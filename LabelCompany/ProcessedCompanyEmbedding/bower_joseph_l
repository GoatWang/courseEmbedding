people wealthier than ever before but capitalisms future is far from assured the global financial meltdown of  nearly triggered another great depression economies in europe are still teetering and powerful forcesincome inequality resource depletion and mass migrations from poor to rich countries to name just a fewpose serious threats to continued prosperity how can the future of capitalism be secured and who should spearhead the effort many observers point to government but in capitalism at risk the authors argue otherwise while they agree that governments must play a role they maintain that businesses should lead the way indeed for enterprising companies the current threats to market capitalism present vital opportunities drawing on discussions with business leaders around the world the authors argue that companies must stop seeing themselves as bystanders and instead develop innovative business strategies that address the disruptors produce profitable growth and strengthen institutions at the community national and international levels   the ceo within why inside outsiders are the key to succession planning with rising ceo turnover companies are increasingly looking outside for qualified candidates sure externally recruited ceos bring fresh perspectives and connections but they lack the indepth knowledge of the company s culture and history that they need to succeed result many deliver disappointing performances companies can avoid this scenario contends joseph bower in the ceo within drawing on a decade s research including interviews with leading ceos and experience managing the succession process bower explains how companies can develop a cohort of internal candidates one of whom may be suited to the increasingly demanding ceo role the key groom insideoutsiders these leaders view their role through the lens of someone who just bought the company unencumbered by the cognitive and emotional baggage that comes from a long tenure in the organization but they also leverage the knowledge they ve accumulated about the company s people suppliers and customers and future direction placed squarely at the intersection of succession planning and leadership development this book describes the distinguishing attributes of the insideoutsider and reveals how to recruit nurture and promote this special type of leader with a healthy supply of qualified internal candidates companies get the leadership they need when they need it the corporate leader how corporate managers contribute value in todays economic climate corporate leaders in

resource allocation process edit joseph l bower managing the resource allocation process a study of corporate planning and investment   the definitive examination of strategic investment from the viewpoint of the people who run the companythe ceo and principal officers includes four case histories that follow specific investment projects from their inception to their approval by top management book abstract the research described in this book is based on a field investigation of resource allocation in a very large firm it was motivated by my conviction stated above that for purposes of management and research adequate models of the allocation process are not available i believe that this lack stems from the fact that prescriptive theories of economic choice have not yet been set in the context of the large organizations political process the research described below is an attempt to take a step in that direction by developing a descriptive conceptual scheme of the resource allocation process because resource allocation is an allencompassing phrase it is not particularly operational as a subject for research p  how can we use our new understanding to help top management change the process by which resources are invested so that strategic objectives are more effectively achieved strangely enough given the argument above in favor of recognizing complexity the next paragraphs develop a very simple conceptual scheme for viewing the firm this is done because the relationships among the essential forces that have been discussed can be most clearly revealed furthermore a more formal discussion facilitates a more precise statement of the research questions it might be useful to begin a statement of the scheme with an informal description of its structure briefly the scheme describes a firms position at any point in time as representing a sum or resultant of past decisions and acts which commit the firms resources the process of changing that position is deemed to consist of two parts  routine and  critical routine change is the continual use of assets and generation of profit which results from the activities of ongoing business no more will be said about this class of change the process of critical change is described in the scheme as consisting of two parts  the business planning process and  the investment process the former involves the problem solving which results in the choice of markets and broad product objectives the latter involves the problem solving which results in the commitment of corporate resources in an attempt to achieve the chosen objectives p  firms rotate managers  across functional and divisional lines to help build cooperative climate and contribute to the development of generalist viewpoints this practice moves managers at the business level where new strategic ideas are developed every two to three years p  as cited in jennifer e bethel  the capital allocation process and managerial mobility p  while evidence reveals the relative unimportance of a particular technique of financial analysis and limited usefulness of the theoretical financial model it also indicates that management can control the investment process p  to make further progress it is necessary to go beyond the financial model p  the leading attempt at a complete normative theory of planning and resource allocation is provided by the concept of strategy p  disruptive technologies catching the wave edit joseph l bower and clayton m christensen disruptive technologies catching the wave harvard business review  one of the most consistent patterns in business is the failure of leading companies to stay at the top of their industries when technologies or markets change goodyear and firestone entered the radialtire market quite late xerox let canon create the smallcopier market bucyruserie allowed caterpillar and deere to take over the mechanical excavator market sears gave way to walmart the pattern of failure has been especially striking in the computer industry ibm dominated the mainframe market but missed by years the emergence of minicomputers which were technologically much simpler than mainframes digital equipment dominated the minicomputer market with innovations like its vax architecture but missed the personalcomputer market almost completely apple computer led the world of personal computing and established the standard for userfriendly computing but lagged five years behind the leaders in bringing its portable computer to market p  lead paragraphs different types of technological innovations affect performance trajectories in different ways on the one hand sustaining technologies tend to maintain a rate of improvement that is they give customers something more or better in the attributes they already value on the other hand disruptive technologies introduce a very different package of attributes from the one mainstream customers historically value and they often perform far worse along one or two dimensions that are particularly important to those customers p  each time a disruptive technology emerged between onehalf and twothirds of the established manufacturers failed to introduce models employing the new architecturein stark contrast to their timely launches of critical sustaining technologies p  one approach to identifying disruptive technologies is to examine internal disagreements over the development of new products or technologies who supports the project and who doesnt marketing and financial managers because of their managerial and financial incentives will rarely support a disruptive technology on the other hand technical personnel with outstanding track records will often persist in arguing that a new market for the technology will emergeeven in the face of opposition from key customers and marketing and financial staff disagreement between the two groups often signals a disruptive technology that toplevel managers should explore p  customer power strategic investment and the failure of leading firms edit clayton christensen and joseph l bower  customer power strategic investment and the failure of leading firms strategic management journal vol  we contest the conclusions of scholars such as tushman and anderson  who have argued that incumbent firms are most threatened by attacking entrants when the innovation in question destroys or does not build upon the competence of the firm we observe that established firms though often at great cost have led their industries in developing critical competencedestroying technologies when the new technology was needed to meet existing customers’ demands p  as cited in cg sandström  a revised perspective on disruptive innovation p  our findings support many of the conclusions of the resource dependence theorists who contend that a firms scope for strategic change is strongly bounded by the interests of external entities customers in this study who provide the resources the firm needs to survive p  quotes about joseph l boweredit bower and christensen  coined the term “disruptive technologies” and christensen  further describes the theory of disruptive innovations matthias knecht  diversification industry dynamism and economic performance p  joseph l bower has been a leader in general management at harvard business school for

function of revenue and cost conditions because measures of revenue are not always available proxies for demand are substituted in some cases leastsquares regression analysis confirms the models usefulness in explaining citytocity variations in commercial construction several problems with the data preclude a fully successful conclusion in any statistical sense however the most serious are the traditional crosssection size problem and a lack of measures over certain important but largely qualitative aspects of the market these problems are discussed and suggestions made on how they

theory a new model of governance promulgated by academic economists in the s is behind the idea that corporate managers should make shareholder value their primary concern and that boards should ensure they do the theory regards shareholders as owners of the corporation—but raises grave accountability problems shareholders have no legal duty to protect or serve the companies whose shares they own they are shielded by the doctrine of limited liability from legal responsibility for those companies’ debts and misdeeds they may buy and sell shares without restriction and are required to disclose their identities only in certain circumstances and they tend to be physically and psychologically distant from the companies’ activities joseph bower and lynn paine examine the agencybased model’s foundations and flaws and its implications for companies before proposing an alternative model that would have at its core the health of the enterprise rather than nearterm returns to its

seru the blog of the stigler center at the university of chicago booth school of business search for “political engagement by corporations derives from and is focused on seeking monopolistic power” posted on march   by promarket writers in this installment of promarket’s new interview series harvard business school professor emeritus joseph bower shares some thoughts on rentseeking politics and the role of corporations and governments in the market “the neoclassical model simply does not comprehend the modern corporation”     on march  the stigler center at the university of chicago booth school of business along with harvard business school and oxford university hosted a conference in chicago to answer the following questions should the economic theory of the firm be modified and if so how   the standard economic theory of the firm is silent on the role firms can play in shaping the rules of the game under which they operate in reality many firms lobby politicians and try to capture regulators in order to modify the rules of the game in their favor some scholars have argued that the resources devoted to these activities are relatively so small that they are likely to have insignificant effects andor that regardless of how much firms invest in political activities in a wellfunctioning democracy there are countervailing forces that effectively level the playing field other scholars have noted that the resources firms devote to shaping the rules of the game to their own advantage are sufficiently large and their effects sufficiently important to warrant a rethinking of the standard economic theory of the firm which of these two views has more empirical support if the latter should the economic theory of the firm be modified if so how and is the potential fix better or worse than the existing problem   the following interview with harvard business school professor emeritus joseph bower is part of an interview series with influential scholars who are addressing these issues in their work you can view all previous installments here   joseph bower joseph bower is the donald k david professor emeritus at harvard business school he is a leading expert on corporate strategy organization and leadership during his storied career which spans five decades bower has focused his teaching and research on the challenges confronting corporate leaders in a rapidly changing hypercompetitive environment   as one of the leaders of a project on the future of market capitalism bower coauthored the book capitalism at risk rethinking the role of business harvard business review press  with his hbs colleagues herman “dutch” leonard and lynn paine he has also consulted with many companies in the us and abroad on issues related to succession strategy and organization   in a brief interview with promarket bower shared some thoughts on rentseeking politics and the role of corporations and governments in the market    q the neoclassical theory of the firm does not consider political engagement by corporations how big of an omission do you think this is   there has been extensive writing about the power and scope of corporations going back at least to edward mason and carl kaysen in a chapter i wrotebower joseph l “the managerial estate” chap  in the us business corporation an institution in transition edited by john r meyer and james m gustafson – cambridge ma ballinger publishing company  i explored the role of large corporations in terms of their impact on factors other than the product market echoing kaysen i emphasized location employment product line choices vendors that because of their scale and scope give firms powers far beyond those conceived in the neoclassical model and unconstrained by traditional notions of price competition the neoclassical model simply does not comprehend the modern corporation   but if we are talking about a theory carefully constructed on a set of axioms the theory really can’t consider political engagements the essence of the neoclassical theory is the constraint on choice imposed by given and widely shared technology and competitive markets for resources and vendors political engagement derives from and is focused on seeking monopolistic power the various theories of monopolistic competition are instructive but fall far short of the standard sought by neoclassical theory   q to what extent is political engagement by corporations responsible for the current populist discontent   only in a limited way both galbraith countervailing power and raymond bauer competition among lobbying powers note that to a significant degree corporate power is less powerful than it would appear more important is the power of banks which since the th century have played a central role in american life trump is closer to jackson but whether he will act to cut back the power of financial institutions is doubtful    q the world economic forum has called for “reimagining” and “reforming” capitalism to what extent is this need for reform the result of disruption brought by technological change globalization and immigration and to what extent is it the effect of rentseeking and regulatory capture   an important question but almost impossible to attack empirically basically both need attention the essential weaknesses of capitalism and neoclassical theory are   labor is thought to be a resource that prefers leisure to work when the price of labor is high enough individuals withhold their effort but in modern society work is the source of standing in society and at higher ends of the market workers appear to prefer work—almost as an addiction they seek more and more wealth try to fit that kind of behavior on a single labor supply curve   with globalization prices have really become a problem since different legal systems imply different pricing of all kinds of public goods these differences are highly significant when it comes to the consequences of trade   q some people describe donald trump’s economic policies as “corporatism” are you more worried by trump’s interference in the market economy or by companies’ ability to subvert markets’ rules   we don’t know what will be trump’s policies i would say that contemporary republican policies are corporatist whatever that means trump’s decisions do not flow from policy—they are impulsive and transactional in intent   disclaimer the promarket blog is dedicated to discussing how competition tends to be subverted by special interests the posts represent the

values which ultimately and unexpectedly overtakes an existing market eg the lowerpriced affordable ford model t which displaced horsedrawn carriages disruptive innovation is a term in the field of business administration which refers to an innovation that creates a new market and value network and eventually disrupts an existing market and value network displacing established market leading firms products and alliances the term was defined and first analyzed by the american scholar clayton m christensen and his collaborators beginning in  and has been called the most influential business idea of the early st century not all innovations are disruptive even if they are revolutionary for example the first automobiles in the late th century were not a disruptive innovation because early automobiles were expensive luxury items that did not disrupt the market for horsedrawn vehicles the market for transportation essentially remained intact until the debut of the lowerpriced ford model t in  the massproduced automobile was a disruptive innovation because it changed the transportation market whereas the first thirty years of automobiles did not disruptive innovations tend to be produced by outsiders and entrepreneurs rather than existing marketleading companies the business environment of market leaders does not allow them to pursue disruptive innovations when they first arise because they are not profitable enough at first and because their development can take scarce resources away from sustaining innovations which are needed to compete against current competition a disruptive process can take longer to develop than by the conventional approach and the risk associated to it is higher than the other more incremental or evolutionary forms of innovations but once it is deployed in the market it achieves a much faster penetration and higher degree of impact on the established markets beyond business and economics disruptive innovations can also be considered to disrupt complex systems only including economic and businessrelated aspects contents  history and usage of the term  theory  disruptive technology  hightechnology effects  practical example of disruption  examples  see also  notes  references  further reading  external links history and usage of the termedit the term disruptive technologies was coined by clayton m christensen and introduced in his  article disruptive technologies catching the wave which he cowrote with joseph bower the article is aimed at management executives who make the funding or purchasing decisions in companies rather than the research community he describes the term further in his book the innovators dilemma innovators dilemma explored the cases of the disk drive industry which with its rapid generational change is to the study of business what fruit flies are to the study of genetics as christensen was advised in the s and the excavating equipment industry where hydraulic actuation slowly displaced cableactuated movement in his sequel with michael e raynor the innovators solution christensen replaced the term disruptive technology with disruptive innovation because he recognized that few technologies are intrinsically disruptive or sustaining in character rather it is the business model that the technology enables that creates the disruptive impact however christensens evolution from a technological focus to a businessmodelling focus is central to understanding the evolution of business at the market or industry level christensen and mark w johnson who cofounded the management consulting firm innosight described the dynamics of business model innovation in the  harvard business review article reinventing your business model the concept of disruptive technology continues a long tradition of identifying radical technical change in the study of innovation by economists and the development of tools for its management at a firm or policy level in the late s the automotive sector began to embrace a perspective of constructive disruptive technology by working with the consultant david e oryan whereby the use of current offtheshelf technology was integrated with newer innovation to create what he called an unfair advantage the process or technology change as a whole had to be constructive in improving the current method of manufacturing yet disruptively impact the whole of the business case model resulting in a significant reduction of waste energy materials labor or legacy costs to the user in keeping with the insight that what matters economically is the business model not the technological sophistication itself christensens theory explains why many disruptive innovations are not advanced technologies which the technology mudslide hypothesis would lead one to expect rather they are often novel combinations of existing offtheshelf components applied cleverly to a small fledgling value network theoryedit the current theoretical understanding of disruptive innovation is different from what might be expected by default an idea that clayton m christensen called the technology mudslide hypothesis this is the simplistic idea that an established firm fails because it doesnt keep up technologically with other firms in this hypothesis firms are like climbers scrambling upward on crumbling footing where it takes constant upwardclimbing effort just to stay still and any break from the effort such as complacency born of profitability causes a rapid downhill slide christensen and colleagues have shown that this simplistic hypothesis is wrong it doesnt model reality what they have shown is that good firms are usually aware of the innovations but their business environment does not allow them to pursue them when they first arise because they are not profitable enough at first and because their development can take scarce resources away from that of sustaining innovations which are needed to compete against current competition in christensens terms a firms existing value networks place insufficient value on the disruptive innovation to allow its pursuit by that firm meanwhile startup firms inhabit different value networks at least until the day that their disruptive innovation is able to invade the older value network at that time the established firm in that network can at best only fend off the market share attack with a metoo entry for which survival not thriving is the only reward christensen defines a disruptive innovation as a product or service designed for a new set of customers generally disruptive innovations were technologically straightforward consisting of offtheshelf components put together in a product architecture that was often simpler than prior approaches they offered less of what customers in established markets wanted and so could rarely be initially employed there they offered a different package of attributes valued only in emerging markets remote from and unimportant to the mainstream christensen argues that disruptive innovations can hurt successful wellmanaged companies that are responsive to their customers and have excellent research and development these companies tend to ignore the markets most susceptible to disruptive innovations because the markets have very tight profit margins and are too small to provide a good growth rate to an established sizable firm thus disruptive technology provides an example of an instance when the common businessworld advice to focus on the customer or stay close to the customer or listen to the customer can be strategically counterproductive while christensen argued that disruptive innovations can hurt successful wellmanaged companies oryan countered that constructive integration of existing new and forwardthinking innovation could improve the economic benefits of these same wellmanaged companies once decisionmaking management understood the systemic benefits as a whole how lowend disruption occurs over time christensen distinguishes between lowend disruption which targets customers who do not need the full performance valued by customers at the high end of the market and newmarket disruption which targets customers who have needs that were previously unserved by existing incumbents lowend disruption occurs when the rate at which products improve exceeds the rate at which customers can adopt the new performance therefore at some point the performance of the product overshoots the needs of certain customer segments at this point a disruptive technology may enter the market and provide a product that has lower performance than the incumbent but that exceeds the requirements of certain segments thereby gaining a foothold in the market in lowend disruption the disruptor is focused initially on serving the least profitable customer who is happy with a good enough product this type of customer is not willing to pay premium for enhancements in product functionality once the disruptor has gained a foothold in this customer segment it seeks to improve its profit margin to get higher profit margins the disruptor needs to enter the segment where the customer is willing to pay a little more for higher quality to ensure this quality in its product the disruptor needs to innovate the incumbent will not do much to retain its share in a notsoprofitable segment and will move upmarket and focus on its more attractive customers after a number of such encounters the incumbent is squeezed into smaller markets than it was previously serving and then finally the disruptive technology meets the demands of the most profitable segment and drives the established company out of the market new market disruption occurs when a product fits a new or emerging market segment that is not being served by existing incumbents in the industry the extrapolation of the theory to all aspects of life has been challenged as has the methodology of relying on selected case studies as the principal form of evidence jill lepore points out that some companies identified by the theory as victims of disruption a decade or more ago rather than being defunct remain dominant in their industries today including seagate technology us steel and bucyrus lepore questions whether the theory has been oversold and misapplied as if it were able to explain everything in every sphere of life including not just business but education and public institutions disruptive technologyedit in  milan zeleny described high technology as disruptive technology and raised the question of what is being disrupted the answer according to zeleny is the support network of high technology for example introducing electric cars disrupts the support network for gasoline cars network of gas and service stations such disruption is fully expected and therefore effectively resisted by support net owners in the long run high disruptive technology bypasses upgrades or replaces the outdated support network technology being a form of social relationshipcitation needed always evolves no technology remains fixed technology starts develops persists mutates stagnates and declines just like living organisms the evolutionary life cycle occurs in the use and development of any technology a new hightechnology core emerges and challenges existing technology support nets tsns which are thus forced to coevolve with it new versions of the core are designed and fitted into an increasingly appropriate tsn with smaller and smaller hightechnology effects high technology becomes regular technology with more efficient versions fitting the same support net finally even the efficiency gains diminish emphasis shifts to product tertiary attributes appearance style and technology becomes tsnpreserving appropriate technology this technological equilibrium state becomes established and fixated resisting being interrupted by a technological mutation then new high technology appears and the cycle is repeated regarding this evolving process of technology christensen said the technological changes that damage established companies are usually not radically new or difficult from a technological point of view they do however have two important characteristics first they typically present a different package of performance attributes—ones that at least at the outset are not valued by existing customers second the performance attributes that existing customers do value improve at such a rapid rate that the new technology can later invade those established markets joseph bower explained the process of how disruptive technology through its requisite support net dramatically transforms a certain industry when the technology that has the potential for revolutionizing an industry emerges established companies typically see it as unattractive it’s not something their mainstream customers want and its projected profit margins aren’t sufficient to cover bigcompany cost structure as a result the new technology tends to get ignored in favor of what’s currently popular with the best customers but then another company steps in to bring the innovation to a new market once the disruptive technology becomes established there smallerscale innovation rapidly raise the technology’s performance on attributes that mainstream customers’ value the automobile was high technology with respect to the horse carriage however it evolved into technology and finally into appropriate technology with a stable unchanging tsn the main hightechnology advance in the offing is some form of electric car—whether the energy source is the sun hydrogen water air pressure or traditional charging outlet electric cars preceded the gasoline automobile by many decades and are now returning to replace the traditional gasoline automobile milan zeleny described the above phenomenon he also wrote that implementing high technology is often resisted this resistance is well understood on the part of active participants in the requisite tsn the electric car will be resisted by gasstation operators in the same way automated teller machines atms were resisted by bank tellers and automobiles by horsewhip makers technology does not qualitatively restructure the tsn and therefore will not be resisted and never has been resisted middle management resists business process reengineering because bpr represents a direct assault on the support net coordinative hierarchy they thrive on teamwork and multifunctionality is resisted by those whose tsn provides the comfort of narrow specialization and commanddriven work hightechnology effectsedit high technology is a technology core that changes the very architecture structure and organization of the components of the technology support net high technology therefore transforms the qualitative nature of the tsns tasks and their relations as well as their requisite physical energy and information flows it also affects the skills required the roles played and the styles of management and coordination—the organizational culture itself this kind of technology core is different from regular technology core which preserves the qualitative nature of flows and the structure of the support and only allows users to perform the same tasks in the same way but faster more reliably in larger quantities or more efficiently it is also different from appropriate technology core which preserves the tsn itself with the purpose of technology implementation and allows users to do the same thing in the same way at comparable levels of efficiency instead of improving the efficiency of performance as for the difference between high technology and low technology milan zeleny once said  the effects of high technology always breaks the direct comparability by changing the system itself therefore requiring new measures and new assessments of its productivity high technology cannot be compared and evaluated with the existing technology purely on the basis of cost net present value or return on investment only within an unchanging and relatively stable tsn would such direct financial comparability be meaningful for example you can directly compare a manual typewriter with an electric typewriter but not a typewriter with a word processor therein lies the management challenge of high technology  however not all modern technologies are high technologies they have to be used as such function as such and be embedded in their requisite tsns they have to empower the individual because only through the individual can they empower knowledge not all information technologies have integrative effects some information systems are still designed to improve the traditional hierarchy of command and thus preserve and entrench the existing tsn the administrative model of management for instance further aggravates the division of task and labor further specializes knowledge separates management from workers and concentrates information and knowledge in centers as knowledge surpasses capital labor and raw materials as the dominant economic resource technologies are also starting to reflect this shift technologies are rapidly shifting from centralized hierarchies to distributed networks nowadays knowledge does not reside in a supermind superbook or superdatabase but in a complex relational pattern of networks brought forth to coordinate human action practical example of disruptionedit in the practical world the popularization of personal computers illustrates how knowledge contributes to the ongoing technology innovation the original centralized concept one computer many persons is a knowledgedefying idea of the prehistory of computing and its inadequacies and failures have become clearly apparent the era of personal computing brought powerful computers on every desk one person one computer this short transitional period was necessary for getting used to the new computing environment but was inadequate from the vantage point of producing knowledge adequate knowledge creation and management come mainly from networking and distributed computing one person many computers each persons computer must form an access point to the entire computing landscape or ecology through the internet of other computers databases and mainframes as well as production distribution and retailing facilities and the like for the first time technology empowers individuals rather than external hierarchies it transfers influence and power where it optimally belongs at the loci of the useful knowledge even though hierarchies and bureaucracies do not innovate free and empowered individuals do knowledge innovation spontaneity and selfreliance are becoming increasingly valued and promoted examplesedit this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable

rail including streetcars was the fastest and most costefficient means of land transportation for goods and passengers in industrialized countries the first cars buses and trucks were used for local transportation in suburban areas where they often replaced streetcars and industrial tracks as highways expanded medium and later longdistance transports were relocated to road traffic and some railways closed down as rail traffic has a lower tonkilometer cost but a higher investment and operating cost than road traffic rail is still preferred for largescale bulk cargo such as minerals however traffic congestion provides a bound on the efficiency of car use and so rail is still used for urban passenger transport high speed rail short distance flights in almost every market where high speed rail with journey times of two hours or less was introduced in competition with an air service the air service was either greatly reduced within a few years or ceased entirely even in markets with longer rail travel times airlines have reduced the amount of flights on offer and passenger numbers have gone down examples include the barcelonamadrid high speed railway the cologne

disruptive innovations tend to be produced by outsiders and entrepreneurs rather than existing marketleading companies the business environment of market leaders does not allow them to pursue disruptive innovations when they first arise because they are not profitable enough at first and because their development can take scarce resources away from sustaining innovations which are needed to compete against current competition a disruptive process can take longer to develop than by the conventional approach and the risk associated to it is higher than the other more incremental or evolutionary forms of innovations but once it is deployed in the market it achieves a much faster penetration and higher degree of impact on the established markets beyond business and economics

hightechnology effects  practical example of disruption  examples  see also  notes  references  further reading  external links history and usage of the termedit the term disruptive technologies was coined by clayton m christensen and introduced in his  article disruptive technologies catching the wave which he cowrote with joseph bower the article is aimed at management executives who make the funding or purchasing decisions in companies rather than the research community he describes the term further in his book the innovators dilemma innovators dilemma explored the cases of the disk drive industry which with its rapid generational change is to the study of business what fruit flies are to the study of genetics as christensen was advised in the s and the excavating equipment industry where hydraulic actuation slowly displaced cableactuated movement in his sequel with michael e raynor the innovators solution christensen replaced the term disruptive technology with disruptive innovation because he recognized that few technologies are intrinsically disruptive or sustaining in character rather it is the business model that the technology enables that creates the disruptive impact however christensens evolution from a technological focus to a businessmodelling focus is central to understanding the evolution of business at the market or industry level christensen and mark w johnson who cofounded the management consulting firm innosight described the dynamics of business model innovation in the  harvard business review article reinventing your business model the concept of disruptive technology continues a long tradition of identifying radical technical change in the study of innovation by economists and the development of tools for its management at a firm or policy level in the late s the automotive sector began to embrace a perspective of constructive disruptive technology by working with the consultant david e oryan whereby the use of current offtheshelf technology was integrated with newer innovation to create what he called an unfair advantage the process or technology change as a whole had to be constructive in improving the current method of manufacturing yet disruptively impact the whole of the business case model resulting in a significant reduction of waste energy materials labor or legacy costs to the user in keeping with the insight that what matters economically is the business model not the technological sophistication itself christensens theory explains why many disruptive innovations are not advanced technologies which the technology mudslide hypothesis would lead one to expect rather they are often novel combinations of existing offtheshelf components applied cleverly to a small fledgling value network theoryedit the current theoretical understanding of disruptive innovation is different from what might be expected by default an idea that clayton m christensen called the technology mudslide hypothesis this is the simplistic idea that an established firm fails because it doesnt keep up technologically with other firms in this hypothesis firms are like climbers scrambling upward on crumbling footing where it takes constant upwardclimbing effort just to stay still and any break from the effort such as complacency born of profitability causes a rapid downhill slide christensen and colleagues have shown that this simplistic hypothesis is wrong it doesnt model reality what they have shown is that good firms are usually aware of the innovations but their business environment does not allow them to pursue them when they first arise because they are not profitable enough at first and because their development can take scarce resources away from that of sustaining innovations which are needed to compete against current competition in christensens terms a firms existing value networks place insufficient value on the disruptive innovation to allow its pursuit by that firm meanwhile startup firms inhabit different value networks at least until the day that their disruptive innovation is able to invade the older value network at that time the established firm in that network can at best only fend off the market share attack with a metoo entry for which survival not thriving is the only reward christensen defines a disruptive innovation as a product or service designed for a new set of customers generally disruptive innovations were technologically straightforward consisting of offtheshelf components put together in a product architecture that was often simpler than prior approaches they offered less of what customers in established markets wanted and so could rarely be initially employed there they offered a different package of attributes valued only in emerging markets remote from and unimportant to the mainstream christensen argues that disruptive innovations can hurt successful wellmanaged companies that are responsive to their customers and have excellent research and development these companies tend to ignore the markets most susceptible to disruptive innovations because the markets have very tight profit margins and are too small to provide a good growth rate to an established sizable firm thus disruptive technology provides an example of an instance when the common businessworld advice to focus on the customer or stay close to the customer or listen to the customer can be strategically counterproductive while christensen argued that disruptive innovations can hurt successful wellmanaged companies oryan countered that constructive integration of existing new and forwardthinking innovation could improve the economic benefits of these same wellmanaged companies once decisionmaking management understood the systemic benefits as a whole how lowend disruption occurs over time christensen distinguishes between lowend disruption which targets customers who do not need the full performance valued by customers at the high end of the market and newmarket disruption which targets customers who have needs that were previously unserved by existing incumbents lowend disruption occurs when the rate at which products improve exceeds the rate at which customers can adopt the new performance therefore at some point the performance of the product overshoots the needs of certain customer segments at this point a disruptive technology may enter the market and provide a product that has lower performance than the incumbent but that exceeds the requirements of certain segments thereby gaining a foothold in the market in lowend disruption the disruptor is focused initially on serving the least profitable customer who is happy with a good enough product this type of customer is not willing to pay premium for enhancements in product functionality once the disruptor has gained a foothold in this customer segment it seeks to improve its profit margin to get higher profit margins the disruptor needs to enter the segment where the customer is willing to pay a little more for higher quality to ensure this quality in its product the disruptor needs to innovate the incumbent will not do much to retain its share in a notsoprofitable segment and will move upmarket and focus on its more attractive customers after a number of such encounters the incumbent is squeezed into smaller markets than it was previously serving and then finally the disruptive technology meets the demands of the most profitable segment and drives the established company out of the market new market disruption occurs when a product fits a new or emerging market segment that is not being served by existing incumbents in the industry the extrapolation of the theory to all aspects of life has been challenged as has the methodology of relying on selected case studies as the principal form of evidence jill lepore points out that some companies identified by the theory as victims of disruption a decade or more ago rather than being defunct remain dominant in their industries today including seagate technology us steel and bucyrus lepore questions whether the theory has been oversold and misapplied as if it were able to explain everything in every sphere of life including not just business but education and public institutions disruptive technologyedit in  milan zeleny described high technology as disruptive technology and raised the question of what is being disrupted the answer according to zeleny is the support network of high technology for example introducing electric cars disrupts the support network for gasoline cars network of gas and service stations such disruption is fully expected and therefore effectively resisted by support net owners in the long run high disruptive technology bypasses upgrades or replaces the outdated support network technology being a form of social relationshipcitation needed always evolves no technology remains fixed technology starts develops persists mutates stagnates and declines just like living organisms the evolutionary life cycle occurs in the use and development of any technology a new hightechnology core emerges and challenges existing technology support nets tsns which are thus forced to coevolve with it new versions of the core are designed and fitted into an increasingly appropriate tsn with smaller and smaller hightechnology effects high technology becomes regular technology with more efficient versions fitting the same support net finally even the efficiency gains diminish emphasis shifts to product tertiary attributes appearance style and technology becomes tsnpreserving appropriate technology this technological equilibrium state becomes established and fixated resisting being interrupted by a technological mutation then new high technology appears and the cycle is repeated regarding this evolving process of technology christensen said the technological changes that damage established companies are usually not radically new or difficult from a technological point of view they do however have two important characteristics first they typically present a different package of performance attributes—ones that at least at the outset are not valued by existing customers second the performance attributes that existing customers do value improve at such a rapid rate that the new technology can later invade those established markets joseph bower explained the process of how disruptive technology through its requisite support net dramatically transforms a certain industry when the technology that has the potential for revolutionizing an industry emerges established companies typically see it as unattractive it’s not something their mainstream customers want and its projected profit margins aren’t sufficient to cover bigcompany cost structure as a result the new technology tends to get ignored in favor of what’s currently popular with the best customers but then another company steps in to bring the innovation to a new market once the disruptive technology becomes established there smallerscale innovation rapidly raise the technology’s performance on attributes that mainstream customers’ value the automobile was high technology with respect to the horse carriage however it evolved into technology and finally into appropriate technology with a stable unchanging tsn the main hightechnology advance in the offing is some form of electric car—whether the energy source is the sun hydrogen water air pressure or traditional charging outlet electric cars preceded the gasoline automobile by many decades and are now returning to replace the traditional gasoline automobile milan zeleny described the above phenomenon he also wrote that implementing high technology is often resisted this resistance is well understood on the part of active participants in the requisite tsn the electric car will be resisted by gasstation operators in the same way automated teller machines atms were resisted by bank tellers and automobiles by horsewhip makers technology does not qualitatively restructure the tsn and therefore will not be resisted and never has been resisted middle management resists business process reengineering because bpr represents a direct assault on the support net coordinative hierarchy they thrive on teamwork and multifunctionality is resisted by those whose tsn provides the comfort of narrow specialization and commanddriven work hightechnology effectsedit high technology is a technology core that changes the very architecture structure and organization of the components of the technology support net high technology therefore transforms the qualitative nature of the tsns tasks and their relations as well as their requisite physical energy and information flows it also affects the skills required the roles played and the styles of management and coordination—the organizational culture itself this kind of technology core is different from regular technology core which preserves the qualitative nature of flows and the structure of the support and only allows users to perform the same tasks in the same way but faster more reliably in larger quantities or more efficiently it is also different from appropriate technology core which preserves the tsn itself with the purpose of technology implementation and allows users to do the same thing in the same way at comparable levels of efficiency instead of improving the efficiency of performance as for the difference between high technology and low technology milan zeleny once said  the effects of high technology always breaks the direct comparability by changing the system itself therefore requiring new measures and new assessments of its productivity high technology cannot be compared and evaluated with the existing technology purely on the basis of cost net present value or return on investment only within an unchanging and relatively stable tsn would such direct financial comparability be meaningful for example you can directly compare a manual typewriter with an electric typewriter but not a typewriter with a word processor therein lies the management challenge of high technology  however not all modern technologies are high technologies they have to be used as such function as such and be embedded in their requisite tsns they have to empower the individual because only through the individual can they empower knowledge not all information technologies have integrative effects some information systems are still designed to improve the traditional hierarchy of command and thus preserve and entrench the existing tsn the administrative model of management for instance further aggravates the division of task and labor further specializes knowledge separates management from workers and concentrates information and knowledge in centers as knowledge surpasses capital labor and raw materials as the dominant economic resource technologies are also starting to reflect this shift technologies are rapidly shifting from centralized hierarchies to distributed networks nowadays knowledge does not reside in a supermind superbook or superdatabase but in a complex relational pattern of networks brought forth to coordinate human action practical example of disruptionedit in the practical world the popularization of personal computers illustrates how knowledge contributes to the ongoing technology innovation the original centralized concept one computer many persons is a knowledgedefying idea of the prehistory of computing and its inadequacies and failures have become clearly apparent the era of personal computing brought powerful computers on every desk one person one computer this short transitional period was necessary for getting used to the new computing environment but was inadequate from the vantage point of producing knowledge adequate knowledge creation and management come mainly from networking and distributed computing one person many computers each persons computer must form an access point to the entire computing landscape or ecology through the internet of other computers databases and mainframes as well as production distribution and retailing facilities and the like for the first time technology empowers individuals rather than external hierarchies it transfers influence and power where it optimally belongs at the loci of the useful knowledge even though hierarchies and bureaucracies do not innovate free and empowered individuals do knowledge innovation spontaneity and selfreliance are becoming increasingly valued and promoted examplesedit this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable

rail including streetcars was the fastest and most costefficient means of land transportation for goods and passengers in industrialized countries the first cars buses and trucks were used for local transportation in suburban areas where they often replaced streetcars and industrial tracks as highways expanded medium and later longdistance transports were relocated to road traffic and some railways closed down as rail traffic has a lower tonkilometer cost but a higher investment and operating cost than road traffic rail is still preferred for largescale bulk cargo such as minerals however traffic congestion provides a bound on the efficiency of car use and so rail is still used for urban passenger transport high speed rail short distance flights in almost every market where high speed rail with journey times of two hours or less was introduced in competition with an air service the air service was either greatly reduced within a few years or ceased entirely even in markets with longer rail travel times airlines have reduced the amount of flights on offer and passenger numbers have gone down examples include the barcelonamadrid high speed railway the cologne

market in ways that customers are expecting eg fuel injection for gasoline engines which displaced carburetors revolutionary discontinuous radical an innovation that is unexpected but nevertheless does not affect existing markets eg the first automobiles in the late th century which were expensive luxury items and as such very few were sold disruptive an innovation that creates a new market by providing a different set of values which ultimately and unexpectedly overtakes an existing market eg the lowerpriced affordable ford model t which displaced horsedrawn carriages disruptive innovation is a term in the field of business administration which refers to an innovation that creates a new market and value network and eventually disrupts an existing market and value network displacing established market leading firms products and alliances the term was defined and first analyzed by the american scholar clayton m christensen and his collaborators beginning in  and has been called the most influential business idea of the early st century not all innovations are disruptive even if they are revolutionary for example the first automobiles in the late th century were not a disruptive innovation because early automobiles were expensive luxury items that did not disrupt the market for horsedrawn vehicles the market for transportation essentially remained intact until the debut of the lowerpriced ford model t in  the massproduced automobile was a disruptive innovation because it changed the transportation market whereas the first thirty years of automobiles did not

coined by clayton m christensen and introduced in his  article disruptive technologies catching the wave which he cowrote with joseph bower the article is aimed at management executives who make the funding or purchasing decisions in companies rather than the research community he describes the term further in his book the innovators dilemma innovators dilemma explored the cases of the disk drive industry which with its rapid generational change is to the study of business what fruit flies are to the study of genetics as christensen was advised in the s and the excavating equipment industry where hydraulic actuation slowly displaced cableactuated movement in his sequel with michael e raynor the innovators solution christensen replaced the term disruptive technology with disruptive innovation because he recognized that few technologies are intrinsically disruptive or sustaining in character rather it is the business model that the technology enables that creates the disruptive impact however christensens evolution from a technological focus to a businessmodelling focus is central to understanding the evolution of business at the market or industry level christensen and mark w johnson who cofounded the management consulting firm innosight described the dynamics of business model innovation in the  harvard business review article reinventing your business model the concept of disruptive technology continues a long tradition of identifying radical technical change in the study of innovation by economists and the development of tools for its management at a firm or policy level in the late s the automotive sector began to embrace a perspective of constructive disruptive technology by working with the consultant david e oryan whereby the use of current offtheshelf technology was integrated with newer innovation to create what he called an unfair advantage the process or technology change as a whole had to be constructive in improving the current method of manufacturing yet disruptively impact the whole of the business case model resulting in a significant reduction of waste energy materials labor or legacy costs to the user in keeping with the insight that what matters economically is the business model not the technological sophistication itself christensens theory explains why many disruptive innovations are not advanced technologies which the technology mudslide hypothesis would lead one to expect rather they are often novel combinations of existing offtheshelf components applied cleverly to a small fledgling value network theoryedit the current theoretical understanding of disruptive innovation is different from what might be expected by default an idea that clayton m christensen called the technology mudslide hypothesis this is the simplistic idea that an established firm fails because it doesnt keep up technologically with other firms in this hypothesis firms are like climbers scrambling upward on crumbling footing where it takes constant upwardclimbing effort just to stay still and any break from the effort such as complacency born of profitability causes a rapid downhill slide christensen and colleagues have shown that this simplistic hypothesis is wrong it doesnt model reality what they have shown is that good firms are usually aware of the innovations but their business environment does not allow them to pursue them when they first arise because they are not profitable enough at first and because their development can take scarce resources away from that of sustaining innovations which are needed to compete against current competition in christensens terms a firms existing value networks place insufficient value on the disruptive innovation to allow its pursuit by that firm meanwhile startup firms inhabit different value networks at least until the day that their disruptive innovation is able to invade the older value network at that time the established firm in that network can at best only fend off the market share attack with a metoo entry for which survival not thriving is the only reward christensen defines a disruptive innovation as a product or service designed for a new set of customers generally disruptive innovations were technologically straightforward consisting of offtheshelf components put together in a product architecture that was often simpler than prior approaches they offered less of what customers in established markets wanted and so could rarely be initially employed there they offered a different package of attributes valued only in emerging markets remote from and unimportant to the mainstream christensen argues that disruptive innovations can hurt successful wellmanaged companies that are responsive to their customers and have excellent research and development these companies tend to ignore the markets most susceptible to disruptive innovations because the markets have very tight profit margins and are too small to provide a good growth rate to an established sizable firm thus disruptive technology provides an example of an instance when the common businessworld advice to focus on the customer or stay close to the customer or listen to the customer can be strategically counterproductive while christensen argued that disruptive innovations can hurt successful wellmanaged companies oryan countered that constructive integration of existing new and forwardthinking innovation could improve the economic benefits of these same wellmanaged companies once decisionmaking management understood the systemic benefits as a whole how lowend disruption occurs over time christensen distinguishes between lowend disruption which targets customers who do not need the full performance valued by customers at the high end of the market and newmarket disruption which targets customers who have needs that were previously unserved by existing incumbents lowend disruption occurs when the rate at which products improve exceeds the rate at which customers can adopt the new performance therefore at some point the performance of the product overshoots the needs of certain customer segments at this point a disruptive technology may enter the market and provide a product that has lower performance than the incumbent but that exceeds the requirements of certain segments thereby gaining a foothold in the market in lowend disruption the disruptor is focused initially on serving the least profitable customer who is happy with a good enough product this type of customer is not willing to pay premium for enhancements in product functionality once the disruptor has gained a foothold in this customer segment it seeks to improve its profit margin to get higher profit margins the disruptor needs to enter the segment where the customer is willing to pay a little more for higher quality to ensure this quality in its product the disruptor needs to innovate the incumbent will not do much to retain its share in a notsoprofitable segment and will move upmarket and focus on its more attractive customers after a number of such encounters the incumbent is squeezed into smaller markets than it was previously serving and then finally the disruptive technology meets the demands of the most profitable segment and drives the established company out of the market new market disruption occurs when a product fits a new or emerging market segment that is not being served by existing incumbents in the industry the extrapolation of the theory to all aspects of life has been challenged as has the methodology of relying on selected case studies as the principal form of evidence jill lepore points out that some companies identified by the theory as victims of disruption a decade or more ago rather than being defunct remain dominant in their industries today including seagate technology us steel and bucyrus lepore questions whether the theory has been oversold and misapplied as if it were able to explain everything in every sphere of life including not just business but education and public institutions disruptive technologyedit in  milan zeleny described high technology as disruptive technology and raised the question of what is being disrupted the answer according to zeleny is the support network of high technology for example introducing electric cars disrupts the support network for gasoline cars network of gas and service stations such disruption is fully expected and therefore effectively resisted by support net owners in the long run high disruptive technology bypasses upgrades or replaces the outdated support network technology being a form of social relationshipcitation needed always evolves no technology remains fixed technology starts develops persists mutates stagnates and declines just like living organisms the evolutionary life cycle occurs in the use and development of any technology a new hightechnology core emerges and challenges existing technology support nets tsns which are thus forced to coevolve with it new versions of the core are designed and fitted into an increasingly appropriate tsn with smaller and smaller hightechnology effects high technology becomes regular technology with more efficient versions fitting the same support net finally even the efficiency gains diminish emphasis shifts to product tertiary attributes appearance style and technology becomes tsnpreserving appropriate technology this technological equilibrium state becomes established and fixated resisting being interrupted by a technological mutation then new high technology appears and the cycle is repeated regarding this evolving process of technology christensen said the technological changes that damage established companies are usually not radically new or difficult from a technological point of view they do however have two important characteristics first they typically present a different package of performance attributes—ones that at least at the outset are not valued by existing customers second the performance attributes that existing customers do value improve at such a rapid rate that the new technology can later invade those established markets joseph bower explained the process of how disruptive technology through its requisite support net dramatically transforms a certain industry when the technology that has the potential for revolutionizing an industry emerges established companies typically see it as unattractive it’s not something their mainstream customers want and its projected profit margins aren’t sufficient to cover bigcompany cost structure as a result the new technology tends to get ignored in favor of what’s currently popular with the best customers but then another company steps in to bring the innovation to a new market once the disruptive technology becomes established there smallerscale innovation rapidly raise the technology’s performance on attributes that mainstream customers’ value the automobile was high technology with respect to the horse carriage however it evolved into technology and finally into appropriate technology with a stable unchanging tsn the main hightechnology advance in the offing is some form of electric car—whether the energy source is the sun hydrogen water air pressure or traditional charging outlet electric cars preceded the gasoline automobile by many decades and are now returning to replace the traditional gasoline automobile milan zeleny described the above phenomenon he also wrote that implementing high technology is often resisted this resistance is well understood on the part of active participants in the requisite tsn the electric car will be resisted by gasstation operators in the same way automated teller machines atms were resisted by bank tellers and automobiles by horsewhip makers technology does not qualitatively restructure the tsn and therefore will not be resisted and never has been resisted middle management resists business process reengineering because bpr represents a direct assault on the support net coordinative hierarchy they thrive on teamwork and multifunctionality is resisted by those whose tsn provides the comfort of narrow specialization and commanddriven work hightechnology effectsedit high technology is a technology core that changes the very architecture structure and organization of the components of the technology support net high technology therefore transforms the qualitative nature of the tsns tasks and their relations as well as their requisite physical energy and information flows it also affects the skills required the roles played and the styles of management and coordination—the organizational culture itself this kind of technology core is different from regular technology core which preserves the qualitative nature of flows and the structure of the support and only allows users to perform the same tasks in the same way but faster more reliably in larger quantities or more efficiently it is also different from appropriate technology core which preserves the tsn itself with the purpose of technology implementation and allows users to do the same thing in the same way at comparable levels of efficiency instead of improving the efficiency of performance as for the difference between high technology and low technology milan zeleny once said  the effects of high technology always breaks the direct comparability by changing the system itself therefore requiring new measures and new assessments of its productivity high technology cannot be compared and evaluated with the existing technology purely on the basis of cost net present value or return on investment only within an unchanging and relatively stable tsn would such direct financial comparability be meaningful for example you can directly compare a manual typewriter with an electric typewriter but not a typewriter with a word processor therein lies the management challenge of high technology  however not all modern technologies are high technologies they have to be used as such function as such and be embedded in their requisite tsns they have to empower the individual because only through the individual can they empower knowledge not all information technologies have integrative effects some information systems are still designed to improve the traditional hierarchy of command and thus preserve and entrench the existing tsn the administrative model of management for instance further aggravates the division of task and labor further specializes knowledge separates management from workers and concentrates information and knowledge in centers as knowledge surpasses capital labor and raw materials as the dominant economic resource technologies are also starting to reflect this shift technologies are rapidly shifting from centralized hierarchies to distributed networks nowadays knowledge does not reside in a supermind superbook or superdatabase but in a complex relational pattern of networks brought forth to coordinate human action practical example of disruptionedit in the practical world the popularization of personal computers illustrates how knowledge contributes to the ongoing technology innovation the original centralized concept one computer many persons is a knowledgedefying idea of the prehistory of computing and its inadequacies and failures have become clearly apparent the era of personal computing brought powerful computers on every desk one person one computer this short transitional period was necessary for getting used to the new computing environment but was inadequate from the vantage point of producing knowledge adequate knowledge creation and management come mainly from networking and distributed computing one person many computers each persons computer must form an access point to the entire computing landscape or ecology through the internet of other computers databases and mainframes as well as production distribution and retailing facilities and the like for the first time technology empowers individuals rather than external hierarchies it transfers influence and power where it optimally belongs at the loci of the useful knowledge even though hierarchies and bureaucracies do not innovate free and empowered individuals do knowledge innovation spontaneity and selfreliance are becoming increasingly valued and promoted examplesedit this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable

drives used in desktop computers however  inch drives were not affordable for the new desktop machines the simple  inch drive assembled from technologically inferior offtheshelf components was an

rail including streetcars was the fastest and most costefficient means of land transportation for goods and passengers in industrialized countries the first cars buses and trucks were used for local transportation in suburban areas where they often replaced streetcars and industrial tracks as highways expanded medium and later longdistance transports were relocated to road traffic and some railways closed down as rail traffic has a lower tonkilometer cost but a higher investment and operating cost than road traffic rail is still preferred for largescale bulk cargo such as minerals however traffic congestion provides a bound on the efficiency of car use and so rail is still used for urban passenger transport high speed rail short distance flights in almost every market where high speed rail with journey times of two hours or less was introduced in competition with an air service the air service was either greatly reduced within a few years or ceased entirely even in markets with longer rail travel times airlines have reduced the amount of flights on offer and passenger numbers have gone down examples include the barcelonamadrid high speed railway the cologne

market in ways that customers are expecting eg fuel injection for gasoline engines which displaced carburetors revolutionary discontinuous radical an innovation that is unexpected but nevertheless does not affect existing markets eg the first automobiles in the late th century which were expensive luxury items and as such very few were sold disruptive an innovation that creates a new market by providing a different set of values which ultimately and unexpectedly overtakes an existing market eg the lowerpriced affordable ford model t which displaced horsedrawn carriages disruptive innovation is a term in the field of business administration which refers to an innovation that creates a new market and value network and eventually disrupts an existing market and value network displacing established market leading firms products and alliances the term was defined and first analyzed by the american scholar clayton m christensen and his collaborators beginning in  and has been called the most influential business idea of the early st century not all innovations are disruptive even if they are revolutionary for example the first automobiles in the late th century were not a disruptive innovation because early automobiles were expensive luxury items that did not disrupt the market for horsedrawn vehicles the market for transportation essentially remained intact until the debut of the lowerpriced ford model t in  the massproduced automobile was a disruptive innovation because it changed the transportation market whereas the first thirty years of automobiles did not disruptive innovations tend to be produced by outsiders and entrepreneurs rather than existing marketleading companies the business environment of market leaders does not allow them to pursue disruptive innovations when they first arise because they are not profitable enough at first and because their development can take scarce resources away from sustaining innovations which are needed to compete against current competition a disruptive process can take longer to develop than by the conventional approach and the risk associated to it is higher than the other more incremental or evolutionary forms of innovations but once it is deployed in the market it achieves a much faster penetration and higher degree of impact on the established markets beyond business and economics

w johnson who cofounded the management consulting firm innosight described the dynamics of business model innovation in the  harvard business review article reinventing your business model the concept of disruptive technology continues a long tradition of identifying radical technical change in the study of innovation by economists and the development of tools for its management at a firm or policy level in the late s the automotive sector began to embrace a perspective of constructive disruptive technology by working with the consultant david e oryan whereby the use of current offtheshelf technology was integrated with newer innovation to create what he called an unfair advantage the process or technology change as a whole had to be constructive in improving the current method of manufacturing yet disruptively impact the whole of the business case model resulting in a significant reduction of waste energy materials labor or legacy costs to the user in keeping with the insight that what matters economically is the business model not the technological sophistication itself christensens theory explains why many disruptive innovations are not advanced technologies which the technology mudslide hypothesis would lead one to expect rather they are often novel combinations of existing offtheshelf components applied cleverly to a small fledgling value network theoryedit the current theoretical understanding of disruptive innovation is different from what might be expected by default an idea that clayton m christensen called the technology mudslide hypothesis this is the simplistic idea that an established firm fails because it doesnt keep up technologically with other firms in this hypothesis firms are like climbers scrambling upward on crumbling footing where it takes constant upwardclimbing effort just to stay still and any break from the effort such as complacency born of profitability causes a rapid downhill slide christensen and colleagues have shown that this simplistic hypothesis is wrong it doesnt model reality what they have shown is that good firms are usually aware of the innovations but their business environment does not allow them to pursue them when they first arise because they are not profitable enough at first and because their development can take scarce resources away from that of sustaining innovations which are needed to compete against current competition in christensens terms a firms existing value networks place insufficient value on the disruptive innovation to allow its pursuit by that firm meanwhile startup firms inhabit different value networks at least until the day that their disruptive innovation is able to invade the older value network at that time the established firm in that network can at best only fend off the market share attack with a metoo entry for which survival not thriving is the only reward christensen defines a disruptive innovation as a product or service designed for a new set of customers generally disruptive innovations were technologically straightforward consisting of offtheshelf components put together in a product architecture that was often simpler than prior approaches they offered less of what customers in established markets wanted and so could rarely be initially employed there they offered a different package of attributes valued only in emerging markets remote from and unimportant to the mainstream christensen argues that disruptive innovations can hurt successful wellmanaged companies that are responsive to their customers and have excellent research and development these companies tend to ignore the markets most susceptible to disruptive innovations because the markets have very tight profit margins and are too small to provide a good growth rate to an established sizable firm thus disruptive technology provides an example of an instance when the common businessworld advice to focus on the customer or stay close to the customer or listen to the customer can be strategically counterproductive while christensen argued that disruptive innovations can hurt successful wellmanaged companies oryan countered that constructive integration of existing new and forwardthinking innovation could improve the economic benefits of these same wellmanaged companies once decisionmaking management understood the systemic benefits as a whole how lowend disruption occurs over time christensen distinguishes between lowend disruption which targets customers who do not need the full performance valued by customers at the high end of the market and newmarket disruption which targets customers who have needs that were previously unserved by existing incumbents lowend disruption occurs when the rate at which products improve exceeds the rate at which customers can adopt the new performance therefore at some point the performance of the product overshoots the needs of certain customer segments at this point a disruptive technology may enter the market and provide a product that has lower performance than the incumbent but that exceeds the requirements of certain segments thereby gaining a foothold in the market in lowend disruption the disruptor is focused initially on serving the least profitable customer who is happy with a good enough product this type of customer is not willing to pay premium for enhancements in product functionality once the disruptor has gained a foothold in this customer segment it seeks to improve its profit margin to get higher profit margins the disruptor needs to enter the segment where the customer is willing to pay a little more for higher quality to ensure this quality in its product the disruptor needs to innovate the incumbent will not do much to retain its share in a notsoprofitable segment and will move upmarket and focus on its more attractive customers after a number of such encounters the incumbent is squeezed into smaller markets than it was previously serving and then finally the disruptive technology meets the demands of the most profitable segment and drives the established company out of the market new market disruption occurs when a product fits a new or emerging market segment that is not being served by existing incumbents in the industry the extrapolation of the theory to all aspects of life has been challenged as has the methodology of relying on selected case studies as the principal form of evidence jill lepore points out that some companies identified by the theory as victims of disruption a decade or more ago rather than being defunct remain dominant in their industries today including seagate technology us steel and bucyrus lepore questions whether the theory has been oversold and misapplied as if it were able to explain everything in every sphere of life including not just business but education and public institutions disruptive technologyedit in  milan zeleny described high technology as disruptive technology and raised the question of what is being disrupted the answer according to zeleny is the support network of high technology for example introducing electric cars disrupts the support network for gasoline cars network of gas and service stations such disruption is fully expected and therefore effectively resisted by support net owners in the long run high disruptive technology bypasses upgrades or replaces the outdated support network technology being a form of social relationshipcitation needed always evolves no technology remains fixed technology starts develops persists mutates stagnates and declines just like living organisms the evolutionary life cycle occurs in the use and development of any technology a new hightechnology core emerges and challenges existing technology support nets tsns which are thus forced to coevolve with it new versions of the core are designed and fitted into an increasingly appropriate tsn with smaller and smaller hightechnology effects high technology becomes regular technology with more efficient versions fitting the same support net finally even the efficiency gains diminish emphasis shifts to product tertiary attributes appearance style and technology becomes tsnpreserving appropriate technology this technological equilibrium state becomes established and fixated resisting being interrupted by a technological mutation then new high technology appears and the cycle is repeated regarding this evolving process of technology christensen said the technological changes that damage established companies are usually not radically new or difficult from a technological point of view they do however have two important characteristics first they typically present a different package of performance attributes—ones that at least at the outset are not valued by existing customers second the performance attributes that existing customers do value improve at such a rapid rate that the new technology can later invade those established markets joseph bower explained the process of how disruptive technology through its requisite support net dramatically transforms a certain industry when the technology that has the potential for revolutionizing an industry emerges established companies typically see it as unattractive it’s not something their mainstream customers want and its projected profit margins aren’t sufficient to cover bigcompany cost structure as a result the new technology tends to get ignored in favor of what’s currently popular with the best customers but then another company steps in to bring the innovation to a new market once the disruptive technology becomes established there smallerscale innovation rapidly raise the technology’s performance on attributes that mainstream customers’ value the automobile was high technology with respect to the horse carriage however it evolved into technology and finally into appropriate technology with a stable unchanging tsn the main hightechnology advance in the offing is some form of electric car—whether the energy source is the sun hydrogen water air pressure or traditional charging outlet electric cars preceded the gasoline automobile by many decades and are now returning to replace the traditional gasoline automobile milan zeleny described the above phenomenon he also wrote that implementing high technology is often resisted this resistance is well understood on the part of active participants in the requisite tsn the electric car will be resisted by gasstation operators in the same way automated teller machines atms were resisted by bank tellers and automobiles by horsewhip makers technology does not qualitatively restructure the tsn and therefore will not be resisted and never has been resisted middle management resists business process reengineering because bpr represents a direct assault on the support net coordinative hierarchy they thrive on teamwork and multifunctionality is resisted by those whose tsn provides the comfort of narrow specialization and commanddriven work hightechnology effectsedit high technology is a technology core that changes the very architecture structure and organization of the components of the technology support net high technology therefore transforms the qualitative nature of the tsns tasks and their relations as well as their requisite physical energy and information flows it also affects the skills required the roles played and the styles of management and coordination—the organizational culture itself this kind of technology core is different from regular technology core which preserves the qualitative nature of flows and the structure of the support and only allows users to perform the same tasks in the same way but faster more reliably in larger quantities or more efficiently it is also different from appropriate technology core which preserves the tsn itself with the purpose of technology implementation and allows users to do the same thing in the same way at comparable levels of efficiency instead of improving the efficiency of performance as for the difference between high technology and low technology milan zeleny once said  the effects of high technology always breaks the direct comparability by changing the system itself therefore requiring new measures and new assessments of its productivity high technology cannot be compared and evaluated with the existing technology purely on the basis of cost net present value or return on investment only within an unchanging and relatively stable tsn would such direct financial comparability be meaningful for example you can directly compare a manual typewriter with an electric typewriter but not a typewriter with a word processor therein lies the management challenge of high technology  however not all modern technologies are high technologies they have to be used as such function as such and be embedded in their requisite tsns they have to empower the individual because only through the individual can they empower knowledge not all information technologies have integrative effects some information systems are still designed to improve the traditional hierarchy of command and thus preserve and entrench the existing tsn the administrative model of management for instance further aggravates the division of task and labor further specializes knowledge separates management from workers and concentrates information and knowledge in centers as knowledge surpasses capital labor and raw materials as the dominant economic resource technologies are also starting to reflect this shift technologies are rapidly shifting from centralized hierarchies to distributed networks nowadays knowledge does not reside in a supermind superbook or superdatabase but in a complex relational pattern of networks brought forth to coordinate human action practical example of disruptionedit in the practical world the popularization of personal computers illustrates how knowledge contributes to the ongoing technology innovation the original centralized concept one computer many persons is a knowledgedefying idea of the prehistory of computing and its inadequacies and failures have become clearly apparent the era of personal computing brought powerful computers on every desk one person one computer this short transitional period was necessary for getting used to the new computing environment but was inadequate from the vantage point of producing knowledge adequate knowledge creation and management come mainly from networking and distributed computing one person many computers each persons computer must form an access point to the entire computing landscape or ecology through the internet of other computers databases and mainframes as well as production distribution and retailing facilities and the like for the first time technology empowers individuals rather than external hierarchies it transfers influence and power where it optimally belongs at the loci of the useful knowledge even though hierarchies and bureaucracies do not innovate free and empowered individuals do knowledge innovation spontaneity and selfreliance are becoming increasingly valued and promoted examplesedit this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable

rail including streetcars was the fastest and most costefficient means of land transportation for goods and passengers in industrialized countries the first cars buses and trucks were used for local transportation in suburban areas where they often replaced streetcars and industrial tracks as highways expanded medium and later longdistance transports were relocated to road traffic and some railways closed down as rail traffic has a lower tonkilometer cost but a higher investment and operating cost than road traffic rail is still preferred for largescale bulk cargo such as minerals however traffic congestion provides a bound on the efficiency of car use and so rail is still used for urban passenger transport high speed rail short distance flights in almost every market where high speed rail with journey times of two hours or less was introduced in competition with an air service the air service was either greatly reduced within a few years or ceased entirely even in markets with longer rail travel times airlines have reduced the amount of flights on offer and passenger numbers have gone down examples include the barcelonamadrid high speed railway the cologne

template message types of innovation sustaining an innovation that does not significantly affect existing markets it may be either evolutionary an innovation that improves a product in an existing market in ways that customers are expecting eg fuel injection for gasoline engines which displaced carburetors revolutionary discontinuous radical an innovation that is unexpected but nevertheless does not affect existing markets eg the first automobiles in the late th century which were expensive luxury items and as such very few were sold disruptive an innovation that creates a new market by providing a different set of values which ultimately and unexpectedly overtakes an existing market eg the lowerpriced affordable ford model t which displaced horsedrawn carriages disruptive innovation is a term in the field of business administration which refers to an innovation that creates a new market and value network and eventually disrupts an existing market and value network displacing established market leading firms products and alliances the term was defined and first analyzed by the american scholar clayton m christensen and his collaborators beginning in  and has been called the most influential business idea of the early st century not all innovations are disruptive even if they are revolutionary for example the first automobiles in the late th century were not a disruptive innovation because early automobiles were expensive luxury items that did not disrupt the market for horsedrawn vehicles the market for transportation essentially remained intact until the debut of the lowerpriced ford model t in  the massproduced automobile was a disruptive innovation because it changed the transportation market whereas the first thirty years of automobiles did not disruptive innovations tend to be produced by outsiders and entrepreneurs rather than existing marketleading companies the business environment of market leaders does not allow them to pursue disruptive innovations when they first arise because they are not profitable enough at first and because their development can take scarce resources away from sustaining innovations which are needed to compete against current competition a disruptive process can take longer to develop than by the conventional approach and the risk associated to it is higher than the other more incremental or evolutionary forms of innovations but once it is deployed in the market it achieves a much faster penetration and higher degree of impact on the established markets beyond business and economics disruptive innovations can also be considered to disrupt complex systems only including economic and businessrelated aspects contents  history and usage of the term  theory  disruptive technology  hightechnology effects  practical example of disruption  examples  see also  notes  references  further reading  external links history and usage of the termedit the term disruptive technologies was coined by clayton m christensen and introduced in his  article disruptive technologies catching the wave which he cowrote with joseph bower the article is aimed at management executives who make the funding or purchasing decisions in companies rather than the research community he describes the term further in his book the innovators dilemma innovators dilemma explored the cases of the disk drive industry which with its rapid generational change is to the study of business what fruit flies are to the study of genetics as christensen was advised in the s and the excavating equipment industry where hydraulic actuation slowly displaced cableactuated movement in his sequel with michael e raynor the innovators solution christensen replaced the term disruptive technology with disruptive innovation because he recognized that few technologies are intrinsically disruptive or sustaining in character rather it is the business model that the technology enables that creates the disruptive impact however christensens evolution from a technological focus to a businessmodelling focus is central to understanding the evolution of business at the market or industry level christensen and mark w johnson who cofounded the management consulting firm innosight described the dynamics of business model innovation in the  harvard business review article reinventing your business model the concept of disruptive technology continues a long tradition of identifying radical technical change in the study of innovation by economists and the development of tools for its management at a firm or policy level in the late s the automotive sector began to embrace a perspective of constructive disruptive technology by working with the consultant david e oryan whereby the use of current offtheshelf technology was integrated with newer innovation to create what he called an unfair advantage the process or technology change as a whole had to be constructive in improving the current method of manufacturing yet disruptively impact the whole of the business case model resulting in a significant reduction of waste energy materials labor or legacy costs to the user in keeping with the insight that what matters economically is the business model not the technological sophistication itself christensens theory explains why many disruptive innovations are not advanced technologies which the technology mudslide hypothesis would lead one to expect rather they are often novel combinations of existing offtheshelf components applied cleverly to a small fledgling value network theoryedit the current theoretical understanding of disruptive innovation is different from what might be expected by default an idea that clayton m christensen called the technology mudslide hypothesis this is the simplistic idea that an established firm fails because it doesnt keep up technologically with other firms in this hypothesis firms are like climbers scrambling upward on crumbling footing where it takes constant upwardclimbing effort just to stay still and any break from the effort such as complacency born of profitability causes a rapid downhill slide christensen and colleagues have shown that this simplistic hypothesis is wrong it doesnt model reality what they have shown is that good firms are usually aware of the innovations but their business environment does not allow them to pursue them when they first arise because they are not profitable enough at first and because their development can take scarce resources away from that of sustaining innovations which are needed to compete against current competition in christensens terms a firms existing value networks place insufficient value on the disruptive innovation to allow its pursuit by that firm meanwhile startup firms inhabit different value networks at least until the day that their disruptive innovation is able to invade the older value network at that time the established firm in that network can at best only fend off the market share attack with a metoo entry for which survival not thriving is the only reward christensen defines a disruptive innovation as a product or service designed for a new set of customers generally disruptive innovations were technologically straightforward consisting of offtheshelf components put together in a product architecture that was often simpler than prior approaches they offered less of what customers in established markets wanted and so could rarely be initially employed there they offered a different package of attributes valued only in emerging markets remote from and unimportant to the mainstream christensen argues that disruptive innovations can hurt successful wellmanaged companies that are responsive to their customers and have excellent research and development these companies tend to ignore the markets most susceptible to disruptive innovations because the markets have very tight profit margins and are too small to provide a good growth rate to an established sizable firm thus disruptive technology provides an example of an instance when the common businessworld advice to focus on the customer or stay close to the customer or listen to the customer can be strategically counterproductive while christensen argued that disruptive innovations can hurt successful wellmanaged companies oryan countered that constructive integration of existing new and forwardthinking innovation could improve the economic benefits of these same wellmanaged companies once decisionmaking management understood the systemic benefits as a whole how lowend disruption occurs over time christensen distinguishes between lowend disruption which targets customers who do not need the full performance valued by customers at the high end of the market and newmarket disruption which targets customers who have needs that were previously unserved by existing incumbents lowend disruption occurs when the rate at which products improve exceeds the rate at which customers can adopt the new performance therefore at some point the performance of the product overshoots the needs of certain customer segments at this point a disruptive technology may enter the market and provide a product that has lower performance than the incumbent but that exceeds the requirements of certain segments thereby gaining a foothold in the market in lowend disruption the disruptor is focused initially on serving the least profitable customer who is happy with a good enough product this type of customer is not willing to pay premium for enhancements in product functionality once the disruptor has gained a foothold in this customer segment it seeks to improve its profit margin to get higher profit margins the disruptor needs to enter the segment where the customer is willing to pay a little more for higher quality to ensure this quality in its product the disruptor needs to innovate the incumbent will not do much to retain its share in a notsoprofitable segment and will move upmarket and focus on its more attractive customers after a number of such encounters the incumbent is squeezed into smaller markets than it was previously serving and then finally the disruptive technology meets the demands of the most profitable segment and drives the established company out of the market new market disruption occurs when a product fits a new or emerging market segment that is not being served by existing incumbents in the industry the extrapolation of the theory to all aspects of life has been challenged as has the methodology of relying on selected case studies as the principal form of evidence jill lepore points out that some companies identified by the theory as victims of disruption a decade or more ago rather than being defunct remain dominant in their industries today including seagate technology us steel and bucyrus lepore questions whether the theory has been oversold and misapplied as if it were able to explain everything in every sphere of life including not just business but education and public institutions disruptive technologyedit in  milan zeleny described high technology as disruptive technology and raised the question of what is being disrupted the answer according to zeleny is the support network of high technology for example introducing electric cars disrupts the support network for gasoline cars network of gas and service stations such disruption is fully expected and therefore effectively resisted by support net owners in the long run high disruptive technology bypasses upgrades or replaces the outdated support network technology being a form of social relationshipcitation needed always evolves no technology remains fixed technology starts develops persists mutates stagnates and declines just like living organisms the evolutionary life cycle occurs in the use and development of any technology a new hightechnology core emerges and challenges existing technology support nets tsns which are thus forced to coevolve with it new versions of the core are designed and fitted into an increasingly appropriate tsn with smaller and smaller hightechnology effects high technology becomes regular technology with more efficient versions fitting the same support net finally even the efficiency gains diminish emphasis shifts to product tertiary attributes appearance style and technology becomes tsnpreserving appropriate technology this technological equilibrium state becomes established and fixated resisting being interrupted by a technological mutation then new high technology appears and the cycle is repeated regarding this evolving process of technology christensen said the technological changes that damage established companies are usually not radically new or difficult from a technological point of view they do however have two important characteristics first they typically present a different package of performance attributes—ones that at least at the outset are not valued by existing customers second the performance attributes that existing customers do value improve at such a rapid rate that the new technology can later invade those established markets joseph bower explained the process of how disruptive technology through its requisite support net dramatically transforms a certain industry when the technology that has the potential for revolutionizing an industry emerges established companies typically see it as unattractive it’s not something their mainstream customers want and its projected profit margins aren’t sufficient to cover bigcompany cost structure as a result the new technology tends to get ignored in favor of what’s currently popular with the best customers but then another company steps in to bring the innovation to a new market once the disruptive technology becomes established there smallerscale innovation rapidly raise the technology’s performance on attributes that mainstream customers’ value the automobile was high technology with respect to the horse carriage however it evolved into technology and finally into appropriate technology with a stable unchanging tsn the main hightechnology advance in the offing is some form of electric car—whether the energy source is the sun hydrogen water air pressure or traditional charging outlet electric cars preceded the gasoline automobile by many decades and are now returning to replace the traditional gasoline automobile milan zeleny described the above phenomenon he also wrote that implementing high technology is often resisted this resistance is well understood on the part of active participants in the requisite tsn the electric car will be resisted by gasstation operators in the same way automated teller machines atms were resisted by bank tellers and automobiles by horsewhip makers technology does not qualitatively restructure the tsn and therefore will not be resisted and never has been resisted middle management resists business process reengineering because bpr represents a direct assault on the support net coordinative hierarchy they thrive on teamwork and multifunctionality is resisted by those whose tsn provides the comfort of narrow specialization and commanddriven work hightechnology effectsedit high technology is a technology core that changes the very architecture structure and organization of the components of the technology support net high technology therefore transforms the qualitative nature of the tsns tasks and their relations as well as their requisite physical energy and information flows it also affects the skills required the roles played and the styles of management and coordination—the organizational culture itself this kind of technology core is different from regular technology core which preserves the qualitative nature of flows and the structure of the support and only allows users to perform the same tasks in the same way but faster more reliably in larger quantities or more efficiently it is also different from appropriate technology core which preserves the tsn itself with the purpose of technology implementation and allows users to do the same thing in the same way at comparable levels of efficiency instead of improving the efficiency of performance as for the difference between high technology and low technology milan zeleny once said  the effects of high technology always breaks the direct comparability by changing the system itself therefore requiring new measures and new assessments of its productivity high technology cannot be compared and evaluated with the existing technology purely on the basis of cost net present value or return on investment only within an unchanging and relatively stable tsn would such direct financial comparability be meaningful for example you can directly compare a manual typewriter with an electric typewriter but not a typewriter with a word processor therein lies the management challenge of high technology  however not all modern technologies are high technologies they have to be used as such function as such and be embedded in their requisite tsns they have to empower the individual because only through the individual can they empower knowledge not all information technologies have integrative effects some information systems are still designed to improve the traditional hierarchy of command and thus preserve and entrench the existing tsn the administrative model of management for instance further aggravates the division of task and labor further specializes knowledge separates management from workers and concentrates information and knowledge in centers as knowledge surpasses capital labor and raw materials as the dominant economic resource technologies are also starting to reflect this shift technologies are rapidly shifting from centralized hierarchies to distributed networks nowadays knowledge does not reside in a supermind superbook or superdatabase but in a complex relational pattern of networks brought forth to coordinate human action practical example of disruptionedit in the practical world the popularization of personal computers illustrates how knowledge contributes to the ongoing technology innovation the original centralized concept one computer many persons is a knowledgedefying idea of the prehistory of computing and its inadequacies and failures have become clearly apparent the era of personal computing brought powerful computers on every desk one person one computer this short transitional period was necessary for getting used to the new computing environment but was inadequate from the vantage point of producing knowledge adequate knowledge creation and management come mainly from networking and distributed computing one person many computers each persons computer must form an access point to the entire computing landscape or ecology through the internet of other computers databases and mainframes as well as production distribution and retailing facilities and the like for the first time technology empowers individuals rather than external hierarchies it transfers influence and power where it optimally belongs at the loci of the useful knowledge even though hierarchies and bureaucracies do not innovate free and empowered individuals do knowledge innovation spontaneity and selfreliance are becoming increasingly valued and promoted examplesedit this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable

drives used in desktop computers however  inch drives were not affordable for the new desktop machines the simple  inch drive assembled from technologically inferior offtheshelf components was an

rail including streetcars was the fastest and most costefficient means of land transportation for goods and passengers in industrialized countries the first cars buses and trucks were used for local transportation in suburban areas where they often replaced streetcars and industrial tracks as highways expanded medium and later longdistance transports were relocated to road traffic and some railways closed down as rail traffic has a lower tonkilometer cost but a higher investment and operating cost than road traffic rail is still preferred for largescale bulk cargo such as minerals however traffic congestion provides a bound on the efficiency of car use and so rail is still used for urban passenger transport high speed rail short distance flights in almost every market where high speed rail with journey times of two hours or less was introduced in competition with an air service the air service was either greatly reduced within a few years or ceased entirely even in markets with longer rail travel times airlines have reduced the amount of flights on offer and passenger numbers have gone down examples include the barcelonamadrid high speed railway the cologne

companies to stay at the top of their industries when technologies or markets change why is it that established companies invest aggressively–and successfully–in the technologies necessary to retain their current customers but then fail to make the technological investments that customers of the future will demand the fundamental reason is that leading companies succumb to one of the most popular and valuable management dogmas they stay close to their customers customers wield extraordinary power in directing a company’s investments but what happens when a new technology emerges that customers reject because it doesn’t address their needs as effectively as a company’s current approach in an ongoing study of technological change the authors found that most established companies are consistently ahead of their industries in developing and commercializing new technologies as long as those technologies address the nextgenerationperformance needs of their customers however an industry’s leaders are rarely in the forefront of commercializing new technologies that don’t initially meet the functional demands of mainstream customers and appeal only to small or emerging markets to remain at the top of their industries managers must first be able to spot the technologies that fall into this category to pursue these technologies managers must protect them from the processes and incentives that are geared to serving mainstream customers and the only way to do that is to create organizations that are completely independent of the mainstream business one of the most consistent patterns in business is the failure of leading companies to stay at the top of their industries when technologies or markets change goodyear and firestone entered the radialtire market quite late xerox let canon create the smallcopier market bucyruserie allowed caterpillar and deere to take over the mechanical excavator market sears gave way to walmart the pattern of failure has been especially striking in the computer industry ibm dominated the mainframe market but missed by years the emergence of minicomputers which were technologically much simpler than mainframes digital equipment dominated the minicomputer market with innovations like its vax architecture but missed the personalcomputer market almost completely apple computer led the world of personal computing and established the standard for userfriendly computing but lagged five years behind the leaders in bringing its portable computer to market why is it that companies like these invest aggressively—and successfully—in the technologies necessary to retain their current customers but then fail to make certain other technological investments that customers of the future will demand undoubtedly bureaucracy arrogance tired executive blood poor planning and shortterm investment horizons have all played a role but a more fundamental reason lies at the heart of the paradox leading companies succumb to one of the most popular and valuable management dogmas they stay close to their customers although most managers like to think they are in control customers wield extraordinary power in directing a company’s investments before managers decide to launch a technology develop a product build a plant or establish new channels of distribution they must look to their customers first do their customers want it how big will the market be will the investment be profitable the more astutely managers ask and answer these questions the more completely their investments will be aligned with the needs of their customers this is the way a wellmanaged company should operate right but what happens when customers reject a new technology product concept or way of doing business because it does not address their needs as effectively as a company’s current approach the large photocopying centers that represented the core of xerox’s customer base at first had no use for small slow tabletop copiers the excavation contractors that had relied on bucyruserie’s bigbucket steam and dieselpowered cable shovels didn’t want hydraulic excavators because initially they were small and weak ibm’s large commercial government and industrial customers saw no immediate use for minicomputers in each instance companies listened to their customers gave them the product performance they were looking for and in the end were hurt by the very technologies their customers led them to ignore we have seen this pattern repeatedly in an ongoing study of leading companies in a variety of industries that have confronted technological change the research shows that most wellmanaged established companies are consistently ahead of their industries in developing and commercializing new technologies—from incremental improvements to radically new approaches—as long as those technologies address the nextgeneration performance needs of their customers however these same companies are rarely in the forefront of commercializing new technologies that don’t initially meet the needs of mainstream customers and appeal only to small or emerging markets managers must beware of ignoring new technologies that don’t initially meet the needs of their mainstream customers using the rational analytical investment processes that most wellmanaged companies have developed it is nearly impossible to build a cogent case for diverting resources from known customer needs in established markets to markets and customers that seem insignificant or do not yet exist after all meeting the needs of established customers and fending off competitors takes all the resources a company has and then some in wellmanaged companies the processes used to identify customers’ needs forecast technological trends assess profitability allocate resources across competing proposals for investment and take new products to market are focused—for all the right reasons—on current customers and markets these processes are designed to weed out proposed products and technologies that do not address customers’ needs in fact the processes and incentives that companies use to keep focused on their main customers work so well that they blind those companies to important new technologies in emerging markets many companies have learned the hard way the perils of ignoring new technologies that do not initially meet the needs of mainstream customers for example although personal computers did not meet the requirements of mainstream minicomputer users in the early s the computing power of the desktop machines improved at a much faster rate than minicomputer users’ demands for computing power did as a result personal computers caught up with the computing needs of many of the customers of wang prime nixdorf data general and digital equipment today they are performancecompetitive with minicomputers in many applications for the minicomputer makers keeping close to mainstream customers and ignoring what were initially lowperformance desktop technologies used by seemingly insignificant customers in emerging markets was a rational decision—but one that proved disastrous the technological changes that damage established companies are usually not radically new or difficult from a technological point of view they do however have two important characteristics first they typically present a different package of performance attributes—ones that at least at the outset are not valued by existing customers second the performance attributes that existing customers do value improve at such a rapid rate that the new technology can later invade those established markets only at this point will mainstream customers want the technology unfortunately for the established suppliers by then it is often too late the pioneers of the new technology dominate the market it follows then that senior executives must first be able to spot the technologies that seem to fall into this category next to commercialize and develop the new technologies managers must protect them from the processes and incentives that are geared to serving established customers and the only way to protect them is to create organizations that are completely independent from the mainstream business no industry demonstrates the danger of staying too close to customers more dramatically than the harddiskdrive industry between  and  diskdrive performance improved at a stunning rate the physical size of a megabyte mb system shrank from  to  cubic inches and the cost per mb fell from  to  technological change of course drove these breathtaking achievements about half of the improvement came from a host of radical advances that were critical to continued improvements in diskdrive performance the other half came from incremental advances the pattern in the diskdrive industry has been repeated in many other industries the leading established companies have consistently led the industry in developing and adopting new technologies that their customers demanded—even when those technologies required completely different technological competencies and manufacturing capabilities from the ones the companies had in spite of this aggressive technological posture no single diskdrive manufacturer has been able to dominate the industry for more than a few years a series of companies have entered the business and risen to prominence only to be toppled by newcomers who pursued technologies that at first did not meet the needs of mainstream customers as a result not one of the independent diskdrive companies that existed in  survives today to explain the differences in the impact of certain kinds of technological innovations on a given industry the concept of performance trajectories—the rate at which the performance of a product has improved and is expected to improve over time—can be helpful almost every industry has a critical performance trajectory in mechanical excavators the critical trajectory is the annual improvement in cubic yards of earth moved per minute in photocopiers an important performance trajectory is improvement in number of copies per minute in disk drives one crucial measure of performance is storage capacity which has advanced  each year on average for a given size of drive different types of technological innovations affect performance trajectories in different ways on the one hand sustaining technologies tend to maintain a rate of improvement that is they give customers something more or better in the attributes they already value for example thinfilm components in disk drives which replaced conventional ferrite heads and oxide disks between  and  enabled information to be recorded more densely on disks engineers had been pushing the limits of the performance they could wring from ferrite heads and oxide disks but the drives employing these technologies seemed to have reached the natural limits of an s curve at that point new thinfilm technologies emerged that restored—or sustained—the historical trajectory of performance improvement on the other hand disruptive technologies introduce a very different package of attributes from the one mainstream customers historically value and they often perform far worse along one or two dimensions that are particularly important to those customers as a rule mainstream customers are unwilling to use a disruptive product in applications they know and understand at first then disruptive technologies tend to be used and valued only in new markets or new applications in fact they generally make possible the emergence of new markets for example sony’s early transistor radios sacrificed sound fidelity but created a market for portable radios by offering a new and different package of attributes—small size light weight and portability in the history of the harddiskdrive industry the leaders stumbled at each point of disruptive technological change when the diameter of disk drives shrank from the original  inches to  inches then to  inches and finally to  inches each of these new architectures initially offered the market substantially less storage capacity than the typical user in the established market required for example the inch drive offered  mb when it was introduced while the primary market for disk drives at that time—mainframes—required  mb on average not surprisingly the leading computer manufacturers rejected the inch architecture at first as a result their suppliers whose mainstream products consisted of inch drives with more than  mb of capacity did not pursue the disruptive products aggressively the pattern was repeated when the inch and inch drives emerged established computer makers rejected the drives as inadequate and in turn their diskdrive suppliers ignored them as well but while they offered less storage capacity the disruptive architectures created other important attributes—internal power supplies and smaller size inch drives still smaller size and lowcost stepper motors inch drives and ruggedness light weight and lowpower consumption inch drives from the late s to the mids the availability of the three drives made possible the development of new markets for minicomputers desktop pcs and portable computers respectively this article also appears in the clayton m christensen reader strategy  innovation book clayton m christensen and harvard business review  add to cart save share although the smaller drives represented disruptive technological change each was technologically straightforward in fact there were engineers at many leading companies who championed the new technologies and built working prototypes with bootlegged resources before management gave a formal goahead still the leading companies could not move the products through their organizations and into the market in a timely way each time a disruptive technology emerged between onehalf and twothirds of the established manufacturers failed to introduce models employing the new architecture—in stark contrast to their timely launches of critical sustaining technologies those companies that finally did launch new models typically lagged behind entrant companies by two years—eons in an industry whose products’ life cycles are often two years three waves of entrant companies led these revolutions they first captured the new markets and then dethroned the leading companies in the mainstream markets how could technologies that were initially inferior and useful only to new markets eventually threaten leading companies in established markets once the disruptive architectures became established in their new markets sustaining innovations raised each architecture’s performance along steep trajectories—so steep that the performance available from each architecture soon satisfied the needs of customers in the established markets for example the inch drive whose initial  mb of capacity in  was only a fraction of the capacity that the minicomputer market needed became fully performancecompetitive in the minicomputer market by  and in the mainframe market by  see the graph “how diskdrive performance met market needs” a company’s revenue and cost structures play a critical role in the way it evaluates proposed technological innovations generally disruptive technologies look financially unattractive to established companies the potential revenues from the discernible markets are small and it is often difficult to project how big the markets for the technology will be over the long term as a result managers typically conclude that the technology cannot make a meaningful contribution to corporate growth and therefore that it is not worth the management effort required to develop it in addition established companies have often installed higher cost structures to serve sustaining technologies than those required by disruptive technologies as a result managers typically see themselves as having two choices when deciding whether to pursue disruptive technologies one is to go downmarket and accept the lower profit margins of the emerging markets that the disruptive technologies will initially serve the other is to go upmarket with sustaining technologies and enter market segments whose profit margins are alluringly high for example the margins of ibm’s mainframes are still higher than those of pcs any rational resourceallocation process in companies serving established markets will choose going upmarket rather than going down managers of companies that have championed disruptive technologies in emerging markets look at the world quite differently without the high cost structures of their established counterparts these companies find the emerging markets appealing once the companies have secured a foothold in the markets and improved the performance of their technologies the established markets above them served by highcost suppliers look appetizing when they do attack the entrant companies find the established players to be easy and unprepared opponents because the opponents have been looking upmarket themselves discounting the threat from below it is tempting to stop at this point and conclude that a valuable lesson has been learned managers can avoid missing the next wave by paying careful attention to potentially disruptive technologies that do not meet current customers’ needs but recognizing the pattern and figuring out how to break it are two different things although entrants invaded established markets with new technologies three times in succession none of the established leaders in the diskdrive industry seemed to learn from the experiences of those that fell before them management myopia or lack of foresight cannot explain these failures the problem is that managers keep doing what has worked in the past serving the rapidly growing needs of their current customers the processes that successful wellmanaged companies have developed to allocate resources among proposed investments are incapable of funneling resources into programs that current customers explicitly don’t want and whose profit margins seem unattractive none of the established leaders in the diskdrive industry learned from the experiences of those that fell before them managing the development of new technology is tightly linked to a company’s investment processes most strategic proposals—to add capacity or to develop new products or processes—take shape at the lower levels of organizations in engineering groups or project teams companies then use analytical planning and budgeting systems to select from among the candidates competing for funds proposals to create new businesses in emerging markets are particularly challenging to assess because they depend on notoriously unreliable estimates of market size because managers are evaluated on their ability to place the right bets it is not surprising that in wellmanaged companies midand toplevel managers back projects in which the market seems assured by staying close to lead customers as they have been trained to do managers focus resources on fulfilling the requirements of those reliable customers that can be served profitably risk is reduced—and careers are safeguarded—by giving known customers what they want seagate technology’s experience illustrates the consequences of relying on such resourceallocation processes to evaluate disruptive technologies by almostany measure seagate based in scotts valley california was one of the most successful and aggressively managed companies in the history of the microelectronics industry from its inception in  seagate’s revenues had grown to more than  million by  it had pioneered inch harddisk drives and was the main supplier of them to ibm and ibmcompatible personalcomputer manufacturers the company was the leading manufacturer of inch drives at the time the disruptive inch drives emerged in the mids engineers at seagate were the second in the industry to develop working prototypes of inch drives by early  they had made more than  such models with a low level of company funding the engineers forwarded the new models to key marketing executives and the trade press reported that seagate was actively developing inch drives but seagate’s principal customers—ibm and other manufacturers of atclass personal computers—showed no interest in the new drives they wanted to incorporate mb and mb drives in their nextgeneration models and seagate’s early inch prototypes packed only  mb in response seagate’s marketing executives lowered their sales forecasts for the new disk drives manufacturing and financial executives at the company pointed out another drawback to the inch drives according to their analysis the new drives would never be competitive with the inch architecture on a costpermegabyte basis—an important metric that seagate’s customers used to evaluate disk drives given seagate’s cost structure margins on the highercapacity inch models therefore promised to be much higher than those on the smaller products senior managers quite rationally decided that the inch drive would not provide the sales volume and profit margins that seagate needed from a new product a former seagate marketing executive recalled “we needed a new model that could become the next st a inch drive generating more than  million in annual sales which was nearing the end of its life cycle at the time the entire market for inch drives was less than  million the inch drive just didn’t fit the bill—for sales or profits” the shelving of the inch drive was not a signal that seagate was complacent about innovation seagate subsequently introduced new models of inch drives at an accelerated rate and in so doing introduced an impressive array of sustaining technological improvements even though introducing them rendered a significant portion of its manufacturing capacity obsolete while seagate’s attention was glued to the personalcomputer market former employees of seagate and other inch drive makers who had become frustrated by their employers’ delays in launching inch drives founded a new company conner peripherals conner focused on selling its inch drives to companies in emerging markets for portable computers and smallfootprint desktop products pcs that take up a smaller amount of space on a desk conner’s primary customer was compaq computer a customer that seagate had never served seagate’s own prosperity coupled with conner’s focus on customers who valued different diskdrive attributes ruggedness physical volume and weight minimized the threat seagate saw in conner and its inch drives from its beachhead in the emerging market for portable computers however conner improved the storage capacity of its drives by  per year by the end of  inch drives packed the capacity demanded in the mainstream personalcomputer market at this point seagate executives took their company’s inch drive off the shelf introducing it to the market as a defensive response to the attack of entrant companies like conner and quantum corporation the other pioneer of inch drives but it was too late by then seagate faced strong competition for a while the company was able to defend its existing market by selling inch drives to its established customer base—manufacturers and resellers of fullsize personal computers in fact a large proportion of its inch products continued to be shipped in frames that enabled its customers to mount the drives in computers designed to accommodate inch drives but in the end seagate could only struggle to become a secondtier supplier in the new portablecomputer market in contrast conner and quantum built a dominant position in the new portablecomputer market and then used their scale and experience base in designing and manufacturing inch products to drive seagate from the personalcomputer market in their  fiscal years the combined revenues of conner and quantum exceeded  billion seagate’s poor timing typifies the responses of many established companies to the emergence of disruptive technologies seagate was willing to enter the market for inch drives only when it had become large enough to satisfy the company’s financial requirements—that is only when existing customers wanted the new technology seagate has survived through its savvy acquisition of control data corporation’s diskdrive business in  with cdc’s technology base and seagate’s volumemanufacturing expertise the company has become a powerful player in the business of supplying largecapacity drives for highend computers nonetheless seagate has been reduced to a shadow of its former self in the personalcomputer market it should come as no surprise that few companies when confronted with disruptive technologies have been able to overcome the handicaps of size or success but it can be done there is a method to spotting and cultivating disruptive technologies determine whether the technology is disruptive or sustaining the first step is to decide which of the myriad technologies on the horizon are disruptive and of those which are real threats most companies have wellconceived processes for identifying and tracking the progress of potentially sustaining technologies because they are important to serving and protecting current customers but few have systematic processes in place to identify and track potentially disruptive technologies one approach to identifying disruptive technologies is to examine internal disagreements over the development of new products or technologies who supports the project and who doesn’t marketing and financial managers because of their managerial and financial incentives will rarely support a disruptive technology on the other hand technical personnel with outstanding track records will often persist in arguing that a new market for the technology will emerge—even in the face of opposition from key customers and marketing and financial staff disagreement between the two groups often signals a disruptive technology that toplevel managers should explore define the strategic significance of the disruptive technology the next step is to ask the right people the right questions about the strategic importance of the disruptive technology disruptive technologies tend to stall early in strategic reviews because managers either ask the wrong questions or ask the wrong people the right questions for example established companies have regular procedures for asking mainstream customers—especially the important accounts where new ideas are actually tested—to assess the value of innovative products generally these customers are selected because they are the ones striving the hardest to stay ahead of their competitors in pushing the performance of their products hence these customers are most likely to demand the highest performance from their suppliers for this reason lead customers are reliably accurate when it comes to assessing the potential of sustaining technologies but they are reliably inaccurate when it comes to assessing the potential of disruptive technologies they are the wrong people to ask a simple graph plotting product performance as it is defined in mainstream markets on the vertical axis and time on the horizontal axis can help managers identify both the right questions and the right people to ask first draw a line depicting the level of performance and the trajectory of performance improvement that customers have historically enjoyed and are likely to expect in the future then locate the estimated initial performance level of the new technology if the technology is disruptive the point will lie far below the performance demanded by current customers see the graph “how to assess disruptive technologies” find this and other hbr graphics in our visual library what is the likely slope of performance improvement of the disruptive technology compared with the slope of performance improvement demanded by existing markets if knowledgeable technologists believe the new technology might progress faster than the market’s demand for performance improvement then that technology which does not meet customers’ needs today may very well address them tomorrow the new technology therefore is strategically critical instead of taking this approach most managers ask the wrong questions they compare the anticipated rate of performance improvement of the new technology with that of the established technology if the new technology has the potential to surpass the established one the reasoning goes they should get busy developing it pretty simple but this sort of comparison while valid for sustaining technologies misses the central strategic issue in assessing potentially disruptive technologies many of the disruptive technologies we studied never surpassed the capability of the old technology it is the trajectory of the disruptive technology compared with that of the market that is significant for example the reason the mainframecomputer market is shrinking is not that personal computers outperform mainframes but because personal computers networked with a file server meet the computing and datastorage needs of many organizations effectively mainframecomputer makers are reeling not because the performance of personalcomputing technology surpassed the performance of mainframe technology but because it intersected with the performance demanded by the established market consider the graph again if technologists believe that the new technology will progress at the same rate as the market’s demand for performance improvement the disruptive technology may be slower to invade established markets recall that seagate had targeted personal computing where demand for harddisk capacity per computer was growing at  per year because the capacity of inch drives improved at a much faster rate leading inchdrive makers were able to force seagate out of the market however two other inchdrive makers maxtor and micropolis had targeted the engineeringworkstation market in which demand for harddisk capacity was insatiable in that market the trajectory of capacity demanded was essentially parallel to the trajectory of capacity improvement that technologists could supply in the inch architecture as a result entering the inchdrive business was strategically less critical for those companies than it was for seagate locate the initial market for the disruptive technology once managers have determined that a new technology is disruptive and strategically critical the next step is to locate the initial markets for that technology market research the tool that managers have traditionally relied on is seldom helpful at the point a company needs to make a strategic commitment to a disruptive technology no concrete market exists when edwin land asked polaroid’s market researchers to assess the potential sales of his new camera they concluded that polaroid would sell a mere  cameras over the product’s lifetime few people they interviewed could imagine the uses of instant photography because disruptive technologies frequently signal the emergence of new markets or market segments managers must create information about such markets—who the customers will be which dimensions of product performance will matter most to which customers what the right price points will be managers can create this kind of information only by experimenting rapidly iteratively and inexpensively with both the product and the market for established companies to undertake such experiments is very difficult the resourceallocation processes that are critical to profitability and competitiveness will not—and should not—direct resources to markets in which sales will be relatively small how then can an established company probe a market for a disruptive technology let startups—either ones the company funds or others with no connection to the company—conduct the experiments small hungry organizations are good at placing economical bets rolling with the punches and agilely changing product and market strategies in response to feedback from initial forays into the market small hungry organizations are good at agilely changing product and market strategies consider apple computer in its startup days the company’s original product the apple i was a flop when it was launched in  but apple had not placed a huge bet on the product and had gotten at least something into the hands of early users quickly the company learned a lot from the apple i about the new technology and about what customers wanted and did not want just as important a group of customers learned about what they did and did not want from personal computers armed with this information apple launched the apple ii quite successfully many companies could have learned the same valuable lessons by watching apple closely in fact some companies pursue an explicit strategy of being second to invent—allowing small pioneers to lead the way into uncharted market territory for instance ibm let apple commodore and tandy define the personal computer it then aggressively entered the market and built a considerable personalcomputer business but ibm’s relative success in entering a new market late is the exception not the rule all too often successful companies hold the performance of smallmarket pioneers to the financial standards they apply to their own performance in an attempt to ensure that they are using their resources well companies explicitly or implicitly set relatively high thresholds for the size of the markets they should consider entering this approach sentences them to making late entries into markets already filled with powerful players for example when the inch drive emerged seagate needed a millionayear product to replace its mature flagship inch model the st and the inch market wasn’t large enough over the next two years when the trade press asked when seagate would introduce its inch drive company executives consistently responded that there was no market yet there actually was a market and it was growing rapidly the signals that seagate was picking up about the market influenced as they were by customers who didn’t want inch drives were misleading when seagate finally introduced its inch drive in  more than  million in inch drives had already been sold information about the market’s size had been widely available throughout the industry but it wasn’t compelling enough to shift the focus of seagate’s managers they continued to look at the new market through the eyes of their current customers and in the context of their current financial structure seagate paid the price for allowing startups to lead the way into emerging markets the posture of today’s leading diskdrive makers toward the newest disruptive technology inch drives is eerily familiar each of the industry leaders has designed one or more models of the tiny drives and the models are sitting on shelves their capacity is too low to be used in notebook computers and no one yet knows where the initial market for inch drives will be fax machines printers and automobile dashboard mapping systems are all candidates “there just isn’t a market” complained one industry executive “we’ve got the product and the sales force can take orders for it but there are no orders because nobody needs it it just sits there” this executive has not considered the fact that his sales force has no incentive to sell the inch drives instead of the highermargin products it sells to highervolume customers and while the inch drive is sitting on the shelf at his company and others last year more than  million worth of inch drives were sold almost all by startups this year the market will be an estimated  million every company that has tried to manage mainstream and disruptive businesses within a single organization failed to avoid allowing small pioneering companies to dominate new markets executives must personally monitor the available intelligence on the progress of pioneering companies through monthly meetings with technologists academics venture capitalists and other nontraditional sources of information they cannot rely on the company’s traditional channels for gauging markets because those channels were not designed for that purpose place responsibility for building a disruptivetechnology business in an independent organization the strategy of forming small teams into skunkworks projects to isolate them from the stifling demands of mainstream organizations is widely known but poorly understood for example isolating a team of engineers so that it can develop a radically new sustaining technology just because that technology is radically different is a fundamental misapplication of the skunkworks approach managing out of context is also unnecessary in the unusual event that a disruptive technology is more financially attractive than existing products consider intel’s transition from dynamic random access memory dram chips to microprocessors intel’s early microprocessor business had a higher gross margin than that of its dram business in other words intel’s normal resourceallocation process naturally provided the new business with the resources it needed creating a separate organization is necessary only when the disruptive technology has a lower profit margin than the mainstream business and must serve the unique needs of a new set of customers cdc for example successfully created a remote organization to commercialize its inch drive through  cdc was the dominant independent diskdrive supplier due to its expertise in making inch drives for mainframecomputer makers when the inch drive emerged cdc launched a late development effort but its engineers were repeatedly pulled off the project to solve problems for the more profitable higherpriority inch projects targeted at the company’s most important customers as a result cdc was three years late in launching its first inch product and never captured more than  of that market when the inch generation arrived cdc decided that it would face the new challenge more strategically the company assigned a small group of engineers and marketers in oklahoma city oklahoma far from the mainstream organization’s customers the task of developing and commercializing a competitive inch product “we needed to launch it in an environment in which everybody got excited about a  order” one executive recalled “in minneapolis you needed a  million order to turn anyone’s head” cdc never regained the  share it had once enjoyed in the market for mainframe disk drives but its oklahoma city operation secured a profitable  of the highperformance inch market had apple created a similar organization to develop its newton personal digital assistant pda those who have pronounced it a flop might have deemed it a success in launching the product apple made the mistake of acting as if it were dealing with an established market apple managers went into the pda project assuming that it had to make a significant contribution to corporate growth accordingly they researched customer desires exhaustively and then bet huge sums launching the newton had apple made a more modest technological and financial bet and entrusted the newton to an organization the size that apple itself was when it launched the apple i the outcome might have been different the newton might have been seen more broadly as a solid step forward in the quest to discover what customers really want in fact many more newtons than apple i models were sold within a year of their introduction keep the disruptive organization independent established companies can only dominate emerging markets by creating small organizations of the sort cdc created in oklahoma city but what should they do when the emerging market becomes large and established most managers assume that once a spinoff has become commercially viable in a new market it should be integrated into the mainstream organization they reason that the fixed costs associated with engineering manufacturing sales and distribution activities can be shared across a broader group of customers and products in order that it may live a corporation must be willing to see business units die this approach might work with sustaining technologies however with disruptive technologies folding the spinoff into the mainstream organization can be disastrous when the independent and mainstream organizations are folded together in order to share resources debilitating arguments inevitably arise over which groups get what resources and whether or when to cannibalize established products in the history of the diskdrive industry every company that has tried to manage mainstream and disruptive businesses within a single organization failed no matter the industry a corporation consists of business units with finite life spans the technological and market bases of any business will eventually disappear disruptive technologies are part of that cycle companies that understand this process can create new businesses to replace the ones that must inevitably die to do so companies must give managers of disruptive innovation free rein to realize the technology’s full potential—even if it means ultimately killing the mainstream business for the corporation to live it must be willing to see business units die if the corporation doesn’t kill them off itself competitors will the key to prospering at points of disruptive change is not simply to take more risks invest for the long term or fight bureaucracy the key is to manage strategically important disruptive technologies in an organizational context where small orders create energy where fast lowcost forays into illdefined markets are possible and where overhead is low enough to permit profit even in emerging markets managers of established companies can master disruptive technologies with extraordinary success but when they seek to develop and launch a disruptive technology that is rejected by important customers within the context of the mainstream business’s financial demands they fail—not because they make the wrong decisions but because they make the right decisions for
