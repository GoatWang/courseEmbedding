corporations compared to llcs knowledge centerrtrifcorporationrtrifcorporations compared to llcs corporations compared to llcs limited liability companies llcs are one of the newest types of business entities like corporations they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships whether an llc or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business the best comparison here is between an llc and an s corporation because an llc can choose to be taxed as an s corporation social security taxes the owners of the s corporation can take out some profits without social security taxes for a large business in which the owners take out salaries of  or more plus profits there would not be much difference since the social security tax cuts out at that level as of  however for a smaller business in which an owner could take out a  salary and  profit the extra taxes on the  would be over  raising money if a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the llc liability protection an important advantage of an llc is that in some states a creditor cannot collect the members’ llc distributions with a corporation creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets but can collect the shareholder’s dividends profits losses and taxes the other advantages of llcs are found in certain tax situations for example an llc can make special allocations of profits and losses among members whereas s corporations cannot s corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership in an llc money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis and lower the taxes of the owners whereas in an s corporation it does not contributing property to set up an llc is not taxable even for minority interest owners whereas for a corporation regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the

structures such as sole proprietorships and general partnerships if you are looking for tax flexibility limited liability and the option to raise capital incorporation may be the best path for you the following are four of the major benefits of incorporationincreased credibilitybeing recognized as a corporation proves to creditors and potential clients that your business is organized according to state law by simply adding “inc” or “llc” to the end of your business name gives you the professional look and credibility that many customers are looking fortax benefits corporation owners are able to deduct many more expenses than those who own informal businesses these writeoffs can be substantial since insurance travel and entertainment are deductions corporation owners are also free from paying certain selfemployment taxes which informal business owners must payasset protectionin the event that a corporation becomes unable to pay its debts the owners are given limited liability status this means that their personal funds or assets cannot be collected in order to pay business debts in the event legal proceedings are brought against the corporation the owners’ personal assets are protectedperpetual lifespan if your business is incorporated it will not be forced to dissolve due to changes in ownership the transfer of ownership is typically accomplished through the simple sale of common or unrestricted preferred stock or by membership interest transfers informal business structures are not perpetual entities so in the event that an owner dies or wants to sell the business typically ceases to exist in its current form being a perpetual entity makes it easier for incorporated businesses to get bank loans and to attract investors incorporate today  or call  want to

to the dollar store and purchased a bunch of dog collars and linked them together over his spine and around his abdomen” said silva  “i was pleasantly surprised when it worked so i had a sturdier one

for you the following are four of the major benefits of incorporationincreased credibilitybeing recognized as a corporation proves to creditors and potential clients that your business is organized according to state law by simply adding “inc” or “llc” to the end of your business name gives you the professional look and credibility that many customers are looking fortax benefits corporation owners are able to deduct many more expenses than those who own informal businesses these writeoffs can be substantial since insurance travel and entertainment are deductions corporation owners are also free from paying certain selfemployment taxes which informal business owners must payasset protectionin the event that a corporation becomes unable to pay its debts the owners are given limited liability status this means that their personal funds or assets cannot be collected in order to pay business debts in the event legal proceedings are brought against the corporation the owners’ personal assets are protectedperpetual lifespan if your business is incorporated it will not be forced to dissolve due to changes in ownership the transfer of ownership is typically accomplished through the simple sale of common or unrestricted preferred stock or by membership interest transfers informal business structures are not perpetual entities so in the event that an owner dies or wants to sell the business typically ceases to exist in its current form being a perpetual entity makes it easier for incorporated businesses to get bank loans and to attract investors incorporate

terry silva the story of terry silva’s invention had a painful beginning  after being dragged across the street causing cuts and bruises that sent her to the emergency room terry knew she needed a new solution to help control her   pound german shepherdalaskan husky named ziggy “i went to the dollar store and purchased a bunch of dog collars and linked them together over his spine and around his abdomen” said silva  “i was pleasantly surprised when it worked so i had a sturdier one made that my dog ziggy loved  he walked by my side and i never had to put any pressure on the new leash” like most inventors who develop their invention terry determined that licensing it to a company with connections at retail would be the best option that’s when she reached out to lambert  lambert to help her design and market her new invention make presentations and negotiate the license deal  “working with lambert  lambert has been a pleasure  they are true professionals and i couldn’t have done it
