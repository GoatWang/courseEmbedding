used to help you increase your savings protect what youve saved or generate a stream of income have us call you annuities generally fall into two categories deferred and income each works differently and offers unique advantages taxdeferred annuities for retirement savings deferred annuities can be a good way to boost your retirement savings once youve made the maximum allowable contributions to your k or ira like any taxdeferred investment earnings compound over time providing growth opportunities that taxable accounts lack deferred annuities have no irs contribution limits so you can invest as much as you want for retirement you can also use your savings to create a guaranteed stream of income for retirement depending on how annuities are funded they may not have minimum required distributions mrds bear in mind that withdrawals of taxable amounts from an annuity are subject to ordinary income tax and if taken before age ½ may be subject to a  irs penalty annuities also come with annual charges not found in mutual funds which will affect your returns deferred variable annuities have funds that may have the potential for investment growth however this can involve some market risk and could result in losses if the value of the underlying investments falls variable annuities are usually appropriate for those with longer time horizons or those who are better able to handle market fluctuations some variable annuities allow you to protect your investment against loss while still participating in potential market growth deferred fixed annuities offer a guaranteed rate of return for a number of years fixed deferred annuities may be more suitable for conservative investors or for those interested in protecting assets from market volatility in this way they’re similar to certificates of deposit cds however deferred fixed annuities differ from cds in that annuities are not fdicinsured withdrawals from annuities prior to age ½ may be subject to a  irs penalty deferred fixed annuities may offer more access to assets than a cd annuity earnings compound on a taxdeferred basis income annuities for income in retirement income annuities may be appropriate for investors in or near retirement because they offer guaranteed income for life or a set period of time they may allow you to be more aggressive with other investments in your portfolio since they provide a lifetime income stream keep in mind that you may have limited or no access to the assets used to purchase income annuities immediate fixed income annuities offer a guaranteed predictable payment for life or for a certain period of time your guaranteed income payment cannot be affected by market volatility helping shield your retirement income from market risk a costofliving increase is available at an additional cost to help your buying power keep pace with inflation deferred income annuities are fixed income annuities that have a deferral period before income payments start because of the deferral period you may get a higher income payment amount than you would from a comparable immediate fixed income annuity with the same initial investment the costofliving increase is also available at an additional cost for deferred income annuities to buy or learn more   find an investor center  each individuals situation is unique and therefore seeking additional guidance from a tax advisor is suggested although variable annuities offer taxdeferral if you are considering one to fund a qualified retirement plan or ira you should do so for the variable annuitys features and benefits other than tax deferral in such cases tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the variable annuity references throughout this material to tax advantages such as tax deferral and taxfree transfers are subject to this consideration  insurance companies reserve the right to limit contributions  guarantees apply to certain insurance and annuity products and are subject to product terms

march   key points turning your retirement savings into income that will last can be a major challenge when youre preparing for and then living in retirement immediate fixed life annuities and variable annuities guarantee income that cant be outlived in retirement adding an optional guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit to a variable annuity guarantees a minimum level of income regardless of market fluctuations understanding the unique attributes of each can help you decide if theyll support your income planafter all your hard work saving for retirement youll need to manage market risk and generate income that lasts annuities are one tool that can help—particularly if youre seeking a stream of income that you know will be around as long as you arethere are two types of annuities we believe may be worth considering to generate income immediate fixed annuities and variable annuities many variable annuities offer an optional rider often called guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefits or glwbs that can provide additional protection for your incomeimmediate fixed annuities provide pensionlike income while variable annuities provide a guaranteed stream of lifetime income at retirement either through annuitization or the purchase of an optional glwb riderunder the standard annuitization option an investors retirement income is based on the performance of the underlying investment options heshe selected adding a glwb rider locksin a minimum level of income that can rise with the performance of the investment options but can never fall annuities add protections to your retirementfirst off why consider an annuity one reason beats all the others in our view unlike a portfolio of stocks and bonds annuities combine characteristics of standard investments with insurance features most life annuities provide a reliable stream of income that you cant outlive and some can help you reduce or transfer the risk of investing in the market for part of your portfolio to an insurerannuities are also a way to systematically turn savings into income this may seem complicated but its one of the most important steps to consider when managing your retirement portfolio—how exactly will you create regular withdrawals from your portfolio that will last immediate fixed annuities provide pensionlike income for lifeimmediate fixed annuities are the oldest most common type of annuity you pay an insurance company a lump sum up front and in return you receive a fixed monthly payment for life or some other specific time period—a reliable stream of income you cant outliveimmediate fixed life annuities may make sense in our view if youre seeking income now and dont want to worry about market fluctuations—at least for a portion of your savings the insurance company manages those details and makes sure you receive a fixed payment that lasts for life as long as the insurance company is solvent youll receive a payment for the same amount every monthif you live longer than average youll benefit from owning an immediate fixed life annuity the rate of return depends on your initial investment and how long you live annuity experts call this a mortality credit if you live longer than other investors youll benefit in fact it may be most useful to think about an immediate fixed annuity not purely as compared to other investments but more for its insurance featureswhat about the current lowinterestrate environment—can that impact payments from an annuity it may not make the most sense to load up on immediate fixed annuities when interest rates are low as the payments depend to a degree on the market but if you need guaranteed income it probably wont pay to wait too long either one strategy is to stagger your purchase of immediate fixed annuities over time much like a bond ladder but using annuities as your guaranteed income needs growits worth noting that monthly payments from immediate fixed life annuities are generally higher the older you are at the time of purchase the insurer anticipates that it will be making payments for a shorter period of time so it can pay a higher proportion of the lump sum on a monthly basis this feature isnt shared by variable annuities with glwbs variable annuities with glwbs income protection flexibility and growth potentialin contrast to immediate fixed annuities variable annuities with an optional glwb rider dont require that you to turn cash over irrevocably to an insurance company rather the investor retains control of the money and makes withdrawals from a portfolio of investments that is held within the variable annuitywhen purchased with a glwb feature at an additional cost the rider may protect against market downturns by guaranteeing your ability to take withdrawals for life at a certain minimum level no matter how the market performs without annuitizing the contract in other words you can stay invested in the market and benefit from flexibility and potential for growthyou should be aware however that the glwb is not a contract value and is not available for withdrawal like a cash value your actual contract value will deplete with each withdrawal though youll continue to take income for life even if withdrawals and market losses deplete your annuitys value to zero theres also an annual cost associated with the additional riderthis type of annuity can be more complex than immediate fixed annuities so its important to examine the details and talk with a professional to make sure you understand them thoroughly but at the most basic level purchasing a glwb rider with a variable annuity adds an additional layer of protections to a portfolio of investments held within a variable annuity to generate retirement income if markets dont perform well you have protections and if they perform better than expected you have some potential for growth after accounting for fees and withdrawalsone tradeoff compared to immediate fixed annuities is that variable annuities with glwbs generally promise a lower guaranteed payment initially once withdrawals begin a typical guaranteed annual withdrawal rate from a variable annuity with glwb may be  of an income base generally based on the highest contract anniversary value the contract achieved since purchase of the glwb rider an immediate fixed life annuity will generally quote a monthly or annual payment but the amount of the withdrawal if calculated as a percentage of the lump sum invested will generally be higheranother consideration is cost glwb riders are purchased at an additional cost generally starting at around  per year and rising this is the cost of adding more protections to the flexibility and growth potential besides the cost of the rider variable annuities are subject to a number of charges these charges will reduce the value of your account and return on your investments how to choose an annuity for youboth types of annuities—immediate fixed and variable with glwbs—provide guaranteed income in retirement but neither type will be right for every investor do you value a higher guaranteed lifetime income in a simple package or do you value flexibility and growth potential are you still preparing for retirement and looking to protect part of your savings or are you already well into retirement and looking for income nowthe table below shows factors to consider when choosing which type might make sense for you compared to or more typically as a complement to a traditional portfoliofactors to take into account when considering annuitiesfactors to considerimmediate fixed annuitiesvariable annuities with glwbstraditional portfolioincome guaranteesinsurer pledges to make income payments that last for a fixed period of lifeinsurer generally

embedded in upfront cost of purchasesannual investments fees insurance costs fees for optional riders potential surrender charges and other possible expensesno added insurance or annuity fee costs of underlying investments still applynote  all guarantees are subject to the claimspaying ability of the insurerits possible to choose a combination of all three depending on your needs each approach has pluses and minuses that can work in isolation or together immediate fixed annuities provide higher guaranteed income for the cost while variable annuities with glwbs help flexibly protect retirement income from market risk and of course a traditional portfolio provides the most flexibility at the lowest cost of the three approaches but doesnt include lifetime income protection how much should you investas a general rule of thumb we dont believe you should commit more than  of your investable assets to either type of annuity most investors will want some assets available for liquidity as well as full growth potential without additional feesif you value lifetime income you may wish to consider predictable income sources such as lifetime income from annuities to cover essential expenditures in retirement—then invest the rest for liquidity and growth for more insights on how to build your retirement income see schwabs retirement income fundamentals next stepsif you need help learning
