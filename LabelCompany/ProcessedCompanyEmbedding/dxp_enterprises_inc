measurements including ebitda adjusted ebitda and free cash flow this supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the unaudited gaap measurements additional information regarding ebitda referred to in this press release is included below under unaudited reconciliation of nongaap financial information the company believes ebitda provides additional information about i operating performance because it assists in comparing the operating performance of the business as it removes the impact of noncash depreciation and amortization expense as well as items not directly resulting from core operations such as interest expense and income taxes and ii the performance and the effectiveness of operational strategies additionally ebitda performance is a component of a measure of the company’s financial covenants under its credit facility furthermore some investors use ebitda as a supplemental measure to evaluate the overall operating performance of companies in the industry management believes that some investors’ understanding of performance is enhanced by including this nongaap financial measure as a reasonable basis for comparing ongoing results of operations by providing this nongaap financial measure together with a reconciliation from net income the company believes it is enhancing investors’ understanding of the business and

earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions this is done because generally speaking if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago the crux of this approach is comparing the most accurate estimate to the zacks consensus estimate although the zacks rank is also an important feature of the esp metric combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report and hopefully surge higher in price too in fact when combining a zacks rank  or better and a positive earnings esp stocks produced a positive surprise  of the time and best of all
