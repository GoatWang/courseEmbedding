the delaware trustee is a trustee of the trust for the sole and limited purpose of fulfilling the requirements of the delaware statutory trust act   investment objective   the trust seeks to track the results of a fully collateralized investment in futures contracts on an index composed of a diversified group of commodity futures which attempts to minimize contango and maximize backwardation the trust seeks to track the investment results of the index before fees and expenses of the trust the trust holds long positions in index futures whose settlement value at expiration is determined based on the value of the bloomberg roll select ci at that time the trust also earns interest on its noncash collateral assets        table of contents     the bloomberg roll select ci incorporates the economic effect of “rolling” the contracts included in the applicable index “rolling” a futures contract means closing out a position in an expiring futures contract and establishing an equivalent position in a replacement futures contract on the same commodity markets for futures contracts can be in “backwardation” which means that futures contracts with distant delivery months are priced lower than those with nearer delivery months or can exhibit “contango” which means that futures contracts with distant delivery months are priced higher than those with nearer delivery months the bloomberg roll select ci employs a “rolling” methodology that seeks to minimize the effect of contango and maximize the effect of backwardation by selecting replacement futures contracts that exhibit the most backwardation or least contango relative to its preceding contract among those eligible futures contracts with delivery months of up to  calendar days until expiration   the index in turn reflects the return of the bloomberg roll select ci together with the return on specified us treasury securities that are deemed to have been held to collateralize a hypothetical long position in the futures contracts comprising the bloomberg roll select ci   the index and the bloomberg roll select ci are calculated based on the same commodities though not always the same futures contracts that are included in the bloomberg commodity index or the “bloomberg ci” which is a liquidity and productionweighted index of the prices of a diversified group of futures contracts on physical commodities the bloomberg ci the bloomberg roll select ci and the index are administered calculated and published by bloomberg who is also referred to in this prospectus as the “index administrator” of the bloomberg ci the bloomberg roll select ci and the index certain intellectual property and other rights relating to the bloomberg ci and related indices are owned by ubs securities including the right to remove bloomberg as index administrator and bloomberg and ubs securities are collectively referred to as the “index providers”   if the index providers cease to maintain the index the bloomberg ci or the bloomberg roll select ci the trust may seek investment results that correspond generally but are not necessarily identical to the performance of a fully collateralized investment in a successor index or any other index that in the opinion of the sponsor is reasonably similar to the index   when establishing positions in index futures the advisor estimates as of the date of this prospectus that the trust will be required to deposit initial margin with a value of approximately  to  of the value of each index futures position at the time it is established these margin requirements are subject to change from time to time by the exchange or the clearing fcm margin requirements established by the clearing fcm may exceed minimum levels established by the exchange on a daily basis the trust will be obligated to pay or entitled to receive variation margin in an amount equal to the change in the daily settlement level of its index futures positions if the daily settlement level causes the value of the trust’s index futures positions to decrease the trust is required to post variation margin with the clearing fcm conversely if the daily settlement level causes the value of the trust’s index futures positions to increase the trust’s account with the clearing fcm receives variation margin in an amount equal to the increase   whenever index futures of different types or expirations are available for investment the sponsor determines pursuant to the terms of the trust agreement which index futures are to be transferred in connection with either the creation or redemption of baskets the trust does not engage in any activities designed to obtain a profit from or to ameliorate losses caused by changes in the level of the index or the bloomberg roll select ci or the value of the collateral assets   the profit or loss on the trust’s index futures positions should correlate with increases and decreases in the value of the bloomberg roll select ci although this correlation is not expected to be exact the return on the index futures together with interest on the noncash collateral assets is expected to result in a total return that corresponds generally but is not identical to the index differences between the returns on the shares and the performance of the index may be based on among other factors differences between the return on the collateral assets and the us treasury rate used to calculate the us treasury return component of the index timing differences differences between the portion of the trust’s assets invested in index futures versus the portion of the return of the index contributed by the bloomberg roll select ci differences between the settlement price of index futures and the closing level of the bloomberg roll select ci and the payment of expenses and liabilities by the trust        table of contents       the advisor acts as the commodity trading advisor for the trust the advisor on behalf of the trust is authorized to invest all of the trust’s assets in long positions in index futures and in collateral assets in order to satisfy applicable margin requirements on those index futures positions any cash that the trust accepts in connection with the creation of shares is used to purchase additional index futures or collateral assets in an amount that the advisor determines will enable the trust to achieve investment results that correspond with the index before the payment of the trust’s expenses and liabilities the advisor does not engage in any activities designed to obtain a profit from or to ameliorate losses caused by changes in the level of the index or the bloomberg roll select ci or the value of the collateral assets   the shares are intended to constitute an alternative means for investors to achieve investment exposure to the performance of the index although the shares are not the exact equivalent of an investment in the underlying futures contracts and treasury securities represented by the index the shares are intended to provide investors with an alternative method of participating in the commodities market   in addition retail investors can gain exposure to the commodities underlying the bloomberg roll select ci by purchasing individual or small lots of shares through traditional brokerage accounts without being subject to the significantly higher minimum contract sizes required for directly establishing a position in the underlying commodities or futures contracts the shares are eligible for margin accounts   risk factors   an investment in the shares is speculative and includes among others the following risks see “risk factors” starting on page  of this prospectus     •  the trust has a limited operating history         •  the market price for

volatile         •  the return on the shares will not correlate precisely with the performance of the index         •  the trust is subject to fees and expenses that are payable regardless of profitability         •  there may be conflicts of interest between you on the one hand and the sponsor and its affiliates the index providers and their affiliates the clearing fcm and any other

schedule k may be somewhat more complex than comparable reporting on irs form         table of contents     conflicts of interest   there may be conflicts of interest between the shareholders and the sponsor and its affiliates these conflicts may arise because the sponsor is affiliated with the trustee and the advisor because of these affiliations the sponsor has an incentive not to remove the trustee or the advisor conflicts may also result from the sponsor’s substantial control over the business and activities of the trust such as the sponsor’s authority to determine whether to make distributions to shareholders its oversight over nav calculations and its rights relating to amending the trust agreement or dissolving the trust in addition conflicts may arise in connection with trading activities relating to the index futures index components or related instruments for the sponsor’s or its affiliates’ proprietary accounts customer accounts or other accounts under management as well as in connection with research reports published by the sponsor or its affiliates with respect to commodities markets additional conflicts of interest may exist between shareholders on the one

which fluctuates based on the prices of commodity futures contracts reflected in the bloomberg roll select ci these prices may be volatile thereby creating the potential for losses regardless of the length of time you intend to hold your shares   because the price of the shares depends on the value of the index futures held by the trust the value of the shares fluctuates based on the prices of commodity futures contracts reflected in the bloomberg roll select ci commodity prices may be volatile commodity prices are generally affected by among other factors the cost of producing transporting and storing commodities changes in consumer or commercial demand for commodities the hedging and trading strategies of producers and consumers of commodities speculative trading in commodities by commodity pools and other market participants disruptions in commodity supply weather political and other global events global economic factors and government intervention in or regulation of the commodity or commodity futures markets these factors cannot be controlled by the trust accordingly the price of the shares could change substantially and in a rapid and unpredictable manner this exposes you to a potential loss on your investment in the shares regardless of the length of time you intend to hold your shares   the following events among others would generally result in a decline in the price of the shares     • a significant increase in hedging activity by producers of the underlying commodities should producers of the commodities underlying the bloomberg roll select ci increase their hedging of their future production through forward sales or other short positions this increased selling pressure could depress the price of one or more of the underlying commodities which could adversely affect the price of the shares         • a significant change in the attitude of speculators and investors toward the futures contracts or commodities underlying the bloomberg roll select ci should the speculative community take a negative view towards one or more of the underlying futures contracts or commodities it could cause a decline in the price of the index futures which may reduce the price of the shares         • significant reductions in the size of positions permitted to be owned by the trust or others in index futures or in the futures contracts andor commodities comprising the bloomberg roll select ci for example as a result of more restrictive position limits or position limit exemptions or more expansive position aggregation requirements could reduce liquidity and depress the price of the bloomberg roll select ci andor the underlying futures contracts or commodities adversely affecting the value of your shares   conversely several factors could trigger a temporary increase in the price of the futures contracts or commodities underlying the bloomberg roll select ci and consequently the index futures in that case you could buy shares at prices affected by the temporarily high commodity prices and you could subsequently incur losses when the causes for the temporary increase disappear   historical performance of the index the bloomberg roll select ci and the bloomberg ci is no guide to their future performance or to the performance of the shares   past performance of the index the bloomberg roll select ci and the bloomberg ci is not necessarily indicative of their future performance or of the performance of the shares there can be no guarantee that the level of the index the bloomberg roll select ci or the bloomberg ci will increase the bloomberg roll select ci and the index have limited performance histories see “risk factors relating to index futures and the bloomberg roll select ci—the index and the bloomberg roll select ci have limited histories and may perform in unexpected ways” although the bloomberg ci which is based on the same underlying commodities as the bloomberg roll select ci and the index has a longer performance history there are differences in the way that the bloomberg ci and the bloomberg roll select ci address the rolling of contracts that could cause the bloomberg ci to perform differently from the bloomberg roll select ci and the index see “the index the bloomberg ci and the bloomberg roll select ci” and “risk factors relating to index futures and the bloomberg roll select ci—the roll selection methodology of the bloomberg roll select ci may not provide any benefits relative to the roll selection methodologies used by other commodities indices including the bloomberg ci and the bloomberg roll select ci may not outperform or may underperform the bloomberg ci” you may lose some or all of your investment in the shares        table of contents     commodity futures trading may be illiquid in addition suspensions or disruptions of market trading in the commodities markets and related futures markets may adversely affect the value of your shares   the commodity futures markets are subject to temporary distortions or other disruptions due to various factors including the lack of liquidity congestion disorderly markets manipulation limitations on deliverable supplies the participation of speculators government regulation and intervention technical and operational or system failures nuclear accidents terrorism riots and acts of god in addition us futures exchanges and some foreign exchanges have regulations that limit the amount of fluctuation in futures contract prices that may occur during a single business day these limits are generally referred to as “daily price fluctuation limits” and the maximum or minimum price of a contract on any given day as a result of these limits is referred to as a “limit price” once the limit price has been reached in a particular contract it is possible that no trades may be made at a different price it is not certain how long any such price limits would remain in effect limit prices may have the effect of precluding trading in a particular contract or forcing the liquidation of contracts at disadvantageous times or prices consequently affecting the value of the bloomberg roll select ci further the clearing fcm or its account holders may represent directly or indirectly a substantial portion of the shortside interest in the index futures market the existence of such a limited number of market participants could cause or exacerbate temporary distortions especially those distortions resulting from illiquidity   any of these circumstances could adversely affect the value of the index futures held by the trust and therefore the value of your shares in addition these circumstances could also limit trading in the index futures which could affect the calculation of the nav and the trading price of the shares accordingly these limits may result in a nav that differs and may differ significantly from the nav that would prevail in the absence of such limits if baskets are created or redeemed at a time when these price limits are in effect the creation or redemption price will reflect the price limits as well   in addition the method in which the bloomberg roll select ci is calculated or determined may also be affected by certain market disruptions such as  the termination or suspension of or material limitation or disruption in the trading of an underlying futures contract  the settlement price of an underlying futures contract reflecting the maximum permitted price change from the previous day’s settlement price for such contract such as in the case of a “limit event” as determined by the applicable futures exchange  the failure of an exchange to publish the official settlement price for an underlying futures contract or  for contracts trading on the london metals exchange any day on which the london metals exchange is not open for business for example if bloomberg determines that a market disruption exists with respect to any underlying futures contract in connection with that contract’s roll period including in connection with an annual rebalancing this would delay the effective rolling of that contract for purposes of determining the bloomberg roll select ci and in the case of a roll period other than in connection with an annual rebalancing would also increase the rate at which that contract effectively rolls when such market disruption has ended in addition the relative weights of the futures contracts underlying the bloomberg roll select ci may be affected by “limit events” occurring with respect to such contracts or due to the failure of an exchange to publish the official settlement price for a futures contract        table of contents     during a period when commodity prices are fairly stationary an absence of “backwardation” in the prices of the commodities included in the bloomberg roll select ci may cause the price of your shares to decrease   the futures contracts that underlie the bloomberg roll select ci are replaced from time to time with new futures contracts on the same commodities this process is referred to as “rolling” although the rolling methodology employed by the bloomberg roll select ci which selects for replacement contracts exhibiting the least contango or the greatest backwardation relative to its preceding contracts may on occasion cause futures contracts to be replaced by new futures contracts with earlier rather than later delivery months it is expected that the bloomberg roll select ci will still tend to roll into futures contracts with later delivery months than the contracts being replaced   historically the prices of some futures contracts generally those relating to commodities that are typically consumed immediately rather than stored have frequently been higher for contracts with shorterterm expirations than for contracts with longerterm expirations which is referred to as “backwardation” in these circumstances absent other factors the sale of the earlier contract would take place at a price that is higher than the price at which the later contract is purchased thereby allowing the contract holder to purchase a greater quantity of the later contract while some of the contracts included in the bloomberg roll select ci have historically exhibited periods of backwardation backwardation will likely not exist at all times moreover some of the commodities reflected in the bloomberg roll select ci have historically exhibited characteristics typical of “contango” markets rather than backwardation contango markets are those in which the prices of contracts are higher in the distant delivery months than in the nearer delivery months due to the costs of longterm storage of a physical commodity prior to delivery or other factors the forward price of a commodity futures contract may also fluctuate between backwardation and contango   although the bloomberg roll select ci attempts to mitigate some of the losses that may arise from the absence of backwardation or the existence of contango through its rolling process the absence of backwardation or the existence of contango in the commodity markets could nevertheless result in losses which could adversely affect the value of the bloomberg roll select ci and accordingly decrease the value of your shares moreover because the trust must pay certain ongoing fees and expenses the value of the shares may decrease even in periods where commodity prices are otherwise stationary     regulatory developments with respect to the futures and overthecounter derivatives markets and in particular with respect to speculative trading in futures contracts and overthecounter derivatives involving commodities and commodity indices could adversely affect the value of your shares   in recent years many bills have been introduced in the us congress targeting excessive speculation in commodities and commodity indices including by institutional “index funds” on regulated futures markets and in the overthecounter or “otc” derivatives markets many of these legislative proposals have not been enacted but could be in the future   in  congress adopted some antispeculative proposals in the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act or the “doddfrank act” these provisions of the doddfrank act have been interpreted by the cftc to require the cftc to expand its existing speculative position limits regime that is applicable to certain agricultural commodity futures and options thereon as appropriate to a wider range of listed futures and options on physical commodities including certain energy metals and agricultural products as well as to economically equivalent swaps while significantly narrowing the bona fide hedging exemptions to a narrower category of commercial market participants and physical hedging strategies   pursuant to the provisions of the doddfrank act described above the cftc proposed regulations in december  modifying an original november  proposal referred to in this prospectus as the “proposed position limits rules” that would impose new federal position limits on futures and options on certain energy metal and agricultural commodities and economically equivalent swaps collectively “referenced contracts” also in december  the cftc adopted final position aggregation requirements   the proposed position limits rules would include as referenced contracts a number of the futures contracts included in the bloomberg roll select ci and as of the date of this prospectus such contracts represent a substantial portion of the weight of the bloomberg roll select ci consequently if the proposed position limits rules are adopted as proposed the maximum positions that market participants can hold in the referenced contracts that underlie the bloomberg roll select ci may be limited which could reduce the liquidity of such referenced contracts and adversely affect the performance of the bloomberg roll select ci and the value of your shares moreover because the relative weights of the commodities in the bloomberg roll select ci are largely determined based on the trading volume of the futures contracts designated for such commodities a reduction in the trading volume of such futures contracts could significantly alter the weights of the futures contracts underlying the bloomberg roll select ci which could have further adverse effects on the level of the bloomberg roll select ci and the value of your shares the risks presented by the proposed position limits rules also arise with respect to existing federal limits on certain agriculturalcommodity futures contracts which include futures contracts underlying the bloomberg roll select ci        table of contents     the proposed position limits rules would also narrow the existing bona fide hedge exemption for referenced contracts if adopted as proposed this narrow definition may affect the hedging and investing activities of participants in the markets for the index futures and the futures contracts and commodities underlying the bloomberg roll select ci which in turn could reduce the liquidity and adversely affect the pricing of the index futures and such futures contracts and commodities any of these effects could increase volatility in and otherwise adversely affect the price of the shares the public comment period on the proposed position limits rules closed on february   the cftc had specifically solicited among other things comments on issues affecting position limits for physical commodity derivatives that could directly affect the value of the trust’s position in index futures going forward   with respect to the position aggregation rules adopted by the cftc in december  those final rules which became effective on february   expand the circumstances requiring persons to aggregate referenced contracts that are owned or controlled by such persons specifically the final aggregation rules require a person holding positions in multiple commodity pools with substantially identical trading strategies to aggregate the pools’ positions in referenced contracts on a prorata basis with other positions in referenced contracts held or controlled by such person although index futures are not among the referenced contracts identified in the proposed position limits rules if federal position limits are extended to index futures or if the exchange adopts similar aggregation rules some participants in the market for index futures may be encumbered in trying to hedge their exposure which could reduce liquidity in such index futures and the futures contracts and commodities underlying the bloomberg roll select ci and adversely affect the value of the shares   in addition to or in lieu of the proposed position limits rules the cftc could propose other rules that may lower the applicable position limits apply position limits to a broader range of contracts including commodity index contracts such as the index futures or further restrict position limit exemptions if any of these actions is taken such measures could further reduce the size of positions that the trust and other investors could hold directly in index futures and the underlying futures contracts and commodities with potential reductions in liquidity and adverse effects on the pricing of index futures see also “—the value of the shares depends on the value of index futures which fluctuates based on the prices of commodity futures contracts reflected in the bloomberg roll select ci these prices may be volatile thereby creating the potential for losses regardless of the length of time you intend to hold your shares”   certain other rules proposed pursuant to the doddfrank act also may have an impact on the trust and the value and continued availability of the shares on december   the cftc proposed rules referred to in this prospectus as the “dcm rules” that would require that at least  of the total volume of any contract listed on a “designated contract market” or “dcm” including the index futures be executed through the central order book rather than as a block transaction or other noncompetitively executed transaction contracts that do not meet the  threshold would be required to be delisted by the dcm and if a swap transferred to a swap execution facility or also be liquidated generally the trust’s transactions in index futures are expected to be executed through block or “exchange for related positions” or “efrp” transactions that are not executed through the applicable exchange’s central order book when the cftc finalized the dcm rules in june  the cftc noted that it needed additional time to consider the proposed requirements regarding the  threshold particularly in light of substantial comments received if ultimately adopted as proposed those proposed requirements could significantly and adversely affect the availability liquidity and price of index futures as well as futures contracts currently included or which may in the future be included in the bloomberg roll select ci and could inhibit the trust’s ability to redeem and offer shares which in turn could adversely affect the value and continued availability of the shares   the cftc has adopted rules regarding the risk management practices of clearing members referred to in this prospectus as the “fcm rules” most of which became effective on june   the fcm rules require the trust’s clearing fcm to establish and periodically reevaluate riskbased limits on position and order size amongst other measures the fcm rules may lead the trust’s clearing fcm to reduce its internal limits on the size of the index futures positions it will execute or clear for the trust reducing the trust’s and other market participants’ ability to transact in index futures and potentially adversely affecting the price of shares in the event that the clearing fcm does reduce its internal limits on the size of index futures positions the trust may deem it feasible to use additional clearing fcms if this happens it could substantially increase the costs of clearing for the trust        table of contents     other regulatory measures under the doddfrank act could increase the costs of the trust result in significant direct limitations on the maximum permitted size of the trust’s futures positions or affect liquidity in the market for the index futures or the underlying futures contracts as well as the correlation between the price of the shares and the net asset value of the trust any such measures could adversely affect the value of your shares   risk factors relating to index futures and the bloomberg roll select ci   the trading of various index futures presents risks unrelated to the bloomberg roll select ci that could adversely affect the value of your shares    although index futures are based on the bloomberg roll select ci the value of the index futures could be affected by factors that do not directly affect the bloomberg roll select ci and accordingly the value of the index futures and the level of the bloomberg roll select ci may vary from each other the activities of market participants in trading index futures or in trading other instruments related to the bloomberg roll select ci could affect the value of the index futures independent of any change in the bloomberg roll select ci and adversely affect the correlation between the value of the index futures and the level of the bloomberg roll select ci   the prices of the various index futures are expected to reflect supply and demand in the market for such index futures which in turn may reflect market expectations at any given time about prospective changes in the level of the bloomberg roll select ci and other market conditions in this way trading in the market for an index futures contract might cause a divergence between the price of such index futures contract and the level of the bloomberg roll select ci similarly actions by the applicable exchange with respect to index futures position such as the imposition of trading or price limits could adversely affect this correlation in these circumstances it is possible that changes in the nav which is calculated based on the value of the index futures will not adequately reflect changes in the level of the bloomberg roll select ci in the event of market disruptions with respect to the index futures such as a suspension of trading by the related exchange as a result of market activity systems or communications failures or other causes the value of the index futures and the level of the bloomberg roll select ci could diverge which could adversely affect the value of the shares   although arbitrage activity by market participants is expected to have the effect of reducing or mitigating divergence between the value of the index futures and the level of the bloomberg roll select ci such arbitrage activity may not fully offset any divergence at all times during which the shares are outstanding during any period the trust is trading index futures of more than one type differences in the settlement values of such index futures to the extent not offset by arbitrage activity between such index futures may limit the expected benefits of or otherwise adversely affect arbitrage activity between the shares and the index futures in the event that any such divergence between the value of the index futures and the level of the bloomberg roll select ci exists from time to time changes in the nav which is calculated based on the value of the index futures may not adequately reflect changes in the level of the bloomberg roll select ci which could adversely affect the value of the shares the impact of certain of these considerations may be heightened in cases where the trust’s positions are concentrated in a particular index futures contract or in cases where the trust represents a substantial portion of the open interest in a particular index futures contract   in addition other actions taken by an exchange including rule changes relating to clearing fees margin requirements or the minimum price fluctuations applicable to an index futures contract may result in economic tax or other consequences to market participants that trade or hold index futures such actions may result in consequences that adversely affect shareholders without necessarily affecting the correlation between the settlement price of the index futures and the level of the bloomberg roll select ci   the index and the bloomberg roll select ci have limited histories and may perform in unexpected ways   the index and the bloomberg roll select ci began publishing on july   and therefore have limited histories historical performance data is provided under “the index the bloomberg ci and the bloomberg roll select ci” including hypothetical performance data intended to illustrate how each of the index and the bloomberg roll select ci may have performed had it been created in the past but those calculations are subject to many limitations unlike actual historical performance such calculations do not reflect actual trading liquidity constraints fees and other costs in addition the models used to calculate these hypothetical returns are based on certain data assumptions and estimates different models or models using different data assumptions and estimates might result in materially different hypothetical performance        table of contents     the roll selection methodology of the bloomberg roll select ci may not provide any benefits relative to the roll selection methodologies used by other commodities indices including the bloomberg ci and the bloomberg roll select ci may not outperform or may underperform the bloomberg ci   as described further under “the index the bloomberg ci and the bloomberg roll select ci” the process through which the bloomberg roll select ci rolls contracts of one delivery month into contracts of a new delivery month differs from the process used by the bloomberg ci unlike the bloomberg ci which rolls into contracts of a predetermined delivery month the bloomberg roll select ci rolls into contracts that demonstrate the least contango or if applicable the most backwardation in each case relative to the contracts of the immediately preceding delivery month this determination is made on the “contract selection date” which is generally the fourth business day of every month   the price at which a futures contract of a specified delivery date is trading on a contract selection date is expected to reflect the market’s outlook with respect to the performance of a contract with the specified delivery date in certain circumstances the market outlook with respect to the underlying commodities may cause futures contracts of a particular delivery date to trade at higher or lower prices relative to futures contracts for the same underlying commodity with a different delivery date based upon expectations regarding the price on such delivery date these expectations may be based on factors that do not affect futures contracts of different delivery dates in the same way such as seasonal fluctuations based on supply and demand accordingly the price at which a futures contract trades relative to a futures contract with an immediately preceding delivery date may not necessarily be reflective of the effect of backwardation or contango that will be realized from rolling such futures contract it is possible that for a given time period the futures contracts selected for inclusion in the bloomberg roll select ci may not outperform and may underperform the futures contracts selected for inclusion in the bloomberg ci   the bloomberg roll select ci may in the future include contracts that are not traded on regulated futures exchanges and that offer different or diminished protections to investors   currently the bloomberg roll select ci is comprised exclusively of futures contracts traded on dcms or regulated futures exchanges the bloomberg roll select ci may in the future include contracts such as swaps and forward contracts traded in the overthecounter market or on tradin g facilities that are subject to lesser degrees of regulation or in some cases no substantive regulation as a result trading in such contracts and the manner in which prices and volumes are reported by the relevant trading facilities may not be subject to the same provisions of and the protections afforded by the cea or other applicable statutes and related regulations that govern trading on regulated futures exchanges in addition many electronic trading facilities have only recently initiated trading and do not have significant trading histories as a result the trading of contracts on such facilities and the inclusion of such contracts in the bloomberg roll select ci may be subject to risks not presented by most exchangetraded futures contracts including risks related to the liquidity and price histories of the relevant contracts   changes in the composition and valuation of the bloomberg roll select ci may adversely affect your shares   the composition of the bloomberg roll select ci may change over time as additional commodities satisfy the eligibility criteria or commodities currently included in the bloomberg roll select ci fail to satisfy those criteria the weighting factors applied to each commodity included in the bloomberg roll select ci change annually based on changes in commodity production statistics and changes in the trading volume of the related futures contracts in addition bloomberg as index administrator or the index committees may modify the method for determining the composition and weighting of the bloomberg roll select ci and for calculating its value such changes could adversely affect the value of your shares or otherwise affect the risks associated with owning the shares such as by increasing relative concentrations in particular commodities and causing the value of the shares to become more sensitive to fluctuations in the prices of those commodities for more information about the methodology for determining the composition and weighting of the bloomberg roll select ci see “the index the bloomberg ci and the bloomberg roll select ci”   a cessation of publication of the bloomberg roll select ci could materially and adversely affect the activities of the trust   the bloomberg roll select ci is administered calculated and published by the index administrator who may cease publication of the bloomberg roll select ci at any time including as a result of its removal by ubs securities if the bloomberg roll select ci ceases being published the sponsor may determine that no suitable replacement index exists and the trust may be liquidated        table of contents     futures contracts including the index futures are not assets with intrinsic value   trading in futures transfers the risk of future price movements from one market participant to another this means that for every gain there is an equal and offsetting loss futures contracts themselves including index futures are not assets with intrinsic value and simply reflect in the case of cashsettled contracts certain rights to payment or obligations to make payments to the other party to the contract and in the case of physicallysettled contracts such as the futures contracts underlying the index an agreement to make or take delivery of a particular asset at a specified price accordingly market participants taking the opposite side of the trust’s index futures trades may believe that the price of such index futures will move against the trust and the trust may be at an informational or other disadvantage relative to such market participants   the trust’s trading activity in index futures could expose it to additional risks   in order for the trust to achieve its investment objective on an ongoing basis it is anticipated that existing positions in index futures will need to be closed out and new positions in index futures will need to be established from time to time the trust may further close out of existing positions and establish new positions in index futures from time to time including new positions in earlier expiring index futures which may allow it to reduce its concentration in any particular index futures contract or to benefit from more liquid markets or otherwise beneficial market activity in index futures listed with different expirations or on different exchanges this activity is expected to cause the trust to incur transaction costs such as brokerage fees and commissions and may cause the shares to underperform the index in particular the prices obtained in connection with rolling index futures positions may be adversely affected by market conditions including the possibility of market disruptions and by the trading activities of other market participants which may reflect market awareness of the trust’s position in its index futures for example if other market participants are able to anticipate the timing of the trust’s transactions they may be able to execute transactions in advance of the trust which would allow these market participants to benefit from the transactions executed by the trust but adversely affect the prices obtained by the trust in addition if the trust’s index futures positions represent a significant part of the open long interest in such index futures other market participants may take this into account with a potential adverse impact on the prices at which the trust is able to execute such transactions there can be no assurance that the trust will be able to effect its transactions in a manner that will allow it to avoid these risks exchanges may cease to list other index futures that the trust will be able to roll its positions into and any index futures listed by an exchange in the future may have terms that differ from those currently held by the trust   the liquidation of index futures could expose the trust to the effects of temporary aberrations or distortions in the market which could adversely affect the prices at which the trust’s index futures positions are liquidated   if the trust liquidates positions in index futures in order to satisfy redemption requests or to pay expenses and liabilities it does so by entering sell orders with its clearing fcm for execution on the exchange the resulting sales serve to offset a portion of the trust’s long positions in index futures however in entering sell orders the trust is subject to the risk that temporary aberrations or distortions will occur in the market at the time these sales are effected and that the prices received by the trust on its sales could be adversely affected thereby adversely affecting the value of the shares such aberrations or distortions could occur as a result of trading activities by other market participants or actions taken by the clearing fcm an exchange other selfregulatory organizations or regulatory authorities including the liquidation of the trust’s index futures to satisfy applicable margin requirements if the trust’s index futures are liquidated at inopportune times or in a manner that causes a temporary market distortion this may adversely affect the nav and the value of your shares   the trusts clearing fcm or an exchange’s clearing house could fail   in the event of the bankruptcy of the clearing fcm or an exchange’s clearing house the trust could be exposed to a risk of loss with respect to its assets that are posted as margin if such a bankruptcy were to occur the trust would be afforded the protections granted to customers of a futures commission merchant or “fcm” and participants to transactions cleared through a clearing house under the united states bankruptcy code and applicable cftc regulations such provisions generally provide for a pro rata distribution to customers of customer property held by the bankrupt fcm or an exchange’s clearing house if the customer property held by the fcm or the exchange’s clearing house is insufficient to satisfy all customer claims in any case there can be no assurance that these protections will be effective in allowing the trust to recover all or even any of the amounts it has deposited as margin   bankruptcy of the clearing fcm can be caused by among other things the default of one of the clearing fcm’s customers in this event the exchange’s clearing house is permitted to use the entire amount of margin posted by the trust as well as margin posted by other customers of the clearing fcm to cover the amounts owed by the bankrupt clearing fcm consequently the trust could be unable to recover amounts due to it on its index futures positions including assets posted as margin and could sustain substantial losses even if the level of the bloomberg roll select ci increases        table of contents     on january   new regulations became effective relating to enhanced customer protections risk management programs internal monitoring and controls capital and liquidity standards customer disclosures and auditing and examination programs for fcms there can be no assurance that the implementation of these regulations will prevent losses to or not materially adversely affect the trust or the shareholders   recourse to the index providers may be limited   the bloomberg commodity indexes sm are a joint product of the

commodity futures including the index and the bloomberg roll select ci as well as swaps options and derivatives which are linked to the performance of such commodities commodity indexes and commodity futures it is possible that this trading activity will affect the value of the index the bloomberg roll select ci and the shares   risk factors relating to the trust   the trust has a limited operating history and as a result it may be more difficult for investors to analyze the trust’s performance history in evaluating an investment in the trust   the trust has limited performance history upon which to evaluate an investor’s investment in the trust although the trust invests in collateralized index futures positions on the bloomberg roll select ci such that it is expected that its performance will generally correlate with the index the trust’s limited past performance history may make it difficult for investors to evaluate how well the trust’s performance correlates with that of the index or whether the trust has outperformed or underperformed the index in the past although past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results more performance history could provide investors with more information with which to evaluate an investment in the trust likewise certain benchmarks such as the bloomberg roll select ci and the index themselves have a limited history a longer history for such benchmarks could provide investors with more information on which to evaluate an investment in the trust see “risk factors relating to index futures and the bloomberg roll select ci—the index and the bloomberg roll select ci have limited histories and may perform in unexpected ways”   the trust is an emerging growth company subject to reduced public company reporting requirements   the trust is an “emerging growth company” as defined in the jobs act the trust has not elected to make use of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards pursuant to section b of the jobs act which election is irrevocable however for so long as the trust remains an emerging growth company it will be subject to reduced public company reporting requirements among other things emerging growth companies are exempt from the auditor attestation requirements under section b of the sarbanesoxley act are exempt from certain “say on pay” provisions of the doddfrank act and are subject to reduced disclosure requirements relating to executive compensation and audited financial statements although the trust will remain subject to the disclosure requirements applicable to publicly traded commodity pools and the sponsor intends to have the trust’s financial statements and disclosures prepared in a manner comparable to that of other ishares ® exchangetraded funds the trust may take advantage of the exemptions and scaled requirements applicable to emerging growth companies        table of contents     the returns on the shares will not precisely correlate with the performance of the index   the value of and returns on the shares are expected to reflect the value of and returns on the trust’s underlying investments in index futures and the cash or other collateral assets used to collateralize the index futures positions the returns on the shares will not precisely correlate with the performance of the index due to among other factors differences between the return on the collateral assets and the us treasury rate used to calculate the us treasury return component of the index timing differences differences between the portion of the trust’s assets invested in index futures versus the portion of the return of the index contributed by the bloomberg roll select ci differences between the settlement price of index futures and the closing level of the bloomberg roll select ci and the payment of expenses and liabilities by the trust   the trust is a passive investment vehicle and the value of the shares may be adversely affected by losses that if it had been actively managed might have been possible to avoid   the advisor manages the trust’s assets in a manner that seeks to obtain returns that correspond generally but are not necessarily identical to the performance of the index before the payment of expenses and liabilities of the trust this means that the net asset value of the trust and consequently the nav are intended to generally track the index when it is flat or declining as well as when it is rising and therefore it is highly likely that the value of the shares will be adversely affected by a decline in commodity futures prices reflected in the index the advisor does not engage in any activities designed to obtain a profit from or to ameliorate losses caused by changes in the level of the index or the bloomberg roll select ci or the value of the collateral assets including making use of any of the hedging techniques available to professional commodity futures traders to attempt to reduce the risks of losses resulting from commodity price decreases   fees and expenses payable by the trust are charged regardless of profitability and may result in a depletion of its assets   the trust is subject to the fees and expenses described in this prospectus which are payable irrespective of profitability these fees and expenses include an allocation to

trust absent an amendment to the trust agreement in accordance with its terms and such an adjustment may only become effective thirty days after the trustee has notified the registered holders of the amendment   interest earned on the assets posted as collateral is paid to the trust and is used to pay the fixed fee to the sponsor a prolonged decline in interest rates could materially affect the amount of interest paid to the trust in the case of either an extraordinary expense andor insufficient interest income to cover ordinary expenses the trust could be forced to liquidate its index futures positions to pay such expenses   the trust’s ability to operate is dependent on the sponsor the trustee the advisor and certain other key service providers and other parties   the trust’s ability to operate and to achieve its investment objective is dependent on a number of parties including     • the sponsor who exercises general oversight and authority over the trust         • the

the trust is exposed to various operational risks including human error information technology failures and failure to comply with formal procedures intended to mitigate these risks and is particularly dependent on electronic means of communicating recordkeeping and otherwise conducting business in addition the trust generally exculpates and in some cases indemnifies its service providers and agents with respect to losses arising from unforeseen circumstances and events which may include the interruption suspension or restriction of trading on or the closure of nyse arca an exchange or an exchange on which the futures contracts underlying the index trade power or other mechanical or technological failures or interruptions computer viruses communications disruptions work stoppages natural disasters fire war terrorism riots rebellions or other circumstances beyond the control of the trust or its service providers and agents accordingly the trust generally bears the risk of loss with respect to these unforeseen circumstances and events to the extent relating to the trust or the shares which may limit or prevent the trust from generating returns corresponding to those of the index or otherwise expose it to loss   although it is generally expected that the trust’s direct service providers and agents will have disaster recovery or similar programs or safeguards in place to mitigate the effect of such unforeseen circumstances and events there can be no assurance that these safeguards are in place for all parties whose activities may affect the performance of the trust or that these safeguards even if implemented will be successful in preventing losses associated with such unforeseen circumstances and events nor can there be any assurance that the systems and applications on which the trust relies will continue to operate as intended in addition to potentially causing performance failures at or direct losses to the trust any such unforeseen circumstances and events or operational failures may further distract the service providers agents or personnel on which the trust relies reducing their ability to conduct the activities on which the trust is dependent these risks cannot be fully mitigated or prevented and further efforts or expenditures to do so may not be costeffective whether due to reduced benefits from implementing additional or redundant safeguards or due to increases in associated maintenance requirements and other expenses that may make it more costly for the trust to operate in more typical circumstances   the price you receive upon the sale of your shares may be less than their nav   shares may trade at above or below their nav the nav fluctuates with changes in the market value of the trust’s assets the trading price of shares fluctuates in accordance with changes in the nav intraday changes in the value of the index futures and market supply and demand the amount of the discount or premium in the trading price of the shares relative to their nav may be influenced by nonconcurrent trading hours between nyse arca the exchange on which the shares trade the exchanges on which index futures trade and the principal commodities markets on which the futures contracts in the bloomberg roll select ci trade while the shares are expected to trade on nyse arca until  pm new york time liquidity in the markets for the index futures and the futures contracts underlying the bloomberg roll select ci is expected to be reduced whenever the principal markets for those contracts are closed as a result trading spreads and the resulting premium or discount on shares may widen during these gaps in market trading hours        table of contents     the trust is not obligated to pay periodic distributions or dividends to shareholders   interest or other income received with respect to the trust’s assets may be used to acquire additional index futures or collateral assets or in the discretion of the sponsor distributed to the shareholders the trust is not obligated however to make any distributions to shareholders at any time prior to the dissolution of the trust and will not make any distributions to shareholders upon dissolution of the trust unless there are assets remaining following dissolution   the trust could be liquidated at a time when the disposition of its interests will result in losses to investors in shares   if at any time any of the events described under “description of the shares and the trust agreement—amendment and dissolution” occurs the sponsor the trustee or if applicable the shareholders may prompt the trust’s dissolution upon dissolution of the trust the trust will in most circumstances sell the index futures and securities held by it in the amount necessary to cover all expenses of liquidation and to pay any outstanding liabilities of the trust the remaining assets will be distributed among investors surrendering shares in the event the trustee cannot distribute such assets proportionately among the shareholders entitled thereto or if the trustee determines that such distribution is not lawful or feasible the trustee may use any other method of distribution that it deems to be lawful equitable and feasible including the public or private sale of trust assets and the distribution of the proceeds thereof any property remaining in the possession of the trustee after ninety days may be sold by the trustee and the proceeds of the sale will be held by the trustee until claimed by any remaining shareholders   in connection with any such liquidation trust property may be sold for prices that are less than the portion of the nav attributable to such trust property accordingly the liquidation of trust property may result in losses or adversely affect your gains on your investment in shares   the sponsor has broad discretion to liquidate the trust at any time   the trust agreement provides the sponsor with broad discretion to liquidate the trust at any time the sponsor determines that liquidation of the trust is advisable it cannot be predicted when or under what circumstances if any the sponsor would use this discretion to liquidate the trust any such liquidation may occur at a time when you are suffering a loss on your investment in the shares and may upset the overall maturity and timing of your investment portfolio   shareholders with large holdings may choose to dissolve the trust and thereby adversely affect your investment in the shares   owners of  or more of the shares have the power to dissolve the trust this power may be exercised by a relatively small number of holders if it is so exercised investors who wished to continue to invest in the performance of the index through the vehicle of the trust will have to find another vehicle and may not be able to find another vehicle that offers the same features as the trust moreover such a dissolution may occur at a time when you are suffering a loss on your investment in the shares and may upset the overall maturity and timing of your investment portfolio   the shares may not provide anticipated benefits of diversification from other asset classes   historically the performance of physical commodity futures prices generally has not been correlated to the performance of financial asset classes such as stocks and bonds noncorrelation means that there is no statistically significant relationship positive or negative between the past performance of futures contracts on physical commodities on the one hand and stocks or bonds on the other hand despite this lack of correlation shares cannot be expected to be automatically profitable during unfavorable periods for the stock or bond markets or automatically unprofitable during favorable periods for the stock or bond markets the commodity futures markets are fundamentally different from the securities markets in that for every gain in commodity futures trading there is an equal and offsetting loss the performance of the shares may reflect positive or negative correlation to one or more financial asset classes in which case any investment strategy relying on the absence of any such correlation may not be successful   the liquidity of the shares may be affected by the withdrawal from participation of authorized participants or by the suspension of issuance transfers or redemptions of shares by the trustee    if one or more authorized participants withdraw from participation it may become more difficult to create or redeem baskets which may reduce the liquidity of the shares if it becomes more difficult to create or redeem baskets the correlation between the price of the shares and the nav may be affected which may affect the trading market for the  shares having fewer participants in the market for the shares could also adversely affect the ability to arbitrage any price difference between the index futures and the shares which may affect the trading market and liquidity of the shares        table of contents     in addition the trustee has the power to suspend the delivery of shares registration of transfers of shares and surrenders of shares for the purpose of withdrawing trust property generally or to refuse a particular deposit transfer or withdrawal at any time if the trustee or the sponsor determines that it is advisable to do so for any reason the liquidity of the shares and the correlation between the value of the shares and the level of the index may be adversely affected in the event of any such suspension of issuance transfer or redemption   the lack of an active trading market for the shares may result in losses on your investment at the time of disposition of your shares   although the shares are listed on nyse arca there can be no guarantee that an active trading market for the shares will develop or be maintained if you need to sell your shares at a time when no active market for them exists the price you receive for your shares assuming that you are able to sell them will likely be lower than that you would receive if an active market did exist   you may be adversely affected by redemption orders that are subject to postponement suspension or rejection under certain circumstances   the trustee may suspend the right of redemption or postpone the redemption settlement date for such periods as it or the sponsor deems to be necessary for any reason in addition the trustee has the right to reject any redemption order for any reason including among others  the related order not being in proper form as described in the authorized participant agreement  market conditions or other circumstances that make transactions in or delivery of the shares or the index futures impossible or impractical  a determination by the trustee that the acceptance of the related order would have adverse tax or other consequences to the trust or the shareholders or  circumstances that would cause the acceptance of the related order to result in a violation of law in the opinion of counsel to the trustee the sponsor or the trust administrator any such postponement suspension or rejection could adversely affect a redeeming authorized participant for example the resulting delay may adversely affect the value of the redemption proceeds if the nav declines during the period of the delay under the authorized participant agreement the trustee disclaims any liability that may result from any such suspension postponement or rejection   competition from other commoditiesrelated investments could limit the market for and reduce the liquidity of the shares   demand for the shares is expected to be affected by the attractiveness of an investment in the shares relative to other investment vehicles including other commodity pools hedge funds traditional debt and equity securities issued by companies in the commodities industry other securities backed by or linked to commodities and direct investments in commodities or commodity futures contracts market financial and other conditions or factors may make it more attractive to invest in other investment vehicles or to invest in such commodities directly which could limit the market for and reduce the liquidity of the shares   the price of the shares could decrease if unanticipated operational or trading problems arise   if the processes of creation and redemption of shares encounter any unanticipated difficulties potential market participants who would otherwise be willing to purchase or redeem baskets to take advantage of any arbitrage opportunity arising from discrepancies between the price of the shares and the price of the underlying index futures may choose not to do so if this is the case the price of the shares may vary from the price of an equivalent position in index futures and may trade at a discount to their nav in addition in some circumstances such as the failure of the registration statement covering the shares to be effective the trust may be unable to create or redeem shares which may have similar consequences   exchange position limits and other rules may restrict the creation of baskets and the operation of the trust   cbot imposes speculative position limits on market participants trading in index futures including the trust that typically prohibit any person from holding a position of more than  contracts the trust may from time to time seek to obtain exemptions from those position limits from cbot but these exemptions may be limited including with respect to the additional number of contracts permitted to be held under such exemption and the time period for which the exemption applies position limits may also apply to other index futures traded by the trust  the availability of obtaining any exemption from any such position limits is expected to be subject to the ability or willingness of the applicable exchange to grant such exemption as well as applicable law        table of contents       the trust’s ability to issue new baskets or reinvest income in additional index futures may be limited to the extent these activities would cause the trust to exceed the position limits then applicable to those index futures the trust may also be required to liquidate any existing contracts in excess of the thenapplicable position limits including as a result of changes to applicable position limits or as a result of the loss of an exemption or be required to take other actions with potentially adverse effects on the liquidity or value of the shares   additionally legislative or regulatory action actions by a dcm or actions by the clearing fcm may impose limitations on the size of positions that the trust may take in index futures andor impose limitations on the size of positions that may be carried by other market participants adversely affecting the liquidity and price of index futures and the underlying futures such events could force the trust or other market participants to sell index futures or encourage market participants to sell or redeem their shares the cftc has proposed that any risk management exemptions granted by dcms such as any exemption that may be applicable to the trust’s positions in index futures can only be granted pursuant to rules which have been reviewed by the cftc as a result if the proposed position limits rules are adopted as proposed the current maximum position in index futures permitted to be held by the trust could be reduced relative to the maximum position otherwise permitted which could in turn require the trust to liquidate some or all of its positions in index futures any such reduction could affect the liquidity of index futures and adversely impact the price of the shares as well as the correlation between the price of the shares and the net asset value of the trust   dcms may also take steps such as requiring liquidation of open positions in the case of disorderly markets market congestion and other market disruptions these actions could require the trust to liquidate all or part of its index futures positions or require holders of positions in the futures contracts underlying the bloomberg roll select ci to liquidate their positions this could affect the level of the index and the nav see also “risk factors relating to commodities markets—regulatory developments with respect to the futures and overthecounter derivatives markets and in particular with respect to speculative trading in futures contracts and overthecounter derivatives involving commodities and commodity indices could adversely affect the value of your shares”   shareholders do not have the rights normally associated with ownership of common shares the sponsor and the trustee exercise substantial control over the trust   shareholders are not entitled to the same rights as owners of shares issued by a corporation by acquiring shares you are not acquiring the right to elect directors to receive dividends to vote on certain matters regarding the trust or to take other actions normally associated with the ownership of common shares   additionally as described under “business of the trust” and “description of the shares and the trust agreement” the sponsor and the trustee exercise substantial control over the trust’s activities among other things the trust agreement authorizes the sponsor to determine whether to make distributions to shareholders gives the sponsor oversight over nav calculations and the creation and redemption process and permits the sponsor to dissolve the trust if it deems such dissolution advisable the trustee also retains the right to reject any order for the creation or redemption of baskets the sponsor and the trustee may amend the provisions of the trust agreement including in a manner adverse to shareholders without shareholder consent including to change the assets through which the trust seeks to achieve its investment objective which may alter the nature of an investment in and the performance of the shares   the trust agreement provides that in the case of a conflict of interest between the trustee the sponsor and their affiliates on the one hand and the holders of shares on the other the trustee and the sponsor will resolve such conflict considering the relevant interests of each party including their own interests and related benefits and burdens any customary or accepted industry practices and any applicable generally accepted accounting practices or principles the trust agreement further provides that in the absence of bad faith by the trustee or the sponsor such a resolution will not constitute a breach of the trust agreement or any duty or obligation of the trustee or the sponsor   shareholders do not have the protections normally associated with the ownership of shares in an investment company registered under the investment company act   the trust is not registered as an investment company for purposes of united states federal securities laws and is not subject to regulation by the sec as an investment company consequently shareholders do not have the regulatory protections provided to investors in investment companies registered under the investment company act for example the provisions of the investment company act that limit transactions with affiliates prohibit the suspension of redemptions except under limited circumstances and limit sales loads do not apply to the trust ishares ® delaware trust sponsor llc as the sponsor is registered with the cftc as a commodity pool operator and blackrock fund advisors as the advisor is registered with the cftc as a commodity trading advisor the cftc therefore has jurisdiction over these entities and regulatory authority over certain activities of the trust the nature and degree of this regulation differs from the regulatory scheme imposed under the investment company act        table of contents     competing claims over ownership of relevant intellectual property rights could adversely affect the trust or an investment in the shares    while the sponsor believes that it has all of the intellectual property rights needed to operate the trust in the manner described in this prospectus third parties may allege or assert ownership of intellectual property rights that may be related to the design structure and operation of the trust or the index to the extent any claims of such ownership are brought or any proceedings are instituted to assert such claims the negotiation litigation or settlement of such claims the issuance of any restraining orders or injunctions or the ultimate disposition of such claims in a court of law may adversely affect the trust and the value of the shares for example such actions could result in expenses or damages payable by the trust or the suspension of activities or dissolution of the trust   the value of the shares will be adversely affected if the trust is required to indemnify the sponsor the advisor or the trustee or their respective agents   under the trust agreement the sponsor the trustee and their respective agents have the right to be indemnified by the trust for any liability or expense they incur without negligence bad faith willful misconduct or reckless disregard of their duties on their part that means the sponsor and the trustee may require the assets of the trust to be sold in order to cover losses or liabilities suffered by it which would reduce the net asset value of the trust and the value of the shares   likewise under the advisory agreement the advisor and its agents have the right to be indemnified by the trust for any liability or expense they incur without negligence bad faith willful misconduct or reckless disregard of their duties on their part that means the advisor may require the assets of the trust to be sold in order to cover losses or liabilities suffered by it which would reduce the net asset value of the trust and the value of the shares   regulatory changes or actions may affect the shares   the futures markets are subject to comprehensive regulation in addition the cftc and the exchanges are authorized to take extraordinary actions in the event of a market emergency including for example implementing speculative position limits including retroactively or higher margin requirements establishing daily price limits and suspending trading the regulation of futures transactions in the united states is subject to modification by government exchange and judicial action the effect of any future regulatory change on the trust could be substantial and adverse see also “—exchange position limits and other rules may restrict the creation of baskets and the operation of the trust” above and “risk factors relating to commodities markets— regulatory developments with respect to the futures and overthecounter derivatives markets and in particular with respect to speculative trading in futures contracts and overthecounter derivatives involving commodities and commodity indices could adversely affect the

trading in the shares may be halted due to market conditions or in light of nyse arca rules and procedures for reasons that in the view of nyse arca make trading in the shares inadvisable or in the event certain information about the index the value of the shares and the nav is not made available as required by such rules and procedures in addition trading generally on nyse arca is subject to trading halts caused by extraordinary market volatility pursuant to “circuit breaker” rules that require trading to be halted for a specified period based on a specified market decline there can be no assurance that the requirements necessary to maintain the listing of the shares will continue to be met or will remain unchanged the trust will be dissolved if the shares are delisted from nyse arca and are not approved for listing on another national securities exchange within five business days of their delisting        table of contents     risk factors relating to conflicts of interest   the sponsor’s relationship with the trustee and the advisor and the proprietary and managed trading activities of the sponsor and its affiliates could conflict with your interests as a shareholder   the sponsor is an affiliate of the trustee and therefore may have a conflict of interest with respect to its oversight of the trustee in particular the sponsor which has authority to remove the trustee in its discretion has an incentive not to exercise this authority even when it is in the best interests of the shareholders to do so because of the affiliation between the entities the trustee is authorized to appoint an unaffiliated trust administrator or other agent to carry out all or some of its duties under the trust agreement but is not required to delegate any of its duties to an unaffiliated third party   the sponsor is an affiliate of the advisor and therefore may have a similar conflict of interest with respect to its oversight of the advisor for example although the sponsor has the authority to terminate the trust’s advisory agreement with the advisor it has an incentive not to exercise this authority even when it is in the best interests of the shareholders to do so because of the affiliation between the entities   as described elsewhere in this prospectus in return for paying certain amounts that would otherwise be considered ordinary operating expenses of the trust the sponsor receives an allocation from the trust that accrues daily at an annualized rate of up to  of the adjusted net asset value of the trust is payable monthly in arrears and is subject to adjustment from time to time except that the sponsor’s fee may not be adjusted to above  of the adjusted net asset value absent an amendment to the trust agreement and thirty days’ prior notice to registered holders of the shares the allocation received by the sponsor from the trust may be higher than the amount the trust would negotiate with an unaffiliated third party manager on an armslength basis   in addition the sponsor and its affiliates including the trustee and the advisor collectively exercise substantial control over the trust to the extent the interests of the sponsor and its affiliates conflict with those of the trust and the shareholders the risks associated with such conflicts may be greater than they would otherwise be for a party that cannot exercise such control over the trust the trust agreement provides that in the case of a conflict of interest between the trustee the sponsor and their affiliates on the one hand and the holders of shares on the other the trustee and the sponsor will resolve such conflict considering the relevant interests of each party including their own interests and related benefits and burdens any customary or accepted industry practices and any applicable generally accepted accounting practices or principles the trust agreement further provides that in the absence of bad faith by the trustee or the sponsor such a resolution will not constitute a breach of the trust agreement or any duty or obligation of the trustee or the sponsor   the sponsor and its affiliates may also engage in trading activities relating to the index futures the components of the index or the bloomberg roll select ci or other derivative instruments related to those indices that are not for the account of or on behalf of the trust or the shareholders and that may compete with trading activity in the shares these activities may present a conflict between the shareholders’ interest in the shares and the interest of the sponsor and its affiliates in their proprietary accounts in facilitating transactions including derivatives transactions for their customers’ accounts and in accounts under their management these trading activities could be adverse to the interests of the shareholders moreover the sponsor and its affiliates have published and in the future expect to publish research reports with respect to commodities markets this research may express opinions or provide recommendations that are inconsistent with purchasing or holding shares the research should not be viewed as a recommendation or endorsement of the shares in any way and investors must make their own independent investigation of the merits of this investment any of these activities by the sponsor and its affiliates may affect the level of the bloomberg roll select ci or its components and therefore the value of the index futures and the price of the shares   proprietary trading and other activities by ubs securities and its affiliates could conflict with your interests as a shareholder   activities conducted by ubs securities and its affiliates may conflict with your interests as a shareholder for example the advisor may execute a substantial amount and potentially all of the purchases and sales of index futures through ubs securities as the trust’s clearing fcm in addition it is expected that ubs securities or its accountholders will represent directly or indirectly a substantial portion of the shortside market for the index futures further ubs securities and its affiliates actively trade futures contracts and options on futures contracts on the commodities that underlie the index overthecounter contracts on these commodities the underlying commodities included in the index and other instruments and derivative products based on the index the bloomberg roll select ci and the bloomberg ci any of these activities of ubs securities or its affiliates could adversely affect the level of the index or the index futures directly or indirectly by affecting the price of the underlying commodities and therefore the value of the index the index futures and the price of the shares        table of contents     in addition ubs securities is one of the index providers and although bloomberg calculates the index on behalf of ubs securities ubs securities retains ownership of the index the bloomberg ci and the bloomberg roll select ci and retains the right to dismiss the index administrator from its duties relating to such indices and may influence the index administrator with respect to the performance of its duties relating to such indices to the extent ubs securities’ interests conflict with those of the trust and the shareholders the risks associated with such conflicts may be greater than they would otherwise be for a party that cannot exercise control over the index the bloomberg ci and the bloomberg roll select ci according to ubs securities ubs securities has implemented a firewall with respect to its personnel regarding access to information concerning the composition andor changes to the index see “—proprietary trading and other activities by the index providers and their respective affiliates could conflict with your interests as a shareholder”   ubs securities and its affiliates may also issue or underwrite other securities or financial or derivative instruments with returns indexed to the index the bloomberg ci or the bloomberg roll select ci which would compete with the shares by introducing competing products into the marketplace ubs securities and its affiliates could adversely affect the price of the shares to the extent that ubs securities or its affiliates serve as issuer agent or underwriter of those securities or other similar instruments their interests with respect to those products may be adverse to your interests as a shareholder in addition ubs securities is an authorized participant and was the initial purchaser of the shares while as noted above it is expected to represent directly or indirectly a substantial portion of the shortside market for the index futures and could therefore benefit from the adverse performance of the index futures which would be adverse to the price of the shares   proprietary trading and other activities by the index providers and their respective affiliates could conflict with your interests as a shareholder   activities conducted by the index providers and their respective affiliates may conflict with your interests as a shareholder for example one or more of the index providers or their respective affiliates may also engage in trading in the index the bloomberg ci the bloomberg roll select ci related indices and subindices and other investments relating to such indices or their underlying components on a regular basis as part of its general business for proprietary accounts for other accounts under management to facilitate transactions for customers or to hedge obligations under products linked to such indices one or more of the index providers or their respective affiliates may also issue or underwrite securities or financial or derivative instruments with returns linked or related to changes in the performance of any of the foregoing any of these activities could adversely affect the market price of the commodities or futures contracts underlying such indices or the value of the indices themselves which may adversely affect the value of the shares according to ubs securities ubs securities has implemented a firewall with respect to its personnel regarding access to information concerning the composition andor changes to the index it is possible that one or more of the index providers or their respective affiliates could receive substantial returns from these hedging activities while the market value of the underlying commodities or futures contracts the value of the indices or the price or the nav of the shares decline some or all of these risks may be further exacerbated as a result of various other roles of the index providers or their affiliates relating to the trust the shares or the index futures   risk factors relating to taxes   please refer to “united states federal income tax consequences” for information on the potential us federal income tax consequences of the purchase ownership and disposition of the shares   your tax liability could exceed cash distributions on your shares   you will be required to pay us federal income taxes on your allocable share of the trust’s income without regard to the receipt of cash distributions on the shares there is no obligation to make distributions on the shares accordingly it is anticipated that you will not receive cash distributions sufficient to cover your allocable share of such taxable income or even the tax liability resulting from that income        table of contents     the irs could adjust or reallocate items of income gain deduction loss and credit with respect to the shares if the irs does not accept the assumptions or conventions utilized by the trust   the us tax rules that apply to partnerships are complex and their application is not always clear moreover the rules generally were not written for and in some respects are difficult to apply to publicly traded interests in partnerships in addition the trust will report tax information to you on internal revenue service or “irs” schedule k with respect to the shares the trustee shall deliver or cause to be delivered to each shareholder an irs schedule k as soon as practicable following each fiscal year but generally not later than march  reporting on irs schedule k may be somewhat more complex than comparable reporting on irs form  each shareholder by its acquisition of shares will be deemed to agree to allow brokers and nominees to provide to the trust its name and address and the other information and forms as may be reasonably requested by the trust for purposes of complying with their tax reporting and withholding obligations and to waive any confidentiality rights with respect to the information and forms for this purpose and to provide information or forms upon request   investors in the shares should consult their tax advisors in determining how to use the information reported on irs schedule k to complete their income tax returns the trust will apply certain assumptions and conventions intended to comply with the intent of the rules and to report income gain deduction loss and credit to investors in a manner that reflects the investors’ economic gains and losses but these assumptions and conventions may not comply with all aspects of the applicable treasury regulations it is possible therefore that the irs will successfully assert that these assumptions or conventions do not satisfy the technical requirements of the united states internal revenue code of  as amended or the “code” or the treasury regulations and will require that items of income gain deduction loss and credit be adjusted or reallocated in a manner that could be adverse to you   if the trust were to fail to qualify as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes the trust’s income and items of deduction would not pass through to the shareholders the trust would be required to pay tax at corporate rates on any portion of the trust’s net income that does not constitute taxexempt income and distributions by the trust to the trust’s shareholders would be taxable dividends to the extent of the trust’s earnings and profits   it is expected that the trust will operate and be classified as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes so long as the trust qualifies as a partnership it will be able to pass through its income including the trust’s federally taxexempt income if any and deductions to the shareholders the trust’s qualification as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes involves the application of numerous technical provisions under which there is a lack of direct authority in general if a partnership is “publicly traded” as defined in the code it will be treated as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes it is expected that the trust will be treated as a publicly traded partnership a publicly traded partnership will however be taxed as a partnership and not as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes so long as  or more of its gross income for each taxable year constitutes “qualifying income” within the meaning of section d of the code and the partnership is not required to register under the investment company act this exception is referred to as the “qualifying income exception” qualifying income generally includes interest other than certain contingent interest and interest derived in the conduct of a financial or insurance business dividends real property rents and income from certain commodities transactions   if less than  of the trust’s gross income for any tax year constitutes qualifying income for any reason other than a failure that is determined to be inadvertent and that is cured within a reasonable time after discovery or if the trust is required to register under the investment company act the trust’s items of income and deduction would not pass through to the trust’s shareholders and the trust’s shareholders would be treated for us federal income tax purposes as stockholders in a corporation the trust would be required to pay income tax at corporate rates on its net taxable income distributions by the trust to its shareholders would constitute dividend income taxable to such holders to the extent of the trust’s earnings and profits and the payment of these distributions would not be deductible by the trust these consequences could have a material adverse effect on the trust its shareholders and the value of the shares        table of contents     if the irs makes audit adjustments to the trusts income tax returns for tax years beginning after  it may collect any resulting taxes including any applicable penalties and interest directly from the trust in which case the cash available for the distribution to the trusts shareholders might be substantially reduced   pursuant to the bipartisan budget act of  significant changes are being made to the rules applicable to us federal income tax audits of partnerships under the new rules which are generally effective for the trust’s taxable years beginning after december   if the irs makes audit adjustments to the trusts us federal income tax returns it may collect any resulting taxes including any applicable penalties and interest directly from the trust the trust may have the ability to shift any such tax liability to the sponsor and the trusts shareholders in accordance with their interests in the trust during the year under audit but there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so in which case the current shareholders would economically bear the burden of the tax even if they were not shareholders during the year under audit or if they had a different percentage interest in the trust in that year if the trust is required to make payments of taxes penalties and interest resulting from audit adjustments the cash available for distribution to the trusts shareholders might be substantially reduced the changes created by the new partnership audit rules are sweeping and in many respects dependent on the promulgation of future regulations or other guidance by the irs or the us treasury department investors in the shares are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding these changes and their potential impact     new tax legislation or changes to the existing us and foreign tax laws treaties and regulations may negatively affect the trust   the trust may be directly or indirectly affected by new tax legislation and regulations or the modification of existing tax laws by us or nonus authorities in particular a number of proposals for broad reform of the business tax system in the united states are under evaluation by various legislative and administrative bodies but it is not possible to determine accurately the overall impact of such proposals at this time the trust’s specific tax status and tax positions could be adversely impacted by changes in tax law or policy        table of contents     forwardlooking statements   this

consist of index futures and cash or in the discretion of the sponsor other collateral assets these proceeds are held by the trust and are retained invested in collateral assets or liquidated in order to rebalance or establish new positions in index futures or collateral assets until  withdrawn in connection with redemptions of baskets or  liquidated to pay expenses and liabilities of the trust including applicable fees and margin payments not assumed by the sponsor see “business of the trust—trust expenses” starting on page    collateral assets with a value equal to approximately  to  of the value of each index futures position are deposited with the clearing fcm as initial margin at the time such index futures position is established these margin deposits are expected to be maintained in accordance with cftc rules which require the segregation of customer funds from those of the clearing fcm the remainder and any variation margin received are retained in the trust’s accounts until transferred in connection with making variation margin payments a basket redemption or the liquidation of an index futures position   any remaining assets of the trust that are not required to meet current margin requirements may be  held in cash in noninterestbearing bank accounts to remain available to pay the expenses of the trust and to serve as reserves in the amounts deemed necessary by the advisor or  deposited with the trust administrator and invested in us treasury securities and other collateral assets all interest income earned on the trust’s investments will be retained for the benefit of the trust the advisor expects that all entities that will hold or trade the trust’s assets will be based in the us and subject to us regulations        table of contents     futures contracts on the bloomberg roll select ci   the assets of the trust consist of index futures and cash or other collateral assets used to satisfy applicable margin requirements for those index futures positions index futures are exchangetraded index futures contracts on the bloomberg roll select ci and may include contracts of different terms and expirations the trust is expected to roll out of existing positions in index futures and establish new positions in index futures on an ongoing basis index futures subsequently acquired by the trust may have terms that differ from those of the index futures it currently holds including transaction fees associated with the purchase and sale of these index futures   creation and redemption of interests in the trust are generally effected through efrps efrps involve contemporaneous transactions in futures contracts and the underlying cash commodity or a closely related commodity in a typical efrp the participant taking the long position on the futures contract transfers the underlying commodity or other related position to the participant taking the short position on the futures contract the exchange on which index futures trade permits the execution of efrps consisting of simultaneous transfers of index futures and shares this mechanism generally is expected to be used by the trust in connection with the creation and redemption of baskets   specifically it is anticipated that an authorized participant requesting the creation of additional baskets typically will transfer index futures and cash or in the discretion of the sponsor other collateral assets to the trust in return for shares if an efrp is executed in connection with the redemption of one or more baskets an authorized participant transfers to the trust the shares being redeemed and the trust transfers to the authorized participant index futures and cash or other collateral assets the trust may include index futures with different terms and expirations in the creation and redemption of baskets and the index futures included in creation baskets may differ from those included in redemption baskets   with the approval of the sponsor baskets may also be created or redeemed for cash in which case the authorized participant will be responsible for the costs incurred by the trust in establishing or liquidating the corresponding index futures position and acquiring or disposing of the related collateral assets   due to the limited trading history of the index futures on the bloomberg roll select ci as of the date of this prospectus there is insufficient data available to determine whether the market for such index futures have themselves generally exhibited contango or backwardation however the term

bloomberg ci that incorporates the economic effect of an alternative rolling methodology as described in more detail below the bloomberg ci itself forms the base commodities index from which the bloomberg roll select ci and the index are derived set forth below is a description of the how the bloomberg ci is determined and calculated a description of how the bloomberg roll select ci is derived from the bloomberg ci and finally a description of how the index is derived from the bloomberg roll select ci   the bloomberg ci   the bloomberg ci from which the bloomberg roll select ci is based was created by aig international inc in  and acquired by ubs securities in may  at which time ubs securities and dow jones trademark holdings llc entered into a joint marketing agreement to market the dow jonesubs commodity index and related indexes dow jones trademark holdings llc subsequently assigned its interest in the joint marketing agreement to dji opco llc in  the joint marketing agreement was terminated and ubs entered into a commodity index license agreement with bloomberg under the commodity index license agreement bloomberg on behalf of ubs securities calculates the bloomberg ci and related indices and subindices including the index and the bloomberg roll select ci   the bloomberg ci is a benchmark index composed of futures contracts on physical commodities the selection and weighting of which are generally determined based on a lagging fiveyear average of the trading volume adjusted by the historic us dollar value of the futures contract being considered for inclusion in the index and a lagging fiveyear average of production figures adjusted by the historic us dollar value of the related futures contracts for the underlying commodities the  commodities currently eligible for inclusion in the bloomberg ci are   aluminum uls diesel soybeans cocoa lead soybean meal coffee lean hogs soybean oil copper live cattle sugar corn natural gas tin cotton nickel rbob gasoline crude oil platinum wheat gold silver zinc   there are  commodities currently represented in the bloomberg ci cocoa lead platinum and tin are the four eligible commodities which are not currently represented in the bloomberg ci for each of the  included commodities specified futures contracts with specified delivery dates are designated for inclusion in the bloomberg ci the bloomberg ci is reweighted and rebalanced annually on a pricepercentage basis to reflect changes in trading volume and production figures the selection and weighting of the bloomberg ci’s constituents and its index methodology is intended to reflect the following four main principles        table of contents     economic significance in order to achieve a fair representation of the relative importance of a diversified group of commodities to the world economy the bloomberg ci uses both liquidity data and us dollarweighted production data in determining the relative quantities of included commodities that are reflected in the calculation of the bloomberg ci liquidity data reflects the amount of trading volume in the futures contracts on a commodity as a measure of the economic significance of that commodity which is particularly relevant for storable commodities such as gold the production figures for which do not reflect their economic importance relative to relatively nonstorable commodities such as live cattle   diversification in order to avoid disproportionate weighting of any particular commodity or sector the bloomberg ci tries to provide diversified exposure to commodities as an asset class by applying both minimum and maximum weights to component commodities and sectors as described under “—determination of bloomberg ci index constituents”   continuity in order to be responsive to the changing nature of commodity markets without completely reshaping the character of the bloomberg ci from year to year the bloomberg ci seeks a balanced approach to provide a stable benchmark over time through a combination of annual rebalancing fiveyear averaging of liquidity and production data diversification rules for constituent commodities and other index features   liquidity in order to provide a more liquid index the bloomberg ci explicitly includes the liquidity of the underlying commodity futures contracts as a weighting factor   for additional detail regarding the bloomberg ci’s current method of selecting constituents and calculation of the bloomberg ci itself see “—determination of bloomberg ci index constituents” and “—calculation of the bloomberg ci”   the bloomberg ci reflects the increased or decreased return associated with “rolling” futures contracts because futures contracts have scheduled expirations or delivery months and as one contract nears expiration it becomes necessary to close out the position in that delivery month and establish a position in a later available delivery month this process is referred to as “rolling” the position forward “rolls” are traditionally accomplished by selling the position in the closest delivery month and purchasing a position of equivalent value in a later applicable delivery month markets for futures contracts can be in “backwardation” which means that futures contracts with distant delivery months are priced lower than those with nearer delivery months or can exhibit “contango” which means that futures contracts with distant delivery months are priced higher than those with nearer delivery months   as part of this roll process the weights applied to expiring futures contracts are reduced while correspondingly the weights applied to the futures contracts that are replacing expiring futures contracts are increased this roll simulation is generally conducted at the beginning of each month over the course of five business days lasting from the sixth business day until the tenth business day of each month the bloomberg ci conducts its roll simulations each month by rolling out of the designated futures contracts expiring in that month and rolling into those designated futures contracts with the next closest designated delivery month currently the designated contracts and related designated delivery months for each of the eligible constituent commodities of the bloomberg ci or its subindices are as follows        table of contents

currently components of the bloomberg ci  these commodities are currently not eligible to be components of the bloomberg ci but are used in various subindices   the bloomberg roll select ci   the index futures in which the trust is investing are based on the bloomberg roll select ci the bloomberg roll select ci is a version of the bloomberg ci that tries to mitigate the effects of contango arising from the rolling process rather than incorporating the economic effect of rolling into the frontmonth futures contracts the bloomberg roll select ci incorporates the economic effect of rolling into applicable futures contracts that exhibit the least contango or if applicable the most backwardation in each case relative to the contracts of the immediately preceding delivery month   the bloomberg roll select ci implements its rolling methodology by selecting from the eligible contracts for each commodity on its applicable contract selection date the contract that exhibits the greatest amount of backwardation or least amount of contango on an annualized basis relative to the contract with the immediately preceding delivery date on the same commodity this is accomplished by first dividing the price of each eligible contract from the price of the contract immediately preceding such eligible contract to determine the percentage difference between the two prices because this price difference may be affected by the relative time between the eligible contract and its immediately preceding contract this price difference is multiplied by  and divided by the number of actual days between the delivery dates of the two contracts to arrive at a measure of the relative annualized contangobackwardation referred to as the “annualized spread” exhibited between the eligible contract and the contract immediately preceding it based on a comparison of these annualized spreads the eligible contract that has the highest annualized spread relative to its immediately preceding contract is the one selected as the contract for the bloomberg roll select ci to establish new positions in this roll selection process generally occurs every month on the fourth business day of the month        table of contents     some historical examples of the rolling process employed by the bloomberg roll select ci provided by the index providers are set forth below   example  an example of selecting the roll futures contract for wti crude oil by calculating its annualized spread as of october   and selecting the eligible futures contract that exhibit the most backwardation

annualized spread kc   h         z          kc   k         h            the bloomberg roll select ci utilizes a different designated contract selection process than the bloomberg ci and as a result the futures contracts comprising the bloomberg roll select ci at any particular time may have different delivery months than those comprising the bloomberg ci and the levels of the bloomberg roll select ci and the bloomberg ci may correspondingly differ in addition as a result of this difference in rolling processes both the performance of the bloomberg roll select ci and the bloomberg ci and the dollarvalue weights of their respective underlying futures contracts are expected to differ over time   although the bloomberg roll select ci’s roll process is designed to mitigate the effects of contango and to take advantage of the effects of backwardation there can be no assurance that the futures contracts selected for inclusion in the bloomberg roll select ci will outperform the futures contracts selected for inclusion in the bloomberg ci for example it is possible that the contracts included in the bloomberg roll select ci could experience less appreciation or greater depreciation than the contracts included in the bloomberg ci particularly when the price of a contract included in either index is influenced by changing expectations of future supply and demand for the related commodity for such contract’s specific delivery month since the bloomberg roll select ci tends to roll into futures contracts that demonstrate less contango or more backwardation relative to the futures contracts with delivery dates immediately preceding such futures contracts the bloomberg roll select ci may exhibit a tendency to roll into contracts exhibiting relatively lower pricing due to seasonal dips in the delivery month of the selected contract seasonal upswings in the delivery month of the immediately preceding contract or shortterm supply or demand shocks affecting either delivery month without regard to whether the selected contract would be expected to appreciate relative to the contract expiring immediately before it additionally the frequency with which the bloomberg roll select ci rolls its futures contracts is expected to differ from that of bloomberg ci due to these differences in the roll methodology the bloomberg roll select ci and the index may not have the same individual component weights as the bloomberg ci for further discussion of the risks associated with the bloomberg roll select ci see “risk factors—risk factors relating to index futures and the bloomberg roll select ci”   the index   the index is designed to reflect the returns on a fully collateralized investment in the bloomberg roll select ci by combining the returns of the bloomberg roll select ci with the returns on cash collateral invested in threemonth us treasury bills        table of contents     bloomberg ci index composition and methodology   the methodology for determining the composition and weighting of the bloomberg ci and for calculating its value is subject to modification by bloomberg or the index committees as described in “—the index committees” below bloomberg makes the official calculations of the value of the bloomberg ci at present this calculation is performed every fifteen seconds   the index committees   bloomberg has established a benchmark oversight committee the “boc” which is the uppermost governance body with respect to the bloomberg ci and consists of senior representatives from various bloomberg business units voting members of the boc do not directly participate in the index business    the boc meets on a quarterly basis to review matters such as material risks conflicts of interest industry developments client complaints and material index errors and restatements to assist in its oversight the boc has established the index operating subcommittee the “ios” and together with the boc the “index committees”    the ios is composed of senior benchmark and strategy index managers designated by the boc members include bloomberg personnel with significant index experience the ios meets at least monthly to address matters such as new index approvals periodic review of existing indices index pricing management of errors and restatements identification and management of actual and potential conflicts of interest approvals of changes to indices and approvals of cessation of indices   the ios also consults with index advisory councils on certain matters as described below the ios reports to the boc at least quarterly on all matters delegated to it    index advisory councils are composed of key market participants and other influential individuals to assist bloomberg in setting index priorities to discuss potential rules changes and to provide ideas for new products index advisory councils are generally constituted on an annual basis while potential benchmark changes are discussed through this process all feedback received is nonbinding and all final decisions on benchmark index rules are made by the ios subject to boc review after the review period has ended members of index advisory councils may include individuals with past or present relationships with the sponsor the clearing fcm an authorized participant other entities involved with the operation of the trust or their respective affiliates such as past or present directors or officers of the foregoing entities   index administration is subject to bloomberg’s internal compliance function which periodically reviews various aspects of bloomberg’s businesses in order to determine whether such businesses are adhering to applicable firmwide policies and procedures and assess whether applicable internal controls are functioning properly   determination of bloomberg ci index constituents   the composition of the bloomberg ci is rebalanced by bloomberg each year pursuant to the procedures set forth in the index methodology by index managers operating under the supervision of the index committees any material deviations or changes from established procedures are subject to review by the index committees in addition to the extent practicable bloomberg may solicit stakeholder feedback including by means of the index advisory council once approved the new composition of the bloomberg ci is publicly announced and takes effect in the month of january immediately following the announcement   the relative weight of a commodity eligible for inclusion in the bloomberg ci called its “cip” or its commodity index percentage is initially determined based on i the relative production percentages of the commodities eligible for inclusion in the bloomberg ci and ii the relative liquidity of the futures contracts that bloomberg has designated as the eligible reference contracts for those commodities this initial cip calculation is then adjusted to give effect to caps and floors on such cips and to adjust the weights for gold and silver the relative production numbers of which are assumed to understate their economic significance   the initial commodity production percentage of a commodity “cpp” is determined for each commodity by taking the fiveyear average of production figures for the related commodity adjusted by the historic us dollar value of the related designated contract and dividing the result by the sum of such products for all eligible commodities for natural gas only north american production is used to reflect the regional nature of this commodity in cases where there is more than one designated contract for a particular commodity this measurement is initially allocated to only one designated contract there will typically be some time lag with respect to the production numbers that are reflected in the bloomberg ci because production data can often only be obtained on a delayed basis for many commodities        table of contents     this initial cpp calculation is then allocated to the designated contract or contracts corresponding to each commodity in order to avoid doublecounting commodities in the same commodity sector eg a primary commodity and the commodity or commodities that are derived from such primary commodity and to avoid doublecounting in any commodity with more than one designated contract the final cpps of designated contracts within the same commodity sector are calculated by allocating among such designated contracts the initial cpp calculated for the primary commodity in such sector based on the commodity liquidity percentages as calculated below for each designated contract for the commodities within that sector as of the date of the index methodology there were two commodity sectors represented in the bloomberg ci – the first consisting of crude oil wti and brent as the primary commodity with uls diesel and rbob gasoline as its derivatives and the second consisting of soybeans as the primary commodity with soybean oil and soybean meal as its derivatives in addition two commodities were represented by more than one designated contract as of the date of the index methodology with crude oil represented by the contract for light sweet crude oil wti traded on nymex and the contract for brent crude oil traded on ice and wheat represented by the contract for soft wheat chicago traded on cbot and hard red winter wheat kansas traded on kcbt   the commodity liquidity percentage or “clp” for each designated contract is determined by taking a fiveyear average of the product of annual trading volume adjusting for the number of applicable units of the commodity eg barrels or metric tons per contract of such designated contract and the related historic us dollar value for such contract and dividing the result by the sum of such products for all designated contracts the clp for each designated contract for the bloomberg ci is an average computed on the basis of historical annual volume data for the five years up to and including the year prior to the applicable calculation period typically the third or fourth calendar quarter of the year preceding such year of calculation in some cases such as copper the related clp may be calculated using the trading volume for a contract other than the designated contract and certain adjustments are made to lme contracts to reflect differences in their trading hours and the time periods during which they may be traded in addition as in the case of crude oil and wheat more than one reference contract may be designated for a particular commodity   the initial cip for each designated contract is equal to ×cpp ×clp for that designated contract in order to calculate the final cips the following further adjustments are made     • first any designated contract with a cip of less than  is reduced to zero         • second if any commodity sector as described above consists of designated contracts with cips totaling more than  the cips of such designated contracts are reduced such that they equal          • third if the cip or combined cips in the case of a commodity with more than one designated contract of the designated contracts for any particular commodity is greater than  such cip or the total of the combined cips is reduced to          • fourth if any commodity group as described below consists of designated contracts with cips totaling more than  the cips of such designated contracts are reduced such that they equal          • fifth the cips for the designated contracts for each of gold and silver are set to equal the lesser of its clp and          • sixth any designated contract with a cip of less than  is increased to  and         • seventh if any designated contract has a ratio of cip after giving effect to the first six steps above to clp greater than  its cip is reduced so that it equals the cip that would cause the cip to clp ratio to equal  which may reduce the cip of a designated contract to below    for each of the first six steps above in order to keep the sum of the cips for each of the commodities equal to  after each step is completed the aggregate adjustment to the cips of affected designated contracts at each such step accompanied by a corresponding increase or reduction as applicable that is allocated equally to the cips of the other commodity sectors then if applicable further allocated equally to the designated contracts within such commodity sector other than those eliminated under step one or capped under steps two through four for the seventh and final step the aggregate reduction in cip resulting from this step is accompanied by a corresponding increase allocated equally to the cips of the designated contracts still in the bloomberg ci with cip to clp ratios below  other than those capped under steps two through four        table of contents     any cip reduction to a commodity with more than one designated contract is allocated equally among such commodity’s designated contracts any aggregate reduction to a commodity sector or commodity group under steps two or four is allocated to the designated contracts within such commodity sector or commodity group to preserve the relative weights of the cips of the designated contracts within such commodity sector or commodity group as calculated immediately prior to making any adjustments under such step for the purposes of step four the current commodity groups for commodities eligible for inclusion in the bloomberg ci are as follows   commodity group   commodities energy

rounding   calculation of the bloomberg ci   the level of the bloomberg ci was set to be equal to  as of december   subsequent levels of the bloomberg ci are determined by multiplying the level of the bloomberg ci as of the previous day by a fraction equal to i the weighted average value “wav” of the bloomberg ci as of the current day divided by ii the wav of the bloomberg ci as of the previous day subject to adjustment for roll periods as described below the wav of the bloomberg ci on any given day is calculated by summing the products of the settlement prices of the designated contracts for each commodity multiplied by the commodity index multiplier “cim” of such designated contract   the cims of the designated contracts in the bloomberg ci are determined annually generally on the fourth business day of each year the date of such determination the “cim determination date” on the cim determination date initial cims “icims” are calculated for each designated contract by multiplying such contract’s cip by  then dividing such product by the contract’s settlement price as of the cim determination date to determine the final cim for each designated contract for the new year each icim is multiplied by an adjustment factor which is a fraction equal to i the wav of the bloomberg ci as of the cim determination date as calculated using the cims from the prior year divided by ii  this adjustment factor is intended to preserve wav continuity from one year to the next   during roll periods which generally occur during the sixth through tenth business days of each month the level of the bloomberg ci is calculated using a blended wav formula that reflects the fact that the bloomberg ci is rolling out of expiring contracts and into replacement contracts the wav associated with the existing index components “old wav” begins weighted at  as of the business day preceding the roll period and decreases by  on each subsequent business day until reduced to zero it has no further effect on the level of the bloomberg ci by the fifth business day of such roll period the wav associated with the new index components “new wav” begins weighted at  as of the business day preceding the roll period and increases by  on each subsequent business day such that by the fifth business day of such roll period the level of the bloomberg ci is determined based entirely on the new wav     accordingly during a roll period the level of the bloomberg ci on any given day can be calculated as the product of the level of the bloomberg ci as of the previous day multiplied by a fraction equal to i old wav× n  new wav × n using the old wav and new wav values as of such day divided by ii old wav × n  new wav × n using the old wav and new wav values as of the previous day the variable “n” in this equation represents the number of business days that have elapsed for such roll period through and including the relevant date of determination        table of contents     an example of calculating the level of the bloomberg ci during a roll period from january  provided by the index cosponsors is set forth below   a   b   c   d   e   f   g   h         date   business day   old wav

wav values for current day  using old wav and new wav values for previous day  previous day bloomberg ci level multiplied by the wav fraction   calculation of the bloomberg roll select ci   the bloomberg roll select ci will be calculated using the same general methodology as the bloomberg ci and using the same cips and cims used in connection with calculating the bloomberg ci however because the roll process for the bloomberg roll select ci is different from that of the bloomberg ci its constituent futures contracts may differ from those included in the bloomberg ci this difference is expected to cause the dollarvalue weights and the weighted average value of the futures contracts included in each index to differ over time and as a result cause the performance of the two indices to diverge   calculation of the index   the index combines the returns of the bloomberg roll select ci with assumed returns on us treasury securities calculated based on the most recent weekly auction high rate for  week  month us treasury bills as reported on the website httpwwwtreasurydirectgov published by the bureau of the public debt of the us treasury or any successor source the level of the index which was set at a hypothetical level of  as of december   can be calculated on any given day as the product of the level of the index as of the previous day multiplied by the sum of i  plus ii the positive or negative percentage return on the bloomberg roll select ci on such day plus iii the daily return based on the auction high rate for  week  month us treasury bills described above

discretion of the sponsor other collateral assets  consistent with its investment objective establishing maintaining and closing out positions in index futures and acquiring holding and disposing of corresponding collateral assets  paying out of its assets any expenses and liabilities of the trust not assumed by the sponsor and  delivering proceeds consisting of index futures cash and other collateral assets in exchange for baskets surrendered for redemption   the trust is a passive investor in index futures and the collateral assets held to satisfy applicable margin requirements on those index futures positions the advisor acts as the commodity trading advisor for the trust and is authorized to transact in index futures and acquire and dispose of the related collateral assets on the trust’s behalf the trust does not engage in any activities designed to obtain a profit from or to ameliorate losses caused by changes in the level of the index or the bloomberg roll select ci or the value of the collateral assets to the extent that the trust accepts cash proceeds in connection with the creation of shares the trust will use that cash to purchase additional index futures and collateral assets in an amount that the advisor determines will enable the trust to achieve investment results that correspond with the index at any time when index futures of more than one expiration are listed on the exchange the sponsor will determine pursuant to the terms of the trust agreement which index futures will be transferred in connection with either the creation or redemption of baskets   the trust establishes long positions in index futures either by receiving transfers of such positions from authorized participants in connection with the creation of shares or by placing orders for purchases of index futures with its clearing fcm the trust’s index futures transactions are executed through globex the cme group’s electronic trading system through the competitive execution market maintained by the cme group and subject to the rules of cbot all index futures positions held by the trust regardless of whether they are transferred to the trust by authorized participants in connection with the creation of shares or established through purchases of index futures by the trust on the related exchange are maintained in the trust’s account with its clearing fcm in order to satisfy redemption requests the trust either transfers index futures to the relevant authorized participants or liquidates index futures to generate cash to be transferred to such authorized participants liquidation of index futures positions is effected by entering orders with an fcm for execution on the related exchange to sell index futures which serves to offset the trust’s existing long positions   the trust is required to deposit initial margin with a value of approximately  to  of the value of each index futures position at the time it is established these margin requirements are subject to change from time to time by the exchange or the clearing fcm margin requirements established by the clearing fcm may exceed minimum levels established by the exchange these requirements apply to index futures transferred by authorized participants or established through transactions executed on behalf of the trust by the clearing fcm the trust also pays or receives variation margin on its index futures positions the trust satisfies these margin requirements by transferring to or receiving from its account with the clearing fcm collateral assets in the required amount when it establishes its index futures positions and with respect to variation margin after the daily settlement of such positions in accordance with the rules of the applicable exchange see “futures contracts on the bloomberg roll select ci”   any collateral assets held in the trust’s account with the clearing fcm are pledged to the clearing fcm as security for the trust’s obligations to the clearing fcm   the index futures listed and made available for trading by exchanges from time to time may have terms that differ from the index futures currently held by the trust including transaction fees associated with the purchase and sale of those index futures as an index futures position nears expiration it is anticipated but there can be no assurance that an index futures position with a later expiration date but similar terms will be listed by an exchange it will be necessary for the trust in order to maintain a long position in index futures to “roll” its position from an index futures position that is about to expire into an index futures position with a later expiration date the trust may further close out of existing positions and establish new positions in index futures from time to time including new positions in earlier expiring index futures which may allow it to reduce its concentration in any particular index futures contract or to benefit from more liquid markets or otherwise beneficial market activity in index futures listed with different expirations or on different exchanges each “roll” will be effected in a manner that in the judgment of the advisor based on the circumstances prevailing at that time is most beneficial to the trust and will reduce the risks to which the trust is exposed as a result of the roll a roll could be effected by liquidating all or a portion of the trust’s existing index futures positions and establishing new index futures positions a roll could also be effected over a period of time by the creation and redemption of baskets in the ordinary course with different index futures included in the applicable basket amounts        table of contents     the rolling of the trust’s positions in index futures will necessarily affect the relationship between the value of the shares and the number of index futures represented by each share when the new index futures to be acquired by the trust are cheaper than the index futures they are replacing the roll will result in the trust owning a larger number of contracts in the new index futures than it owned in the index futures that were just replaced conversely if the new index futures are more expensive than the ones being replaced the roll will result in the trust owning fewer contracts in the new index futures relative to those that were replaced the differential in the number of index futures will result in the trust participating to a greater or lesser extent in subsequent changes in the price of the index futures whether any price differential exists between the index futures involved in a roll however will depend on the prices of these index futures at the time the roll occurs the likelihood and extent of discounts or premiums resulting from the rolling process or of how the shares will be affected as a result thereof may vary and cannot readily be determined   the trust’s ability to operate and achieve its investment objective is dependent on a number of parties including     • the sponsor who exercises general oversight and authority over the trust         • the trustee who is responsible for the daytoday administration of the trust         • the trust administrator who provides certain administrative and custodial services to the trust         • the advisor who exercises general oversight over the trust’s investment activities         • the clearing fcm through which the trust transacts in index futures and maintains its index futures positions         • the exchange through which the trust’s index futures transactions clear and settle         • the index providers who own the rights to the index on which the trust’s investment objective is based         • the index administrator who administers calculates and publishes the index         • the authorized participants whose creation and redemption activities allow index futures and collateral assets to be converted to shares and vice versa to help maintain the relationship between the index and the shares and         • the tax administrator who provides tax reporting and tax administrative services   of the foregoing parties the sponsor the advisor and the trustee are commonly controlled subsidiaries of blackrock inc ubs securities one of the index providers acts as the trust’s clearing fcm and as an authorized participant and was the initial purchaser of the shares a number of the foregoing parties are publicly traded companies or subsidiaries of publicly traded companies and a portion of their shares may be owned by one or more of the other foregoing parties   investment objective of the trust   the trust seeks to track the results of a fully collateralized investment in futures contracts on an index composed of a diversified group of commodities futures which attempts to minimize contango and maximize backwardation the trust seeks to track the investment results of the index before fees and expenses of the trust the index that the trust seeks to track reflects the value of the bloomberg roll select ci together with the return on specified us treasury securities that are deemed to have been held to collateralize a hypothetical long position in the futures contracts comprising the bloomberg roll select ci the bloomberg roll select ci is a version of the bloomberg ci a liquidity and productionweighted index of the prices of a diversified group of futures contracts on physical commodities that seeks to minimize the effect of contango and maximize the effect of backwardation by selecting replacement futures contracts that exhibit the most backwardation or least contango among those eligible futures contracts with delivery months of up to  calendar days until expiration   the trust seeks to achieve its investment objective by holding long positions in index futures that have settlement values at expiration based on the level of the bloomberg roll select ci at that time and earning interest on the noncash collateral assets used to satisfy applicable margin requirements on those index futures positions   when establishing positions in index futures the advisor estimates as of the date of this prospectus that the trust will be required to deposit initial margin with a value of approximately  to  of the value of each index futures position at the time it is established these margin requirements are subject to change from time to time by the exchange or the clearing fcm margin requirements established by the clearing fcm may exceed minimum levels established by the exchange on a daily basis the trust is obligated to pay or entitled to receive variation margin in an amount equal to the change in the daily settlement level of its index futures positions if the daily settlement level causes the value of the trust’s index futures positions to decrease the trust is required to post variation margin with the clearing fcm conversely if the daily settlement level causes the value of the trust’s index futures positions to increase the trust’s account with the clearing fcm receives variation margin in an amount equal to the increase        table of contents     whenever index futures of different types or expirations are available for investment the sponsor determines pursuant to the terms of the trust agreement which index futures are to be transferred in connection with either the creation or redemption of baskets on any given business day the index futures to be delivered in connection with the creation of a basket may differ from the index futures to be delivered in connection with the redemption of a basket for example expiring index futures may be delivered in connection with the redemption of a basket while more recently listed index futures may be delivered in connection with the creation of a basket the trust does not engage in any activities designed to obtain a profit from or to ameliorate losses caused by changes in the level of the index or the bloomberg roll select ci or the value of the collateral assets   the profit or loss on the trust’s index futures positions should correlate with increases and decreases in the value of the bloomberg roll select ci although this correlation is not expected to be exact the return on the index futures together with interest on the noncash collateral assets is expected to result in a total return that corresponds generally but is not identical to the index differences between the returns on the shares and the performance of the index may be based on among other factors differences between the return on the collateral assets and the us treasury rate used to calculate the us treasury return component of the index timing differences differences between the portion of the trust’s assets invested in index futures versus the portion of the return of the index contributed by the bloomberg roll select ci differences between the settlement price of index futures and the closing level of the bloomberg roll select ci and the payment of expenses and liabilities by the trust   the advisor acts as the commodity trading advisor for the trust the advisor on behalf of the trust is authorized to invest all of the trust’s assets in long positions in index futures and in collateral assets in order to satisfy applicable margin requirements on those index futures positions any cash that the trust accepts in connection with the creation of shares is used to purchase additional index futures and collateral assets in an amount that the advisor determines will enable the trust to achieve investment results that correspond with the index before the payment of the trust’s expenses and liabilities the advisor does not engage in any activities designed to obtain a profit from or to ameliorate losses caused by changes in the level of the index or the bloomberg roll select ci or the value of the collateral assets   due to creation or redemption activity or expenses incurred in the trust the notional value of index futures held may at times exceed the aggregate value of the trusts assets in such instances the advisor may elect in such a manner as the advisor determines will enable the trust to achieve investment results that correspond to the index before the payment of the trusts expenses and liabilities to dispose of index futures to reduce the trusts notional exposure to index futures or continue to hold index futures in a notional amount that exceeds the aggregate value of the trusts assets until additional creation or redemption activity or trading aligns the notional value of the index futures with the corresponding collateral holdings   the shares are intended to constitute an alternative means for investors to achieve investment exposure to the performance of the index although the shares are not the exact equivalent of an investment in the underlying futures contracts and us treasury securities represented by the index the shares are intended to provide investors with an alternative method of participating in the commodities market   in addition retail investors can gain exposure to the commodities underlying the bloomberg roll select ci by purchasing individual or small lots of shares through traditional brokerage accounts without being subject to the significantly higher minimum contract sizes required for directly establishing a position in the underlying commodities or futures contracts the shares are eligible for margin accounts   secondary market trading   while the trust anticipates that the price of the shares will fluctuate in a manner that reflects changes in the trust’s net asset value over time at any given time the shares may trade at above or below the nav the nav fluctuates primarily with changes in the market value of index futures the nav may also be affected as a result of fluctuations in the value of collateral assets but this fluctuation is not expected to be significant because the collateral assets are expected to consist of cash and us treasury securities the trading price of the shares fluctuates in accordance with changes in the nav intraday changes in the value of the index futures and market supply and demand the amount of the discount or premium in the trading price relative to the nav may be influenced by nonconcurrent trading hours between nyse arca the exchange on which the shares trade the exchanges on which index futures trade and the principal commodities markets on which the futures contracts in the bloomberg roll select ci trade while the shares are expected to trade on nyse arca until  pm new york time liquidity in the markets for the index futures and the futures contracts underlying the bloomberg roll select ci is expected to be reduced whenever the principal markets for these contracts are closed as a result trading spreads and the resulting premium or discount on the shares may widen during these gaps in market trading hours        table of contents     valuation of index futures computation of the trust’s net asset value   the sponsor has the exclusive authority to determine the net asset value of the trust and the nav which it has delegated to the trustee under the trust agreement the trustee determines the net asset value of the trust and the nav as of  pm new york time on each business day on which nyse arca is open for regular trading as soon as practicable after that time a “business day” is a day  on which none of the following occurs a nyse arca is closed for regular trading b an exchange is closed for regular trading or c the federal reserve wire transfer system is closed for cash wire transfers or  that the trustee determines that it is able to conduct business   the trustee values the trust’s long positions in index futures on the basis of that day’s settlement prices for the index futures held by the trust as announced by the applicable exchange the value of the trust’s positions in any particular index futures contract equals the product of  the number of such index futures contracts owned by the trust  the settlement price of such index futures contract on the date of calculation and  the multiplier of such index futures contract if there is no announced settlement price for a particular index futures contract on a business day the trustee uses the most recently announced settlement price unless the trustee in consultation with the sponsor determines that such price is inappropriate as a basis for valuation the daily settlement price for each index futures contract currently held by the trust is established on each trading day by cme group staff generally at  pm new york time   the trustee values all other holdings of the trust at a its current market value if quotations for such property are readily available or b its fair value as reasonably determined by the trustee if the current market value cannot be determined   once the value of the index futures and interest earned on the trust’s noncash collateral assets has been determined the trustee subtracts all accrued expenses and liabilities of the trust as of the time of calculation in order to calculate the net asset value of the trust   once the net asset value of the trust has been calculated the trustee determines the nav by dividing the net asset value of the trust by the number of shares outstanding at the time the calculation is made any changes to the nav that may result from creation and redemption activity occurring on any business day is not reflected in the nav until the following business day   the nav for each business day on which nyse arca is open for regular trading is expected to be distributed through major market data vendors and published online at httpwwwisharescom or any successor thereto the trust updates the nav as soon as practicable after each subsequent nav is calculated   trust expenses   the sponsor has agreed under the trust agreement to pay the following administrative operational and marketing expenses  the fees of the trustee the delaware trustee the advisor and their respective agents  nyse arca listing fees  printing and mailing costs  audit fees  fees for registration of the shares with the sec  tax reporting costs  license fees and  legal expenses relating to the trust of up to  annually as of the date of this prospectus the sponsor estimates that these annual administrative operational and marketing expenses will be approximately  of the net asset value of the trust per year although the actual amount of these expenses may be more or less the trust is not expected to have other ordinary recurring administrative operational or marketing expenses other than brokerage commissions and similar transaction fees as described below        table of contents     in return for paying the expenses described above the sponsor receives the sponsor’s fee which accrues daily at an annualized rate of up to  of the adjusted net asset value of the trust is payable by the trust monthly in arrears and is subject to adjustment from time to time except that the sponsor’s fee may not be adjusted to above  of the adjusted net asset value absent an amendment to the trust agreement with thirty days’ prior notice to registered holders of the shares for a description of how the net asset value of the trust is calculated see “—valuation of index futures computation of the trust’s net asset value” above   the sponsor and the trustee may amend or terminate the sponsor’s obligation to pay certain expenses of the trust in compliance with the requirements described under “description of the shares and the trust agreement—amendment and dissolution”   the trust is responsible for paying any applicable brokerage commissions and similar transaction fees out of its assets as of the date of this prospectus the sponsor estimates that these brokerage commissions and transaction fees will equal

time        table of contents     description of the shares and the trust agreement   the trust is a statutory trust organized under the laws of the state of delaware on december   the trust intends to continuously offer shares to the public but is not required to do so the required consideration for the trust’s issuance of shares consists of index futures and cash or in the discretion of the sponsor other collateral assets the trust is governed by the amended and restated trust agreement dated as of july   among the sponsor the trustee and the delaware trustee the trust agreement sets out the rights of the registered holders of the shares and the rights and obligations of the sponsor the trustee and the delaware trustee delaware law governs the trust agreement the trust and the shares in connection with the establishment of the trust and the preparation of the trust’s initial financial statements the sponsor made initial contributions in the aggregate amount of  this initial contribution was redeemed and distributed to the sponsor in connection with the issuance and sale of the initial shares to ubs securities as initial purchaser   each share represents a unit of fractional undivided beneficial interest in the net assets of the trust the assets of the trust consist of its positions in index futures and collateral assets held to satisfy applicable margin requirements on those index futures positions the trust may also hold a limited amount of cash necessary to cover any expenses of the trust not assumed by the sponsor in addition there may be other situations where the trust may hold cash for example a claim may arise against an authorized participant or any other third party which is settled in cash any cash held by the trust is held in a noninterestbearing account the trust is not an investment company registered under the investment company act and is not required to register under that act   the following summary is qualified by reference to the entire trust agreement and the form of authorized participant agreement which are filed as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part   creations of baskets   the trust intends to offer shares on a continuous basis on each business day but issuances of new shares may be suspended at any time shares may be offered only in baskets of  shares baskets are typically issued only in exchange for an amount of index futures and cash or in the discretion of the sponsor other collateral assets equal to the basket amount for the business day on which the creation order was received by the trustee the basket amount for a business day has a per share value equal to the nav as of such day and the assets included in the basket amount are valued in the same manner and on the same basis as the trust’s nav calculations for its assets generally as more fully described in “business of the trust—valuation of index futures computation of the trust’s net asset value” creation orders received after  pm new york time are not deemed to be received until the following business day in limited circumstances and subject to the approval of the trustee baskets may be created for cash equal to the nav of the shares constituting a basket as determined on the date the related creation order was received plus the costs incurred by the trust in establishing the corresponding index futures positions and acquiring the related collateral assets creation orders for baskets paid for solely in cash that are received after  am new york time will be deemed received as of the following business day the trustee notifies the authorized participants of the basket amount on each business day   before the trust issues any baskets to an authorized participant that authorized participant must deliver to the trustee a creation order indicating the number of baskets it intends to purchase and providing other details with respect to the procedures by which the baskets are to be transferred the trustee expects to acknowledge the creation order unless it or the sponsor decides to refuse the order as described below under “—requirements for trustee actions”   upon the transfer of  the required consideration of index futures in the amounts and of the type specified by the trustee and cash or in the discretion of the sponsor other collateral assets in the amounts specified by the trustee in each case to the accounts specified by the trustee and  all transaction fees associated with creations including but not limited to fees charged by the exchange and the clearing fcm per basket the trustee delivers the appropriate number of baskets to the dtc account of the authorized participant the total transaction fees charged per basket created may change from time to time see “—fees for creations and redemptions”   only authorized participants can transfer the required consideration and receive baskets in exchange authorized participants may act for their own accounts or as agents for brokerdealers custodians and other securities market participants that wish to create or redeem baskets an authorized participant is under no obligation to the trust to create or redeem baskets for itself or on behalf of other persons an order for one or more baskets may be placed by an authorized participant on behalf of multiple clients the sponsor and the trustee maintain a current list of authorized participants        table of contents     no shares are issued unless and until the trustee receives confirmation that the required consideration has been received in the account or accounts specified by the trustee it is expected that delivery of the shares will be made against transfer of consideration on the next business day following the business day on which the creation order is received by the trustee which is referred to as a t settlement cycle if the trustee has not received the required consideration for the shares to be delivered on the delivery date by  am new york time the trustee may cancel the creation order   the trustee has the right to reject any creation order for any reason the reasons for the rejection may include among others  the related order not being in proper form as described in the authorized participant agreement  market conditions or other circumstances that make transactions in or delivery of the shares or the index futures impossible or impractical  a determination by the trustee that the acceptance of the related order would have adverse tax or other consequences to the trust or the shareholders or  circumstances that would cause the acceptance of the related order to result in a violation of law in the opinion of counsel to the trustee the sponsor or the trust administrator each authorized participant agreement provides that neither the trustee nor any agents acting on its behalf will be liable to any person for rejecting a creation order   redemptions of baskets   authorized participants may typically surrender baskets in exchange only for an amount of index futures and cash or in the discretion of the sponsor other collateral assets equal to the value of the basket amount on the business day the redemption request is received by the trustee redemption orders received after  pm new york time are not deemed to be received until the following business day holders of baskets who are not authorized participants are not able to redeem their baskets except through an authorized participant it is expected that authorized participants may redeem baskets for their own accounts or on behalf of shareholders who are not authorized participants but no authorized participant is under any obligation to the trust to do so   before surrendering baskets for redemption an authorized participant must deliver to the trustee a request indicating the number of baskets it intends to redeem and providing other details with respect to the procedures by which the assets representing the required basket amount are to be transferred the trustee expects to acknowledge the redemption order unless it or the sponsor decides to refuse the redemption order as described below under “—requirements for trustee actions”   after the delivery by the authorized participant to the trust’s dtc account of the total number of shares to be redeemed by an authorized participant the

of interest   general   prospective investors should be aware that the sponsor the advisor and the trustee intend to assert that shareholders have by purchasing shares consented to the following conflicts of interest in the event of any proceeding alleging that such conflicts violated any duty owed by the sponsor the advisor or the trustee to the shareholders   the sponsor the advisor and the trustee want you to know that there are certain entities with which the sponsor the advisor or the trustee may have relationships that may give rise to conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest these entities include the following affiliates of the sponsor the advisor and the trustee including blackrock inc and the pnc financial services group inc and each of their affiliates directors partners trustees managing members officers and employees collectively the “affiliates”   the activities of the sponsor the advisor the trustee and the affiliates in the management of or their interest in their own accounts and other accounts they manage may present conflicts of interest that could disadvantage the trust and its shareholders one or more of the sponsor the advisor the trustee or the affiliates provide investment management services to other funds and discretionary managed accounts that may follow an investment program similar to that of the trust the sponsor the advisor the trustee and the affiliates collectively are involved worldwide with a broad spectrum of financial services and asset management activities and may engage in the ordinary course of business in activities in which their interests or the interests of their clients may conflict with those of the trust and its shareholders one or more of the sponsor the advisor the trustee or the affiliates act or may act as an investor investment banker research provider investment manager financier underwriter advisor market maker trader prime broker lender agent and principal and have other direct and indirect interests in assets in which the trust directly and indirectly invest   thus it is likely that the trust will have multiple business relationships with and will engage in transactions with or obtain services from entities for which the sponsor the advisor the trustee or an affiliate performs or seeks to perform investment banking or other services   one or more of the sponsor the advisor the trustee or an affiliate are currently involved in transactions with and would stand to benefit from the positive performance by entities that are or may be direct competitors of the trust including in capacities such as the sponsor commodity pool operator commodity trading advisor trustee or administrator of competing or potentially competing funds one or more of the sponsor the advisor the trustee and one or more affiliates may additionally engage in proprietary trading and advise accounts and funds that have investment objectives similar to those of the trust andor that engage in and compete for transactions in the same types of assets as the trust those trading activities are carried out without reference to positions held directly or indirectly by the trust and may result in one or more of the sponsor the advisor the trustee an affiliate or such accounts having positions that are adverse to those of the trust or entering into transactions preferentially ahead of opposite to or in a manner otherwise adverse to the interests of the trust   no affiliate is under any obligation to share any investment opportunity idea or strategy with the trust as a result an affiliate may compete with the trust for appropriate investment opportunities as a result of this and several other factors the results of the trust’s investment activities may differ from those of an affiliate and of other accounts managed by an affiliate and it is possible that the trust and shareholders could sustain losses during periods in which one or more affiliates and other accounts achieve profits on their trading for proprietary or other accounts the opposite result is also possible   the trust may from time to time enter into transactions in which other clients of the sponsor the advisor the trustee or an affiliate have an adverse interest furthermore transactions undertaken by affiliateadvised clients may adversely impact the trust transactions by one or more affiliateadvised clients or the sponsor the advisor the trustee or an affiliate may have the effect of diluting or otherwise disadvantaging the values prices or investment strategies of

fund name index providers including the affiliates may be paid licensing fees for use of their indices or index names affiliates will not be obligated to license their indices to blackrock inc and blackrock inc cannot be assured that the terms of any index licensing agreement with the affiliates will be as favorable as those terms offered to other index licensees        table of contents

have business relationships with and purchase or distribute or sell services or products from or to distributors consultants or others who recommend the trust or who engage in transactions with or for the trust and may receive compensation for such services the trust may also make brokerage and other payments to affiliates in connection with the trust’s transactions   the activities of the sponsor the advisor the trustee or the affiliates may give rise to other conflicts of interest that could disadvantage the trust and its shareholders the sponsor the advisor and the trustee have adopted policies and procedures designed to address these potential conflicts of interest   the sponsor   the sponsor is an affiliate of the advisor and the trustee and therefore may have a conflict of interest with respect to its oversight of the advisor or the trustee as the case may be in particular the sponsor which has authority to remove the trustee or terminate the advisory agreement in its discretion has an incentive not to exercise this authority even when it is in the best interests of the shareholders to do so because of its affiliation with the trustee or the advisor as the case may be the trustee is authorized to appoint an unaffiliated trust administrator tax administrator or other agent to carry out all or some of its duties under the trust agreement but it is not required to delegate any of its duties to an unaffiliated third party   in addition the sponsor and its affiliates may engage in trading activities relating to the index futures the components of the index or the bloomberg roll select ci or other derivative instruments related to those indices that are not for the account of or on behalf of the trust or the shareholders these activities may present a conflict between the shareholders’ interest in the shares and the interest of the sponsor and its affiliates in their proprietary accounts in facilitating transactions including derivatives transactions for their customers’ accounts and in accounts under their management these trading activities if they influence the value of the index futures could be adverse to the interests of the shareholders

recommendations that are inconsistent with purchasing or holding shares the research should not be viewed as a recommendation or endorsement of the shares in any way and investors must make their own

adjusted net asset value absent an amendment to the trust agreement and  days’ prior notice to registered holders of the shares the amount of the sponsor’s fee increases as the trust’s net assets increase   resolution of certain conflicts   the trust agreement provides that in the case of a conflict of interest between the trustee the sponsor and their affiliates on the one hand and the holders of shares on the other the trustee and the sponsor will resolve such conflict considering the relevant interests of each party including their own interests and related benefits and burdens any customary or accepted industry practices and any applicable generally accepted accounting practices or principles the trust agreement provides that in the absence of bad faith by the sponsor or trustee such a resolution will not constitute a breach of the trust agreement or any duty or obligation of the sponsor or trustee        table of contents     conflicts relating to ubs securities the

contracts on the commodities that underlie the index overthecounter contracts on these commodities the underlying commodities included in the index and other instruments and derivative products based on the index bloomberg roll select ci and the bloomberg ci any of these activities of ubs securities or its affiliates could adversely affect the level of the index or index futures directly or

performance of the index futures which would be adverse to the price of the shares   the index providers   activities conducted by the index providers and their respective affiliates may conflict with your interests as a shareholder for example one or more of the index providers or their respective affiliates may also engage in trading in the index the bloomberg ci the bloomberg roll select ci

futures and the collateral assets it is expected that the trust’s items of income or loss as the case may be will consist primarily of  capital gain or loss as the case may be in respect of the index futures computed annually under the “marktomarket” rules applicable to section  contracts described above  adjustments to such capital gain or loss as the case may be in respect of the index futures upon their expiration or upon disposition of an index futures position by the trust and  interest income on noncash collateral assets and if applicable gain or loss on the disposition of such collateral assets   gain or loss on index futures or on securities held as collateral generally will be equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or other disposition thereof and the adjusted tax basis of the index futures or securities respectively in the case of index futures with certain exceptions such gain or loss will be characterized as shortterm capital gains or losses to the extent of  thereof and as longterm capital gains or losses to the extent of  thereof gain or loss on the securities held by the trust to collateralize its index futures positions which will generally consist of threemonth us treasury securities are expected to be characterized as shortterm capital gains or losses but gain or loss on any such securities that are held by the trust for more than one year will be characterized as longterm capital gain or loss interest or dividends accrued or paid on the securities held by the trust to collateralize its index futures positions will be taxable to you as ordinary income if any of the securities are treated as issued with original issue discount you generally will be required to include the original issue discount in income   under certain circumstances loss deductions are disallowed where they result from wash sales of stock or securities a wash sale occurs if stock or securities are sold at a loss and the seller acquires substantially identical stock or securities within a certain time period before or after the sale the trust should not be subject to the wash sale rules in connection with the sale or disposition of index futures because the index futures do not constitute securities for purposes of these rules   because you will be treated as a beneficial owner of an interest in a partnership you will be required to include in income the trust’s items of income gain loss deduction expense and credit that are allocated to you for the trust’s taxable year ending with or within your taxable year regardless of whether any distributions are made to you accordingly you may be required to include amounts in income without a corresponding current receipt of cash if the trust earns taxable income but does not make corresponding cash distributions for example you may incur income tax liabilities in excess of cash distributions on shares as a result of the “marktomarket” rules applicable to section  contracts as a result of adjustments to the capital gain or loss computed for a section  contract when it is closed out by offset or otherwise expires or from the disposition of such section  contract in connection with the redemption by an authorized participant of a basket and as a result of interest earned by the trust on the securities it holds to collateralize its index futures positions or from amounts deposited with the clearing fcm or the trust administrator   distributions on the shares   distributions on the shares generally will not be taxable to you except to the extent that the cash you receive exceeds your adjusted tax basis in the shares cash distributions in excess of your adjusted tax basis in the shares generally will be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of the shares taxable in accordance with the rules described under “—sale exchange or other taxable disposition of shares”        table of contents     upon a liquidating distribution of cash by the trust a distribution to you that terminates your interest in the trust you generally will recognize gain or loss from the sale or exchange of the shares taxable in accordance with the rules described under “—sale exchange or other taxable disposition of shares”   sale exchange or other taxable disposition of shares   upon the sale exchange or other taxable disposition of shares you generally will recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized upon the sale exchange or other disposition and your adjusted tax basis in the shares your adjusted tax basis in your shares generally will be equal to the amount you paid for your shares  increased by any income or gain of the trust that is allocated to you and by the amount of any contributions you make to the capital of the trust as part of the creation of a basket and  decreased but not below zero by any loss or expense of the trust that is allocated to you and by the amount of any cash and the tax basis of any property distributed or deemed distributed to you for a description of the allocation of income gain loss and expense to you see “—partnership allocations and adjustments”   creation and redemption of baskets   if the trust transfers or otherwise disposes of an index futures position in connection with the redemption of a basket the disposition will generally give rise to gain or loss that will be allocated in part to you however holders of shares other than authorized participants or holders for which an authorized participant is acting generally are not expected to recognize gain or loss directly as a result of an authorized participant’s creation or redemption of a basket an authorized participant’s creation or redemption of a basket also may affect the portion of the trust’s tax basis in the trust’s assets that is allocated to you which could affect the amount of gain or loss allocated to you under the “marktomarket” system applicable to section  contracts or on the closing out whether by offset or otherwise expiration or disposition of an index futures position by the trust   distributions of index futures to authorized participants in connection with redemptions of baskets may give rise to character and timing mismatches between gain or loss recognized by the authorized participant on the index futures and gain or loss recognized on any shares retained by the authorized participant or if relevant a holder of shares for which an authorized participant is acting in a nonliquidating distribution the authorized participant generally will receive a carryover basis in the index futures distributed to it assuming that such carryover basis does not exceed the holder’s outside basis in its shares and the holder will reduce its outside basis in the shares it retains after the redemption by the sum of the basis it takes in the index futures and the amount of cash if any it receives thus for example an authorized participant that is a dealer in securities who receives a distribution of index futures generally will recognize capital gain or loss on such index futures in the year of the distribution under the special “marktomarket” rules applicable to regulated futures contracts under section  of the code but may recognize in the same year an offsetting amount of ordinary income or loss on any shares it retains after the redemption under the regular “marktomarket” rules that apply to dealers in securities similarly an authorized participant or other redeeming holder of shares that is not a dealer in securities who receives a distribution of index futures generally will recognize capital gain or loss on such index futures in the year of the distribution under the special “marktomarket” rules applicable to regulated futures contracts but generally will not recognize gain or loss with respect to the shares it retains after the redemption until it disposes of such shares different rules would apply if a creation of shares and a redemption of shares were treated as a “disguised sale” under special rules applicable to certain contributions to and redemptions from a partnership the trust intends to take the position that the disguised sale rules generally do not apply authorized participants and other redeeming holders of shares for which an authorized participant is acting are urged to consult their own tax advisor with regard to the tax consequences to them of redemption of shares including whether the authorized participant or other redeeming holder of shares is obligated to file a disguised sale disclosure statement with its tax return   limitations on deductibility of certain losses and expenses   the deductibility for us federal income tax purposes of a us holder’s share of losses and expenses of the trust is subject to certain limitations including but not limited to rules providing that  you may not deduct the trust’s losses that are allocated to you in excess of your adjusted tax basis in your shares  individuals and personal holding companies may not deduct the losses allocable to a particular “activity” in excess of the amount that they are considered to have “at risk” with respect to the activity and  a noncorporate us holder may deduct its share of expenses of the trust only to the extent that such share together with such noncorporate us holder’s other miscellaneous itemized deductions exceeds  of such noncorporate us holder’s adjusted gross income the annual allocation from the trust will be reported to the sponsor as an expense of the kind subject to the limitation on miscellaneous itemized deductions to the extent that a loss or expense that you cannot deduct currently is allocated to you you may be required to report taxable income in excess of your economic income or cash distributions to you on the shares you are urged to consult your own tax advisor with regard to these and other limitations on your ability to deduct losses or expenses with respect to the trust        table of contents     partnership allocations and adjustments   for us federal income tax purposes your share of the trust’s income gain loss deduction and other items will be determined by the trust agreement unless an allocation under these agreements does not have “substantial economic effect” in which case the allocations will be determined in accordance with the “partners’ interests in the partnership” subject to the discussion below under “—monthly allocation and revaluation conventions” and “—section  election” the allocations pursuant to the trust agreement should be considered to have substantial economic effect   if the allocations provided by the trust agreement were successfully challenged by the irs the amount of income or loss allocated to you for us federal income tax purposes under the agreement could be increased or decreased the timing of income or loss could be accelerated or deferred or the character of the income or loss could be altered   as described in more detail below the us tax rules that apply to partnerships are complex and their application is not always clear moreover the rules generally were not written for and in some respects are difficult to apply to publicly traded interests in partnerships the trust will apply certain assumptions and conventions intended to comply with the intent of the rules and to report income gain deduction loss and credit to investors in a manner that reflects the investors’ economic gains and losses but these assumptions and conventions may not comply with all aspects of the applicable treasury regulations it is possible therefore that the irs will successfully assert that these assumptions or conventions do not satisfy the technical requirements of the code or the treasury regulations and will require that items of income gain deduction loss and credit be adjusted or reallocated in a manner that could be adverse to you holders with questions regarding partnership allocations and adjustments or other tax matters may obtain further information from the sponsor at the following number ishares or    monthly allocation and revaluation conventions   in general the trust’s taxable income and losses will be determined monthly and will be apportioned among the holders of shares in proportion to the number of shares treated as owned by each of them as of the close of the last trading day of the preceding month by investing in the shares a us holder agrees that in the absence of an administrative determination or judicial ruling to the contrary it will report income and loss under the monthly allocation and revaluation conventions described below   under the monthly allocation convention the person that was treated for us federal income tax purposes as holding a share as of the close of the last trading day of the preceding month will be treated as continuing to hold that share until immediately before the close of the last trading day of the following month as a result a holder that is transferring its shares or whose shares are redeemed prior to the close of the last trading day of a month may be allocated income gain loss and deduction realized after the date of transfer   the code generally requires that items of partnership income and deductions be allocated between transferors and transferees of partnership interests on a daily basis it is possible that transfers of shares could be considered to occur for these purposes when the transfer is completed without regard to the trust’s monthly convention for allocating income and deductions in that event the trust’s allocation method might be viewed as violating that requirement   in addition for any month in which a creation or redemption of shares takes place the trust generally will credit or debit respectively the “book” capital accounts of the holders of existing shares with any unrealized gain or loss in the trust’s assets this will result in the allocation of items of the trust’s income gain loss deduction and credit to existing holders of shares to account for the difference between the tax basis and fair market value of property owned by the trust at the time new shares are issued or old shares are redeemed “reverse section c allocations” the intended effect of these allocations is to allocate any builtin gain or loss in the trusts assets at the time of a creation or redemption of shares to the investors that economically have earned such gain or loss        table of contents     as with the other allocations described above the trust generally will use a monthly convention for purposes of the reverse section c allocations more specifically the trust generally will credit or debit respectively the “book” capital accounts of holders of existing shares with any unrealized gain or loss in the trust’s assets based on the lowest fair market value of the assets and shares respectively during the month in which the creation or redemption transaction takes place rather than the fair market value at the time of such creation or redemption the “monthly revaluation convention” as a result it is possible that for us federal income tax purposes  a purchaser of newly issued shares will be allocated some or all of the unrealized gain in the trust’s assets at the time it acquires the shares or  an existing holder of shares will not be allocated its entire share in the unrealized loss in the trust’s assets at the time of such acquisition furthermore the applicable treasury regulations generally require that the “book” capital accounts will be adjusted based on the fair market value of partnership property on the date of adjustment and do not explicitly allow the adoption of a monthly revaluation convention   the code and applicable treasury regulations generally require that items of partnership income and deductions be allocated between transferors and transferees of partnership interests on a daily basis and that adjustments to “book” capital accounts be made based on the fair market value of partnership property on the date of adjustment final treasury regulations generally permit publicly traded partnerships like the trust to use monthly allocation conventions similar to those used by the trust for taxable years beginning on or after august   but they do not specifically authorize the monthly reallocation convention or all aspects of the monthly allocation convention that the trust has adopted if the irs does not accept the trust’s monthly allocation or monthly revaluation conventions the irs may contend that taxable income or losses of the trust must be reallocated among the holders of shares if such a contention were sustained the holders’ respective tax liabilities would be adjusted to the possible detriment of certain holders the trustee is authorized to revise the trust’s allocation and revaluation methods in order to comply with applicable law or to allocate items of partnership income and deductions in a manner that reflects more accurately the holders’ interest in the trust   section  election   the trust intends to make the election permitted by section  of the code such an election is irrevocable without the consent of the irs these elections generally will require each purchaser of shares to adjust its proportionate share of the tax basis in the trust’s assets “inside basis” to fair market value as reflected in the purchase price for the purchaser’s shares as if the purchaser had acquired a direct interest in the trusts assets these adjustments are attributed solely to a purchaser of shares and are not added to the tax basis of the trusts assets associated with other holders of shares generally the section  election is intended to eliminate the disparity between a purchaser’s outside basis in its shares and the trust’s corresponding inside basis in its assets such that the amount of gain or loss that will be allocated to the purchaser on the disposition by the trust of its assets for example on the expiration or disposition of an index futures position will correspond to the purchaser’s share in the appreciation or depreciation in the value of such assets since the purchaser acquired its shares depending on the relationship between a holder’s purchase price for shares and its interest in the unadjusted share of the trust’s inside basis at the time of the purchase the section  election may be either advantageous or disadvantageous to the holder as compared to the amount of gain or loss a holder would be allocated absent the section  election   the calculations under section  are complex and there is little legal authority concerning the mechanics of the calculations particularly in the context of publicly traded interests in partnerships to help reduce the complexity of those calculations and the resulting administrative costs to the trust the trust will apply certain assumptions and conventions in determining and allocating the basis adjustments it is possible that the irs will successfully assert that the assumptions and conventions utilized by the trust do not satisfy the technical requirements of the code or the treasury regulations and will require different basis adjustments to be made if such different adjustments were required some holders could be adversely affected   in order to make the basis adjustments permitted by section  the trust will be required to obtain information regarding each holder’s secondary market transactions in shares as well as creations and redemptions of shares the trust will seek such information from the record holders of shares and by purchasing shares each beneficial owner of shares will be deemed to have consented to the provision of such information by the record owner of such beneficial owner’s shares notwithstanding the foregoing however there can be no guarantee that the trust will be able to obtain such information from record owners or other sources or that the basis adjustments that the trust makes based on the information they are able to obtain will be effective in eliminating disparity between a holder’s outside basis in its shares and its interest in the inside basis in the trust’s assets        table of contents     constructive termination   the trust will experience a constructive termination for tax purposes if there is a sale or exchange of  or more of the total shares within a month period although the trust would continue to exist as a delaware statutory trust a constructive termination would among other things result in the closing of the trust’s taxable year for all holders of shares a constructive termination occurring on a date other than december  would result in the trust filing two tax returns and each holder of shares could receive two schedules k for one calendar year however pursuant to an irs relief procedure for publicly traded partnerships that have constructively terminated the irs may allow the trust to provide a single schedule k to each holder of shares for the tax year in which the termination occurs in the case of a holder of shares reporting on a taxable year other than a fiscal year ending december  the closing of the trust’s taxable year may result in more than  months of its taxable income or loss being includable in its taxable income for the year of termination the trust would be required to make new tax elections after a termination including a new election under section  a termination could also result in penalties if the trust were unable to determine that the termination had occurred   other matters   borrowing of shares   if your shares are borrowed or rehypothecated by your broker and sold to a third party for example as part of a loan to a “short seller” to cover a short sale of shares you may be considered as having disposed of those shares if so you would no longer be a beneficial owner of a pro rata portion of the shares during the period of the loan and may recognize gain or loss from the disposition in addition during the period of the loan  the trust’s income gain loss deduction or other items with respect to those shares would not be reported by you and  any cash distributions received by you with respect to those shares could be fully taxable likely as ordinary income accordingly if you desire to avoid the risk of income recognition from a loan of your shares you should modify any applicable brokerage account agreements to prohibit your broker from borrowing your shares   these rules should not affect the amount or timing of items of income gain deduction or loss reported by a taxpayer that is a dealer in securities that marks the shares to market for us federal income tax purposes or a trader in securities that has elected to use the marktomarket method of tax accounting with respect to the shares   information reporting with respect to shares   as described above under “— classification of the trust ” as a result of statements by the irs on the classification of trusts similar to the trust the trust files a partnership return rather than a trust return   tax information will be reported to investors on an irs schedule k for each calendar year as soon as practicable after the end of each such year but in no event later than march  each schedule k provided to a holder of shares will set forth the holder’s share of the trust’s items of income gain deduction loss and credit for such year in a manner sufficient for a us holder to complete its tax return with respect to its investment in the shares   each holder by its acquisition of shares will be deemed to agree to allow brokers and nominees to provide to the trust its name and address and such other information and forms as may be reasonably requested by the trust for purposes of complying with their tax reporting and withholding obligations and to waive any confidentiality rights with respect to such information and forms for such purpose and to provide such information or forms upon request   as described above under “partnership allocations and adjustments—monthly allocation and revaluation conventions” the partnership tax rules generally require that items of partnership income and deductions be allocated between transferors and transferees of partnership interests on a daily basis and that certain adjustments be made based on daily valuations if the irs does not accept the trust’s monthly allocation conventions the irs may contend that taxable income or losses of the trust must be reallocated among investors if such a contention were sustained investors’ respective tax liabilities would be adjusted to the possible detriment of certain investors the trustee is authorized to revise the trust’s allocation methods to comply with applicable law   reportable transactions   treasury regulations require us taxpayers to report certain types of transactions to the irs “reportable transactions” under these regulations a us holder who disposes of shares and recognizes a loss with respect to such disposition in excess of certain thresholds would be required to report the loss on form  reportable transaction statement the loss threshold is  million in any single taxable year or  million in any combination of taxable years for corporations and  million in any single taxable year or  million in any combination of taxable years for most partnerships individuals s corporations or trusts you should consult with your tax advisor regarding any tax filing and reporting obligation that may apply in connection with acquiring owning and disposing of shares        table of contents     tax audits   under the code adjustments in tax liability with respect to the trust’s items generally will be made at the trust level in a partnership proceeding rather than in separate proceedings with each shareholder the sponsor will represent the trust as its “tax matters partner” during any audit and in any dispute with the irs each shareholder will be informed of the commencement of an audit of the trust in general the tax matters partner may enter into a settlement agreement with the irs on behalf of and that is binding upon the shareholders   adjustments resulting from an irs audit may require each shareholder to adjust a prior year’s liability and possibly may result in an audit of such shareholders return any audit of a shareholder’s return could result in adjustments not related to the trust’s returns as well as those related to the trust’s returns   the tax matters partner will make some elections on the trust’s behalf and on behalf of the trust’s shareholders in addition the tax matters partner can extend the statute of limitations for assessment of tax deficiencies against the trust’s shareholders for items in the trust’s returns the tax matters partner may bind a shareholder with less than a  profits interest in the trust to a settlement with the irs unless that shareholder elects by filing a statement with the irs not to give that authority to the tax matters partner the tax matters partner may seek judicial review by which all shareholders are bound of a final partnership administrative adjustment and if the tax matters partner fails to seek judicial review judicial review may be sought by any shareholder having at least a  interest in profits or by any group of shareholders having in the aggregate at least a  interest in profits however only one action for judicial review will go forward and each shareholder with an interest in the outcome may participate   pursuant to the bipartisan budget act of  significant changes are being made to the rules applicable to us federal income tax audits of partnerships under the new rules which are generally effective for the trust’s taxable years beginning after december   if the irs makes audit adjustments to the trusts us federal income tax returns it may collect any resulting taxes including any applicable penalties and interest directly from the trust the trust may have the ability to shift any such tax liability to the sponsor and the trusts shareholders in accordance with their interests in the trust during the year under audit but there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so in which case the current shareholders would economically bear the burden of the tax even if they were not shareholders during the year under audit or if they had a different percentage interest in the trust in that year if the trust is required to make payments of taxes penalties and interest resulting from audit adjustments the cash available for distribution to the trusts shareholders might be substantially reduced the changes created by the new partnership audit rules are sweeping and in many respects dependent on the promulgation of future regulations or other guidance by the irs or the us treasury department investors in the shares are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding these changes and their potential impact   taxexempt organizations   an organization that is otherwise exempt from us federal income tax generally is nonetheless subject to taxation with respect to its “unrelated business taxable income” “ubti” except as noted below with respect to certain categories of exempt income ubti generally includes income or gain derived either directly or through a partnership from a trade or business the conduct of which is substantially unrelated to the exercise or performance of the organization’s exempt purpose or function ubti generally does not include passive investment income such as dividends interest and capital gains whether realized by the organization directly or indirectly through a partnership such as the trust in which it is a partner however if a taxexempt entity’s acquisition of a partnership interest is debtfinanced or the partnership incurs “acquisition indebtedness” all or a portion of the income or gain attributable to the “debtfinanced property” would also be included in ubti regardless of whether such income would otherwise be excluded as dividends interest or capital gains the income of the trust will be passive investment income generally excluded from ubti and the trust will not incur “acquisition indebtedness” thus if you are a taxexempt entity and your acquisition of the shares is not debtfinanced income with respect to the shares will not be ubti        table of contents     regulated investment companies   regulated investment companies “rics” such as mutual funds are subject to a  annual gross income test and must satisfy certain diversification requirements with respect to their assets generally at the close of each quarter of the taxable year under the income test at least  of a ric’s gross income must be derived from dividends interest payments with respect to certain securities loans gains from the sale or other disposition of stock or securities or foreign currencies or other income derived with respect to its business of investing in stock securities or currencies “ric qualifying income” in general income and gains from investments in commodities and futures contracts do not qualify as ric qualifying income very generally under the diversification test at the close of each quarter of a ric’s taxable year at least  of the value of its assets must be made up of cash government securities and securities of other issuers and no more than  of the value of its assets may be invested in the securities of a single issuer   special rules apply to investments held by a ric in a qualified publicly traded partnership “qptp” a partnership that is publicly traded will qualify as a qptp unless  or more of its gross income consists of income that would if realized by a ric count towards the  income requirement described above if a ric holds interests in a partnership that is a qptp qualifying income for purposes of the  gross income test includes net income derived from interests in the qptp and the  asset limitation described above applies to the equity securities of the qptp if a ric holds interests in a partnership that is not a qptp then the ric is generally required to look through to its distributable share of the partnership’s gross income for purposes of applying the income test the irs has ruled in certain circumstances that a ric also should look through to the assets of a partnership that is not a qptp for purposes of the diversification test   as described above under “classification of the trust” the trust files a partnership tax return and takes the position that it is treated as a partnership for tax purposes consequently the trust would generally be treated as a publicly traded partnership as such the trust would qualify as a qptp if less than  of the trust’s annual gross income constitutes interest gain from the disposition of securities or other ric qualifying income in that case only the ric’s share of the trust’s net income would be included in applying the qualified income test and the ric would be subject to the  asset limitation described above with respect to its investment in the shares   the trust would not qualify as a qptp if  or more of the trust’s annual gross income constitutes interest gains from the disposition of securities or other ric qualifying income in that case the ric would generally be required to look through to its distributable share of the trust’s gross income for purposes of applying the income test holders that are rics should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the diversification test to their investment in the shares   consequently whether the shares qualify as interests in a qptp depends on the type of income recognized by the trust because the trust’s income depends on the type of investments the trust makes and the frequency of the trust’s dispositions of investments and may change over time no determination can be provided whether the shares constitute interests in a qptp however the sponsor will provide information on its website at wwwisharescom on a monthly basis on the composition of the trust’s gross income and assets and will also provide an annual income and asset statement in order to enable a us holder that is a ric to make an independent determination regarding the status of the trust as a qptp   taxation of nonus holders of shares   as used herein the term “nonus holder” means a beneficial owner of shares that is not a us holder the trust will conduct its activities in such a manner that a nonus holder of the shares who is not otherwise carrying on a trade or business in the united states will not be considered to be engaged in a trade or business in the united states as a result of an investment in the shares   thus if you are a nonus holder interest income allocable to you generally will be considered shortterm interest not subject to us withholding or income tax or “portfolio interest” not subject to  us federal income or withholding tax provided that i with respect to “portfolio interest”  you do not actually or constructively own  or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote of the clearing fcm in the case of interest income on amounts deposited with the clearing fcm or to the extent collateral assets consist of other corporate securities  or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote of the issuer of such securities  you are not a controlled foreign corporation for us federal income tax purposes that is related to the clearing fcm or such issuer as applicable through stock ownership and  you certify on irs form wben or successor form under penalties of perjury that you are not a us person and provide your name and address and otherwise satisfy applicable documentation requirements or ii with respect to any interest paid after june   other than generally interest on debt outstanding on july   you hold the shares through a foreign financial institution or entity that has entered into an agreement with the us government to collect and provide to the us tax authorities information about its accountholders including certain investors in such institution or entity and if required you have provided the withholding agent with a certification identifying your direct and indirect us owners        table of contents     subject to the discussion below you generally will not be subject to us federal income tax on gains on the sale of the shares or on your share of the trust’s gains however in the case of an individual nonus holder such holder will be subject to us federal income tax on gains on the sale of shares or such holder’s share of the trust’s gains if such nonus holder is present in the united states for  days or more during a taxable year and certain other conditions are met even if you are eligible for a lower treaty rate you will be subject to a  withholding tax rather than the lower treaty rate on dividend payments to you unless you have provided the withholding agent with an irs form wben or other documentary evidence establishing your entitlement to the lower treaty rate with respect to such payments   if you are subject to withholding in respect of interest dividends or gross proceeds paid with respect to your shares you may be able to obtain a refund of or credit for any amounts withheld in excess of the applicable rate holders are encouraged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the possible implications of these withholding requirements on their investment in the shares   each holder by its acquisition of shares will be deemed to agree to allow brokers and nominees to provide to the trust its name and address and such other information and forms as may be reasonably requested by the trust for purposes of complying with their tax reporting and withholding obligations and to waive any confidentiality rights with respect to such information and forms for such purpose and to provide such information or forms upon request   foreign account tax compliance   the foreign account tax compliance provisions of the hiring incentives to restore employment act “hire” enacted in  generally impose a reporting regime and potentially a  withholding tax with respect to certain us source income including dividends and interest and gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of property that can produce us source interest or dividends “withholdable payments” as a general matter the rules are designed to require us persons’ direct and indirect ownership of nonus accounts and nonus entities to be reported to the irs the  withholding tax regime applies if there is a failure to provide required information regarding us ownership   the rules subject a nonus holder’s share of withholdable payments and a portion of other payments from nonus entities who have entered into ffi agreements as defined below “passthru payments” to  withholding tax unless such holder provides information representations and waivers of nonus law as may be required to comply with the provisions of the rules a nonus holder that is treated as a “foreign financial institution” is generally subject to withholding unless it enters into an agreement a “ffi agreement” with the irs with respect to the foregoing including reporting certain information to the irs regarding its us accountholders and those of its affiliates the withholding rules generally apply to us source payments made after june   to gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition after december   of property that can produce us source interest or dividends and to other passthru payments made after the later of december   or the date that final regulations defining the term “foreign passthru payment” become effective   the application of the withholding rules to a sale or other disposition of an interest in a partnership is unclear but it is possible that the gross proceeds of the sale or other disposal of an interest in the trust will be subject to tax under the withholding rules if such proceeds are treated as an indirect disposal of the nonus holder’s interest in assets that can produce us source interest or dividends unless the selling nonus holder provides appropriate reporting information holders should consult their own advisors regarding the requirements under hire with respect to their own situation   backup withholding   the trust is required in certain circumstances to backup withhold on certain payments paid to noncorporate holders of shares who do not furnish to the trust their correct taxpayer identification number in the case of individuals their social security number and certain certifications or who are otherwise subject to backup withholding backup withholding is not an additional tax any amounts withheld from payments made to you may be refunded or credited against your us federal income tax liability if any provided that the required information is timely furnished to the irs        table of contents     erisa and related considerations   erisa and the code impose certain restrictions on a employee benefit plans as defined in section  of erisa that are subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of erisa as set forth in title i thereof b plans described

constitute a transaction prohibited under section  of erisa or section  of the code  eg  the indirect transfer to or use by or for the benefit of a party in interest or disqualified person of assets of a plan such transactions may be subject to one or more statutory or administrative exemptions such as section b of erisa and section d of the code which exempt certain transactions with nonfiduciary service providers prohibited transaction class exemption “ptce”  which exempts certain transactions involving insurance company pooled separate accounts ptce  which exempts certain transactions involving bank collective investment funds ptce  which exempts certain transactions effected on behalf of a plan by a “qualified professional asset manager” ptce  which exempts certain transactions involving insurance company general accounts ptce which exempts certain transactions effected on behalf of a plan by an “inhouse asset manager” even if all of the conditions specified in one of the foregoing exemptions were satisfied however there can be no assurance that such exemption would apply to all of the prohibited transactions that could be deemed to arise in connection with a plan’s purchase of shares   because of the possibility that a prohibited transaction could occur as a result of the transfer of index futures between a plan and an authorized participant no such transfer shall occur unless such transfer will not constitute or result in a nonexempt prohibited transaction under section  of erisa or section  of the code accordingly each plan and its fiduciary will be deemed to have represented in connection with a transfer of index futures between the plan and an authorized participant that such transfer will not constitute or result in a nonexempt prohibited transaction by reason of one of the statutory or administrative exemptions described above or another applicable exemption   plan asset rules   under section  of erisa and regulations issued by the us department of labor the “dol” at  cfr section  together with section  of erisa the “plan asset rules” as a general rule the underlying assets and properties of corporations partnerships trusts and certain other entities in which a plan purchases an “equity interest” will be deemed for purposes of the fiduciary responsibility provisions of erisa and section  of the code to be assets of the investing plan unless certain exceptions apply the plan asset rules define an “equity interest” as any interest in an entity other than an instrument that is treated as indebtedness under applicable local law and which has no substantial equity features the shares should be treated as “equity interests” for purposes of these rules   one exception provides that an investing plan’s assets will not include any of the underlying assets of an entity if the equity interest acquired by the plan is a “publiclyoffered security” a publiclyoffered security is defined in the plan asset rules as a security that a is freely transferable b is part of a class of securities that is owned by  or more investors independent of the issuer and of one another and c either i part of a class of securities registered under section b or section g of the exchange act or ii sold to the plan as part of an offering of securities to the public pursuant to an effective registration statement under the securities act and the class of securities of which such security is a part is registered under the exchange act within  days or such later time as may be allowed by the sec after the end of the fiscal year of the issuer during which the public offering occurred        table of contents     it is anticipated that the shares will constitute publiclyoffered securities under the plan asset rules accordingly shares purchased by a plan but not the assets held in the trust should be treated as assets of the plan for purposes of applying the fiduciary responsibility provisions of erisa and section  of the code   general investment considerations   any plan fiduciary that proposes to cause a plan to purchase shares should consult with its counsel with respect to the potential applicability of erisa and the code to such investment and determine on its own whether any exceptions to or exemptions from the prohibited transaction provisions of erisa and the code are applicable and whether all conditions of any such exceptions or exemptions have been satisfied moreover each plan fiduciary should consider the fiduciary standards under erisa in the context of the plan’s particular circumstances before authorizing an investment of a portion of such plan’s assets in the shares accordingly such fiduciary should consider i whether the investment satisfies the diversification requirements of section ac of erisa ii whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan as required by section ad of erisa and iii whether the investment is prudent under erisa   certain employee benefit plans including nonus pension plans governmental plans established or maintained in the united states as defined in section  of erisa and church plans as defined in section  of erisa for which no election has been made under section d of the code are not subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of erisa or section  of the code however any such plan that is qualified and exempt from taxation under sections a and a of the code may nonetheless be subject to the prohibited transaction rules set forth in section  of the code also some nonus plans and governmental plans may be subject to nonus laws or us federal state or local laws that are to a material extent similar to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of erisa or section  of the code each fiduciary of a plan subject to such a similar law should make its own determination as to whether an investment in the shares complies with all applicable requirements under such law   the sale of shares to a plan is in no respect a representation by the trust the sponsor an authorized participant or any other person that such an investment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by plans generally or any particular plan or that such an investment is appropriate for plans generally or any particular plan        table of

shares to its customers or if it chooses to couple the creation of a supply of new shares with an active selling effort involving solicitation of secondary market demand for the shares a determination of whether a particular market participant is an underwriter must take into account all the facts and circumstances pertaining to the activities of the brokerdealer or its client in the particular case and the examples mentioned above should not be considered a complete description of all the activities that would lead to designation as an underwriter and subject them to the prospectusdelivery

other factors the trading price of the shares on nyse arca the nav and the supply of and demand for the shares at the time of the offer shares initially comprising the same basket but offered by authorized participants to the public at different times may have different offering prices the excess if any of the price at which an authorized participant sells a share in respect of which it is acting as a statutory underwriter over the price paid by that authorized participant in connection with the creation of that share in a basket may be deemed to be underwriting compensation however such underwriting compensation together with any other underwriting compensation received in connection with the offering if any will not exceed  of the gross proceeds in accordance with finra conduct rule    the trust will not pay a selling commission or any other compensation to any authorized participant in connection with the creation of baskets investors that purchase shares through a

    table of contents     the commodity futures markets   futures contracts on physical commodities and commodity indices are traded on regulated futures exchanges and physical commodities and other derivatives on physical commodities and commodity indices are traded in the overthecounter market and on various types of physical and electronic trading facilities and markets at present all of the contracts included in the index are exchangetraded futures contracts an exchangetraded futures contract provides for the purchase and sale of a specified type and quantity of a commodity or financial instrument during a stated delivery month for a fixed price a futures contract on an index of commodities provides for the payment and receipt of cash based on the level of the index at settlement or liquidation of the contract a futures contract provides for a specified settlement month in which the cash settlement is made or in which the commodity or financial instrument is to be delivered by the seller whose position is described as “short” and acquired by the purchaser whose position is described as “long”   there is no purchase price paid or received on the purchase or sale of a futures contract instead an amount of cash or cash equivalents must be deposited with the broker as “initial margin” this amount varies based on the requirements imposed by the exchange clearing houses this margin deposit provides collateral for the obligations of the parties to the futures contract   by depositing margin which may vary in form depending on the exchange with the clearing house or broker involved a market participant may be able to earn interest on its margin funds thereby increasing the total return that it may realize from an investment in futures contracts the market participant normally makes to and receives from the broker subsequent daily payments as the price of the futures contract fluctuates these payments are called “variation margin” and are made as the existing positions in the futures contract become more or less valuable a process known as “marking to the market”   futures contracts are traded on organized exchanges known as “contract markets” in the united states at any time prior to the expiration of a futures contract subject to the availability of a liquid secondary market a trader may elect to close out its position by taking an opposite position on the exchange on which the trader obtained the position this operates to terminate the position and fix the trader’s profit or loss futures contracts are cleared through the facilities of a centralized clearing house and a brokerage firm referred to as a “futures commission merchant” which is a member of the clearing house the clearing house guarantees the performance of each clearing member that is a party to a futures contract by in effect taking the opposite side of the transaction clearing houses do not guarantee the performance by clearing members of their obligations to their customers   unlike equity securities futures contracts by their terms have stated expirations and at a specified point in time prior to expiration trading in a futures contract for the current delivery month will cease as a result a market participant wishing to maintain its exposure to a futures contract on a particular commodity with the nearest expiration must close out its position in the expiring contract and establish a new position in the contract for the next delivery month a process referred to as “rolling” for example a market participant with a long position in november crude oil futures that wishes to maintain a position in the nearest delivery month will as the november contract nears expiration sell november futures which serves to close out the existing long position and buy december futures this will “roll” the november position into a december position and when the november contract expires the market participant will still have a long position in the nearest delivery month   futures exchanges and clearing houses in the united states are subject to regulation by the cftc the exchange may adopt rules and take other actions that affect trading including imposing speculative position limits maximum price fluctuations and trading halts and suspensions and requiring liquidation of contracts in certain circumstances see “risk factors—risk factors relating to the trust—exchange position limits and other rules may restrict the creation of baskets and the operation of the trust”   futures markets outside the united states are generally
