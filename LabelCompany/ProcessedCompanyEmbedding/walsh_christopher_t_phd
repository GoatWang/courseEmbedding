christopher a walsh laboratory  research on developmental disorders of the brain     about us   walsh lab members and alumni represent varying academic and cultural backgrounds we come from many us states and other countries around the world including canada china india iraq italy japan korea lebanon and saudi arabia   » lab members and alumni   » news and announcements   » research support     lab members and alumni  back to list christopher a walsh md phd dr christopher walsh completed his bs degree at bucknell university in chemistry and his md  and phd  in neurobiology at the university of chicago  after completing his residencies at massachusetts general hospital dr walsh became a postdoctoral fellow at harvard medical school  during his fellowship he performed some of the first direct studies of cell lineage and cell migration in the developing cortex of mammals  dr walsh established his own lab in  the goal of which is to identify and analyze the genes that regulate the development and normal function of the human cerebral cortex  most of the genetic work of the lab has benefited from worldwide collaborations especially with physicians in countries where marriage between cousins is common because this creates genetic effects that greatly simplify the identification of rare recessive mutations   as chief of the genetics division at childrens hospital boston dr walsh is working to leverage his labs gene discovery efforts to harness new technology to improve genetic diagnosis in the clinical setting as well as to collaborate with other members of the division to develop improved treatments for children with neurological disorders   since establishing his lab in  dr walsh has been fortunate to receive a number of awards including the derek dennybrown award american neurological association dreiffuspenry epilepsy award american academy of neurology jacob javits distinguished investigator award national institute of neurological disorders and stroke epilepsy research award american epilepsy society and jacoby research award american neurological association  in  he was elected a fellow of the american association for the advancement of science in  drwalsh was elected to the institute of medicine   dr walsh is bullard professor of neurology at harvard medical school chief of the division of genetics at childrens hospital boston investigator of the howard hughes medical institute at childrens hospital boston and the former director of the harvardmit mdphd program      christopher a walsh laboratory all rights reserved home  about us

disorders in many of these conditions the brain does not develop normally before birth these can be called brain malformations or malformations of cortical development   » services   » staff   » appointments   » clinic directions     services brain development and genetics clinic the brain development and genetics brdg clinic is designed to bridge the services of neurology and genetics and provide a multidisciplinary approach to diagnosing treating and counseling patients with brain malformations as well as their families brain malformations or malformations of cortical development are disorders in which the brain does not develop normally before birth they can arise from many different genetic or nongenetic causes in some cases brain malformations can be due to a genetic change mutation that is inherited in a family while in other cases they can result from nongenetic problems during pregnancy such as certain maternal infections the diagnosis of a brain malformation often leaves families with many questions and looking for more information these conditions are rare and information about them is often hard to find the brdg clinic combines our specialties of neurology genetics genetic counseling and research to provide a comprehensive approach to working with children and adults with brain malformations and to help address their unanswered questions our team of

hadnt selected the course and knew nothing about psychology but fortunately he decided to sign up the teacher was alan leshner who later directed the national institute on drug abuse and now publishes the journal science he got me really excited about neuroscience says walsh who had gone to college with no clue about what i wanted to do after walshs freshman year his brotherinlaw a neurosurgical resident found him a summer job at columbia universitys neurological institute of new york working for neuroradiologist sadek hilal the same summer the institute acquired its first ct scanner i still remember dr hilal holding up one of the pictures and saying this is the future of neurology walsh recalls these two events were pivotal to his career walsh says today he is an expert on the development of the cerebral cortex and the developmental missteps that produce mental retardation after walsh graduated in chemistry in  he entered the university of chicagos mdphd program interested in brain chemistry and disorders such as schizophrenia but when he began to study brain development he was struck by the similarity between the brains physical structure and philosopher immanuel kants ideas about the structure of perception which he had encountered during a college course i became interested in the fact that the structure of consciousness is built out of biological nuts and bolts walsh explains little was known about brain construction when walsh became a postdoc at harvard medical school after completing his internship and residencies therefore he decided to label cells in the developing brain to see where they ended up at that time it was thought that a dividing cell gave rise to a patch of similar cells that remained in that location but that proved to be only partly true to my complete surprise we saw some daughter cells being scattered as far as the eye could see walsh says other scientists were skeptical of this finding which walsh and colleagues reported in science in  but over the next  years the paper became very influential scientists now know that excitatory neurons cluster together during brain development but that inhibitory neurons migrate to other parts of the brain nature has found it easier to make the inhibitory neurons for the entire forebrain in one place and then cause these cells to migrate far and wide than to form similar cell types in multiple places walsh says when walsh established his own lab in  he was unsure how to combine basic science with medicine but after hearing a former professors talk about an inherited brain malformation walsh decided to study human genetics and he began to look for genes that affect neuronal migration by studying children who suffer from double cortex syndrome in which an extraneous cortex forms beneath the cerebral cortex his group discovered its first new gene for a human disease dubbed doublecortin this gene encodes a signaling protein that structures the cellular skeleton of neurons when it is faulty neurons that should migrate long distances through the developing brain get stuck en route forming the second cortex the patients—usually girls because this recessive gene lies on the x chromosome—have epilepsy and mental retardation this discovery was a major highlight for me because of the tremendous logic of genetics walsh says you focus on a disorder for a long period and then come up with a very simple explanation in terms of mutations in a specific gene while it is difficult to envision therapies for gross malformations of the brain walsh adds having a genetic diagnosis can help families decide whether to bear more children having a disabled child is so defining for many families he says to get an understanding of where the disorder came from—whether it is inherited or more commonly a spontaneous mutation—can be very useful over the years his group has discovered many more genes that affect neuronal migration and cause severe malformations when faulty for example they isolated a gene called aspm which controls brain size when aspm is mutated the human brain grows to only about half its normal size walshs group and others subsequently showed that this gene has changed markedly during primate evolution as the brain has become bigger an interest in developing better therapies has driven him to investigate the genetics of intellectual disabilities and autism spectrum disorders as well since in these conditions the brain appears generally normal in its shape and size so that therapies intended to make the brain function better look promising doing disease genetics gives you moments of discovery because you start with an inherited disorder track the gene to a particular neighborhood of the genome find the gene and then determine the specific changes in that gene that result in the disorder looking back over this work walsh is surprised by the number of things that can go wrong with brain development but the brain uses  to  genes and nature has probably put them all there for good reason he says we try very hard to categorize the disorders of kids as precisely as we can someday i expect we will understand that say autism is hundreds of different disorders to better understand that complex disease walsh is collaborating with physicians in countries such as turkey and saudi arabia where families are large and people often marry distant relatives increasing the risk of genetic disease he actively recruits collaborators at international scientific meetings but sometimes finds them closer to home he recently gave a talk at his alma mater on a malformation of the brains right but not left hemisphere which he had observed in one family afterward a classmate from medical school said she was treating three siblings with the same condition so two families are now available for study in  their lab described mutations that can disrupt the development of just one hemisphere of the brain while the other appears to develop and function normally and found that some of these mutations are present in brain cells but not always in the blood of the same patient the idea that different cells in the body have different genomes from one another has become an increasing focus of his lab walshs world is now expanding beyond the brain thanks to a new collaboration with geneticist and cardiologist ming hui chen also on the harvard faculty chen is walshs wife and the mother of their  and yearold girls since some brain disorders include cardiac effects the couple is studying filamin a which has been implicated in neuronal migration in december  they reported that this protein is needed to establish junctions between cells in the developing heart and blood vessels those moments of insight are

medical school  boston massachusetts year  subject chemistry award benjamin franklin medal citation for seminal studies at the interface of chemistry biology and medicine that revolutionized the development of antibiotics for the treatment of disease and provided the foundation for the new field of chemical biology during the past two centuries as sciences tools and techniques have become ever more refined so have scientists become increasingly focused and specialized in their individual careers the generalists of the past the galileos and ben franklins whose interests and talents ranged across a broad spectrum of knowledge have little place in a world that demands specialists who can focus narrowly on one field or even on a single scientific problem but there are notable exceptions—scientists who resist being restricted to defined boundaries between scientific disciplines such scientists recognize the principle of what biologist e o wilson calls consilience—the essential ultimate unity and commonality of all fields of knowledge one such scientist is christopher walsh who has spent his life working at the interface of biology chemistry and medicineafter earning his phd at the rockefeller university walsh began his career as a postdoc at brandeis university he worked under robert abeles with whom he studied enzymology specifically the mechanisms of enzyme inhibition he took a position at mit in  where he extended his work on enzymes to investigate suicide substrates a special class of enzyme inhibitors these along with other enzymeinhibiting mechanisms he developed were instrumental in the creation of new and useful drugs he also studied and elucidated previously unknown enzymatic transformations such as flavindependent redox active cofactors in all of this work walsh was approaching the study of biological mechanisms through a chemistrytinted lens laying the groundwork for the new discipline of chemical biologyin  after five years as chair of the mit chemistry department walsh took on a new position with a title indicative of the broadranging character of his work chair of the department of biological chemistry and molecular pharmacology at harvard medical school he built on his earlier research on enzymatic processes to look at the workings of antibiotics and antitumor drugs exploring ways to combat the evergrowing problem of antibiotic and drug resistance when other drugs fail to stop lifethreatening bacterial infections such as mrsa the traditional last resort has been vancomycin despite its dangerous side effects and toxicity in recent years even this powerful pharmaceutical weapon has been compromised by increasing bacterial resistance probing into the new antidrug defenses evolved by bacteria walsh found that five different genes were needed to create vancomycin resistance and isolated and characterized all of them this new understanding promises the development of a new family of vancomycin derivatives that can overwhelm the newlyresistant bacterial strainswalsh has continued to perform vitally important research on the action resistance mechanisms and biosynthesis of antibiotics including the identification of the nonribosomal peptide synthase nrps and polyketide synthase pks pathways through which biologically active small molecules are formed such knowledge is crucial both for the improvement and refinement of existing drugs but also for the synthesis of new pharmaceuticals with enhanced bettertargeted therapeutic characteristicswalsh has served as president and ceo of the dana farber cancer institute  as a member of the scientific review board of hhmi and the national academy of sciences among many other prestigious organizations and as a consultant to major pharmaceutical companies he is now hamilton kuhn distinguished professor at harvard medical school walsh’s first book enzymatic reaction mechanisms published in  is widely recognized as a classic in its field as are his two succeeding volumes he has published more than  papers and he has trained a whole new generation of chemical biologistsfrom its beginning to the present day christopher walshs career has been about bringing together disparate pieces of knowledge from different and sometimes unexpected sources—and how much as the enzymatic mechanisms he studies new and important reactions are created in the process walsh himself has made perhaps the most apt observation of his own scientific impact as befits an enzymologist my contributions have been
