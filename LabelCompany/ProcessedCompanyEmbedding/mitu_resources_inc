condition and results of operations of this form k mitu resources inc expressly does not undertake any duty to update forwardlooking statements part i item  business overview we are a startup exploration stage mining company with one mineral claim the mitu gold claim in the republic of colombia our goal is to generate revenues through the sale of gold found and extracted from this claim we have a specific business plan to complete exploration work on this claim and have no reason to alter this plan within the next twelve months the company has no subsidiaries affiliates or joint venture partners we do not intend to enter into a merger or acquisition have not been involved in any large purchases other than that of the mitu gold claim and have not been involved in any reclassification bankruptcy or receivership since inception mitu resources inc was incorporated under the laws of the state of nevada april   by juan perez and another former officer to acquire and develop gold properties we acquired the mitu gold claim from alvarez explorations inc alvarez located in the republic of the colombia on april  for the sum of  the only terms between the company and alvarez are the payment of the purchase price by the company to alvarez and the transfer of the mitu gold claim from alvarez to the company the mitu gold claim is our only mineral claim and only material asset in april  we engaged a mining consultant jorge villaneuva to develop a technical report for the development of the mitu claim mr villaneuva has proposed a two phase exploration program of this property but no exploration has yet been carried out there are no operations underway no facilities other than the principal executive offices and no employees other than the two executive officers assuming we can raise the necessary capital we intend to carry out the exploration program proposed on the mitu claim there is the distinct possibility that we will not only fail to raise the capital but fail to find a commercially viable ore body there is no guarantee that gold or any other substance of significant value will be found we currently do not have any ore body products or revenues we lease our principal executive offices at cll b c bogota colombia our telephone number is  emerging growth company we are an emerging growth company as defined in the jumpstart our business startups jobs act we shall continue to be deemed an emerging growth company until the earliest of a the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer during which it had total annual gross revenues of  as such amount is indexed for inflation every  years by the commission to reflect the change in the consumer price index for all urban consumers published by the bureau of labor statistics setting the threshold to the

accelerated filer as defined in section b  of title  code of federal regulations or any successor thereto as an emerging growth company we are exempt from section b of regulation sk section a requires issuers to publish information in their annual reports concerning the scope and adequacy of the internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting this statement shall also assess the effectiveness of such internal controls and procedures section b requires that the registered accounting firm shall in the same report attest to and report on the assessment on the effectiveness of the internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting as an emerging growth company we are exempt from section a a and b of the securities exchange act of  which require the shareholder approval of executive compensation and golden parachutes we have elected not to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with any new or revised accounting standards pursuant to section b of the jobs act we will be conducting exploration activities in columbia if the us dollar loses strength to the columbian peso the cop our future operations may be adversely affected there have been no purchases of our equity securities by us since inception regulation of mining activity republic of colombia mining laws we are currently in compliance with all material mining health safety and environmental statutes of the republic of colombia mining regulations in colombia are predicated upon the principle that the subsoil and all mineral resources are property of the state and therefore may only be exploited with the permission of the national mining agency columbian law grants the rights to explore and exploit mining reserves exclusively through mining concession agreements these concession agreements include the exploration construction and exploitation phases and are granted for periods of up to  years the three phases covered by a concession agreement are as follows  exploration this phase has an initial term of three years extendible for time periods of two years up to a maximum of  years during this phase the holder may perform the technical exploration of the concession area  construction once the exploration term lapses the holder may begin the construction of the necessary infrastructure to perform exploitation and related activities this phase has an initial threeyear term which may be extended for one additional year  exploitation during the remainder of the term minus the two previous phases the concession holder will be permitted to perform exploitation activities concession agreements are granted for specific minerals within the concession area however if the holder finds other minerals within the granted area it may request that the mining authorities extend the object of the agreement to include them we hold a concession agreement for the mitu gold claim colombian laws distinguish between the environmental requirements for exploration activities and those that have to be fulfilled for construction and exploitation works during the exploration phase the concession holder does not need any specific environmental permit or license there are no permitting bonding or reclamation requirements for the exploration phase of a concession agreement in order to commence and perform construction and exploitation operations however the concession holder must obtain an environmental license environmental licenses include all the necessary permits and authorizations necessary for the construction and exploitation operations of a mining project in order to obtain an environmental license for a mining project the concession holder must file an environmental impact assessment which includes a description of the project the natural renewable resources to be used and a report of the possible environmental impacts and the measures that are going to be taken to prevent mitigate correct or compensate them the holder must also take out an insurance policy to cover any possible environmental damage the cost of complying with these environmental requirements should we determine to proceed with construction and exploitation operations cannot be determined at this time upon completion of exploration operations if we decide based upon the results of those operations to proceed with construction and exploitation operations we will be in a position to estimate the costs of complying with these environmental requirements we are in compliance with all governmental laws and regulations that bear upon the exploration of the mitu gold claim there are no new regulations the adoption of which is probable that would affect our exploration or exploitation of the mitu gold claim fees are due from the moment the area is declared available for the company rather than from the time the concession contract is signed such fees change based on the size of the concession the fees for the mitu gold claim will be  per hectare per year or about  per year once exploration is complete and the mining infrastructure is in place the concessionaire must begin paying royalties royalties paid to the colombian government consist of a percentage of the primary product and subproducts being exploited for gold the percentage to be paid is four percent any changes to current laws in the republic of colombia may require additional costs and financing these changes are unpredictable and the additional requirements may render certain exploration activities uneconomical and lead to business failure market customers and distribution methods although there can be no assurance large and well capitalized markets are readily available for all metals and precious metals throughout the world a very sophisticated futures market for the pricing and delivery of future production also exists the price for metals is affected by a number of global factors including economic strength and resultant demand for metals for production fluctuating supplies mining activities and production by others in the industry and new and or reduced uses for subject metals the mining industry is highly speculative and of a very high risk nature as such mining activities involve a high degree of risk which even a combination of experience knowledge and careful evaluation may not be able to overcome few mining projects actually become operating mines the mining industry is subject to a number of factors including intense industry competition high susceptibility to economic conditions such as price of metal foreign currency exchange rates and capital and operating costs and political conditions which could affect such things as import and export regulations foreign ownership restrictions furthermore the mining activities are subject to all hazards incidental to mineral exploration development and production as well as risk of damage from earthquakes any of which could result in work stoppages damage to or loss of property and equipment and possible environmental damage hazards such as unusual or unexpected geological formations and other conditions are also involved in mineral exploration and development competition the mineral exploration industry is highly competitive we are a new and exploration stage company and have a weak competitive position in the industry we compete with junior and senior mineral exploration companies independent producers and institutional and individual investors who are actively seeking to acquire mineral exploration properties throughout the world together with the equipment labor and materials required to operate on those properties competition for the acquisition of mineral exploration interests is intense with many mineral exploration leases or concessions available in a competitive bidding process in which we may lack the technological information or expertise available to other bidders many of the mineral exploration companies with which we compete for financing and for the acquisition of mineral exploration properties have greater financial and technical resources than those available to us accordingly these competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on acquiring mineral exploration interests of merit or on exploring or developing their mineral exploration properties this advantage could enable our competitors to acquire mineral exploration properties of greater quality and interest to prospective investors who may choose to finance their additional exploration and development such competition could adversely impact our ability to attain the financing necessary for us to acquire further mineral exploration interests or explore and develop our current or future mineral exploration properties we also compete with other junior mineral exploration companies for financing from a limited number of investors that are prepared to invest in such companies the presence of competing junior mineral exploration companies may impact our ability to raise additional capital in order to fund our acquisition or exploration programs if investors perceive that investments in our competitors are more attractive based on the merit of their mineral exploration properties or the price of the investment opportunity in addition we compete with both junior and senior mineral exploration companies for available resources including but not limited to professional geologists land specialists engineers camp staff helicopters float planes mineral exploration supplies and drill rigs general competitive conditions may be substantially affected by various forms of energy legislation andor regulation introduced from time to time by the governments of columbia the united states and other countries as well as factors beyond our control including international political conditions overall levels of supply and demand for mineral exploration in the face of competition we may not be successful in acquiring exploring or developing profitable gold or mineral properties or interests and we cannot give any assurance that suitable gold or mineral properties or interests will be available for our acquisition exploration or development despite this we hope to compete successfully in the gold or mineral industry by    keeping our costs low    relying on the strength of our managements contacts and  using our size and experience to our advantage by adapting quickly to changing market conditions or responding swiftly to potential opportunities intellectual property none research and development we have not incurred any research and development expenses since our inception reports to security holders we are subject to the reporting and other requirements of the exchange act and we intend to furnish our shareholders annual reports containing financial statements audited by our independent registered public accounting firm and to make available quarterly reports containing unaudited financial statements for each of the first three quarters of each fiscal year we may also file additional documents with the commission if they become necessary in the course of our companys future operations the public may read and copy any materials that we file with the sec at the secs public reference room at  f street ne washington dc  the public may obtain information on the operation of the public reference room by calling the sec at sec the sec maintains an internet site that contains reports proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the sec the address of that site is wwwsecgov environmental regulations we are not aware of any material violations of environmental permits licenses or approvals that have been issued with respect to our future operations we expect to comply with all applicable laws rules and regulations relating to our business and at this time we do not anticipate incurring any material capital expenditures to comply with any environmental regulations or other requirements while our intended projects and business activities do not currently violate any laws any regulatory changes that impose additional restrictions or requirements on us or on our potential customers could adversely affect us by increasing our operating costs or decreasing demand for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our results of future operations item a risk factors please consider the following risk factors before deciding to invest in our common stock any investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below and all other information contained in this report before you decide whether to purchase our common stock the occurrence of any of the following risks could harm our business you may lose part or all of your investment due to any of these risks or uncertainties our stock is speculative and should be purchased only by those who can afford to lose their entire investment risks associated with our company and our industry we are governed by only two people which may lead to faulty corporate governance we have only one director  juan perez  and two executive officers  mr perez and nelson rincon who make all the decisions regarding corporate governance these decisions will include their executive compensation accounting overview related party transactions and so on mr perez will have full control over matters that require board of directors approval this may introduce conflicts of interest and prevent the segregation of executive duties from those that require board of directors approval this may lead to ineffective disclosure and accounting controls noncompliance with laws and regulations may result in fines and penalties they would have the ability to take any action that they review and approve so long as they are the sole shareholders they would exercise control over all matters requiring shareholder approval including significant corporate transactions we have not implemented various corporate governance measures nor have we adopted any independent committees as we presently do not have any independent directors our sole director and executive officers will own a substantial amount of common stock and will have substantial influence over our operations denying an investor an effective voice  mr rincon owns  or  of the  of our outstanding common shares mr perez has  or  of the  outstanding shares together these holdings amount to almost  of our outstanding stock our director and officers are not residents of the united states making the enforcement of liabilities against them difficult  our director and executive officers reside outside the united states in the republic of columbia if a shareholder wishes to sue them for damages the shareholder would have to serve on them a summons and complaint even if personal service is accomplished and a judgement is entered against that person the shareholder would then have to locate the assets of that person and register the judgement in the foreign jurisdiction where the assets are located our executive officers have other business interests which may limit the amount of time they can devote to our company our executive officers have other business interests meaning they may not have enough time to devote to our business operations this could cause business failure they have been devoting and in the future plan to devote only  hours per month to company affairs which may lead to sporadic exploration activities and periodic interruptions of business operations unforeseen events may cause this amount of time to become even less we must attract and maintain key personnel or our business will fail  success depends on the acquisition of key personnel we will have to compete with other companies both within and outside the mining industry to recruit and retain competent employees if we cannot maintain qualified employees to meet the needs of our anticipated growth this could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition we are recently formed lack an operating history and have yet to make any revenues if we cannot generate any profits you may lose your entire investment  we are a recently formed company and have yet to generate any revenues no profits have been made to date and if we fail to make any then we may fail as a business and an investment in our common stock will be worth nothing we have no operating history and thus no way for you to measure progress or potential future success success has yet to be proved currently there are no operations in place to produce revenue we are exploration stage and have yet to find or produce sellable product financial losses should be expected to continue in the near future and at least until such time that we enter the production stage as a new business we face all the risks of a startup venture including unforeseen costs expenses problems and management limitations and difficulties since inception we have a loss of approximately  there is no guarantee unfortunately that we may ever be able to turn a profit or locate additional opportunities hire additional management and other personnel we need to acquire additional financing or our company will fail we must obtain additional capital or our business will fail in order to explore the claim and eventually establish operations we must secure more funds currently we have very limited resources and have already accumulated a net loss unless we complete the planned exploration work on the mitu gold claim and commence operations we will make no money which may result in complete loss of your investment financing is also needed to bring product to market financing may be subject to numerous factors including investor sentiment acceptance of mining claims and so on we currently have no arrangements for additional financing we may also have to borrow large sums of money that require substantial capital and interest payments we must perform mineral explorations on the mitu gold claim to determine if any ore reserves are present and to keep the property in good standing the planned exploration work alone is expected to cost  on march   we had cash of only  the probability of a mineral claim having profitable reserves is very small and our claim even with large investments may never generate a profit we are dependent upon our mining property for success all anticipated future revenues would come directly from the mitu gold claim should we fail to extract and sell gold from this property our business will fail mineral deposit estimates are imprecise and subject to error and resource calculations when made may prove unreliable assumptions made regarding the supporting data may prove inaccurate and unforeseen events may lead to further inaccuracies sample variability mining and processing adjustments environmental changes metal price fluctuations and law and regulation changes are all factors that could lead to deviances from the original estimations no assurances can be given that any mineral deposit estimate will ever be reclassified as a reserve we have no known ore reserves despite future investment in exploration activities there is no guarantee we will locate a commercially viable ore reserve most exploration projects do not result in discovery of commercially mineable deposits with little capital available we will have to limit our exploration which decreases the chances of finding a commercially viable ore body even if gold is identified the mitu gold claim may not be put into production due to high extraction costs low gold prices or inadequate amount and reduced recovery rates if the exploration activities do not suggest a commercially successful prospect then we may altogether abandon plans to develop the property the exploration and prospecting of minerals is speculative and extremely competitive which may make success difficult we face strong competition from other mining companies for the acquisition of new properties new properties increase the probability of discovering a profitable reserve most companies have greater financial and managerial resources than we do and can acquire and explore attractive new mining properties we will face similar difficulties raising new capital to expand operations against the larger better capitalized competitors limited supply and unforeseen demand from larger more competitive companies may make secure all necessary equipment and materials difficult and may result in periodic interruptions or even business failure success depends on a combination of many factors including but not limited to the quality of management technical geological expertise quality of land available for exploration and the capital available for exploration international operations in columbia are subject to inherent risks political instability uncertainty of the economic climate currency fluctuations exchange controls and taxation laws may be significant access to all of the equipment supplies and materials necessary to begin exploration may not be available and delay such activity we have not yet attempted to locate or negotiate with any suppliers of products equipment or materials but plan to do so when exploration begins exchange rate changes between the cop and the us dollar may also adversely affect success our future operations may be adversely affected by future governmental and environmental regulations and permitting environmental regulations may negatively affect the progression of operations and these regulations may become stricter in the future in columbia all mining is regulated by the deputy minister of mines and the national mining agency licenses and permits must be obtained from these entities as well as an environmental impact study developed for each mining property before starting mining activities these are expensive and may affect the timing of operations pollution can be anticipated with mining activities if we are unable to comply with current or future regulations this may expose us to fines penalties and litigation that could cause our business to fail we are subject to inherent mining hazards and risks that may result in future financial obligations risks and hazards associated with the mining industry may adversely affect our operations such as but not limited to political and country risks industrial accidents labor disputes inability to retain necessary personnel or equipment environmental hazards unexpected geologic formations caveins landslides flooding and monsoons fires explosions power outages processing problems personal injury and death could result as well as property damage delays in mining environmental damage legal liability and monetary loss we may not be able to obtain insurance to cover these risks at economically reasonable premiums we do not carry any sort of insurance and may have difficulties obtaining such once operations start as insurance is generally sparse and cost prohibitive our independent auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern we incurred a net loss of  for the period from april   date of inception to march   and we expect to incur further losses in the development of our business which raises substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern we had cash of  as at march   we are in the development stage and have yet to attain profitable operations and in their report on our financial statements for the period from inception to march   our independent auditors included an explanatory paragraph regarding the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern our financial statements contain additional note disclosures describing the circumstances that led to this disclosure by our independent auditors our officers and director have never visited the mitu gold claim if any feature of the mitu gold claim is obvious and might impede the claims exploration that feature might remain undiscovered because no officer or director of the company has personally visited the claim risks related to our stock we may not be able to raise additional capital through the offering of more shares and if we are able to do so it will dilute those shares issued and outstanding at the time of raise raising additional capital through future offerings of common stock may be necessary for our company to continue operations but there is no guarantee that this will be possible doing so will however dilute the total share number issued and outstanding financing may be achieved by issuing more shares which will increase the number of common shares outstanding this may decrease the percentage interest held by each of our shareholders obtaining financing through the sale of our common stock will dilute other shareholders interests as the total number of outstanding common shares increases the equity attached to any individual share will decrease causing a dilution of shareholder ownership over the company with little other access to funds currently we may have to rely on this method substantially to raise additional capital there is no market for our common stock meaning that you may not be able to resell your shares  our common stock currently has no market limiting shareholders ability to resell them or use them as collateral thus the shareholder must sell their shares privately which may prove very difficult the shares are not currently listed on any exchange or quotation system private sales are more difficult and often give lower than anticipated prices should a public market develop for our stock future sales of shares may negatively affect their market price even if a market

resources infrastructure and topography the mitu gold claim is located close to the brazilian border in southeastern colombia in the north western part of the department of vaupes it covers areas of historic placer and small scale bedrock gold mining it is approximately  km west of the capital mitu and approximately  km northwest of the small town of taraira flying time from bogota to mitu capital of vaupes department is  hours the main routes of transportation and communication with the provinces and the municipalities of caruru and taraira are by air the vaupes river is the main waterway in the department of vaupes and its municipalities larger sailing vessels can navigate the upper portions of the river for seven months a year a section of  km of road between mitu and monforth is passable as well as a network of  km of unpaved roads link the communities to each other mitu is described as an area of transition between the dry plains of orinoco and the amazon rainforest with temperatures ranging from °c to °c  to  farenheit there are dry and wet seasons with rainfalls ranging from  cm to  cm per year exploration work can be carried out unhampered throughout the year although production may be slower during the months of april may and october when peak rains occur there is a heavy reliance on government expenditure in the form of government salaries and government subsidies to improve living conditions in the area other economic activities in the area consist of the collection of wild rubber and subsistence farming with the cultivation of yucca pupuna peppers pineapple sugar cane and onions mineral resources such as gold and ilmenite can be found as well as small percentage content of coltan tantalite over  of the municipality is covered in tropical forests which are part of the forest reserve of the amazon so their uses are conditional the main food crops are cassava maize coca banana sweet potato and yam cane various fruits are also grown in the region such as pineapple papaya watermelon cocoa as well as numerous local wild fruits in mitu there is an airport named alberto leon bentley which has been in operation since september  with a runway length of  meters long and  wide the airport terminal approximately  meters square in size handles all cargo food fuel and other materials to be distributed to interior areas in the department of vaupes freight companies operate regularly and air taxi carriers provide transport service between mitu the other municipalities of the department and rural indigenous communities a series of unpaved roads connects the town of mitu to other communities in the interior of the department accessible by jeep a  km of passable roadway links mitu to the town of monforth there are numerous trails present and many of the local residents use canoes and waterways to travel between communities in the amazon basin history numerous showings of mineralization have been discovered in the area and six prospects have achieved significant production with the nearby lopez gold claim  kilometers away producing  ounces of gold annually gold is reported to have also been discovered in taraira a municipal in the department of vaupes approximately  km southeast of mitu where several mining explorations are currently being conducted geological setting regional geology of the area the project lies within the northwestern edge of the neblina successor foreland basin a large meso to paleoproterozoic basin which overlaps the paleoproterozoic roraima foreland basin and encompasses a large area of brazil as well as areas of venezuela guyana and colombia deposits within these basins were derived from the transamazonian mountain range and are dominantly mature deltaic and shallowmarine sandstones such as quartz arenite and arkosic sandstones sedimentary strata underlying the project area and gold mineralization are belong to a group of roraimalike have been determined sedimentary outliers overlie roraima supergroup strata further west for which zircon from tuffs within this supergroup are from the paleoproterozoic age basin deposits in the project area overlie the eastern proterozoic rio negro amazon craton formed mostly by collisional s and itype granitoids which were intruded into the basement roraimalike sequences including deposits were deformed during the sunsas collision along the northwestern and southwestern margins of the amazon craton these deposits remained buried until late jurassic when they were uplifted during the takutu rift event which preceded the drift phase of africa and north america the metasedimentary sequence is comprised predominantly of quartzarenite strata with minor mudstone and siltstone intercalations and metaconglomerate beds this sequence is the primary host to gold mineralization in the region metasedimentary strata throughout the region have been folded into a sequence of northerlytrending anticlines and synclines outcrop patterns suggest polyphase folding the mitu gold claim is the located on a bedrock of native gold occurrences and numerous relatively small alluvial gold deposits mineralization was discovered in the area in the early s and since that time has been the site of multiple smallscale placer and hardrock gold recovery operations by individual miners these minor operations left no disturbance or contamination on the surface or in the groundwater and so no remediation activities will be needed alluvial gold deposits appear to be widespread in the region and these types of deposits have been the main target of smallscale individual miners native gold is readily panned from the surrounding areas generally in areas of minor excavations and mine workings and also from creeks grains of native gold up to mm in size have been observed in rock samples from the project insitu primary gold mineralization in the district occurs along trending ridges of precambrian sedimentary stratigraphy quartz arenite is the main lithological unit in this metasedimentary sequence and is also the primary host of gold minor native gold also occurs in metaconglomerate beds in the sedimentary sequence primary gold mineralization identified to date in the district appears to be strongly controlled by stratigraphy however it is also associated with crosscutting structures mineralization occurs as fine to coarsegrained native gold hosted by narrow cryptocrystalline quartz veins gold mineralization also occurs as possibly detrital grains along bedding planes and as very fine interstitial grains interpreted as paleoplacer mineralization mineralization is most closely associated with silica alteration at all locations occurring as minor zones of narrow quartz veining andor as evidently more widely distributed zones of silicification in host strata native gold most commonly occurs in the absence of sulfides or other opaque minerals or in association with trace to minor amounts of pyrite andor wolframite the presence of organic matter within the sedimentary strata has also been suggested to be important to gold mineralization historic reports and preliminary investigations suggest that the district has the potential to host paleoplacer or modified paleoplacer andor epigenetic vein and shearrelated gold mineralization a synsedimentary origin for gold mineralization in the district is consistent with apparent lithological and stratigraphic controls on mineralization and by the widespread distribution of gold mineralization in quartz arenite dominant strata the tentative identification of rounded and irregularshaped gold particles in quartz sandstone also supports a synsedimentary origin since these particles closely resemble paleoplacer micronuggets and do not appear to be related to veining the apparent paucity of sulfides associated with gold mineralization and the absence of significant hydrothermal alteration could also be construed as supportive of a paleoplacer origin for stratabound mineralization the common occurrence of native gold in narrow quartz veins and along fractures supports either an epigenetic or remobilized paleoplacer model the close association between mineralization and silica as silicification of quartz arenite strata andor as narrow quartz veinlets and the apparent association between gold and elements such as bismuth and antimony may more readily conform with an epigenetic model nevertheless a possible paleoproterozoic age for siliciclastic deposits and therefore also for inferred detrital gold mineralization do not preclude a paleoplacer origin for gold mineralization it is hypothesized that where regionalscale tectonic processes favored their preservation paleoplacer gold deposits which is thought to have formed throughout earths history have survived an increase in the distribution of orogenic gold deposits globally have provided a ready source of primary gold for redistribution in late paleoproterozoic placers both epigenetic and syngenetic paleoplacer deposit types are being targeted in exploration programs with the possibility for paleoplacer or remobilized paleoplacer and structurally controlled andor veinhosted gold mineralization in the district and considering the potential economic importance associated with these styles of mineralization exploration records indicate that no detailed exploration has been completed on the property drilling summary no drilling has occurred on the mitu gold claim since  several properties east of mitu gold claim have been drilled by junior mineral exploration companies sampling method sample preparation data verification all the exploration will be conducted according to generally accepted exploration procedures with methods and preparation that are consistent with generally accepted exploration practices no samples have been taken no other procedures of quality control will be employed and no opinion on their absence is expressed report recommendations a two phased exploration program to further delineate the mineralized system currently recognized on mitu gold claim is recommended the program would consist of air photo interpretation of the structures geological mapping both regionally and detailed on the area of the main showings geophysical survey using both magnetic and electromagnetic instrumentation in detail over the area of the showings and in a regional reconnaissance survey and geochemical soil sample surveying regionally to identify other areas on the claim that are mineralized and in detail on the known areas of mineralization the effort of this exploration work is to define and enable interpretation of a followup

be considered in conjunction with audited financial statements of the company and forwardlooking statements contained here apply from this date and involve some risks and uncertainties we are a startup exploration stage company we have a limited operating history and have not yet generated or realized any revenues from our activities we have yet to undertake any exploration activity on our sole property  the mitu gold claim as our property is in the early stage of exploration and there is no reasonable likelihood that revenue can be derived from the property in the foreseeable future our plan is to explore the mitu gold claim for gold we want to proceed but lack sufficient cash to do so the two phase exploration program will cost  cop  for phase i and  cop  for phase ii thus the anticipated company expenses over the next year are roughly  in exploration alone if phase i and phase ii are undertaken we also anticipate an additional  for expenses including professional legal and accounting services required after becoming a reporting company no revenues have yet been earned we do not anticipate revenues until a commercially profitable product can be extracted and sold as exploration has not yet commenced we remain uncertain as to whether we will ever discover profitable amounts of mineral and what the market will be for it when and if we do produce some if conditions are favorable then upon discovery we will enter into production if we do not proceed then we will try to acquire an interest in another mineral claim should we not have sufficient funds to purchase another mineral claim outright then we may have to make a share offering to obtain an option on a property if that succeeds then again we would try to explore with money raised by offering our stock engaging in borrowing or locating a joint venture partner we have not generated any revenues and no revenues are anticipated until we begin removing and selling minerals if ever accordingly we must raise cash from sources other than the sale of gold found on the mitu gold claim to implement further exploration work on the mitu gold claim and to stay in business we must raise additional cash  particularly over the next  months if we cannot raise additional funds we will not have sufficient funds to satisfy our cash requirements and would have to go out of business since our business activity is related solely to the exploration and evaluation of the mitu gold claim it is the opinion of management that the most meaningful financial information relates primarily to current liquidity and solvency as at march   we had  in working capital deficit our future financial success will depend upon the success of the exploration work on the mitu gold claim such exploration may take years to complete and future cash flows if any are impossible to predict at this time the realization value from any mineralization which may be discovered by us is largely dependent on factors beyond our control such as the market value of metals produced mining regulations in columbia and foreign exchange rates liquidity and capital resources since inception to the present we have raised capital through private placements of common stock aggregating  with our only two shareholders and officers as at march   we had  in cash our capital commitments for the coming  months consist of administrative expenses together with expenses associated with the completion of our planned exploration program including this exploration work we estimate that we will have to incur the following expenses during the next  months expenses        amount     description accounting     fees to the independent accountant for preparing the quarterly and annual financial statements legal          legal fees in connection with miscellaneous matters audit          review of the quarterly financial statements and audit of the annual financial statements exploration          for phase i filing

estimated          expenses         in the future the company may be forced to rely upon cash advances from its officers to meet current and future liabilities we have no plant or significant equipment to sell nor are we going to buy any plant or significant equipment during the next  months we will not buy any equipment unless we locate a body of ore and determine that it is economical to extract the ore from the land we may attempt to interest other companies to undertake exploration work on the mitu gold claim through joint venture arrangement or even the sale of part of the mitu gold claim neither of these avenues has been pursued as of the date of this prospectus our geologist has recommended an exploration program for the mitu gold claim however even if the results of this work suggest further exploration work is warranted we do not presently have the requisite funds and so will be unable to complete anything beyond the exploration work on phase i recommended in the report until we raise more money or find a joint venture partner to complete the exploration work if we cannot find a joint venture partner and do not raise more money we will be unable to complete any work beyond the exploration program recommended by our geologist if we are unable to finance additional exploration activities we do not know what we will do and we do not have any plans to do anything else we do not intend to hire any employees at this time all of the work on the mitu gold claim will be conducted by our two officers they will be responsible for supervision surveying exploration and excavation and will be capable of evaluating the information derived from the exploration and excavation including advising mitu on the economic feasibility of removing any mineralized material we may discover of all the possibilities of financing to meet current and future liabilities the most likely is cash advances from our officers however we have no agreements with our officers for them to make such advances and they have no obligation to do so the company can operate for at least six months with its current cash balance limited operating history need for additional capital there is no historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance as an exploration corporation we are a exploration stage company and have not generated any revenues from our exploration activities we cannot guarantee we will be successful in our exploration activities our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise including limited capital resources possible delays in the exploration of our properties and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services to become profitable and competitive we must invest in the exploration of our property before we start production of any minerals we may find we must obtain equity or debt financing to provide the capital required to fully implement our phased exploration program we have no assurance that financing will be available to us on acceptable terms if financing is not available on satisfactory terms we may be unable to commence continue develop or expand our exploration activities even if available equity financing could result in additional dilution to existing shareholder results of operations during the year ended march   we incurred a net loss of  comprised of  of professional fees related to our accounting audit and legal fees incurred as part of our sec registration and filing requirements we also incurred  of general and administrative costs from transfer agent fees this compared to a net loss of  during the period from april   date of inception to march   for which we incurred  in professional fees and  in transfer agent fees the overall increase is due to the fact that we incorporated a full year of operations in fiscal  and the fact that we incurred a majority of sec filing costs during the current fiscal period for the year ended march   and for the period from april   date of inception to march   we had a loss per share of nil our planned exploration program we must conduct exploration to determine what if any amounts of minerals exist on the mitu gold claim and if such minerals can be economically extracted and profitably processed our planned exploration program is designed to explore and evaluate our property efficiently our anticipated exploration costs for phase i work on the mitu gold claim are approximately  this figure represents the anticipated cost to us of completing only phase i work recommended by the report however should the results of this work be sufficiently encouraging to justify our undertaking phase ii work recommended in the report at an estimated cost of  we will have to raise additional investment capital regardless we will have to raise additional funds within the next  months in order to satisfy our ongoing cash requirements and finance anything beyond phase i work on the mitu gold claim balance sheet as at march   we had cash of  and total assets of  compared to cash of  and total assets of  as at march   the decrease in cash and total assets was attributed to the use of cash for operating expenses during the year as the company had more operating expenses and raised less money from financing activities compared to prior year we had liabilities of  at march   compared to  at march   the increase in liabilities is due to  of debt owing to the president and director of the company for financing of our daytoday operations the amount owing is unsecured noninterest bearing and due on demand the increase is offset by a decrease of  in accounts payable and accrued liabilities as we repaid outstanding obligations as they became due during the year ended march   we did not have any capital transactions cash flows cash flows from operating activities during the year ended march

company has generated no revenues to date and has an accumulated deficit of  the continuation of the company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its shareholders the ability to raise equity or debt financing and the attainment of profitable operations from the companys future business these factors raise substantial doubt regarding the companys ability to continue as a going concern these financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern the companys plan of action over the next twelve months is to raise capital financing to conduct exploration and drilling on its

financial statements and related notes are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap and are expressed in us dollars the companys fiscal yearend is march    b use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period the company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to the recoverability of mineral properties and deferred income tax asset valuation allowances the company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources the actual results experienced by the company may differ materially and adversely from the companys estimates to the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results future results of operations will be affected   c cash and cash equivalents the company considers all highly liquid instruments with maturity of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents as at march   and  the company had no cash equivalents   d mineral property costs the company has been in the exploration stage since its formation on april   and has not yet realized any revenues from its planned operations mineral property acquisition costs are capitalized as incurred exploration and evaluation costs are expensed as incurred until proven and probable reserves are established the company assesses the carrying costs for impairment under asc  property plant and equipment at each fiscal quarter end when it has been determined that a mineral property can be economically developed as a result of establishing proven and probable reserves the costs then incurred to develop such property are capitalized such costs will be amortized using the unitsofproduction method over the estimated life of the probable reserve if mineral properties are subsequently abandoned or impaired any capitalized costs will be charged to operations   e asset retirement obligations as at march   and  the company has no asset retirement obligations f mitu resources inc notes to the financial statements expressed in us dollars  summary of significant accounting policies continued   f basic and diluted net loss per share the company computes net income loss per share in accordance with asc  earnings per share asc  requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share eps on the face of the income statement basic eps is computed by dividing net income loss available to common shareholders numerator by the weighted average number of shares outstanding denominator during the period diluted eps gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the ifconverted method in computing diluted eps the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants diluted eps excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti dilutive   g income taxes potential benefits of income tax losses are not recognized in the accounts until realization is more likely than not the company has adopted asc  accounting for income taxes as of its inception pursuant to asc  the company is required to compute tax asset benefits for net operating losses carried forward the potential benefits of net operating losses have not been recognized in these financial statements because the company cannot be assured it is more likely than not it will utilize the net operating losses carried forward in future years   h comprehensive loss asc  comprehensive income establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive loss and its components in the financial statements as at march   and  the company has no items that represent comprehensive loss and therefore has not included a schedule of comprehensive loss in the financial statements   i financial instruments pursuant to asc  fair value measurements and disclosures and asc  financial instruments an entity is required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value asc  establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value a financial instruments categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement asc  prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value level  level  applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  level  applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions less active markets or modelderived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data level  level  applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities the companys financial instruments consist principally of cash and accounts payable and accrued liabilities pursuant to asc the fair value of cash and cash equivalents is determined based on level  inputs which consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets we believe that the recorded values of all of our other financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of their nature and respective maturity dates or durations   j recent accounting pronouncements the company has limited
