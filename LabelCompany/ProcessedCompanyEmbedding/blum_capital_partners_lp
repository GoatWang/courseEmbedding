sfleadsblumcapitalcom  strategy — blum capital  strategy blum capital has consistently pursued its corporate investing strategy since the firm’s inception in for over forty years we have applied our investment strategy focusing on small and midcapitalization companies to source strategic block and control investments and subsequently work with the managements and boards of directors to increase shareholder value  over time we have invested more than  billion of equity capital and demonstrated a proven ability to play a constructive active role in unlocking value from our portfolio companies through the implementation of financial operational and governance initiativesthe core tenets of our investment strategy have remained constant throughout the firm’s history while still allowing us to take advantage of different opportunities in diverse market environments  this flexibility has resulted in portfolios that have varied in emphasis over time  however the key principles of our investment philosophy have always been consistently applied as follows   high quality of businesswe believe in the importance of investing in high quality businesses with defensible franchises attractive longterm growth potential and attractive returns on invested capital because high quality businesses generate greater compounding of wealth over timeopportunity for valueaddour goal is to be the largest or among the largest shareholders and to build a partnership with management and the board of directors allowing us to initiate and often  implement valueadded strategies that enhance shareholder returns  our proposals include a broad range of financial operational and governance initiatives with the objective of maximizing equity value over timesmallmidcap focusour primary focus is the small and midcapitalization sectors of the market which we believe tend to offer more attractively valued investment opportunities  in addition smaller and midsized companies afford greater potential for influence and valueadd on our part than larger companieslongterm horizonwe are longterm investors  our longterm perspective allows us to take a partnership approach with management teams whose time horizons are similar to our own  the average holding period for private equity investments made by our strategic funds has been five yearsconcentrated portfolioour strategy is to limit investments to a relatively small number of our best opportunities and to focus our efforts on adding value to those portfolio companies  combined with our highly selective investment criteria intensive research and ability to implement valuecreating initiatives we believe concentration is critical in achieving our goal of superior returns rigorous research processconsistent with our private equity approach we apply a highly rigorous process in researching potential investments  we believe our concentrated portfolio strategy requires this level of private equity due diligence in order to minimize investment risk        yelp yelp sorry you’re not allowed to access this page contact yelp if you keep experiencing issues blum capital partners lp  san francisco ca  company
