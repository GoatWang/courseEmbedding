had filed a prospectus that relates to the offering of a total of  shares of our common stock on a selfunderwritten basis at a fixed price of  per share in december  we completed the sale of  common shares at the price of a  per share for total proceeds of  our auditors have issued a going concern opinion this means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for

providers that would be prepared to perform relocation services for our clients on terms presently we have one party with two apartments interested in negotiating for our services f we have retained a website developer who has commences design and narrative of the site for our corporate website that will describe the services that we offer to provide to our potential clients with the ability to contact us to request services or ask questions about the services that we offer and to the extent possible disclose the qualifications of some of the thirdparty service providers that agree to perform relocation services to our clients our plan of operations over the  month period following successful completion of our offering is to establish and develop our service network our website and our advertising and marketing plan our challenge will be to attract customers to our website and to advise them of the range of services that we will offer we anticipate achieving the following specific business milestones in the  months following the completion of our offering  for a period of six months from the date of completion of the offering our president rosy rodrigues intends to

search engine optimization consultant that will aid us in developing an internet presence and assure that our website is highly visible to potential clients that search for us  once our website is operational ms rodrigues will undertake the design and implementation of social media accounts on websites such as facebook google plus and twitter we anticipate that this process will take approximately one to two weeks and will have negligible cost to us  subject to the initial success of our business which may prevent ms rodrigues from providing all of the consulting services that she intends to personally provide due to time constraints that would impact her ability to properly perform her tasks we intend to hire employees to perform similar functions the pay rates for such employees would be negotiable but are anticipated to be approximately  per year we anticipate that any wages would be paid from revenue that we earn and would not impact our use of proceeds as our business develops ms rodrigues role would transition from client consultant to a manager of all of our consultants this would likely occur once we employed at least five consultants we do not expect to realize any revenues and do not expect to commence operations until approximately september  our independent auditor has issued a report on our audited financial statements which expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern currently our president has increased the time and now devotes approximately  of her business time to the companys operations ms
