leverage january        ecommerce wordpressselling other peoples products chris lemathere’s a great way to make money selling other people’s products if you’re not a developer but you’re good at marketing then creating a marketplace may be right for you a marketplace looks like a normal ecommerce store but there’s a single difference the products aren’t your own it used to be difficult to create these kinds of marketplaces but today it’s ridiculously easy because of a combination you may not know about – a plugin a few extensions and a theme easy digital downloads edd extension commissions edd extension frontend submissions wordpress theme marketify the marketplace bundle the good news when it comes to the edd extensions is that pippin and the good folks working on edd have created a marketplace bundle – giving you the two extensions above along with several others that will round out some nice functionality commissions the reason i say this is a great way to do it is because you can work with a variety of vendors to convince them to sell their products in your store after all what’s wrong with another channel and use commissions to provide them the right incentives more channels means more broader market which leads to greater profits for everyone involved frontend submissions and frontend submissions gives product owners control over adding their own products the copy that shows up on product pages images and more it reduces your need to do a lot to build the store other than recruiting sellers marketify when i said you were good at marketing i meant you would need to be good at getting the word out as well as getting more sellers but notice i didn’t say you had to be a great developer because this new theme marketify will make your site look beautiful to recap install edd  extensions install marketify recruit sellers launch  market that’s the right way to create a marketplace is there a wrong way to sell other people’s products yes my friends yes there is now in the wordpress world you should know that most of the plugins and themes are licensed under gpl it’s a license that allows anyone to freely use enhance or distribute the code without any requirement of paying for license fees if this is the first time you’ve heard about the gpl i know how weird it can sound but the results have proven it to be a model that works well to increase community participation in the development of fantastic software but that same freedom to distribute can lead to people taking premium products like ithemes builder headway themes the genesis framework and gravity forms and redistributing them on their own sites for their own gain now i know given the paragraph above – you’re going to ask me if it’s legal and the truth is that it is  lega if the code is licensed under gpl it is free to be distributed but if you’re going to do that you can’t infringe on their trademarks and copyrights and that’s where things come falling apart they highlight the wrong way to do it because the only reason people would even spend  on these products is if they thought they were the real ones – coded and supported by the real companies that produced them so imagine your surprise were you to buy gravity forms for  and install it when you realized you couldn’t get any support for it at all what a waste and that’s because this marketplace isn’t a legit marketplace it’s a fake as fake as the guys on the street corner in nyc selling fake guci bags and yes there’s a “c” missing there’s never been a better time fortunately you have at least two legit ways to sell other people’s code without infringing on their rights the first is to use affiliate links like those in this article i only recommend products that i own i use i trust you can read more about my policy on affiliate recommendations and why even though i get offers to write reviews for tons of products every day over  never show up on this site the second way is to build a marketplace and as you’ve seen above between the marketplace bundle and  marketify you could have a marketplace built for less than  that’s seriously an amazing deal by the way if you do create a new marketplace come back and tell me about it i want to know about it   photo credit jorisvo  shutterstockcom about chris lemachris is best known for relentlessly writing blog posts

check your email there was an error submitting your subscription please try again sign up comments nathan p says january   at  pm i’m thinking of creating one still need to come up with a good name who’s url isn’t taken for it first though i might do some searching when i have more cash to spend on this idea bit it’s what my company does – create websites around ideas or themes just wish we had more cash to hire a developer or two so we could finish some of the ideas reply andy freist says january   at  pm nice i have some juicy ideas stirring up from reading this thanks for the tip your posts are always topnotch and greatly appreciated reply louis reingold says january   at  am great post  because the only reason people would even spend  on these products is if they thought they were the real ones premium plugin developers like me wish this were true but it isn’t also the “you’re really paying for support” argument people often put forth is also bs… if the products are easy to use do you really need support most people aren’t paying for support most people are paying for the product reply jason coleman says january   at  am yeah a lot of people know they are getting “just the code” from someone other than the original plugin developer i assume there might be some confusion with some customers or some of the leech sites but i think a lot of people know what they are purchasing imo  is about right to pay for someone to package up otherwise paywalled gpl code make sure it’s up to date and free of malware etc and offer it up for download reply carl hancock says january   at  pm if only it were that simple but the code is gpl so we can do whatever we want right not quite not when there are companies with well established brands and trademarks involved the gpl only applies to the code it does not apply a companies brand or trademarks the simplest explanation i’ve seen on this matter is on the wikipedia page that discusses red hat linux redistributions red hat linux being an open source version of linux released under the gnu gpl license specifically the section on “legal aspects” found here httpenwikipediaorgwikiredhatenterpriselinuxderivativeslegalaspects “however to avoid misrepresentation of red hat’s trademark material in the original distribution covered by the trademark must be stripped off or removed from the redistribution” red hat must protect it’s trademarks legally you have to or risk losing it in this case that means stripping out every instance of “red hat” or any other red hat related trademarks from the redistributed code nothing is ever as simple as we may believe it to be reply michael cabral poubel bastos says january   at  am people need to remember to keep in mind that companies like headway got around the gpl issue by creating their own javascript and css which they can copyright and so even though the code is gpl because it’s derivative from wordpress they can still sue due to copyrighted images and content if someone tries to resell their theme etc very important for anyone looking into doing this to remember so do what you want with the code but pay attention to the copy written content visible to the user reply chris wiegman says january   at  am good post chris i’ve had very good luck with people mostly companies paying for support but i know that isn’t everyone i would be curious if there is any actual data from the wordpress community as to what the customer thinks they’re paying for support or product reply dan says january   at  am hi chris can a marketplace like this be used to sell physical products only reply bobwp says january   at  pm great post chris and it all makes sense… common sense and there is always people who ruin it for other people   and so with you on affiliates… i also get requests for numerous ones daily but stick to what i know trust and use myself i have found some socalled reputable people in the wordpress community who have affiliate links and when i have shared them with clients and readers because i thought they would only have them on the site because they trusted them also that was a mistake one particular instance the client had a horrible experience i when i contacted the person whose site share it she totally ignored me ugh… thanks for the post reply king tut says january   at  pm one could argue that blogging about this practice and using it as an opportunity to use affiliate links all throughout is equally “wrong” excessively blogging on topics framed in such a way that everything is always about affiliate links does call into question the sincerity and purpose of the blogger reply chrislema says january   at  pm i would suggest that they’re worlds apart the links in this post model an alternative that doesn’t take money out of a developers hand and doesn’t hurt a customer at all as for my sincerity and integrity you’d have to read a few posts to come to a rational conclusion – one that many have done and decided the posts were worth reading but that’s a personal choice reply di ana says september   at  am hi chris thanks so much for this article it gave me the info i needed to create and getting ready to launch soon a marketplace of classes consultations and creative services for women entrepreneurs i used the theme plugins and extensions you talked about it has been amazingly easy to do i am still “tweaking” it getting ready for the launch but would love for you to see it httpwwwthewomenentrepreneursacademycom – thank you – di ana reply alex says january   at  pm by the way if you do create a new marketplace come back and tell me about it i want to know about it well i’m in the process of creating one but for the core of it still comparing an edd approach to a woocommerce approach what do you think of  reply nikov says may   at  am hi i’m wondering if anyone knows of any profitable sites built with the edd marketplace bundle i have purchased the bundle and am trying to configure everything and it is far from straightforward in fact there are some missing functionalities that are pretty much unforgiveable from the point of view of website visitiors i’m wondering if anyone has actually made money using this bundle or if there are just hundreds perhaps thousands of hopefuls that have bought it and are doing nothing because it’s hard to work with reply anurag sahay says october   at  am hi chris wonderful article i did my bit of research on marketify and the edd plugin package i could not figure out the admin level access  controls on my website features like approving or revoking membership products etc and other standard features of the admin dashboard how wonderful will it be if you could help out on
