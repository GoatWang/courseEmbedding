bay inc looks to dominate marijuana testing clean cannabis please signal bay inc looks to dominate marijuana testing news provided by signal bay inc oct    et share this article the companys evio labs are setting the standard in the growing cannabis testing market bend or oct   prnewswire  whether youre looking to ease the symptoms of cancer or just looking to unwind on a friday evening marijuana is the substance of choice for many americans the social stigma of pot continues to dwindle there will always be some squares and as a consequence more and more states have sought to legalize the use of cannabis for both medical and recreational purposes in fact medical marijuana has become legal in  states while recreational marijuana use has been decriminalized throughout the nation four states colorado alaska washington and oregon have to varying degrees legalized marijuana use for recreational purposes also more states have recreational legal marijuana on the ballot including the most populous state california with legalization comes regulation and with regulation comes the mandate for quality control standards—just like any other legal substance and there is a lot that must be tested such as levels of potency pesticides ecoli yeast mold and other contaminants etc in  governor of california jerry brown signed the marijuana regulation and safety act which will give the state some of the most comprehensive regulations in the nation  with only  of california cannabis currently being tested these regulatory measures and similar ones nationwide provide a tremendous market opportunity for companies able to nimbly operate in the growing cannabis testing market enter signal bay inc  goodbye oregano hello evio signal bay inc is the oregonbased life science company operates through its three subsidiaries evio labs signal bay research and signal bay services going public via reverse merger in  signal bay focused primarily on providing research and consulting services to cannabis growers product manufacturers and other industry professionals we provide data collection and industry research as well as help entrepreneurs in the cannabis space get licenses and put them in touch with capital opportunities explained ceo of signal bay william waldrop to date our consulting and research expertise has been responsible for the generation of over  million in deal flow but while some signal bay personnel were satisfied with this impressive consulting and research business ceo william waldrop and other top management saw a much larger opportunity in the cannabis testing market a market that is expected to grow to over  million by   leveraging their expertise in the industry and client relationships the company to redirected its focus on its evio labs division with three cannabis testing currently operating in oregon the company now controls  of the legal cannabis testing space in the state next stop for signal bay is the new green rush state california where signal bay has signed a letter of intent to acquire another testing laboratory this key move in california will provide us a solid foundation in what is virtually a wide open market added waldrop by the end of  signal bay is expected to have  of its evio labs operating in total helping more than double the companys  revenues of a little under  to over  million by  mr waldrop expects the company to be doing over  million in annual revenues operating  evio labs but is this kind of growth possible for such a young company mr waldrop believes it is the key he asserts is signal bays business model a model that sets it apart from the competition a model that best achieves economies of scale its the economies of scale stupid… there are only a handful of companies trying to capture the growing cannabis compliance testing market however these companies are mostly in the business of owning and operating independent labs each of which provides core testing services in simpler terms each lab is its own centralized entity operating as basically its own business but the limber management team at signal bay a team that has redirected focus in the past in light of new opportunities has developed a business model they liken to quest diagnostics nyse dgx an industry leader in clinical laboratory services its the hub and spoke model simplifies waldrop in each state we have one centralized testing laboratory with other ancillary testing facilities in local markets statewide the core centralized lab handles the bigger high dollar testing functions while the smaller localized labs handle collection sampling and other testing services this enables us to develop networks of testing laboratories that operate efficiently within each state the profit of weed testing signal bay isnt in the business of building laboratories or acquiring an empty lab and setting up shop rather the company acquires currently operating cannabis testing laboratories along with the existing client base once acquired signal bay ensures that the laboratory is operating up to its reputable evio labs standard with years of industry consulting and research expertise signal bay looks to increase the labs efficiency and expand its client base as well as work with existing personnel to educate them on how to improve quality control with our three operating labs in oregon we currently have a client base of over  customers continued waldrop with our california acquisition we will be acquiring around  clients alone a crude comparison might be to think of signal bay as the cannabis testing version of the cnbc show the profit like the way business expert marcus lemonis revamps some small family business signal bay acquires a cannabis testing laboratory and revamps it to guarantee quality and efficiency the company is essentially in the quality control business a business that with more and more regulations mandated by states legalizing marijuana will continue to grow exponentially the real key to the cannabis testing business however is understanding the local market in which each lab operates the most important thing people need to understand about the cannabis business is that it is very much a relationshipbased industry said waldrop its all about close client relationships and understanding the market on a local level test locally grow globally signal bay is a young company but one that might just be poised for significant growth with a big footprint in oregon with eyes on california and maryland the companys evio labs might become the standard in the growing cannabis compliance testing industry if the young company can continue to grow smartly without becoming overextended—and continue to grow its evio brand—it might just leave its cannabis competitors up in smoke

 required fields santa monica ca  accesswire  july    a month after saying it was expanding its cannabis testing business into massachusetts signal bay inc otcqb sgby made good on their promise inking a definitive agreement to acquire viridis analytics ma llc for an undisclosed amount viridis is one of only a handful of operating cannabis testing laboratories in the state serving clients from a stateoftheart facility at its headquarters in southborough massachusetts through its subsidiary evio labs signal bay initiated its cannabis testing market footprint in its home state of oregon opening its first licensed facility in october  led by ceo william waldrop the company is making short work of expansion into other large us markets where cannabis has been legalized for both recreational and medicinal purposes the company which recently said it plans to change its name to evio inc as a better branding method has in the last month penetrated the massive california market and now massachusetts as well in november residents in both states voted to legalize recreational marijuana setting the stage for a surge in cannabis demand in  against the backdrop of increased consumption lawmakers are challenged to enact regulations to ensure the safety of marijuana products market analysts at new frontier forecast the california and massachusetts cannabis markets will reach  billion and  billion respectively by  as these markets swell so will the demand for accredited testing facilities to help standardize and verify repeatable strains and make sure all products are free of pesticides pathogens and other potentially harmful contaminants by their own accord evio labs estimates that the cannabis testing market in massachusetts alone will top  million by  when the acquisition of viridis is completed next week evio labs will be one of only three operating testing facilities in the state with marijuana being legal in one fashion or another across  states opportunities abound outside of oregon but we are being meticulous about where we are spending our resources to maximize return and build shareholder value waldrop said in a phone conversation on thursday our move into costa mesa california gives us a leg up on labs potentially opening in other orange county cities now we have a more than ample opportunity to capture market share as one of the few operating labs in the whole state of massachusetts we have cutting edge testing equipment the expertise gravitas and a head start on competition in what are expected to be massive markets he added as we cement our positions in these markets our strategy is to identify optimal organic and inorganic growth opportunities to cascade our labs across the country massachusetts is expected to experience a tremendous boom in dispensaries going forward consider that while much more populous california has approximately  dispensaries compared to massachusetts which only has  that equates to  dispensary in ca for about every  people versus  dispensary for every  people in ma simply  dispensaries are not going to service the  million citizens of massachusetts according to the massachusetts executive office of health and human services there are over  pending applications for registered marijuana dispensaries that can open upon final approval evio labs will be in on the ground floor as the number of ma dispensaries rises fold just the way that they are aligned to be the first accredited lab in orange county ca providing evidence that waldrop and his team have got a game plan and are executing it to the letter that doesnt mean theyre content where they are though yes were happy with what weve accomplished in a short period of time for sure but in this rapidly emerging industry

parent company of evio labs provides corporate update bend or  signal bay inc otcqbsgby a market leader in cannabis testing research and advisory services is pleased to provide our shareholders a corporate update coast to coast is our new mantra stated signal bay ceo william waldrop we plan to have evio labs represented in every market that requires independent laboratory testing across north america we have made significant strides in this endeavor acquiring accrediting and streamlining four labs in oregon prelegalization and our location in yuba city ca now those same labs are recording significant growth on a yearoveryear basis we are now aggressively approaching california with the same vigor seeking to identify local markets and building client relationships that will maximize shareholder value we feel our recent decision to locate in costa mesa california will be pinnacle to helping us achieve this goal we are in final phases of discussions with prospective growth opportunities that will expand the evio labs brand into the north east south east and even the central united states speaking of brand recognition the board of directors has realized that from our inception as a consulting and industry research company under the brand of signal bay and the tremendous growth of our evio labs division there is a need for uniform national branding and awareness efforts as such the board of directors has approved a shareholder vote to rename the company evio inc along with this renaming if approved we would request finra to change our stock symbol to reflect our new identity the company continues to refine and improve its business model complete the implementation of new equipment and strive to maximize efficiencies from our recent acquisitions but as previously noted to support the accelerated growth for a company at this stage cannot be accomplished solely by relying on internal cash flow as such signal bay has been able to secure a m mezzanine financing commitment from two institutional investors these debenture financing agreements have been structured to provide signal bay the capital it needs to expand into these markets while minimizing shareholder impact ceo will waldrop continues our continued meetings with institutional investors at events such as ld micro continues to drive strong interest based on our tremendous growth and continued success the one area of heartburn is that we continue to get negative feedback regarding our current share structure it severely limits the types of institutional investors we can attract and as such impacts our ability to raise traditional equity financing it is time to address the elephant in the room and clean up our share structure as such the signal bay board of directors has approved a shareholder vote to perform a reverse stock split of the companys common stock as discussed back in march the holders of both the series b and series c preferred stock removed all antireserve provisions so they will reverse along with the common stock on a prorata basis our goal is that when this is complete we will only have one series of common stock this coupled with our new acquisition financing will have a positive impact on all shareholders we feel that this is imperative to protect the value created thus far through our achievements and prepare the company to be positioned for growth and future uplistings about signal bay signal bay inc the company is an oregonbased biotech company through its three subsidiaries evio labs signal bay research and signal bay
