challenge of financial inclusion is far from being won according to the global findex over  billion people – nearly 0 of the world’s adult population – live without access to basic financial services being financially excluded is connected to income level which is proved by the fact that the majority of poor people  are unbanked with no checkingsavings account because of costs travel distances and difficulttofulfil requirements to open a bank account for them access to finance means making longerterm consumption and investment decisions participating in productive activities investing in education health and enterprises managing risk definitely living a better present and investing in a safer future a problem not only experienced in the poorest countries according to data in the us about m people are either unbanked or underbanked  who rely on nontraditional forms of finance and microfinance to solve this global issue a report released in april  by the committee on payments and market infrastructures cpmi and the world bank group titled “payment aspects of financial inclusion“ set out seven guiding principles to help countries increase financial inclusion these include i commitment from public and private sector organisations ii a robust legal and regulatory framework underpinning financial inclusion iii safe efficient and widely reachable financial and ict infrastructures iv transaction accounts and payment product offerings that effectively meet a broad range of transaction needs v availability of a broad network of access points and interoperable access channels vi effective awareness and financial literacy efforts and vii the leveraging of largevolume and recurrent payment streams including remittances to advance financial inclusion objectives the report also suggests possible actions including providing basic accounts at little or no cost stepping up efforts to increase financial literacy and leveraging largevolume payment programs such as government payments by adopting electronic payment services over the past several years various types of financial services providers including nongovernment and communitybased development entities commercial banks insurance and creditcard companies tlc and wire services post offices and other businesses providing point–ofsale pos access have developed and offer new products
