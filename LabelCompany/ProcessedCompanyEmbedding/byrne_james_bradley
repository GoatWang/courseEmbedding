is of a  pounder gun in the lower battery at fort donelson national battlefield near dover tennessee  btw the ’ pounder’ refers to the weight of the shot not the cannon the gun barrel weighs about  pounds  the capture of forts henry on the tennessee river and donelson on the cumberland river by the union early during the civil war forced the confederates to abandon kentucky and much of tennessee  the battle of fort donelson also launched the careers of us grant and nathan bedford forrest  general grant gained the nickname “unconditional surrender” for taking fort donelson modern republicans should learn from our gop ancestors  i’d rather vote for a candidate who vows “to break” our political opponents than one whose first thought is “crossing the aisle” to compromise  that is why i plan to vote for bradley byrne for governor in the republican primary runoff on july   i like dr bentley he’s always been very kind to me and if he wins i will do everything i can to get him elected  however during his campaign speeches bentley touts crossing the aisle like it’s a good thing – and maybe it is – but right now i want someone who will force the lying cheating and stealing democrats to surrender their corrupt rule in montgomery…  what do a mover from florida a butcher in tennessee and me have in common  we’re all sick and tired of obama and his socialist regime  i’ve got to admit that i’m pleasantly surprised when random people start talking about obama  i really like john mcmillan for commissioner of agriculture and industries in the gop primary runoff  mcmillan’s new tv ad describes the ag commissioner’s job pretty well in a few seconds  i like that mcmillan considers water quality to be an important issue and that when he was a state representative he worked on water issues  pioneer seed corn is very popular in western kentucky – an area which used to be known for tobacco but not so much anymore  just to note that politics and history are an inescapable part of life  the hibred corn company pioneer was founded in part by henry wallace the  progressive party candidate for president part of his campaign platform was universal government health insurance – socialized medicine  wallace later wrote where i was wrong explaining how he had been a ‘useful idiot’ of the soviets polls vs polls posted on june   by reactionary now that the gop gubernatorial numbers have settled down a little bit let’s compare the polls on june st – hat tip to doc’s versus the public strategy associates poll early may   bradley byrne received  of the vote vs  robert bentley received  vs  tim james received  vs  roy moore received  vs   psa observed that  of known gop primary voters were undecided  in may psa said “the next couple of weeks will be ‘make or break’ in the governor’s race…” said brent buchanan a partner in public strategy associates “this is when the heat is on and a lot can change in the next nineteen days” he added nice job on the poll  looks like the undecideds broke for dr bentley and we’ll see soon enough if he or tim james is in the runoff pending the recount – friday is the deadline  the vote difference between bentley and james is  votes – well within the  error rate mentioned by susan fillipelli in comments at doc’s which seems to be a pretty good estimate   my guess is that bentley made the runoff with byrne but james certainly has good reason to request and pay for a recount primary runoff turnout generally drops to  of the primary turnout but that’s still roughly  voters who might show up the most recent gop primary runoff in madison county turned out about  – which could translate into almost  voters on july th  it’s probably safe to assume that most of byrne’s  voters show up and that most of bentley’s or james’  voters show up that leaves  to  votes ‘undecided’   none of the candidates’ voters by themselves can take the primary runoff exempli gratia byrne needs to get out all his vote plus add at least another  votes to win the runoff i voted for byrne and will again but james and bentley rounded out my top three choices so i could vote for any of them come november bradley byrne gotv posted on may   by reactionary from erin at the byrne campaign to right on huntsville the byrne campaign is going very well in madison county since your group’s endorsement we have only felt the momentum grow in this area the fish fry last saturday was a great success we had around  people attend it was the best political event the campaign has seen to date a big thanks to the members who helped make the event a memorable one as we get in the last  days leading up to the first election we are looking for a few more people to help us ensure a byrne victory in north alabama we need volunteers to make  phone calls each to remind others to get out the vote on june st there’s a short script and a list of names calls can be made anytime beginning friday may  and ending tuesday june  at  pm we also need volunteers to be election day “cheerleaders” for bradley throughout the day our first priority is to fill the  am shift at  gop boxes the realtors are working on filling some of these shifts but i say the more the merrier we will also look to place people at our biggest boxes from  and  all we need you to do is stand outside and wave a sign as people pass by if either of the above sounds like a winner to you please let me know asap at  or erinwalkerbyrneforalabamacom bradley can’t win up here without your help the easiest way to jump in is to come by hq  university drive on monday for a memorial day gotv cookout you can make  calls from here and then have a hot dog and drink it’ll be a good time if you want to help out this weekend we’ll be here  at least tomorrow and saturday and  sunday i’ll also be here all day tuesday you are welcome to come watch the numbers here after work that day mcgop –  may  posted on may   by reactionary the room was packed this morning for the madison county gop breakfast – there’s lots of great energy out there we’ll see if that energy manifests itself in voter turnout in the primary elections on june  i was lucky enough to find a chair and got a great seat between huntsville city councilman mark russell and huntsville times ace reporter challen stephens  the more i speak with russell the more i’m pleased that i vote for him  we spoke about the police advisory commission and he explained the background of why the council supports the creation of the commission – and why the bill kling ‘compromise’ is a good solution  we also talked about the clinton avenue ‘parking garage and affordable downtown housing for young professionals’ – thank goodness that project got put on hold here’s challen stephens’ article “huntsville city no longer planning to build lofts to lure young professionals downtown” …city councilman mark russell who represents the area said there always remained too many unanswered questions about the city’s role in creating buildings to be finished and possibly operated by private developers challen stephens does good work for the times as “the watchdog”  here’s another one of his recent articles “huntsville housing authority construction plans questioned” one of the volunteers who oversees the huntsville housing authority broke ranks on monday voting against plans to build the  million gateway place senior center downtown specifically board member dick fountain said he’s concerned about millions of federal dollars passing through huntsville on their way to private companies in louisville ky and jacksonville fla… the construction will cost about  million widman said and the rest would cover soft costs such as architect fees and engineering fees some members of the audience on monday questioned those figures don spurlin a republican candidate for the state senate told the board that a third of the budget shouldn’t be going to soft costs and overhead after doing the math to come up with a price tag of  per apartment spurlin simply said “that seems like a lot”  the main speakers this morning were bradley byrne and roy moore  here’s a summary of their speeches byrne “do you want paul hubbert to pick your next governor” “it is time to take our state back from paul hubbert the vice chairman of the democratic party” “… largest public corruption case in the nation is going on in birmingham” “we have the weakest ethics laws” “focus on jobs” “roads and bridges to support brac” “will do what it takes to fight for the constellation project” “right on huntsville endorsement” “i will not back down” moore “obama is a socialist” “everything about the constitution is being undermined” “we’re going to change the state legislature” “smaller government fewer taxes” “graduated from west point” “you need somebody who knows about the military” to lead the guard and reserve – that line got applause “get somebody who will say one thing and do it” challen stephens of the huntsville times wrote “moore criticizes obama byrne rails against hubbert” byrne gave a fiery if short speech lambasting hubbert the head of the teachers’ alabama education association… byrne has recently been attacked as too liberal in a tv ad sponsored by the true republican pac hubbert has publicly acknowledged that aea provided the money for the ad… “barack obama is a socialist” he moore said… the only position of obama’s that he agrees with said moore is the creation of a playoff system for college football but moore offered only the most general proposals for his plans saying he favored smaller government lower taxes and less regulations  i got to meet facebook friend james lomax in real life  lomax is running for huntsville city council district   along with jonathan hitt barry pendergraft and john olshefski  i’m impressed with his campaigning efforts and that he attends council meetings  attending council meetings board meetings citizen meetings etc is timeconsuming and i might add kinda boring at times… but it is the life of politicians public strategy gop governor and ag poll posted on may   by reactionary the good folks at public strategy associates say that gop gubernatorial candidates bradley byrne and tim james are running “neck and neck” in a race that is “too close to call” psa also observes “luther strange strongly pulling away from incumbent troy king in the race for attorney general” in phone surveys conducted by baselice  associates with  known republican primary voters the race for governor of alabama appears to be a dead heat between byrne and james byrne is in the lead at  percent with james right behind at  percent the survey found the bottom three contenders are roy moore at  percent robert bentley at  percent and bill johnson at  percent with  percent undecided survey data in the republican primary for attorney general indicates that luther strange has a commanding lead over troy king with strange at  percent and king at  percent the percentage of undecided voters in this race is at  percent compare that to an earlier psa poll from the “best in the barrio” post the poll of “likely republican primary voters” showed gubernatorial candidates bradley byrne at  roy moore at  tim james at  robert bentley at  kay ivey at  and bill johnson at  – with  of gop primary voters undecided the poll showed attorney general candidates troy king incumbent at  and luther strange  – with  of gop primary voters undecided brent buchanan of psa comments “the next couple of weeks will be ‘make or break’ in the governor’s race it will come down to who has the best message that resonates with the right universe of voters the appropriate amount of times” said brent buchanan a partner in public strategy associates “this is when the heat is on and a lot can change in the next nineteen days” he added danny at doc’s wrote “public strategy associates releases independent polling in gop gov  ag races”   thanks to clinton for the heads up  a quick look at the gop governor’s race sees that byrne’s support has gained a little but that james and bentley have gained lots of ground and that moore’s support is stable  this looks like a threeway race for the primary runoff between byrne james and moore in the gop attorney general’s race big luther strange seems to be getting his money’s worth from his media campaign right on huntsville endorses bradley byrne posted on may   by reactionary right on huntsville endorsed bradley byrne for governor citing “his proven leadership conservative progrowth vision and record on ethics reform  these qualities will enable byrne to turn alabama’s economy around create jobs and restore trust in state government” the endorsement was announced today may  at the rbc summit building downtown  great view and a beautiful day – someone should think about putting a restaurant up there…  joel jaqubino of right on made the announcement for the group and introduced byrne byrne gave a short speech focused on the crises that face alabama the economy the budget public corruption and now the oil spill  byrne said that alabama has the th most corrupt state government in the nation reax – note that the ranking was earned before the new gambling investigation  byrne also mentioned the recent school board scandal as an example of corruption in the state that story is known around here as the smithwick hijacking byrne said that building roads in huntsville would be the top priority of his transportation department  he said that’s not just what he tells people up here but all across the state from dothan to birmingham he’s explained the need to prioritize roads up here and that they agree byrne lives on mobile bay so he’s been paying attention to the spill  byrne said that it has already cost the seafood industry hundreds of jobs plus thousands of people are cancelling their beach trips  byrne urged people not to cancel their trips – the coastal tourism industry needs you i say go on down and then help clean up if you can – you’ll do a double good heres a summaryof byrne’s prepared remarks “i’m incredibly honored and grateful to receive the support of these conservative leaders  right on huntsville has quickly emerged as a leading force in pushing for conservative economic growth and strong government accountability two hallmarks of my campaign  if given the opportunity to serve as your next governor i will work hard to build and maintain an environment that fosters a robust economy and we will – once and for all – implement reforms in montgomery that bring about strong government accountability and restore public trust in our system” state representative mike ball and madison county commissioner dale strong attended the announcement huntsville governors forum report posted on april   by reactionary it’s been awhile since the lifechanging huntsville governors forum on march   my notes and memories aren’t getting any better with age  so finally here it is the post you’ve all been waiting for the hottest post in the world the huntsville governors forum report to refresh your memories the madison county young republicans and right on huntsville hosted the forum at the davidson center  republican gubernatorial candidates robert bentley bradley byrne kay ivey tim james bill johnson and james potts attended – note that kay ivey has since decided to run for lieutenant governor retired lt gen jim link of redstone arsenal and teledyne brown gary palmer of the alabama policy institute and former huntsville mayor loretta spencer were the forum panelists the event was attended in total by  people but what surprised me was that it was almost like two events several hundred attended the reception and several hundred attended the forum  anyway – it was a successful event – the hosts did better than break even the davidson center costs big money – iirc like  with catered hors d’ouvres   but it was worth it the forum began promptly at  with the butler high school air force rotc color guard presenting the colors  i was able to spend some time with the cadets and they are great kids – smart and ambitious  rotc instructors colonel mike parsons and senior master sergeant elijah porter are creating future leaders – well done retired colonel john reitzell led the pledge of allegiance  clinton carter of the madison county young republicans introduced the candidates and panelists  kudos to carter for doing a fantastic job of organizing the forum  joel jaqubino of right on huntsville fired up the audience with red meat – and then – the big show… loretta spencer asked about state support for brac in terms of roads and infrastructure bentley – signed the gas tax pledge james – signed the gas tax pledge saying “where do we get the biggest return” and “bang for the buck” byrne – cited maryland brac efforts as a model governor is “the point of the spear” state may have to spend more than  on the dollar for roads and schools johnson – helped get brac jobs “understands the needs and will deliver” ivey – “focused” designate senior staff to liaison with city  county leaders to cut red tape “count on kay ivey” potts – statewide audit taxfree bonds for infrastructure subdivisions pay their way air  water quality of life general jim link asked for specific ideas to boost the economy james – “keep taxes down” incentivize existing businesses regulations – “get government out of the way” byrne – use universities as key asstes cited year college robotics center create “office of innovation and entrepreneurship” johnson – get all the brac jobs here that are allocated improve state image grow exports ivey – economic liberty entrepreneurship elevate office of economic development to cabinet level workforce development and education unfortunately i missed potts’ and bentley’s answers as well as gary palmer’s question along with the responses to his question from most of the candidates  we’ll pick back up with bentley and james’ responses to palmer’s question bentley – unfunded teachers retirement is huge problem  billion plus  billion for employee health care need to refinance over year cycle  need health savings accounts likes representative greg canfield’s rolling budget plan james – elect republicans to the state house and senate   more  mayor loretta spencer asked about forming a ‘transportation commission’ to hire the alabama department of transportation director johnson – supports “taking the politics” out of road construction ivey – “the last thing you need is another layer of government”  need a firm method of deciding road funding potts – “committees spend money on studies but don’t get anything done” bentley – every time this bill came up he voted for it he voted against it this time because he’s running for governor  the governor needs a single point of contact not a commission james – no commission  removing politics from the process won’t happen  need one person in charge byrne – not ready for a commission maybe in the long term general link said there are  people who work at redstone arsenal  what role does the state play in protecting federal jobs such as constellation ivey – listen and “keep economy healthy healthy healthy” potts – keep a close relationship with senators work force development ensure that education produces students who perform gradelevel work bentley – brac renegotiation in  education work with senators and representatives james – believes in limited government interstate commerce and defense  cited lobbying office in washington for the air force tanker program byrne – “intense response to brac” johnson – cited the moon landing “we can’t sit on the sidelines” while china and russia continue improving their space programs  sorry about this out of time  only a few more pages of notes to post  maybe starting this post will motivate me to finish it – that’s the plan… winter wonderland forum posted on march   by reactionary tuesday march  dawned with snow… fluffy chunks of what les phillip calls “goreflakes”   the republican women of huntsville held a gubernatorial forum at the ledges which is a beautiful place any day but it was spectacularly beautiful in the snow  tim james on his facebook said “the snow up in the hills was absolutely breathtaking” the forum was moderated by wbhp’s will anderson who did a fine job of asking questions and pressing for answers  i got to meet will in person after the event – he recognized my name but couldn’t place it – i mentioned that i’d called his show once before and that we’d talked about obama’s looming defense and nasa cuts which have since happened  i was impressed that will recalled the conversation  we also talked about brian’s social skills “wounded rat” and will’s compliments to brian’s posts calling flashpoint the “heritage foundation of alabama” the forum agenda called for each of the five candidates attending robert bentley bradley byrne kay ivey tim james and bill johnson to give a short opening speech followed by three questions each and ending with closing remarks  here are some snippets kay ivey – “it’s women who manage money” bradley byrne – “the  issue is not bingo it’s putting our people back to work” bill johnson – asked about education said “not everyone will go to college” and proposed improving technical and trade education bradley byrne – asked about education said “we shouldn’t let the vicechair of the democratic party aea’s paul hubbert rob our children of their future” robert bentley – asked about health care said “form health insurance exchange” and ‘scholarships for medical students with committments to practice in underserved areas’ kay ivey – asked about her greatest single skill said “leadership standing on principle” and mentioned that she’s been vilified for pact but that “governors don’t get to choose crises” tim james – about pact said “the problem is we lost balance” and that trust fund money should be more carefully invested bill johnson – “always votes against taxes” because “it’s personal” tim james – “i’m a businessman” who’s “created private sector jobs” robert bentley – “the state is in pain and you need a doctor” thanks to the republican women of huntsville for a great event – there were more than  people there – what a turnout  i think the gop is going to have a good year… huntsville governors forum posted on march   by reactionary the huntsville governors forum will be held tuesday march   at the davidson center  the forum will start at pm and the public is invited the huntsville times wrote “six of seven republican candidates for alabama governor to appear at forum” the forum will be moderated by a panel including retired lt gen jim link former commanding general of redstone arsenal and former president of teledyne brown engineering gary palmer president of the alabama policy institute and former huntsville mayor loretta spencer “huntsville and north alabama have not always been at the ‘epicenter of attention’ for candidates for political office but i believe the scope and size of the huntsville governors forum shows that we are gaining influence in the state’s political process” said clinton carter chair of the madison county young republicans and the forum’s chair “we feel that the forum will provide a great opportunity for voters to hear directly from the republican candidates for governor including where they stand on a variety of issues that are important to huntsvillians” the forum will commence with the presentation of the colors by butler high school’s air force rotc color guard followed by the pledge of allegiance and invocation each panelist will ask two questions – each candidate will have  seconds to respond to each question which is a long time in forum time  we’ve scheduled an hour for all three panelists to ask  their two questions and get responses from the six candidates remember –  second answers we’ve scheduled  minutes for a ten question “lightning round”  each candidate gets  seconds to respond to these questions ranging from free the hops brewery modernization to charter schools to improving trade and technical schools along with the obligatory gambling question  we’ve tried to come up with some questions that are different from those asked at other venues… we’ve also scheduled  minutes for a potentially exciting “round robin” where each candidate gets to directly ask one other candidate a question even though the forum is competing with ncis we expect to have a fine turnout and we’d love to see you there thanks to the huntsville times for writing about the huntsville governors forum – i think that the event will generate some news content for you… archives
