our reliance on several large customers for a significant percentage of revenue uncertainties related to the economic environments in the industries we serve uncertainties related to future contract research and development revenue uncertainties related to future stock repurchases and dividend payments and other specific risks that may be alluded to in this report or in the documents incorporated by reference in this report for more information regarding our risks and uncertainties see item a risk factors of this report item  business in general      nve corporation referred to as nve we us or our develops and sells devices that use spintronics a nanotechnology that relies on electron spin rather than electron charge to acquire store and transmit information we manufacture highperformance spintronic products including sensors and couplers that are used to acquire and transmit data we have also licensed our spintronic magnetoresistive random access memory technology commonly known as mram nve history and background      nve is a minnesota corporation headquartered in a suburb of minneapolis we were founded in  by james m daughton phd a spintronics pioneer our common stock became publicly traded in  through a reverse merger and became nasdaq listed in  since our founding we have been awarded more than  million in government research contracts these contracts have helped us develop products and build our intellectual property portfolio we have adopted a march  fiscal year so fiscal years referenced in this report end march  industry background      much of the electronics industry is devoted to the acquisition storage and transmission of information we have focused on three applications for our spintronic technology magnetic sensors couplers and memories sensors acquire information couplers transmit information and memories store information in that sense our technology can provide the eyes nerves and brains of electronic systems      magnetic sensors can be used for a number of purposes including detecting the position or speed of robotics and mechanisms or for communicating with implantable medical devices we believe our spintronic sensors are smaller more precise and more reliable than competing devices      couplers are widely used in factory automation providing reliable digital communication between electronic subsystems in factories for example couplers are used to send highspeed data between robots and central controllers as manufacturing automation expands there is a need for higher speed data and more channel density because of their unique properties we believe our couplers transmit more data at higher speeds and over longer distances than conventional devices      nearterm potential mram applications include missioncritical storage such as military industrial and antitamper applications long term mram could address the market for ubiquitous highdensity memory our enabling technology      our designs are generally based on either giant magnetoresistance or tunneling magnetoresistance these structures produce a large change in electrical resistance depending on the electron spin orientation in a free layer      in giant magnetoresistance gmr devices resistance changes due to conduction electrons scattering at interfaces within the devices the gmr effect is only significant if the layer thicknesses are less than the mean free path of conduction electrons which is approximately five nanometers our critical gmr conductor layers may be less than two nanometers or five atomic layers thick  table of contents        the second type of spintronic structure we use is based on tunneling magnetoresistance tmr such devices are known as spindependent tunnel sdt junctions or magnetic tunnel junctions mtjs sdt junctions use tunnel barriers that are so thin that electrons can tunnel through a normally insulating material to cause a resistance change sdt barrier thicknesses can be in the range of one to four nanometers less than ten molecular layers      in our products the spintronic elements are connected to integrated circuitry and packaged in much the same way as conventional integrated circuits our strategy      our vision is to become the leading developer of practical spintronics technology and devices our spintronic technology provides eyes nerves and brains for electronic systems breathing life and intelligence into inanimate objects our unique products support global trends of smarter and smaller connections and an internet of things we plan to monetize our technology by selling the products described below and licensing our mram technology to grow product sales we plan to broaden our sensor and coupler product lines and longer term to target larger markets such as consumer electronics automotive electronics and biosensors our products and markets      we operate in a single business segment that includes research design and manufacture of spintronics for commercial and military markets sensor products and markets      our sensor products detect the strength or gradient of magnetic fields and are often used to determine position or speed the gmr changes its electrical resistance depending on the magnetic field in our devices gmr is combined with conventional foundry integrated circuitry and packaged in much the same way as conventional integrated circuits we sell standard or catalog sensors and custom sensors designed to meet customers exact requirements our sensors are quite small very sensitive to magnetic fields precise and reliable standard sensors      our standard or catalog sensors are generally used to detect the presence of a magnetic or metallic material to determine position or speed we believe our spintronic sensors are smaller more precise and more reliable than competing devices our major market for standard sensors is factory automation custom and medical sensors      our primary custom products are sensors for medical devices which are customized to our customers requirements and manufactured under stringent medical device quality standards most are used to replace electromechanical magnetic switches we believe our sensors have important advantages in medical devices compared to electromechanical switches including no moving parts for inherent reliability and being smaller more sensitive and more precise our sensors can be customized using customerspecific integrated signal processing and design variations that can include the range and sensitivity to magnetic fields electrical resistance and multisensor elements configuration future custom sensor target markets include consumer electronics automotive electronics and biosensors coupler products and markets      our spintronic couplers combine a gmr sensor element and an isoloop integrated microscopic coil the coil creates a small magnetic field that is picked up by the spintronic sensor transmitting data almost instantly couplers are also known as isolators because they electrically isolate the coupled systems our isoloop couplers are faster than the fastest optical couplers      we have five lines of coupler products costeffective ilseries couplers ilseries passiveinput couplers ililseries highspeed couplers ililseries isolated network couplers and ilseries topoftheline couplers mram products and markets      mram uses spintronics to store data it has been called the ideal or universal memory because of its potential to combine the speed of sram the density of dram and the nonvolatility of flash memory data is stored in the spin of the electrons in thin metal alloy films and read with spindependent tunnel junctions unlike electrical charge the spin of an electron is inherently permanent we have invented several types of mram memory cells including inventions related to advanced mram designs and mram for tamper prevention or detection      our strategy is to develop manufacture and sell low bitdensity mram for applications such as tamper prevention and detection for high bitdensity mram our strategy is to license our technology to companies with largescale memories manufacturing capabilities  table of contents   product manufacturing      the heart of our fabrication facility is a cleanroom area with specialized equipment to deposit pattern etch and process spintronic materials most of our products are fabricated in our facility using either raw silicon wafers or foundry wafers foundry wafers contain conventional electronics that perform housekeeping functions such as voltage regulation and signal conditioning in our products      each wafer may include thousands of devices we build spintronics structures on wafers in our fabrication facility we either saw wafers to be sold in die form or send wafers to asia for dicing and packaging other production operations include waferlevel inspection and testing packaged parts are returned to us to be tested inventoried and shipped sales and product distribution      we rely on distributors who stock our products and sell them in more than  countries distributors of our products include america ii electronics inc digikey corporation and premier farnell plc companies our distributor agreements generally renew annually in addition we distribute versions of some of our products under privatebrand partnerships with large integrated device manufacturers these privatebrand partnerships broaden our distribution and enhance our sales support technical support and brand awareness new product status      in the past year we began marketing a number of new products including              new angle sensor models for energy and resource management that use less energy or less magnetic field  rotation sensors for robotics and resource management  new sensors for medical devices and  new antitamper sensors        longterm product development programs in fiscal  included              smart sensor interfaces for connection to the internet of things  biosensors for food safety and medical diagnostics  new current sensors for energy management  ultrahigh speed couplers  lowpower couplers and  mram for antitamper and security applications   our competition industrial sensor competition      several other companies either make or may have the capability to make gmr or tmr sensors also several competitors make solidstate industrial magnetic sensors including silicon halleffect sensors and anisotropic magnetoresistive amr sensors we believe those types of sensors are not as sensitive as our gmr or tmr sensors medical sensor competition      our sensors for medical devices face competition from electromechanical magnetic sensors and from other solidstate magnetic sensors electromechanical magnetic sensors such as reed and microelectromechanical system mems switches have been in use for several decades because our sensors have no moving parts we believe they are inherently more reliable than electromechanical magnetic sensors we also believe our sensors are smaller than the smallest electromechanical magnetic sensors more precise in their magnetic switch points and more sensitive compared to other solidstate sensors our medical sensors may have advantages in size sensitivity to small magnetic fields or electrical interface simplicity coupler competition      competing coupler technologies include optical couplers inductive couplers transformers capacitive couplers and radiofrequency modulation couplers prominent optical coupler suppliers include broadcom limited fairchild semiconductor international liteon technology corporation renesas electronics corporation toshiba corporation and vishay intertechnology      our strategy is to compete based on product features rather than to compete solely on price isoloop couplers are smaller and therefore require less circuit board space per channel than most competing couplers our other advantages over competing technologies may include less signal distortion longer product life and lower power consumption mram competition      a number of companies compete or may compete with us for mram research and development or service business or may be attempting to develop mram intellectual property for licensing to others emerging technologies that could compete with mram include graphene and carbon nanotubes phasechange memory pcm also known as chalcogenide d xpoint or ovonic memory resistive ram reram or rram conductive bridge ram cbram memory resistors memristors and conductive metal oxide cmox memory mram may have advantages over these technologies in either manufacturability speed bit density data retention or endurance    table of contents   sources and availability of raw materials      our principal sources of raw materials include suppliers of raw silicon and semiconductor foundry wafers that are incorporated into our products and suppliers of device packaging services our wafers sources are based around the world most of our packaging services take place in asia intellectual property patents      as of march   we had more than  issued us patents assigned to us we also have a number of foreign patents a number of us and foreign patents pending and we have licensed patents from others there are no patents we regard as critical to our current business owned by us or licensed to us that expire in the next  months      much of our intellectual property has been developed with us government support under federal legislation companies normally may retain the principal worldwide patent rights to any invention developed with us government support      certain of our patents cover inventions we believe may be necessary for successful highdensity highperformance mrams we believe us patent  titled current switched magnetoresistive memory cell is particularly important the patent has been reissued as re  and expires may          we also have patents on advanced mram designs that we believe are important including patents that relate to magnetothermal mram spinmomentum mram and synthetic antiferromagnetic storage trademarks      nve and isoloop are our registered trademarks other trademarks we claim include gmr switch and gt sensor seasonality      in some years we have observed weak product sales late in the calendar year possibly due to ordering patterns or customer vacations and shutdowns we cannot predict whether this seasonal pattern will occur in future years working capital items      like other companies in the electronics industry we have historically invested in capital equipment for manufacturing and testing our products as well as research and development equipment we have also deployed significant capital in inventories to have finished products available from stock to receive more favorable pricing for raw materials and to guard against raw material shortages dependence on major customers      we rely on several large customers for a significant percentage of our revenue including abbott laboratories formerly st jude medical inc sonova ag formerly known as phonak ag certain other medical device manufacturers and certain distributors the loss of one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on us firm backlog      as of march   we had  of contract research and development backlog we believed to be firm compared to  as of march   we expect the firm backlog as of march   to be filled in fiscal  certain contracts have performance requirements and milestones and there can be no assurance that backlog will result in future revenue our product sales are made primarily under standard purchase orders which are generally cancellable therefore product order backlog is not included in firm backlog and product sales backlog as of any particular date may not be indicative of future results we also have certain agreements that require customers to forecast purchases however these agreements do not generally obligate the customer to purchase any particular quantity of products based on semiconductor industry practice and our experience we do not believe that such agreements are meaningful for determining backlog amounts  table of contents   research and development activities      over the past three fiscal years our research and development activities have included development of new sensors couplers and memories as well as related underlying technologies we spent  for

development contract activities these research and development contracts were with various agencies of the us government as well as nongovernment entities environmental matters      we are subject to environmental laws and regulations particularly with respect to industrial waste and emissions compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position to date existing and future environmental laws and regulations could result in expenses related to emission abatement or remediation but we are currently unable to estimate such expenses number of employees      we had  employees as of march   our employment can fluctuate due to a variety of factors none of our employees are represented by a labor union or are subject to a collective bargaining agreement and we believe we maintain good relations with our employees financial information about geographic areas      foreign sales accounted for approximately

condition operating results business prospects or any other aspect of nve and could cause our actual results to differ materially from that projected or estimated by us in the forwardlooking statements made by us or on our behalf although we have attempted to list below the important factors that do or may affect our financial condition operating results business prospects or any other aspect of nve other factors may in the future prove to be more important new factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all of such factors similarly we cannot necessarily assess or quantify the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor or combination of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forwardlooking statements we may lose revenue if any of our large customers cancel postpone or reduce their purchases      we rely on several large customers for a significant percentage of our revenue these large customers include abbott laboratories formerly st jude medical inc sonova ag formerly known as phonak ag certain other medical device manufacturers and certain distributors although we have agreements with certain large customers these agreements do not obligate customers to purchase from us and may not prevent price reductions furthermore orders from our large customers can generally be reduced postponed or canceled any decreases in purchase quantities or purchase prices or the loss of any of our large customers could have a significant impact on our revenue and our profitability we risk losing business to our competitors      known product competitors include analog devices inc broadcom limited fairchild semiconductor international hermetic switch inc linear technology inc maxim integrated products inc meder electronic ag memscap sa nec corporation sharp corporation silicon laboratories inc texas instruments incorporated toshiba corporation vishay intertechnology and others many of our competitors and potential competitors have significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources than us we believe that our competition is increasing as the technology and markets mature this has meant more competitors and more severe pricing pressure in addition our competitors may be narrowing or eliminating our performance advantages we expect these trends to continue and we may lose business to competitors or it may be necessary to significantly reduce our prices in order to acquire or retain business these factors could cause a material adverse impact on our financial condition revenue gross profit margins or income  table of contents   we may lose revenue if we are unable to renew customer agreements      we have agreements with certain customers including a supply agreement as amended with sonova ag formerly known as phonak ag which expires march   and a supplier partnering agreement as amended with abbott laboratories formerly st jude medical inc expires january   we cannot predict if these agreements will be renewed or if renewed under what terms although it is possible we could continue to sell products to these customers without formal agreements an inability to agree on mutually acceptable terms or the loss these customers could have a significant adverse impact on our revenue and our profitability we will lose revenue if government contract funding is reduced delayed or eliminated      although our revenue from agencies of the us government was less than  of our total revenue in each of the past three fiscal years a material decrease in us government funded research or disqualification as a vendor to the us government for any reason could hamper future research and development activity and decrease related revenue in addition to direct government funding certain of our nongovernment customers and prospective customers depend on government support to fund their contracts with us our direct and indirect government funding depends on adequate continued funding of the agencies and their programs such funding is affected by government budgets and priorities that can change and over which we have no control and delays in such funding can occur for a number of reasons interruptions in the government funding process such as federal budget delays debt ceiling limitations shutdowns or sequestration may impact government contract funding furthermore some of our government funding has been through small business innovation research sbir or small business technology transfer research sttr contracts sbir and sttr budgets eligibility or funding limits may be changed by legislation or by agencies such as the department of defense or department of agriculture if we were barred for any reason from us government contracts there could be a significant adverse impact on our revenue and our ability to make research and development progress      if we were to be charged with violation of certain laws or if the us government were to determine that we are not a presently responsible contractor we could be temporarily suspended or in the event of a violation barred for up to three years from receiving new us government contracts or governmentapproved subcontracts in addition we could expend substantial amounts in defending against such charges and in damages fines and penalties if such charges are proven or result in negotiated settlements being barred for any reason from us government contracts could have a material adverse effect on our revenue profits and research and development efforts we face an uncertain economic environment in the industries we serve which could adversely affect our business      we sell our products into the semiconductor market which is highly cyclical additionally effects of us healthcare reform legislation could have an adverse effect on the economic environment for the medical device industries we serve we cannot predict the timing strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent recovery worldwide or in the industries we serve the economic environment could have a material adverse impact on our business and revenue failure to meet stringent customer requirements could result in the loss of key customers and reduce our sales      some of our customers including certain medical device manufacturers have stringent technical and quality requirements that require our products to meet certain test and qualification criteria or to adopt and comply with specific quality standards certain customers also periodically audit our performance failure to meet technical or quality requirements or a negative customer audit could result in the loss of current sales revenue customers and future sales we could be subject to claims based on warranty product liability or delivery failures      claims based on warranty product liability or delivery failures that could lead to significant expenses as we defend such claims or pay damage awards we may also incur costs if we decide to compensate the affected customer or end consumer for such claims in addition if our customers recall products containing our products we may incur costs and expenses relating to the recall costs or payments we may make in connection with warranty delivery claims or product recalls may adversely affect our business and financial condition some of our products are incorporated into medical devices which could expose us to a risk of product liability claims and such claims could seriously harm our business and financial condition      certain of our products are used in medical devices including devices that help sustain human life we are also marketing our technology to other manufacturers of cardiac pacemakers and icds although we have indemnification agreements with certain customers including provisions designed to limit our exposure to product liability claims there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to losses claims damages liabilities or expenses resulting from bodily injury or property damage arising from the incorporation of our products in devices sold by our customers our indemnifying customers may not have the financial resources to cover all liability existing or future laws or unfavorable judicial decisions could limit or invalidate the provisions of our indemnification agreements or the agreements may not be enforceable in all instances a successful product liability claim could require us to pay or contribute to payment of substantial damage awards which would have a significant negative effect on our business and financial condition  table of contents   federal legislation may not protect us against liability for the use of our products in medical devices and a successful liability claim could seriously harm our business and financial condition      although the biomaterials access assurance act of  may provide us some protection against potential liability claims that act includes significant exceptions to supplier immunity provisions including limitations relating to negligence or willful misconduct a successful product liability claim could require us to pay or contribute to payment of substantial damage awards which would have a significant negative effect on our business and financial condition any product liability claim against us with or without merit could result in costly litigation divert the time attention and resources of our management and have a material adverse impact on our business any malfunction of our products in existing medical devices could lead to the need to recall devices incorporating our products from the market which may be harmful to our reputation and cause a significant loss of revenue      any malfunction of our products could lead to the need to recall existing medical devices incorporating our products from the market which may be harmful to our reputation because it is dependent on product safety and efficacy even if assertions that our products caused or contributed to device failure do not lead to product liability or contract claims such assertions could harm our reputation and our customer relationships any damage to our reputation andor the reputation of our products or the reputation of our customers or their products could limit the market for our and our customers products and harm our results of operations we may lose business and revenue if our critical production equipment fails      our production process relies on certain critical pieces of equipment for defining depositing and modifying the magnetic properties of thin films some of this equipment was designed or customized by us and some may no longer be in production while we have an inhouse maintenance staff maintenance agreements for certain equipment some critical spare parts and backups for some of the equipment we cannot be sure we could repair or replace critical manufacturing equipment were it to fail the loss of supply from any of our key singlesource wafer suppliers could impact our ability to produce and deliver products and cause loss of revenue      our critical suppliers include suppliers of certain raw silicon and semiconductor foundry wafers that are incorporated in our products we maintain inventory of some critical wafers but we have not identified or qualified alternate suppliers for many of the wafers now being obtained from single sources increased industry demand or other factors beyond our control or ability to predict could cause or exacerbate wafer supply shortages wafer supply interruptions for any reason including acts of god such as floods typhoons cyclones or earthquakes could seriously jeopardize our ability to provide products that are critical to our business and operations and may cause us to lose revenue the loss of supply of any critical chemicals or supplies could impact our ability to produce and deliver products and cause loss of revenue      there are a number of critical chemicals and supplies that we require to make products these include certain gases photoresists polymers metals and specialized alloys we maintain inventory of critical chemicals and materials but in many cases we are dependent on single sources and some of the materials could be subject to shortages or be discontinued by their suppliers at any time furthermore current and future climate change regulations could increase our costs or cause the loss of supply of critical chemicals we use chemicals such as sulfur hexafluoride in our manufacturing process that have been identified as greenhouse gases if such chemicals were restricted or prohibited we would need to obtain substitutes that might be more expensive or less available supply interruptions or shortages for any reason could seriously jeopardize our ability to provide products that are critical to our business and operations and may cause us to lose revenue the loss of supply from any of our packaging vendors could impact our ability to produce and deliver products and cause loss of revenue      we are dependent on our packaging vendors because of the unique materials our products use the complexity of some of our products and the high isolation voltage specifications of our couplers many of our products are more challenging to package than conventional integrated circuits some of our products use processes or tooling unique to a particular packaging vendor and it might be expensive timeconsuming or impractical to convert to another vendor in the event of a supply interruption we have alternate vendors or potential alternate vendors for the substantial majority of our product sales but it could prove expensive timeconsuming or technically challenging to convert certain products to an alternate vendor we might not be able to recover work in process or finished goods in their possession if one of our packaging vendors were to become insolvent or disrupted by acts of god including floods typhoons or earthquakes furthermore an alternate vendor may not have sufficient capacity available to meet our requirements additionally certain of our packaging vendors are in floodsusceptible areas flooding risks to such vendors may increase in the future due to possible higher ocean levels extreme weather and other potential effects of climate change any supply interruptions or loss of inventory could seriously jeopardize our ability to provide products that are critical to our business and operations and may cause us to lose revenue  table of contents   we are subject to risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries that could impair our results of operations      foreign sales were approximately  of our revenue for fiscal  and we expect foreign sales to continue to represent a significant portion of our revenue furthermore we rely on suppliers in china india taiwan thailand and other foreign countries risks relating to operating in foreign markets that could impair our results of operations include economic and political instability difficulties in enforcement of contractual obligations and intellectual property rights changes in regulatory requirements tariffs customs duties and other trade barriers transportation delays acts of god including floods typhoons cyclones and earthquakes and other uncertainties relating to the administration of or changes in or new interpretation of the laws regulations and policies of jurisdictions where we do business our business and our reliance on intellectual property exposes us to litigation risks      if patent infringement claims or actions are asserted against us we may be required to obtain a license or crosslicense modify our existing technology or design a new noninfringing technology such licenses or design modifications can be costly or could increase the cost of our products in addition we may decide to settle a claim or action against us which settlement could be costly we may also be liable for any past infringement and we may be required to indemnify our customers against expenses relating to possible infringement if there is an adverse ruling against us in an infringement lawsuit an injunction could be issued barring production or sale of any infringing product it could also result in a damage award equal to a reasonable royalty or lost profits or if there is a finding of willful infringement treble damages any of these results would increase our costs or harm our operating results we may not be able to enforce our intellectual property rights      we protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property by seeking patents trademarks and copyrights and by maintaining trade secrets through entering into confidentiality agreements with employees suppliers customers and prospective customers depending on the circumstances we hold patents or are the licensee of others owning patented technology covering certain aspects of our products and technology these patent rights may be challenged rendered unenforceable invalidated or circumvented two of our patents have been subject to inter partes reexamination proceedings by the us patent and trademark office initiated by everspin technologies inc as a defensive action in connection with our litigation against everspin the claims of one of the patents were invalidated and a final adverse decision on the other inter partes reexamination or any future reexamination proceedings could invalidate some or all of the patent claims additionally rights granted under the patents or under licensing agreements may not provide a competitive advantage to us we have filed a patent infringement lawsuit against everspin and at least several other companies have described designs that we believe may infringe on our patents if such designs were commercialized efforts to enforce patent rights can involve substantial expense and may not be successful furthermore others may independently develop similar superior or parallel technologies to any technology developed by us or our technology may prove to infringe on patents or rights owned by others thus the patents held by or licensed to us may not afford us any meaningful competitive advantage also our confidentiality agreements may not provide meaningful protection of our proprietary information our inability to maintain our proprietary rights could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we may not be able to enforce our patents against motorola freescale or everspin      our patent license option agreement with motorola provided for termination on december   or on the date motorola ceases manufacturing mram products whichever is later we believe such a termination is likely to have occurred as a result of motorola apparently having eliminated its ability to manufacture mram products through its spinoff of freescale in  freescale announced that it had transferred its mram technology and intellectual property to an independent company everspin technologies inc we believe we are free to negotiate a new agreement with freescale or everspin or an assignment of the motorola patent license option agreement but we have said we would do so only with amendments thereto a settlement agreement by and between everspin and us limits our rights to sue everspin for patent infringement and prevents us from asserting three specific patents against everspin there can be no assurance that we can successfully enforce any of our other patents or that any agreement will be reached with freescale or everspin or that nve would receive any value under the existing agreement with motorola or any value under any such further agreement with freescale or everspin our business success may be adversely affected if we are unable to attract and retain highly qualified employees      we have employment agreements with certain employees including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer but those agreements do not prevent employees from leaving the company competition for highly qualified management and technical personnel can be intense and we may not be able to attract and retain the personnel necessary for the development and operation of our business the loss of the services of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations  table of contents   we could incur losses on our marketable securities

standard and poors indicating a possible increase in default risk conditions and circumstances beyond our control or ability to anticipate can cause downgrades and increases in default risk and such downgrades or increases in default risk are possible at any time additionally the assignment of a high credit rating does not preclude the risk of default on any marketable security defaults default

highquality investment grade longterm marketable securities with less than five years to maturity we classify all of our marketable securities as availableforsale thus securities are recorded at fair value and any associated unrealized gain or loss net of tax is included as a separate component of shareholders equity accumulated other comprehensive income loss if we judged a decline in fair value for any security to be other than temporary the cost basis of the individual security would be written down and a charge recognized to net income the fair values for our securities are determined based on quoted market prices as of the valuation date and observable prices for similar assets we consider a number of factors in determining whether otherthantemporary impairment exists including credit market conditions the credit ratings of the securities historical default rates for securities of comparable credit rating the presence of insurance of the securities and if insured the credit rating and financial condition of the insurer the effect of market interest rates on the value of the securities and the duration and extent of any unrealized losses we also consider the likelihood that we will be required to sell the securities prior to maturity based on our financial condition and anticipated cash flows if any of these conditions and estimates change in the future or if different estimates are used the fair value of the investments may change significantly and could result in otherthantemporary decline in value which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations inventory valuation      inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value cost is determined by the first in first out method where there is evidence that inventory could be disposed of at less than carrying value the inventory is written down to the net realizable value in the current period additionally we periodically examine our inventory in the context of

subsequently sold corresponding reductions in inventory and inventory reserves are made our inventory reserve was  as of march   and  as of march   deferred tax assets estimation      in determining the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets we must assess the likelihood of sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions based on estimates and assumptions to realize the

note  summary of significant accounting policies cash and cash equivalents      we consider all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents fair value of financial instruments      the carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable and accounts payable approximates fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments fair values of marketable securities are based on quoted market prices marketable securities      all of the investments we have held the past two years were marketable securities we classify securities with original maturities greater than three months and remaining maturities one year or less as shortterm marketable securities and securities with remaining maturities greater than one year as longterm marketable securities we classify all of our marketable securities as availableforsale thus securities are recorded at fair value and any associated unrealized gain or loss net of tax is included as a separate component of shareholders equity accumulated other comprehensive income loss we use a specificidentification cost basis to determine gains and losses the amortized cost of marketable securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity both of which are included in interest income      we consider an otherthantemporary impairment of our marketable securities to exist if we determine it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of a debt security if we judged a decline in fair value for any security to be other than temporary the cost basis of the individual security would be written down and a charge recognized in net income we consider a number of factors in determining whether otherthantemporary impairment exists including credit market conditions the credit ratings of the securities historical default rates for securities of comparable credit rating the presence of insurance of the securities and if insured the credit rating and financial condition of the insurer the effect of market interest rates on the value of the securities and the duration and extent of any unrealized losses we also consider the likelihood that we will be required to sell the securities prior to maturity based on our financial condition and anticipated cash flows we determined that no writedowns for otherthantemporary impairment were required on availableforsale securities during fiscal   or  concentration of risk and financial instruments      financial instruments potentially subject to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents marketable securities and accounts receivable      cash and cash equivalents have been maintained in financial institutions we believe have high credit quality however these accounts are generally in excess of federally insured amounts      we have invested our excess cash in corporatebacked and municipalbacked bonds and money market instruments our investment policy prescribes purchases of only highgrade securities and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer      our customers are throughout the world we generally do not require collateral from our customers but we perform ongoing credit evaluations of their financial condition more information on accounts receivable is contained in the paragraph titled accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts of this note      additionally we are dependent on critical suppliers including our packaging vendors and suppliers of certain raw silicon and semiconductor wafers that are incorporated in our products accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts      we grant credit to customers in the normal course of business and at times may require customers to prepay for an order prior to shipment accounts receivable are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts we make estimates of the uncollectibility of accounts receivable we specifically analyze accounts receivable historical bad debts and customer creditworthiness when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance we had no charges or provisions to our allowance for doubtful accounts in fiscal   or    f table of contents   inventories      inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value cost is determined by the first in first out method we record inventory reserves when we determine certain inventory is unlikely to be sold based on sales trends turnover competition and other market factors   product warranty      in general we warranty our products to be free from defects in material and workmanship for one year fixed assets      fixed assets are stated at cost depreciation of machinery and equipment is recorded over the estimated useful lives of the assets generally five years using the straightline method amortization of leasehold improvements is recorded using the straightline method over the lesser of the lease term or fiveyear useful life we record losses on longlived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amount we have not identified any indicators of impairment during fiscal   or  depreciation and amortization expense related to fixed assets was  for fiscal   for  and  for fiscal  revenue recognition product sales revenue recognition      we recognize product sales revenue when evidence of an arrangement exists the price to the buyer is fixed and determinable collectability is reasonably assured and the product has shipped our sales are shipped fob shipping point meaning that our customers end users and distributors take title and assume the risks and rewards of ownership on shipment our customers may return defective products for refund or replacement under warranty and have other very limited rights of return      shipping charges billed to customers are included in product sales and the related shipping costs are included in selling general and administrative expense such shipping costs were  for fiscal   for fiscal  and  for fiscal       our stocking distributors take title and assume the risks and rewards of product ownership payments from our distributors are not contingent on resale or any other matter other than the passage of time and delivery of products is not dependent on the number of units resold to the ultimate customer there are no other significant acceptance criteria pricing or payment terms that would affect revenue recognition accounting for commissions and discounts      we sometimes utilize independent sales representatives that provide services relating to promoting our products and facilitating product sales but do not purchase our products we pay commissions to sales representatives based on the amount of revenue facilitated and such commissions are recorded as selling general and administrative expenses under certain limited circumstances our distributors may earn commissions for activities unrelated to their purchases of our products such as for facilitating the sale of custom products or research and development contracts with third parties we recognize any such commissions as selling general and administrative expenses      we presume consideration given to a customer is a reduction in revenue unless both of the following conditions are met i we receive an identifiable benefit in exchange for the consideration and the identifiable benefit is sufficiently separable from the customers purchase of our products such that we could have purchased the products or services from a third party and ii we can reasonably estimate the fair value of the benefit received we recognize discounts provided to our distributors as reductions in revenue contract research and development revenue recognition      we recognize contract research and development revenue prorata as work progresses our research and development contracts do not contain postshipment obligations contracts may be either firmfixedprice or costplusfixedfee firmfixedprice contracts provide for a price that is not subject to any adjustment based on our cost in performing the contract      costplusfixedfee contracts are costreimbursement contracts that also provide for payment to us of a negotiated fee that is fixed at the inception of the contract the costs for which we earn reimbursement are the actual costs incurred and are recorded in the period in which they are incurred we recognize the contract fees prorata as work progresses   f table of contents   income taxes      we account for income taxes using the liability method deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities we provide valuation allowances against deferred tax assets if we determine that it is less likely than not that we will be able to utilize the deferred tax assets   research and development expense recognition      research and development costs are expensed as they are incurred   stockbased compensation      we measure stockbased compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize the compensation expense over the requisite service period which is generally the vesting period we estimate prevesting option forfeitures at the time of grant by analyzing historical data and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates ultimately the total expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest net income per share      net income per basic share is computed based on the weightedaverage number of common shares issued and outstanding during each year net income per diluted share amounts assume conversion exercise or issuance of all potential common stock instruments stock options were the only such instruments for the three most recent fiscal years stock options totaling  for fiscal   for fiscal  and  for fiscal  were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the exercise prices were greater than the market price of the common stock the following table

fair value provide a definition of fair value and prescribe required disclosures about fairvalue measurements generally accepted accounting principles define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability fair value is a marketbased measurement that should be determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability generally accepted accounting principles utilize a valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements the categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement the valuation hierarchy categories are as follows      level   financial instruments with quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities our level  financial instruments consist of publiclytraded marketable corporate debt securities which are classified as availableforsale on the balance sheets these securities are included in marketable securities short term and marketable securities long term the fair value of our level  marketable securities was  as of march   and  as of march        level
