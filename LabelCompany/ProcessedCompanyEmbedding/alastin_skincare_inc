skin receptivity to procedures as well as enhancing the healing process in order to optimize the overall procedure result the products are also designed to combat the signs of aging and improve and maintain skin health with daily use alastin skincare™ products with proprietary trihex technology™ feature a patentpending synergistic blend of potent peptides and key ingredients in a formulation designed to penetrate the skin alastin skincare™ products featuring trihex technology™ are based on proprietary science designed to stimulate strengthen and support the skin’s regenerative processes to enhance skincare procedure outcomes when stimulated by alastin skincare™ products the new skin is softer smoother and more pliable in histological studies alastin skincare™ products have been shown to enhance the deposition of both elastin and collagen this demonstration of enhanced elastin deposition in histological studies has established alastin skincare™ as the leader among skincare lines in the area of elastin stimulation importance of elastin and collagen elastin and collagen are the primary structural component proteins in the dermis collagen and elastin are abundant in early skin and critical for its ability to renew and regenerate levels of collagen and elastin begin diminishing almost immediately from birth and by middle age elastin replenishment is minimal therefore skin becomes less and less able to naturally recycle itself and regenerate resulting in slower wound healing and the telltale signs of aging including preprocedure and aged skin often presents with the following peptides and skin regeneration peptides are small proteins naturally present in the body that direct cell signaling certain peptides signal the generation of collagen and elastin also some have modulating and recycling properties of the extracellular matrix ecm enhancing the skin’s own ability to generate renewed healthy skin effects of time on the ecm the ecm the largest component of the dermal skin layer is the central orchestrator of skin repair and regeneration the ecm provides the background for cellular and matrix component signaling and crosstalk over time certain factors create waste products in the ecm including • extrinsic factors sun primary and other environmental factors • intrinsic factors genetics aging hormones these waste products result in protein clumping protein clumps clutter the ecm interfering with the crosstalk necessary for healthy cellular regeneration – ie the body’s ability to produce fresh healthy skin skin bed preparation in aged skin collagen and elastin clumping leads to inefficient fibroblasts and compromised ecm the strategy for reversing this long termdamage is to recycle the ecm and begin to remove the clumped protein fragments thereby allowing natural cell signalling to occur effectively in order to stimulate regeneration of collagen and elastin similar to how the chronic wound healing process requires wound bed preparation before therapeutic intervention treatment of chronic aging of the skin benefits from a “skin bed preparation” to optimize the outcome of rejuvenation procedures and skin maintenance programs this skin bed preparation serves to optimize procedure outcomes by creating an environment ideal for healing and regeneration ideally this skin bed preparation or preconditioning takes place over a  week period prior to the procedure trihex technology™ stimulates the clearing of the debris from the ecm allowing the body to produce new collagen and elastin skin repair although many patients believe the healing process is complete within a few short weeks postprocedure that visible healing is only on the skin’s surface in truth the full healing process can last well beyond the visual signs of recovery invasive and noninvasive procedures require specific aftercare and the healing process can last as long as  months posttreatment when skin is cut or injured in a surgical ablative laser or peel procedure the body begins a natural process of healing including • the inflammation phase stabilizes the site and cleans away dead cells and any bacteria lasts a short period of time and if prolonged can lead to scar formation • the reparative phase skin cells multiply and initiate mobilization to close the wound and regenerate the epidermis outer skin layer • the remodeling phase completes the skin remodeling can take  days or more and is marked by the formation of new layers of skin built up from within moderation of inflammation can reduce scarring and discoloration

procedures » noninvasive » skin care skin care conveniently located to serve the areas of maryland virginia and washington dc contents about the skin frequently asked questions how our skin ages why peel your skin what is chemical peeling skin care services vitalize peel rejuvenize peel about the skin the skin our body’s largest organ is both a complex and multipurpose organ it protects the body against injury chemicals bacteria and even uv light it regulates body temperature and is a vital part of our immune system in addition it has the wonderful power to constantly repair itself the skin is made of three layers the epidermis the outermost layerwhich has five sublayers the dermis the middle or supporting layer and the subcutis bottom or fatty layer the epidermis the layer we see and touch is very tough but microscopically thin it is the layer with the highest content of water however as we mature the skin’s ability to retain water decreases which causes the skin to become dehydrated this is why many of us feel the need to use a moisturizer when we reach our mid ’s the melanocytes the cells responsible for skin’s pigment are present in the lower layers of the epidermis these protective cells produce pigment melanin in response to ultraviolet rays skin trauma andor hormones melanocytes migrate into individual cells to form a physical umbrella over the cell’s nucleus this “brown umbrella” a suntan is created to protect the cell’s nucleus from even further sun damage and sunburn because a tan is created only when the skin is confronted with injury there is no such thing as a healthy tan unless it comes from a self tanner when severe damage has occurred and as we mature these cells often coagulate into clumps causing hyperpigmentation age spots the dermis middle layer is often referred to as the living skin this layer is made of collagen  and elastin    protein fibers that are woven together in a microscopic network collagen enables the skin to stretch and elastin brings it back to form elasticity depends on a well balanced water content in the dermis and other skin layers the dermal layer is also responsible for supporting the epidermis the skin’s repair immune system and sensory system the subcutis the bottom layer consists mainly of fat and cells interspersed with blood vessels nerve fibers and muscle fibers this layer acts as a protective cushion for what lies above it and below it frequently asked questions how our skin ages the skin which has the ability to renew itself goes through a natural shedding process called desquamation this cellular renewal takes about  days in normal skin however as we age this natural shedding process slows down in addition collagen production declines as well as the skin’s natural moisture level furthermore the subcutis fat begins to thin and facial muscles begin to sag this natural aging process is inevitable however many of our lifestyle choices make our skin age before it’s time activities such as smoking sunbathing excessive alcohol consumption a poor diet and lack of sleep all take a toll on our skin terms such as “weathered skin”  “photoaging” and “premature aging” are often used to describe such skin the good news is that we can do something about it why peel your skin artificially removing the outer layer of skin by a process called peeling or exfoliating helps speed up the body’s natural process of skin renewal the skin grows back without replicating many of the problems that have developed during its life—such as fine lines sun damage dark spots etc consistently removing the outer layers of skin epidermis results in a skin that is well hydrated less pigmented and more youthful looking what is chemical peeling chemical peeling involves applying an acidic solution to the skin the most popular chemical peels are glycolic acid made from sugar cane and lactic acid made from milk these chemicals are also called alpha hydroxy acids the chemical solution promotes the shedding of the skin by breaking down the substance that holds the skin cells together the extent of the exfoliation depends on the type of acid its ph and the condition of your skin chemical peels have a cumulative effect and are best done is a series of  treatments benefits of a chemical peel smoother skin surface and texture minimized appearance of lines and wrinkles increased production of collagen and elastin reduction of hyperpigmentation salicylic acid betahydroxy acid another popular chemical peel contains the same active ingredient found in aspirin although this acid is similar to alphahydroxy acids it has the added ability to penetrate the skin’s pores because it is lipid oil soluble this type of acid peel is excellent for refining clogged pores and reducing skin’s breakouts because this acid is related to aspirin it is an antiinflammatory and is a great treatment for acne and rosacea benefits of salicylic acid comedones epidermal pigmentation problems fine lines and wrinkles large pores shallow scarring skin laxity skin care services vitalize peel level  helps fight the effects of time sun damage and environmental impurities this powerful peel can take years off aging skin  for  minutes rejuvenize peel level   – the deepest of the skinmedica peels this treatment penetrates into the skin to produce significant results with minimal irritation you will have noticeable improvement in skin texture and tone as well as acne melasma and hyperpigmentation it can provide noticeable results after one peel controlled exfoliation of the uppermost damaged
