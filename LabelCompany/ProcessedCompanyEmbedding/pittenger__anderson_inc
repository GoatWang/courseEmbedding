management styles are highlighted below  we have included characteristics of each who they might appeal to and the average allin cost to you for each style custom equityfixed incomebalancedmutual fundsetfs typically has a  allocation to equities but fixed income can be added at discretion of pa largely individual stocks with exchangetraded funds etfs and mutual funds mixed in to round out the portfolio if you want to know exactly what stocks you own custom equity will appeal to you this style allows us to more effectively manage your realized gains  losses each tax year our fee schedule begins at  of assets per year with the first breakpoint at  million the average allin cost to you including trading commissions is generally in the  to  range on an annual basis this style is invested  in bonds bond funds and other fixed income securities if you want a predictable income stream and lower volatility than a portfolio with stocks this style will appeal to you if you’re in a high tax bracket and want the taxfree interest from municipal bonds if you prefer knowing when your bonds will mature this style should appeal to you same fee schedule as custom equity our most popular management style this is a combination of custom equity  fixed income primarily individual stocks and bonds with some mutual funds and etfs mixed in to round out the portfolio asset allocations are tailored to your risk tolerance financial goals and time horizon a good option if you don’t want all your invested assets exposed to the stock market same fee schedule as custom equity and fixed income noload and no transaction fee mutual funds are used to achieve proper diversification low cost index funds constitute anywhere from  to  of these accounts  index funds seek to replicate the return of a market benchmark or index such as the sp   managed mutual funds where the fund manager seeks to beat a certain index or benchmark represent the remainder of the portfolio mutual fund accounts are rebalanced twice per year at a minimum  rebalancing involves bringing each mutual fund back to our desired weighting  funds that have outperformed typically are trimmed while those that have underperformed typically are added to if you plan to consistently add to or withdraw from your account this style may be of interest our fee schedule for mutual fund accounts starts at  annually the allin cost to you which includes the underlying mutual fund expenses as well as our management fee is generally between  and  exchangetraded funds etfs are baskets of stocks or bonds similar to mutual funds but they trade during the day like individual stocks and bonds do our etf accounts will be formally rebalanced or reviewed for rebalancing two times per year  in effect they are constantly being monitored for any investment that falls outside of our preferred range these accounts work well for investors who are comfortable with mutual fundlike products and who want to minimize their expenses our fee schedule for these accounts starts at  annually the etfs we use have relatively lower expense ratios than mutual funds the allin cost to you including etf expenses trading commissions and our management fee is generally around  you won’t read this on many other financial adviser websites but given our feeonly business model it’s in our interest to keep your

way to give money to charities and c organizations is not by writing the charity a check  if you have an aftertax investment account with highly appreciated securities a charitable gift trust or donoradvised fund should be of interest  we use fidelity for these and they charge  per year for this account while we don’t charge you anything you fund a gift trust account by contributing appreciated securities netting you a charitable contribution deduction for the current tax year  you also avoid paying capital gains taxes on the securities you contribute to your gift trust account  fidelity requires a minimum of  to open one and minimum donations to charity called grants of  each here’s more about the benefits of using a charitable gift trustdaf collaborating with your other
