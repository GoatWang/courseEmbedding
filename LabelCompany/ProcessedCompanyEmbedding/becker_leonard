case began in  my first attempt at finding a lawyer to represent me did not go well within months it became apparent he didnt know what he was doing and even more so when he withdrew his counsel  years later the opposing lawyers loved this and began calling my house taunting me telling me to just give up and it was a very difficult case i knew this and so i began to think maybe it was hopeless but thanks to the anger i felt from their phone calls and my moms encouragement  i pursued the case i knew i was right and so i started to look for a better lawyerthats when i found lannon lannon  barr in the beginning they were unsure of the outcome and they told me it would be a very difficult case they didnt give up on me though and before i knew it the case was building and moving forward suddenly everything started to look like maybe i actually had a chance i knew very quickly that i had found a very good lawyerwe won the case after losing two more appeals the insurance company finally gave up firing the lawyers who had originally harassed me and admitting defeat i cant even express in words how excited i am with the outcome i sincerely recommend this law firm to everyone and anyone who needs a good workers compensation attorney they wont give up on you they know exactly what they are doing and they work hard for you call thembudin law officesb a ratedi and two more
