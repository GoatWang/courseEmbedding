need to respond in kind generics are flooding the marketplace foreign protocols are making newproduct development more demanding than ever and we can only guess at the future of pricing but revolutionary opportunities are just as powerful look at the growth of personalized medicine biologics and the exciting pipelines in oncology alzheimers disease diabetes hiv and other therapeutic areas the revolution is here and the smartest companies are right in the front lines general consultants are often extremely bright people with mbas from the finest bschools and they deliver a multitude of processesagain and again and again what many of them dont do however is execute—theyve never had to whats needed now is industryspecific experience and lots of it cary lemkowitz pharma companies need to work and play well with everyone else in the valuechain sandbox they need to drop their adversarial attitudes about managed care organizations pharmacy benefit managers and drug superstores and reach out to them to form productive alliances specifically there is the need for energetic statesmanlike leaders who can reach out to both congress and the general populace more money needs to be spent not on lobbying but on educating people about the drugs being developed to treat lifethreatening illnesses imagine the effectiveness of a highly visible wellfunded initiative featuring a respected spokesperson on the level of meryl streep the time for speculating about that kind of cooperative industry program is over its time now to get it done a call to action providing prescription drug coverage for everyone who needs it is the right thing to do so who is better qualified to devise the best plan congress the presidential candidates or the pharmaceutical industry in partnership with the medical profession the smartest companies will establish programs now to make sure their drugs are accessible to all who need them senior managers need to get out of their offices and innovate the marketing tools that are available today are in their own way as revolutionary as the molecules that are being developed managers need to drive innovation in both areas they need to put programs in place to embed the culture of innovation deep in their companies dna and finally they need to gather all the business intelligence they can about their competition they need to understand what the competition is doing and anticipate what theyre going to do we like to call it healthy paranoia the knowledge that theres always someone out there trying to steal share from your brand getting back to basics with walmart promoting  generics the pharmaceutical industry has to do what it has always done—create superior new products that both physicians and patients will insist on having access to at the end of the day companies that help people live happier healthier longer lives will have a place of honor at the national table but first companies need to be brutally honest with themselves—and us—about the areas where they need help traditional pharmaceutical marketing just wont cut it anymore companies that are ready to innovate can now jump the revenue curve more than
