the requirements of the securities exchange act of  the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the duly authorized undersigned     civeo corporation         date               may                   by s   michael l ridley               michael l ridley       senior vice president and   president       north america duly authorized officer       exhibit – conflict minerals report   conflict minerals report of civeo corporation in accordance with rule p under the securities exchange act of    this is the conflict minerals report “cmr” of civeo corporation “civeo” or “company” for the reporting period ended december   the “reporting period” in accordance with rule p under the securities exchange act of  “rule p”    introduction   the intent of this cmr is to summarize the results of civeo’s good faith reasonable country of origin inquiry “rcoi” and describe civeo’s due diligence process in accordance with rule p requirements    reasonable country of origin inquiry description   to implement the rcoi civeo’s tier  suppliers representing  of spend in conflict mineral supplier categories as defined by the company were engaged to collect information regarding the presence and sourcing of gold tantalum tin and tungsten collectively “tg” used in the products supplied to civeo information was collected and stored within civeo’s internal record keeping systems   civeo’s supplier engagement efforts followed these steps     ● an introduction was presented and discussed with tier  suppliers describing the conflict minerals compliance program “cmcp” requirements     ● following the introduction information was solicited from suppliers on the presence of tg in the products supplied to civeo     ● throughout the process suppliers were supported and offered assistance to ensure timely survey completion and submission compliance     ● civeo performed a series of follow ups with nonresponsive suppliers     ● civeo escalated the request to senior management within the supplier organization where appropriate to ensure supplier participation in cmcp requirements   civeo utilized the electronic industry citizenship coalition “eicc” and global esustainability initiative “gesi” conflict minerals due diligence template “eiccgesi template” for data collection   suppliers were asked to provide information regarding the sourcing of their materials with the ultimate goal of identifying the tg smelters or refiners “sors” and associated mine countries of origin to facilitate reporting at the productlevel the products indicated by civeo as being sourced from a given supplier were communicated to that supplier as part of the data request suppliers were able to submit multiple conflict minerals reporting templates “cmrt” as needed to address all indicated products in many cases however the supplier response defaulted to a company level cmrt and was not specifically related to products supplied to civeo           supplier responses were evaluated for plausibility consistency and to ensure completion of the necessary detail additional contact with suppliers was conducted to address issues of incomplete data on eiccgesi templates    rcoi results   twentyeight  suppliers were identified as having supplied materials containing tg to be used in civeo’s manufacturing processes they were considered inscope for conflict mineral regulatory purposes and contacted as part of the rcoi process   a total of  smelters or refiners sors spanning  countries of origin were identified as potential tg sors used by our suppliers below is a summary of verified smelters –    as a result of the inquiry process civeo was able to identify sor of tg with an indication of democratic republic of

a conflict free smelter program cfsp audit and have submitted signed agreement for the exchange of confidential information aeci and auditee agreement contracts   rwanda     for those declaration responses provided at the company and userdefined level and nonspecific to civeo’s products the presence of any particular smelter is not necessarily linked to the products that civeo purchases and uses in its products as thus the information provided in such supplier responses was not at a productlevel specific to the materials and components we use as such the identified sors and countries of origin identified above have not been confirmed to be present in civeo’s supply chain      design of due diligence framework   civeo’s due diligence process is designed in accordance with the organization for economic cooperation and development’s oecd due diligence guidance for responsible supply chains of minerals from conflictaffected and highrisk areas and accompanying supplements httpwwwoecdorgdafinvmneguidanceeditionpdf  collectively the “oecd guidance” it is important to note that the oecd guidance was written for both upstream  and downstream  companies in the supply chain as civeo is a downstream company in the supply chain our due diligence practices were tailored accordingly                                                             oecd due diligence guidance for responsible supply chains of minerals from conflictaffected and highrisk areas supplement on tin tantalum and tungsten and supplement on gold  httpwwwoecdorgdafinvmneguidanceeditionpdf  upstream companies refer to those between the mine and sor as such the companies typically include miners local traders or exporters from the country of mineral origin international concentrate traders and sors    downstream companies refer to those entities between the sor and retailer as such the companies typically include metal traders and exchanges component manufacturers product manufacturers original equipment manufacturers oems and retailers            due diligence measures performed   due diligence measures undertaken by civeo included the following   ● maintained current the company’s conflict minerals policy the conflict minerals policy is publicly available at httpswwwciveocom    ● assembled an internal team to support supply chain due diligence   ● established a system of controls and transparency over the mineral supply chain   ● implemented internal measures to strengthen company engagement with suppliers   ● included an internal grievance mechanism in the conflict minerals policy   ● designed and implemented a strategy to respond to supply chain risks   ● implemented a risk management plan monitored and tracked risk mitigation reported to senior civeo supply chain management and evaluated supplier partnerships and   ● reported annually on supply chain due diligence this cmr and the form sd to which it is an exhibit are publicly available at httpirciveocomseccfm     steps to improve due diligence   civeo will endeavor to continuously improve upon supply chain due diligence efforts via the following measures   ● continue to assess the presence of tg in the supply chain   ● clearly communicate expectations with regard to supplier performance transparency and sourcing   ● increase supplier response rate for rcoi process   ● increase supplier rate of product specificity for rcoi process   ● increase the rate in which civeo addresses issues including implausible statements regarding no presence of tg and incomplete data on eiccgesi templates regarding scrap and recycled sources    ● continue to compare rcoi results to information collected via independent conflict free smelter validation programs such as the eiccgesi conflict free smelter program   ● engage with sors to obtain mine of origin and transit routes and assess whether sors have carried out all elements of due diligence for responsible supply chains of minerals from conflictaffected and highrisk areas   ● undertake additional fact and risk assessments for risks requiring mitigation or after a change of circumstances and   ● provide continuing education to members of our conflict minerals compliance team as well as employees who are involved with supplier and customer contact related to conflict minerals compliance        inherent limitations   because civeo is a downstream user of tg we must rely on the representations and information provided by our suppliers and other third parties within our supply chain as a result incomplete or inaccurate information provided by the suppliers or by a sor could affect the accuracy or completeness of the information set forth below or other information contained in this cmr   note also that many suppliers provided responses with sor information based on a company or divisional level rather than a productlevel specific to the materials and components we use as such civeo is unable to confirm all sors in its supply chain for the reporting period       cveo key statistics  civeo corp financial ratios  marketwatch bulletin investor alert new york markets open in market snapshot analyst
