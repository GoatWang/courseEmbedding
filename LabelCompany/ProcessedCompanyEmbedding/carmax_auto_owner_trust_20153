line with the prior five transactions from a collateral credit quality perspective the weighted average wa fico is  however there is a slight increase in greater than  month loans at  adequate credit enhancement ce structure initial ce for the class a notes has dropped slightly since  while ce on the class b c and d notes has increased initial excess spread is  lower than  as well loss coverage for all notes is adequate to support fitchs  base case proxy for the respective ratings stable portfoliosecuritization performance losses on cafs portfolio and  securitizations have remained below the peak levels seen in  evolving wholesale market the us wholesale vehicle market wvm is normalizing following strong performance in recent years fitch expects increasing used vehicle supply from offlease vehicles and tradeins to pressure abs recovery rates leading to moderately higher loss rates fitchs analysis accounts for this risk by including periods of weak wvm performance in the derivation of its base case loss expectation stable origination underwriting and servicing fitch believes caf to be a capable originator underwriter and servicer for caot  integrity of the legal structure the legal structure of the transaction should provide that a bankruptcy of caf would not impair the timeliness of the payments on the securities rating sensitivities unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case in turn it could result in potentially adverse rating actions on the notes fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to all classes of carmax auto owner trust  to increased losses over the life of the transaction fitchs analysis found that the notes display some sensitivity to increased defaults and losses in fact they could lead to potential downgrades of up to one category under fitchs moderate x base case loss scenario the notes could experience downgrades of two to three rating categories under fitchs severe x base case loss scenario due diligence usage additionally fitch was provided with thirdparty due diligence information from kpmg llp
