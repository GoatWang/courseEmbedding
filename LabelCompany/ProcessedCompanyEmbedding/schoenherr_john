schoenherr  oracle corporation  zoominfocom john schoenherr biography written by kirk snavely prior to entering college john schoenherr considered a career in biology fortunately for those of us who enjoy his work he preferred drawing to dissection and opted for art his interest in animals and rocks developed at an early age and is reflected in his illustrations for science fiction and childrens literature and in his wildlife art he was born in new york city in  as a fouryearold he drew pictures to communicate with his friends who spoke chinese italian irish and greek in the babel of his queens neighborhood he spoke only german at home as his german father and hungarian mother were european immigrants the desire to draw remained after he learned english listening to his mother practice it as she read to him from the comic strips and any available surface would do when he was eight his parents gave him a set of watercolors and soon after he was given oils at thirteen he was taking the subway into manhattan to attend saturday classes at the art students league where he studied etching and lithography under will barnet whom schoenherr later credited as getting me to see and draw things realistically instead of in a comic book mode quoted in frances traher john schoenherr in the midst of the city he discovered the natural world exploring the abandoned lots and undeveloped fields in his neighborhood as a young boy and becoming aware of the shapes and textures of cobblestones at his doorstep he sketched the animals at the bronx and central park zoos and drew habitat groups at the american museum of natural history where he came in contact with spelunkers and learned about the art students league summer camps in the adirondacks were an occasion to draw the animals he encountered he began exploring caves as a teenager the time spent underground over the years informs his illustrations for speleology  caves and the cave environment    such as the stalactites shown at right the book was authored by george w moore and nicholas sullivan above ground rock climbing gave him a daylight view of stone as well as a visceral feel for its texture knowledge he would use in later work he also enjoyed hiking and camping just being outdoors spending weeks alone exploring the woods and rivers of the adirondacks after high school schoenherr attended the pratt institute in brooklyn where he enjoyed photography but ironically failed nature drawing he was more concerned with drawing accurately while the instructor stressed selfexpression during the summers he returned to the art students league where frank reilly introduced him to the old french academy style of painting among the instructors who influenced him at pratt were richard bové frederico castellon stanley meltzoff william a smith and khosrov ajootian who helped him with his draftsmanship getting the right contours schoenherr admired the use of light in the work of the old masters van eyck rembrandt michelangelo and vermeer he also liked the photographs of edward weston with their monumental stones and their simplicity and strength of composition after graduating from pratt with a bfa in  he worked for a short while cutting mats in a studio then became a freelance illustrator and never looked back his simple philosophy was to adapt the clients needs to his own vision and make the best picture he could         worlds of imagination the nesfa press  back to top schoenherr made his first professional sale while still in college collecting  from amazing stories in  his affinity for science fiction sf began in childhood when he read jules vernes mysterious island illustrated by nc wyeth as a reader he had admired richard powerss ethereal paperback covers and edd cartiers lively magazine interiors for their ability to enhance the text of a story after graduation from pratt schoenherr was able to get work in the field and contributed interior illustrations to a variety of sf magazines over the next several years primarily amazing stories fantastic and infinity the tongueincheek noahs ark piece at right from adam chases deadly honeymoon in the june  issue of fantastic is an early depiction of alien fauna fsf  analog  in his early portrayals of humans the eyes are often visible one example at far left is from a bertram chandlers the man who could not stop in the may  issue of the magazine of fantasy and science fiction fsf the eyes tend to disappear in shadow later on however as in the drawing at near left from raymond f joness the great gray plague in the february  issue of analog this lends his drawings a darker more abstract quality in my view in  began what for him would be a long association with astounding science fiction which changed its name to analog in  he had been reading astounding since high school and preferred the tone of the magazine his art dominated the covers of analog during the sixties many of his early cover paintings were done in egg tempera or oils and are somewhat subdued in color compared to his work after  which includes acrylics schoenherrs covers portrayed a variety of settings and moods as shown below from future police stations february  to sandstorms on a desert planet december  from whimsical july  to startling february  february  december  july  february  code three february  is an example of his compositional skill my eyes are led around the page from the face on the cruiser with its contrasting red light green windshield and white mouth to the textures and rectangular patterns of the pavement stones overhead lights and brick wall the cover for dune world december  demonstrates his ability to create a dramatic scene the lines of eroded gullies in the foreground converge on the two running figures who are dwarfed by the massive rock formation that dominates the picture a potential shelter from the approaching storm in the background the stark contrast of this scene with the two moons floating in the serene blue sky further emphasizes the danger a reproduction of the cover for trader team july  hangs in my living room and whenever i look at it it is fresh perhaps it is the eyes of the centauroid saurian the masterful lighting on his skin or the contrast in color between his skin and the sky fido february  reminds me of other media images from the early seventies for its shock value the cover is both disturbing and attractive his covers include elements that elicit a second look from the observer what are the human figures doing in the background of code three is that a rock spire or a rocket ship in the background of trader team is something falling out of the sky in fido and why does the sky appear to be burning john w campbell jr who was the editor of astoundinganalog had a preference for scratchboard for the interior illustrations of his magazine scratchboard showed up well in the primitive letterpress printing that was used at the time for the sf pulps and schoenherr was a master of this medium one example is the siamese cat at left from mario brands the spy analog april  click on the image to obtain something approximating the actual size of the illustration in the magazine the cats eyes are luminous the larger size of the magazine for this year bedsheet or ¼ inches by  inches enabled more detail to be seen in the illustrations using his considerable knowledge of animals he enjoyed creating convincing aliens designing his own or fleshing out the authors descriptions the atmospheric rendering of azkashi shown at right is from poul andersons the ancient gods analog june  when his favorite type of scratchboard rossboard became unavailable after the manufacturers proprietor passed away schoenherr explored other media he started using acrylic drybrush because he could scratch into it but did less of that over time anne mccaffreys pernese dragons weyr search analog october  shown above right were done in acrylic over gesso and modeled on dinosaurs then he started using rough watercolor paper with bowlpointed post office pens and drybrush with japanese brushes he created marvelous texture using this technique as in the crazy quilt of the spaceships cargo hold above left from spider robinsons when no man pursueth analog november  it is a threedimensional scene that appeals to his spelunking days when the pulps went to offset printing he tried some wipeout techniques but they werent too popular occasionally he would tweak your funny bone the baboons below are doing their own version of the three monkeys in bernard deitchmans chester analog june  in  schoenherr started painting paperback covers for science fiction horror and fantasy primarily for pyramid and ace he was also doing paperback covers in travel adventure and natural history his early covers showed some influence from surrealism a movement in art that was adopted for paperback covers in science fiction the previous decade by richard powers the dreamlike qualities of the green rain  include the spiky tree the human forms moving along the single road across the barren plain to the abstract city and the rain that looks more like a green aurora when i first looked at the cover of more macabre  i saw what i thought was the profile of a dinosaurlike head with a large eye and ear hole only later did i see it as the frontal view of a primatelike head missing one eye either way it is a striking cover for me the blade of grass is a whatsit element pyramid  ace  pyramid  ace  ace  ace  he quickly developed his own more representational style typified by biomorphic machines  and buildings  alien encounters  and faces with strained or sardonic expressions  often set against brightly colored backgrounds a good schoenherr cover be it a magazine or paperback has a presence to it in the science fiction genre schoenherrs name is perhaps most closely associated with frank herberts novel dune originally published as two serials in analog dune world and the prophet of dune between  and  schoenherrs illustrations for dune world rendered in scratchboard and for the prophet of dune using acrylic drybrush on illustration board helped garner him the  hugo award for best artist he later produced allnew illustrations for the illustrated dune published in  the sandworm at left is from the  dune calendar frank herbert was so impressed with schoenherrs work that he once referred to him as the only man who has ever visited dune quoted in the new encyclopedia of science fiction noted sf illustrator vincent di fate holds john schoenherr in high esteem saying he is one of the very best artists to have ever worked in the science fiction genre personal communication schoenherr worked diligently in the genre for a decade producing some of his best illustrations for analog in the sixties and providing close to  paperback covers for pyramid and ace yet he remained relatively poor at the time publishers were not paying competitive rates for sf illustration in the late sixties he lost interest in the subject matter following a short hiatus he returned to analog for several years in the seventies then aside from a rare appearance now and then he left the field of sf illustration but around the corner          sports cars illustrated september  back to top around this time he and his young son ian who is currently a talented illustrator worked on a science fiction novel for young readers lee hardings the fallen spaceman  schoenherr was no stranger to childrens literature however coincidence played a part in his first book assignment sterling norths rascal  about a boy and his pet raccoon both schoenherr and the first illustrator chosen for the book occasionally did art work for the bronx zoo though they had not met that artist was too busy to work on the book on the basis of what he had seen of schoenherrs zoo work he recommended him to the publishers art director who happened to be a fan of science fiction schoenherrs scratchboard illustrations for rascal which was a newbery honor book attracted the attention of other publishers and over the years he illustrated close to fifty hardcover wildlife books for children and young adults other wellknown titles include walt moreys gentle ben  and jean craighead georges julie of the wolves  which won the john newbery medal the newbery medal is awarded to the book which showed the most distinguished writing for children in the previous year in robert murphys the golden eagle  the hungry mountain lion at right faces off with a porcupine not shown schoenherr captures the concentration in the cats posture and does a beautiful job depicting the texture of the lions fur the fox in miska miless fox and the fire  shown below is unconcerned as he scratches his ear here we see schoenherrs dramatic scratchboard style in  schoenherr wrote and illustrated the barn an ala notable book inspired by a skunk he observed waddling into a neighbors rundown barn allan w eckerts incident at hawks hill  is based on a true story of a little boy who became lost in rural manitoba canada and was adopted by a female badger the chance meeting of the two is depicted in the scene at left for me the continuity of the boys hair with the grass and the badgers fur suggests a link between boy and badger while the shading of the badgers back into the paper denotes the unexpected nature of the meeting by  schoenherr had illustrated ten of miska miless books looking at the otter below from miska miless otter in the cove  i get a real sense of the ocean sometimes he worked in preseparated color printers charged more for doing separations than illustrators he used a wipeout technique for theodore clymers the travels of atunga  the eskimo atunga watches sun dance with moon in the scene shown at left in joanne ryders simon underground  he combined color with the texture of drybrush on watercolor paper below simon the mole digs his way to the surface and springtime the toad appears to have been rudely awakened after the fallen spaceman schoenherr spent the next seven years happily focused on his own wildlife painting then he read a jane yolen manuscript given to him by a friend and editor at philomel and accepted the assignment to illustrate the book without hesitation he had taken his own children owling in the woods when they were small and he resonated with the attitudes toward the wild found in janes prose in addition for the first time in childrens literature he could work in full color and he chose pen with watercolor on darches paper the woods around his farm formed the setting and his wifes suggestion of including the small animals hidden in the landscape helped enliven the winter scenes john schoenherr won the  randolph caldecott medal for his work on owl moon the caldecott is for the illustrator of the most distinguished picture book for children in the previous year with the success of owl moon philomel encouraged schoenherr to write and illustrate more childrens books for bear  a story of growth and survival of a young bear he traveled to the alaskan peninsula to study the coastal species in the watercolor at right produced for the book the bear wanders through mountains and snowfields and valleys of ash in search of food in rebel  a curious gosling goes exploring unaware of potential dangers in pond and forest in both books each realistic watercolor is a twopage spread scholastic commissioned him to contribute watercolors in a more playful mode to from sea to shining sea amy l cohn ed  and lynn plourdes pigs in the mud in the middle of the rud  well worth the enjoyable read          outside the box       readers digest july  back to top from a young age schoenherr had a desire to paint wildlife he began painting wildlife in his teens and continued to do so for assignments at pratt and while making a living as an illustrator all the while improving his fine art technique he traveled widely to study and photograph animals that he would later paint in his studio an old barn that he himself rebuilt the barn was located on the acre rural farm near locktown new jersey where he lived with his family red rocks oil    the american west appealed to him on his first trip to the western united states in  while attending a spelunkers convention in wyoming with his wife judy he encountered bison over the years he climbed cliffs after mountain goats in montana and photographed sea otters in california during return trips to the western deserts and caves he grew to love the stone and dirt there the underlying structure of the landscape in preference to the eastern woodlands many of his wildlife paintings are set in rugged barren landscapes outpost acrylic  some of his field trips were commissioned the national park service hired him to paint bears in the great smoky mountains as official artist of a tour to puerto rico he painted the cave where the camuy river flows on a monthlong trip to iran commissioned to paint the wildlife there he and his wife came upon tigers leopards red deer brown bear and wild goats while hiking in the elburz mountains and were chased by a wild boar the boar can be found in the art of painting wild animals  part of the grumbacher series in  schoenherr made his first trip to alaska during a month spent photographing and studying the huge alaska brown bear at katmai national monument he came to identify with the bear though he soon learned not to carry food with him on the trails he made many return trips to alaska during one trip he was surprised to suddenly see a  lb brown bear in the viewfinder of his camera the bear passed within six feet of him while he remained motionless illustration continued to pay the bills but schoenherr chafed at the constraints and compromises involved as he described in his caldecott medal acceptance speech i gradually learned however that my most satisfactory work was based on intuitive discovery usually while painting and usually at the last minute this approach is not accepted gracefully by most publishers they require sketches done on schedule and finished work which relates to the sketches  also done on schedule i was discovering that my best ideas usually happen in hindsight and on their own schedule    i found the compromises of illustration too limiting and devoted myself fully to creating my own images painted in my own manner and done on my own schedule in the late seventies he devoted himself to easel painting creating large paintings for galleries and managed to make a living at it his work has won awards and hangs in private collections and in museums and galleries around the country including the carson gallery in denver and the spanierman gallery in the field his sketchbook is a camera schoenherr relies on photographs and sometimes movies to study movement color and configuration most of his paintings begin as visions whether using a photograph as a springboard or recalling an image that persists in his memory he does not paint actual scenes art comes before subject matter pallas cat egg tempera  in his early work schoenherr showed an affinity for cats he portrayed many members of the cat family often working in egg tempera on panel the cachets for the  belize world wildlife fund stamp issue honoring the jaguar were painted by him at right is a proof page featuring one of his watercolors his preference later shifted to working in oils on canvas and painting large monochromatic mammals that he could use a big brush on particularly bears to him bears represent intelligence and power and recall a primeval age oil paint was a flexible medium that allowed him to make major changes on the canvas bear with salmon oil  during the creative process he will often rework a painting until it pleases him in one extreme case he worked on a painting of a tiger for eleven years his art is characterized by strong compositions and draftsmanship as well as masterful lighting with a few brush strokes and a heavy application of paint he creates the illusion of detail be it fur texture or feather markings his canvases tend to be large as well as long and narrow first outing oil  in referring to the animals he has encountered in the wild schoenherr states caldecott speech large or small i feel awe and wonder and respect they are all presences and personalities alien and largely unfathomable but worth acceptance and contemplation for what they are this is what ive found worth trying to express in my work he continues to communicate through his art twos company oil  john schoenherr and fellow sf artists were honored at chicon  in an exhibition of science fiction art of the fifties and sixties his watercolors for owl moon have toured the country a major retrospective of his wildlife painting and illustration john schoenherr beyond the edge and deep within was held at the hiram blauvelt art

one of the  tall figures to school and play with a classmate go ahead call me a sucker my husband didthinking on last night reminded me of joseph had a little overcoat a  caldecott medal winner by simms taback that teaches the virtues of thrift and being happy with what you have or as simms sums it up you can always make something out of nothing he adapted the story from a yiddish folk song he sang as a childin what appears to be a turnofthecentury jewish village joseph is wearing a worn overcoat with patches holding it together did he throw it in the trash bin and head to town to buy a new one no he made a jacket out of it and went to the fair where he had a blast before long joseph had a little jacket it got old and wornso he made a vest out of it and danced at his nephews wedding and so the frugality begins i wont give away any more of the story its fun to see what joseph turns the increasingly more worn and shrinking item intowhats unique about this book is that every few pages is diecut which means that there is a space cut out of the page large enough to fit whatever new piece of clothing joseph makes the diecuts get smaller as the pages are turned there is lots going on in every scene to keep your child on his toes friends peaking into a window an old man asleep while singing in the choir funny newspaper headlines like fiddler on the roof falls off the roof hanging platitudes on the walls of josephs humble homejoseph had a little overcoat is a simple but fun book that teaches a moral without being preachyheres a video sampling of joseph had a little overcoat

permanentlyno one knows why some corpses reanimate and its tough deciding what to do with them they cant hold jobs because whos buying anything a smelly decomposing zombie is selling they have no rights because theyre technically not alive people are free to hurl obscenities at them throw perfectly good food at them from their cars and attack and kill them again without any legal ramificationsandy attends undead anonymous just to get out of his parents wine cellar every week but he cant participate in the group discussions because his larynx is crushed and hes still sporting stitches from where the embalmer sewed his lips shut he bathes in pinesol but hes still embarrassed about his graveyard odorbut he eventually makes friends with some members of the group rita a beautiful suicide who eats makeup hoping the chemicals will stave off rot jerry a girlie magazine enthusiast tom a vegetarian whose arm is stolen during a fraternity hazing and ray whose wife went missing and who generously shares jars of preserved mystery meat with the groupas andy starts venturing out of the wine cellar and onto the streets he feels the weight of zombie injustice on his shoulders and becomes a mouthpiece for the civil rights of the undead then he and his fellow undead anonymous group start healing in miraculous ways now with two heartbeats per minute will he risk his second chance at life and the awful prospects of being shipped off to a zombie zoo or losing his head to a teaching college to become the martin luther king jr of zombiesthere are some laughoutloud
