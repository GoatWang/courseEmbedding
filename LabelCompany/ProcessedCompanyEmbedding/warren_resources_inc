heavily to investors between  and  with the massive slide in oil prices in  and  caused by the jump in domestic oil stockpiles due to new highly efficient drilling techniques like horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracking techniques companies affiliated with the oil industries have lost substantial value resulting in devastating investment losses for many investors unfortunately many small oil

have declined in value in  and  the  billion masterlimitedpartnership sector is the sausage maker of the investment world buyers love the yields — now averaging about  — but many know little about how the yields are generated the bullish pitch by brokers in favor of the investments centered around the highyielding way to participate in the booming us energy infrastructure buildout unfortunately the

fraudulent oil and gas deals are frequently structured with the limited partnership or other legal entity in one state the operation and physical presence of the field in a second state and the

firms like linsco lpl ubs merrill lynch raymond james citgroup and stifel nicolaus also sometimes engage in an activity called “selling away” when a broker sells a customer an “investment” outside the

and used as a means for the advisor to convert client funds unfortunately unscrupulous oil promoters and stockbrokers frequently use the internet and “boiler room” offices with banks of phones manned
