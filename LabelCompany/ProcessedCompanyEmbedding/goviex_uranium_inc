corporate presentation contact financial statements proxy documents technical reports   introduction  the madaouela uranium project is situated southeast of the mining town of arlit and the mariannemarilyn deposit is located approximately km from arlit the land surface of the tenement forms a rectangle of less than km topography  topographic relief in the madaouela tenements is minimal a few tens of meters from high to low areas of drilling are at approximately m elevations amsl over much of the areas drilled relief is less than m from low ridges of sandstone outcrops to essentially flat sand covered plains climate  niger is landlocked and almost entirely located within the semidesert belt of western africa its climate is characterized by very scarce rainfall mostly concentrated during the summer months july to september and with very hot temperatures notably at the end of spring april to june infrastructure  the proximity of the town of arlit and akokan are an asset for madaouela permits the towns have over  people supporting local mining operations with airports drilling companies electricity potable water and a hospital arlit is connected to the southern part of niger via the socalled uraniumhighway through agadez and tahoua to niamey the niger capital further south a power line connects the town to the sonichar coalfired power station located north of agadez access by plane is possible through an airstrip in arlit and also agadez history  the french commissariat à lenergie atomique cea discovered the madaouela uranium mineralized areas in the early s they conducted drilling operations using drilling grids of  down to m over vast areas of the permit the discovery of the marilyn deposit was then drilled locally at m cea sunk a m deep shaft and drove m of drifts within the mineralized formation the simultaneous discovery of the somaïr uranium deposits was responsible for the decision to stop all works at the madaouela site  pnc the japanese pacific reactor and nuclear fuel development corporation took over the cea tenement in  in association with onarem a niger stateowned organization pnc conducted additional uranium exploration work up to  and produced a report on the feasibility of the madaouela deposit in  which was later updated  by the japan nuclear cycle development institute the new company name for pnc very few drillholes less than  were drilled by pnc in madaouela i and none on marianne or marilyn the feasibility study was fully based on cea drillholes in  the economic assumptions and data for the  feasibility study were updated and concluded that underground mining could be costeffective provided the uranium price stabilizes at around uslb u level  a chinese company cnuc took over madaouela and held the land from  to  they drilled a limited number of holes and departed apparently because they could not access the original cea data little exploration work seems to have been carried out until goviex niger holdings ltd gnh ltd took over the property in  regional geology  the madaouela property is located in the tim mersoi basin this basin covers most of the western part of the republic of niger with extensions in algeria mali benin and nigeria in early paleozoic an open gulf developed to the south of the central saharan massif and fed continental sediments to the developing basin during the mesozoic and tertiary the area was mainly continental periodically invaded by marine transgressions diminishing in thickness to the south and passing laterally into continental series uplift movements beginning in the middle eocene gave the basin its present aspect  precarboniferous sedimentation consists of cambroordovician sandstones and graptolite shales these formations are of major interest because they host the major reduced uranium deposits in the arlit area the stratigraphic sequence begins by the greyblack talak visean argillites it consists of black shale this is overlaid by the guezouman formation that includes a lower and an upper member the lower member is composed of fine to coarsegrained crossbedded sandstone units with minor conglomerates teleflak the upper member consists of fine sandstone siltstone and shale units geological structures  west dipping units mark the structure of the tim mersoi basin the deformation of the sedimentary body resulted from basement fault activities located between the air massif and the azaoua lineament several large faults systems cut the sediments and have played a major role during the sedimentation  the main structure is the arlit fault it has been active during the sedimentation especially during carboniferous time and has been reactivated several times all the major uranium deposits are located immediately to the east of the fault  the madaouela fault shows similar characters with a large uplift of the north western compartment quartdebrie that is situated across the goviex madaouela tenements in anou melou the airlet and madaouela fault converge and present goviex with a clear future exploration target  mineralization is always localized at the contact between the guezouman sandstone and the underlying talak argillite the mineralization is located on the flank of the channel following the reducing unit of the talak and always associated with coarse sandstone of the guezouman  in  goviex geologists made a major scientific breakthrough and discovered the la banane deposit as a result of its area exploration program this discovery has had a major impact on the exploration philosophy in the tim mersoi basin as the la banane deposit is situated in the madaouela sequence of sandstones where previously it was not envisaged that uranium mineralization could significantly occur deposit type  sandstonehosted uranium deposits occur in permeable mediumcoarse grained sandstone usually deposited in continental fluvial or marginal marine sedimentary environments the source of uranium is usually igneous or volcanic rocks either in close proximity to or interbedded with the sandstone units the uranium mineralization typically precipitates from oxidizing fluids under reducing conditions caused by a variety of reducing agents the reducing agent for madaouela is most likely insitu organic material lignite or hydrocarbons transported along major fault the main primary uranium minerals are uraninite and coffinite with minor secondary uranium minerals being noted in exposed weathered mineralization  sandstone deposits are an important source of uranium representing approximately  of the worlds known uranium resources and accounting for over  of the african uranium deposits in  this style of uranium deposit typically yields small to medium size individual deposits  to approximately t of uo characterized by low to medium grade  to  uo but deposits typically occur in clusters mineralized zones  the mariannemarilyn deposit is a nearly flat tabular body of mineralization that spans approximately km by km across in plan and the deposit thickness varies from  to over m average thickness of about m the mineralization occurs at depths from about m on the eastend of marilyn to approximately m in depth in the middle of the mariannemarilyn deposit up to m in depths on the west extensions of marianne  the msne deposit is approximately  km south of mariannemarilyn with maryvonne deposit in between the geology of these deposits is very similar to mariannemarilyn ore depth ranges from  m to  m across the deposits miriam deposit was discovered in  and is located in the southern portion of madaouela i tenement the ore is  to  m in thickness at miriam and at a depth of  to  m adjacent properties  there are currently two producing mines in the arlit region that are on property positions immediately adjacent to the madaouela uranium project both mines are subsidiaries of areva and have operated uninterrupted since starting production   somaïr operates an open pit and an acid leaching plant since  producing t uranium annually and have recently started a heap leaching operation and   cominak operates underground and has its own acid leaching plant to produce more than approximately  tpy uranium exploration drilling  exploration is undertaken with mudrotary drill rigs that drill mm diameter holes historical drill holes have been located where possible in the field and redrilled with this larger diameter drill bit and relogged goviex is therefore relying of goviex data from historical drill holes not historical data  in uranium exploration the usual technique consists in   measuring the radioactivity in the drill holes using dedicated probes and   transforming the radioactivity into uranium grade equivalent uranium grade eu or euo  core drilling is therefore done with the rotary drill rig as conventional drilling to collect core from the mineralized horizons for assay comparisons with gamma probe eu determinations  goviex exploration approach is complete surface mapping and sampling along traverse lines approximately  kilometres apart data collected during these traverses includes geological mapping and radioactivity measurement on regular spacing   once areas of exploration interest have been defined the company commences with a wide spaced drilling program starting at mx m and based on these results exploration drilling continues but on a decreasing spacing towards those required for resource classification  based on analysis inferred material is where the drilling density of the deposit is m x m or lower while indicated material is defined a nominal drillhole spacing of m x m goviex has reduced drillhole spacing to as low as m x m in large parts of marianne marilyn and miriam mining operations  three primary mining targets are defined for future possible development  the marilyn and marianne deposits that are located adjacent to each other along a km nesw strike length the msne and maryvonne deposits and the miriam deposit to the south of the madaouela i license  the marilynmarianne deposits are shallow with depths below surface from m in the ne to m in the sw while the msnemaryvonne deposits are approximate m in depth the deposits are generally flat lying ° slope with thicknesses varying from m tabular deposits such as these generally lend themselves to room and pillar type mining methods  the mineralized material will be mined using low profile mining equipment capable achieving mining heights of  m panel development will be undertaken using  m wide drifts a primary pattern of  m x  m pillars will be developed during the initial advance through the panel on retreat from the extremities of the panel each  m x  m pillar will be split by  m drifts to leave four  m x  m pillars  the mineralized material is transported by lhd to the conveyor feeder that is located at the entrance to the panel where initial crushing will occur the crushed material is to be transported by conveyor to a coarse ore stockpile situated before the process plant a panel mining fleet will consist of a single boom face drill a ground support jumbo with fully automated rockbolt installation and a m bucket capacity lhd  while the miriam deposit is approximately  m to  m deep but has a greater thickness up to m with local grades over  u thus containing the highest gradethickness gt in four main seams    and  that coalesce locally in a redox front system the mining of miriam is planned to be by open pit operations inline with that under taken at arevas sominak mine metallurgy  mined ore is transferred to the run of mine rom stockpile feed preparation consists of primary crushing with the ore then routed to radiometric ore sorter ros where by the radiometric selection ore is preconcentrated to provide a higher grade material following the ros stage the ore is secondary crushed and mixed with water to produce a slurry for the ablation stage where two slurry streams are impacted together to form a high impact energy zone that separates fine heavier uranium minerals from the host rock the combination of ros and ablation results in a tpd of feed for feed to the leaching circuit with approximately  of the uranium that was contained in the initial  tpd mined feed  the two stage leaching circuit consists of primary and secondary agitated leach tanks in recirculation in the first stage solution from the second stage belt filters is recirculated to leach the fresh feed after which the slurry is thickened with the thickener overflow routed to the uranium recovery circuit as pregnant leach solution pls the thickener underflow is routed to the second stage leach which uses fresh acid to further leach the milled solids after the second stage the slurry is filtered and the filtered solids residue is washed with fresh solution and discarded to the tailings disposal system  leach tanks are agitated and aerated to allow the milled ore to react with sulfuric acid allowing dissolution of the contained uranium the solution from leach thickener overflow is routed to uranium recovery uranium recovery from the neutralised pls takes place through solvent extraction “sx” sx is undertaken using a new process to recover both molybdenum and uranium from acidic solutions using cyanex®  extractant the overall circuit configuration would consist of two extraction steps one stripping step for iron two stripping steps for molybdenum an ammonia washing step and two uranium stripping steps a wash stage swill be used after the uranium strip to prevent phosphoric acid transfer phosphoric acid will be recovered through an evaporation step in order to reduce reagent requirements additional uranium recovery will come from this step through a bleed stream that would feed back into the solvent extraction process as a result of the cyanex  solvent the madaouela project will be able to produce molybdenum oxide and uranium oxide in a saleable form srk completed a technical economic analysis for the project the economic analysis results indicate an aftertax net profit value npv of usd m at an  discount rate with an internal rate of return irr of  payback will be in production year    the proposed base case envisions a  mlb per year uo yellowcake production rate and an  ultimate recovery generating an eighteen year mine life and a total production of  mlb uo the project economics are at a longterm uranium price of usd  lb uo initial capital costs are estimated at usd  m total lom capital costs at usd  m and cash operating costs of usd  lb uo excluding royalties and usd  lb uo
