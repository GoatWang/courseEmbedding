value in the fixed account is not withdrawn transferred or annuitized until the end of the specified period the base interest rate is subject to your contracts fixed account minimum interest rate which will be  a year credited daily during the first ten contract years and  a year credited daily afterwards depending on the issue date of your contract however the fixed account minimum interest rate may be  a year credited daily in all contract years subject to these minimum requirements we may declare different base interest rates at different times your contract value in the fixed account may be subject to an excess interest adjustment and a withdrawal charge however if you decide to withdraw or transfer your contract value allocated to the fixed account or if you annuitize the contract before the end of the specified period the excess interest adjustment depends on the base interest rate that was available when you allocated contract value to a fixed account option versus the base interest rate available for allocations to the same fixed account option at the time of withdrawal transfer or annuitization if your base interest rate is higher than the base interest rate available for allocations to the same fixed account option at the time of withdrawal transfer or annuitization then the excess interest adjustment will increase your contract value and vice versa

less than your base interest rate by  or less also there is no excess interest adjustment on the oneyear fixed account option death benefit proceed payments payments pursuant to a life contingent income option or an income option resulting in payments spread over at least five years amounts withdrawn for contract charges and free withdrawals in no event will the excess interest adjustment reduce the contract value below the minimum interest rate applicable to the fixed account portion of your contract whenever a specified period ends you will have  days to transfer or withdraw the contract value in the fixed account option and there will not be an excess interest adjustment if you do nothing then after  days the contract value that remains in that fixed account option will be subject to another specified period of the same duration subject to availability and provided that that specified period will not extend beyond the income date otherwise the next closest specified period or the oneyear fixed account option if there is one year or less until the income date will apply you may allocate premiums to the oneyear fixed account option but we may require that the amount in the oneyear fixed account be automatically transferred on a monthly basis in equal installments to your choice of investment division within  months of the date we received the premium so that at the end of the period all amounts in the oneyear fixed account will have been transferred the amount will be determined based on the amount allocated to the oneyear fixed account and the base interest rate charges withdrawals and additional transfers taken from the oneyear fixed account will shorten the length of time it takes to deplete the account balance these automatic transfers will not count against the  free transfers in a contract year interest will continue to be credited daily on the account balance remaining in the oneyear fixed account as funds are automatically transferred into your choice of investment divisions however the effective yield over the month automatic transfer period will be less than the base interest rate as it will be applied to a declining

risk charge each day as part of our calculation of the value of the accumulation units and annuity units we make a deduction for the mortality and expense risk charge the mortality and expense risk charge is expressed as an annual percentage of the average daily account value of the investment divisions and is set based upon the breakpoint schedule below using the aggregate premium determined at issue aggregate premium at issue is equal to the anticipated total premium breakpoint specified by you in the statement of intention section of the application if no statement of intention is provided by you in the application the aggregate premium at issue will equal the initial premium received the aggregate premium will be redetermined only at the end of the sixth contract month which may result in a change to the mortality and expense risk charge assessed after the sixth contract month at the time the aggregate premium is redetermined the mortality and expense risk charge will be set by reference to the newly determined aggregate premium if the contract owner dies prior to the end of the sixth contract month there will not be an adjustment to the mortality and expense risk charge

total of all premiums you may make without our prior approval is  million the payment of subsequent premiums within the limited period of the first six contract months relative to market conditions at the time the payments are made may or may not contribute to the various benefits under your contract including the optional enhanced death benefits or any gmwb allocations of premium you may allocate your premiums to one or more of the investment divisions and fixed account each allocation must be a whole percentage between  and  the minimum amount you may allocate to the investment division or a

of a contract if we do not receive all of the information that we require we will contact you to get the necessary information if for some reason we are unable to complete this process within five business days we will return your money each business day ends when the new york stock exchange closes usually  pm eastern time capital protection program if you select our capital protection program at issue we will allocate enough of your premium to the fixed account you select to assure that the amount so allocated will equal at the end of a selected period of    or  years your total original premium paid you may allocate the rest of your premium to any investment divisions if any part of the fixed account value is surrendered or transferred before the end of the selected guaranteed period the value at the end of that period will not equal the original premium this program is available only if fixed account options are available there is no charge for the capital protection program you should consult your jnl representative with respect to the current availability of fixed account options their limitations and the availability of the capital protection program for an example of capital protection assume you made a premium payment of  when the interest rate for the threeyear guaranteed period was  per year we would allocate  to that guarantee period because  would increase at that interest rate to  after three years assuming no withdrawals are taken the remaining  of the payment would be allocated to the investment divisions you selected alternatively assume jackson national receives a premium payment of  when the interest rate for the year period is  per year jackson national will allocate  to that guarantee period because  will increase at that interest rate to  after  years the remaining  of the payment will be allocated to the investment divisions you selected thus as these examples demonstrate the shorter guarantee periods require allocation of substantially all your premium to achieve the intended result in each case the results will depend on the interest rate declared for the guarantee period accumulation units your contract value allocated to the investment divisions will go up or down depending on the performance of the investment divisions you select in order to keep track of the value of your contract during the accumulation phase we use a unit of measure called an accumulation unit during the income phase we use a measure called an annuity unit every business day we determine the value of an accumulation unit for each of the investment divisions by  determining the total amount of assets held in the particular investment division  subtracting any assetbased charges and taxes chargeable under the contract and  dividing this amount by the number of outstanding accumulation units charges deducted through the cancellation of units are not reflected in this computation the value of an accumulation unit may go up or down from day to day the base contract has a different accumulation unit value than each combination of optional endorsements an owner may elect based on the differing amount of charges applied in calculating that accumulation unit value when you make a premium payment we credit your contract with accumulation units the number of accumulation units we credit is determined at the close of that business day by dividing the amount of the premium allocated to any investment division by the value of the accumulation unit for that investment division that reflects the combination of optional endorsements you have elected and their respective charges transfers and frequent transfer restrictions you may transfer your contract value between and among the investment divisions at any time unless transfers are subject to other limitations but transfers between an investment division and the fixed account must occur prior to the income date transfers from the fixed account will be subject to any applicable excess interest adjustment there may be periods when we do not offer the fixed account or when we impose special transfer requirements on the fixed account if a renewal occurs within one year of the income date we will continue to credit interest up to the income date at the then current interest rate for the fixed account option you can make  transfers every contract year during the accumulation phase without charge a transfer will be effective as of the end of the business day when we receive your transfer request in good order and we will disclaim all liability for transfers made based on your transfer instructions or the instructions of a third party authorized to submit transfer requests on your behalf restrictions on transfers market timing the contract is not designed for frequent transfers by anyone frequent transfers between and among investment divisions may disrupt the underlying funds and could negatively impact performance by interfering with efficient management and reducing longterm returns and increasing administrative costs frequent transfers may also dilute the value of shares of an underlying fund neither the contracts nor the underlying funds are meant to promote any active trading strategy like market timing allowing frequent transfers by one or some owners could be at the expense of other owners of the contract to protect owners and the underlying funds we have policies and procedures to deter frequent transfers between and among the investment divisions under these policies and procedures there is a  charge per transfer after  in a contract year and no round trip transfers are allowed within  calendar days also we could restrict your ability to make transfers to or from one or more of the investment divisions which possible restrictions may include but are not limited to  limiting the number of transfers over a period of time  requiring a minimum time period between each transfer  limiting transfer requests from an agent acting on behalf of one or more owners or under a power of attorney on behalf of one or more owners or  limiting the dollar amount that you may transfer at any one time to the extent permitted by applicable law we reserve the right to restrict the number of transfers per year that you can request and to restrict you from making transfers on consecutive business days in addition your right to make transfers between and among investment divisions may be modified if we determine that the exercise by one or more owners is or would be to the disadvantage of other owners we continuously monitor transfers under the contract for disruptive activity based on frequency pattern and size we will more closely monitor contracts with disruptive activity placing them on a watch list and if the disruptive activity continues we will restrict the availability of electronic or telephonic means to make a transfer instead requiring that transfer instructions be mailed through regular us postal service andor terminate the ability to make transfers completely as necessary if we terminate your ability to make transfers you may need to make a partial withdrawal to access the contract value in the investment divisions from which you sought a transfer we will notify you and your representative in writing within five days of placing the contract on a watch list regarding round trip transfers we will allow redemptions from an investment division however once a complete or partial redemption has been made from an investment division through an investment division transfer you will not be permitted to transfer any value back into that investment division within  calendar days of the redemption we will treat as shortterm trading activity any transfer that is requested into an investment division that was previously redeemed within the previous  calendar days whether the transfer was requested by you or a third party our policies and procedures do not apply to the money market investment division the fixed account dollar cost averaging earnings sweep or the automatic rebalancing program we may also make exceptions that involve an administrative error or a personal unanticipated financial emergency of an owner resulting from an identified health employment or other financial or personal event that makes the existing allocation imprudent or a hardship these limited exceptions will be granted by an oversight team pursuant to procedures designed to result in their consistent application please contact our annuity service center if you believe your transfer request entails a financial emergency otherwise we do not exempt any person or class of persons from our policies and procedures we have agreements allowing for asset allocation and investment advisory services that are not only subject to our policies and procedures but also to additional conditions and limitations intended to limit the potential adverse impact of these activities on other owners of the contract we expect to apply our policies and procedures uniformly but because detection and deterrence involves judgments that are inherently subjective we cannot guarantee that we will detect and deter every contract engaging in frequent transfers every time if these policies and procedures are ineffective the adverse consequences described above could occur we also expect to apply our policies and procedures in a manner reasonably designed to prevent transfers that we consider to be to the disadvantage of other owners and we may take whatever action we deem appropriate without prior notice to comply with or take advantage of any state or federal regulatory requirement telephone and internet transactions the basics you can request certain

income want to provide themselves with sufficient lifetime income and also to provide for an inheritance for their beneficiaries the main obstacles they face in meeting these goals are the uncertainties as to i how much income their investments will produce and ii how long they will live and will need to draw income from their investments a guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit gmwb is designed to help reduce these uncertainties a gmwb is intended to address those concerns but does not provide any guarantee the income will be sufficient to cover any individuals particular needs moreover the gmwb does not assure that you will receive any return on your investments the gmwb also does not protect against loss of purchasing power of assets covered by a gmwb due to inflation even relatively low levels of inflation may have a significant effect on purchasing power if not offset by stronger positive investment returns the stepup feature on certain of the gmwbs may provide protection against inflation when there are strong investment returns that coincide with the availability of effecting a stepup payments under the gmwb will first be made from your contract value our obligations to pay you more than your contract value will only arise under limited circumstances thus in considering the election of any gmwb you need to consider whether the value to you of the level of protection that is provided by a gmwb and its costs which reduce contract value and offset our risks are consistent with your level of concern and the minimum level of assets that you want to be sure are guaranteed the  for life gmwb with the joint option available only to spouses differs from the  for life gmwb without the joint option available to spouses and unrelated parties and enjoys

effective for more information about the for life guarantee and for information on who is a covered life under this form of gmwb please see the joint  for life guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit with annual stepup beginning on page  o if an owner dies before the automatic payment of benefits begins the surviving covered life may continue the contract and the for life guarantee is not automatically terminated as it is on the for life gmwb without the joint option guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit important special considerations each of the gmwbs provides that the gmwb and all benefits thereunder will terminate on the income date which is the date when annuity payments begin the income date is either a date that you choose or the latest income date the latest income date is the date on which the owner attains age  under a nonqualified contract unless otherwise approved by the company or such earlier date as required by the applicable qualified plan law or regulation before  electing a gmwb  electing to annuitize your contract after having purchased a gmwb or  when the latest income date is approaching and you are thinking about electing or have elected a gmwb you should consider whether the termination of all benefits under the gmwb and annuitizing produces the better financial results for you naturally you should discuss with your jnl representative whether a gmwb is even suitable for you consultation with your financial and tax advisor is also recommended these considerations are of greater significance if you are thinking about electing or have elected a gmwb for life as the for life payments will cease when you annuitize voluntarily or on the latest income date to the extent that we can extend the latest income date without adverse tax consequences to you we will do so as permitted by the applicable qualified plan law or regulation after you have consulted your financial and tax advisors you will need to contact us to request an extension of the latest income date please also see extension of latest income date beginning on page  for further information regarding possible adverse tax consequences of extending the latest income date in addition with regard to required minimum distributions rmds under an ira only it is important to consult your financial and tax advisor to determine whether the benefits of a particular gmwb will satisfy your rmd requirements with regard to other qualified plans you must determine what your qualified plan permits distributions under qualified plans and taxsheltered annuities must begin by the later of the calendar year in which you attain age   or the calendar year in which you retire you do not necessarily have to annuitize your contract to meet the minimum distribution  guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit with annual stepup the following description is supplemented by the examples in appendix b that may assist you in understanding how calculations are made in certain circumstances for owners  years old and younger on the contracts issue date or on the date on which this endorsement is selected if after the contracts issue date a  gmwb with annual stepup may be available which permits an owner to make partial withdrawals prior to the income date that in total are guaranteed to equal the guaranteed withdrawal balance gwb as defined below regardless of your contract value the  gmwb with annual stepup is not available on a contract that already has a gmwb one gmwb only per contract we may further limit the availability of this optional endorsement once selected the  gmwb with annual stepup cannot be canceled if you select the  gmwb with annual stepup when you purchase your contract your premium payment net of any applicable taxes will be used as the basis for determining the gwb the  gmwb with annual stepup may also be selected after the issue date within  days before any contract anniversary and the endorsement will take effect on the contract anniversary if your request is in good order if you select the  gmwb with annual stepup after the issue date to determine the gwb we will use your contract value on the date the endorsement is added to the contract the gwb can never be more than  million including upon stepup and the gwb is reduced with each withdrawal you take once the gwb has been determined we calculate the guaranteed annual withdrawal amount gawa which is the maximum annual partial withdrawal amount except for certain taxqualified contracts as explained below upon selection the gawa is equal to  of the gwb the gawa will not be reduced if partial withdrawals taken within any one contract year do not exceed  however withdrawals are not cumulative if you do not take  in one contract year you may not take more than  the next contract year if you withdraw more than  the guaranteed amount available may be less than the total premium payments and the gawa may be reduced the gawa can be divided up and taken on a payment schedule that you request you can continue to take the gawa each contract year until the gwb has been depleted withdrawal charges and excess interest adjustments as applicable are taken into consideration in calculating the amount of your partial withdrawals pursuant to the  gmwb with annual stepup but these charges or adjustments are offset by your ability to make free withdrawals under the contract for certain taxqualified contracts the  gmwb with annual stepup allows for withdrawals greater than gawa to meet the required minimum distribution rmd under the internal revenue code code without compromising the endorsements guarantees examples   and  in appendix b supplement this description premiums are accepted during the first six contract months only however any time a subsequent premium payment is made we recalculate the gwb and the gawa each time you make a premium payment the gwb is increased by the amount of the net premium payment also the gawa will increase by  of the net premium payment or  of the increase in the gwb if the maximum gwb is reached we require prior approval for a subsequent premium payment however that would result in your contract having  million of premiums in the aggregate we also reserve the right to refuse subsequent premium payments if the total of your partial withdrawals made in the current contract year is greater than the gawa we will recalculate your gwb and your gawa may be lower in the future in other words withdrawing more than the gawa in any contract year could cause the gwb to be reduced by more than the amount of the withdrawals and even reset to the then current contract value likely reducing the gawa too recalculation of the gwb and gawa may result in reducing or extending the payout period examples   and  in appendix b illustrate the impact of such withdrawals if the partial withdrawal plus all prior partial withdrawals made in the current contract year is less than or equal to the gawa the gwb is equal to the greater of  the gwb prior to the partial withdrawal less the partial withdrawal or  zero if the partial withdrawal plus all prior partial withdrawals made in the current contract year is greater than the gawa the gwb is equal to the lesser of  the contract value after the partial withdrawal or  the greater of the gwb prior to the partial withdrawal less the partial withdrawal or zero if all your partial withdrawals made in the current contract year are less than or equal to the gawa the gawa is the lesser of  the gawa prior to the partial withdrawal or  the gwb after the partial withdrawal if the partial withdrawal plus all prior partial withdrawals made in the current contract year is greater than the gawa the gawa is equal to the lesser of  the gawa prior to the partial withdrawal or  the gwb after the partial withdrawal or   of the contract value after the partial withdrawal for purposes of these calculations all partial withdrawals are assumed to be the total amount withdrawn including any withdrawal charges and excess interest adjustments withdrawals made under the guarantee of this endorsement are considered to be the same as any other partial withdrawals including systematic withdrawals for the purposes of calculating any other values under the contract and any other endorsements they are subject to the same restrictions and processing rules as described in the contract withdrawals under the guarantee of this endorsement are also treated the same for federal income tax purposes for more information about your nonqualified contract please see nonqualified contracts  withdrawals and income payments beginning on page  for more information about your taxqualified contract please see taxqualified contracts  withdrawals and income payments beginning on page  required minimum distribution calculations notice of an rmd is required at the time of your withdrawal request and there is an administrative form for such notice the administrative form allows for one time or systematic withdrawals eligible withdrawals that are specified as rmds may only be taken based on the value of the contract to which the endorsement applies even where the code allows for the taking of rmds for multiple contracts from a single contract initiating and monitoring for compliance with the rmd requirements is the sole responsibility of the owner under the code rmds are calculated and taken on a calendar year basis but with the  gmwb with annual stepup gawa is based on contract years because the intervals for the gawa and rmds are different the endorsements guarantees may be more susceptible to being compromised with taxqualified contracts if the sum of your total partial withdrawals in a contract year exceed the greatest of either of the rmd for each of the two calendar years occurring in that contract year and the gawa for that contract year then the gwb and gawa could be adversely recalculated as described above if your contract year is the same as the calendar year then the sum of your total partial withdrawals should not exceed the greater of the rmd and the gawa below is an example of how this modified limit would apply assume a taxqualified contract with a contract year that runs from july  to june  and that there are no withdrawals other than as described the gawa for the  contract year ending june  is  the rmd requirements for calendar years  and  are  and  respectively if the owner takes  in each of the two halves of calendar year  and  in each of the two halves of calendar year  then at the time the withdrawal in the first half of calendar year  is taken the owner will have withdrawn  because the sum of the owners withdrawals for the  contract year is less than the higher rmd requirement for either of the two calendar years occurring in that contract year the gwb and gawa would not be adversely recalculated an exception to this general rule is that with the calendar year in which your rmds are to begin generally when you reach age   however you may take your rmds for the current and next calendar years during the same contract year as necessary see example below the following example illustrates this exception it assumes an individual owner born january   of a taxqualified contract with a contract year that runs from july  to june  if the owner delays taking his first rmd the  rmd until march   he may still take the  rmd before the next contract year begins june   without exposing the gwb and gawa to the possibility of adverse recalculation however if he takes his second rmd the  rmd after june   he should wait until the next contract year begins that is after june   to take his third rmd the  rmd because except for the calendar year in which rmds begin taking two rmds in a single contract year could cause the gwb and gawa to be adversely recalculated if the two rmds exceeded the applicable gawa for that contract year examples that are relevant specific to taxqualified contracts illustrating the gmwb in varying circumstances and with specific factual assumptions are at the end of the prospectus in appendix b particularly examples   and  please consult

stepups occur automatically upon each of the first  contract anniversaries from the endorsements effective date then on or after the th contract anniversary at any time upon your request so long as there is at least one year between stepups upon election of a stepup the gwmb charge may be increased subject to the maximum charges listed above the request will be processed and effective on the day we receive the request in good order before deciding to stepup please consult the representative who helped you purchase your contract to be sure if a stepup is right for you and about any increase in charges upon a stepup upon election of a stepup the applicable gmwb charge will be reflected in your confirmation spousal continuation if you die before annuitizing a contract with the  gmwb with annual stepup the contracts death benefit is still payable when contract value is greater than zero alternatively the contract allows the beneficiary who is your spouse to continue it retaining all rights previously held by the owner if the spouse continues the contract and the  gmwb with annual stepup endorsement already applies to the contract the  gmwb with annual stepup will continue and no adjustment will be made to the gwb or the gawa at the time of continuation stepups will continue automatically or as permitted as described above and contract anniversaries will continue to be based on the anniversary of the original contracts issue date upon spousal continuation of a contract without the  gmwb with annual stepup if the  gmwb with annual stepup is available at the time the beneficiary may request to add this endorsement within  days before any contract anniversary and the endorsement will take effect on the contract anniversary if the request is made in good order termination the  gmwb with annual stepup endorsement terminates subject to a prorated gmwb charge assessed for the period since the last quarterly or monthly statement charge on the date you annuitize or surrender the contract in surrendering the contract you will receive the contract value less any applicable charges and adjustments and not the gwb or the gawa you would have received under the  gmwb with annual stepup the  gmwb with annual stepup also terminates with the contract upon your death unless the beneficiary who is your spouse continues the contract or upon the first date both the gwb and contract value equal zero  whichever occurs first contract value is zero if your contract value is reduced to zero as the result of a partial withdrawal contract charges or poor fund performance and the gwb is greater than zero the gwb will be paid to you on a periodic basis elected by you which will be no less frequently than annually the total annual payment will equal the gawa but will not exceed the current gwb the payments continue until the gwb is reduced to zero all other rights under your contract cease and all optional endorsements are terminated without value upon your death as the owner your beneficiary will receive the scheduled payments no other death benefit will be paid annuitization if you decide to annuitize your contract you may choose the following income option instead of one of the other income options listed in your contract fixed payment income option this income option provides payments in a fixed dollar amount for a specific number of years the actual number of years that payments will be made is determined on the calculation date by dividing the gwb by the gawa upon each payment the gwb will be reduced by the payment amount the total annual amount payable will equal the gawa but will never exceed the current gwb this annualized amount will be paid over the specific number of years in the frequency no less frequently than annually that you select if you should die assuming you are the annuitant before the payments have been completed the remaining payments will be made to the beneficiary as scheduled this income option may not be available if the contract is issued to qualify under sections    or  of the internal revenue code for such contracts this income option will only be available if the guaranteed period is less than the life expectancy of the annuitant at the time the option becomes effective see guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit general considerations and guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit important special considerations beginning on page  for additional things to consider before electing a gmwb when electing to annuitize your contract after having purchased a gmwb or when the latest income date is approaching and you are thinking about electing or have elected a gmwb effect of gmwb on tax deferral the purchase of the  gmwb with annual stepup may not be appropriate for the owners of contracts who have as a primary objective taking maximum advantage of the tax deferral that is available to them under an annuity contract please consult your tax and financial advisors on this and other matters prior to electing the  gmwb with annual stepup  for life guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit with annual stepup the following description of this gmwb is supplemented by the examples in appendix b particularly examples  and  for the stepups and examples  and  for the for life guarantees this gmwb guarantees partial withdrawals during the contracts accumulation phase ie before the income date for the longer of  the owners life the for life guarantee if the for life guarantee is in effect the for life guarantee is based on the life of the first owner to die with joint owners there is also another gmwb option for joint owners that are spouses as described below for the owner that is a legal entity the for life guarantee is based on the annuitants life or the life of the first annuitant to die if there is more than one annuitant the for life guarantee becomes effective on the contract anniversary on or immediately following the owners th birthday or with joint owners the oldest owners th birthday if the owner or oldest owner is  years old or older on the endorsements effective date then the for life guarantee is effective when this gmwb is added to the contract so long as the for life guarantee is in effect withdrawals are guaranteed even in the event contract value is reduced to zero or  until all withdrawals under the contract equal the guaranteed withdrawal balance gwb without regard to contract value the gwb is the guaranteed amount available for future periodic withdrawals because of the for life guarantee your withdrawals could amount to more than the gwb but please note the guarantees of this gmwb are subject to the endorsements terms conditions and limitations that are explained below please consult the representative who is helping or who helped you purchase your contract to be sure that this gmwb ultimately suits your needs this gmwb is available to owners  to  years old proof of age is required may be added to a contract on the issue date or any contract anniversary and once added cannot be canceled except by a beneficiary who is the owners spouse who upon the owners death may elect to continue the contract without the gmwb at least  calendar days prior notice and proof of age is required for good order to add this gmwb to a contract on a contract anniversary this gmwb is not available on a contract that already has a gmwb only one gmwb per contract we allow ownership changes of a contract with this gmwb when the owner is a legal entity  to another legal entity or the annuitant otherwise ownership changes are not allowed also when the owner is a legal entity charges will be determined based on the age of the annuitant and changing annuitants is not allowed availability of this gmwb may be subject to further limitation there is a limit on withdrawals each contract year to keep the guarantees of this gmwb in full effect  the greater of the guaranteed annual withdrawal amount gawa and for certain taxqualified contracts the required minimum distribution rmd under the internal revenue code withdrawals exceeding the limit do not invalidate the for life guarantee but cause the gwb and gawa to be recalculated election the gwb depends on when this gmwb is added to the contract and the gawa derives from the gwb  when this gmwb is added to the the gwb equals initial premium net of contract on the issue date  any applicable premium taxes the gawa equals  of the gwb   when this gmwb is added to the the gwb equals contract value contract on any contract anniversary  the gawa equals  of the gwb  please note at the time the for life guarantee becomes effective the gawa is reset to equal  of the then current gwb premium net of any applicable premium taxes is used to calculate the gwb when this gmwb is added to the contract on the issue date if you were to instead add this gmwb to your contract post issue on any contract anniversary the gwb is calculated based on contract value on the date the endorsement is added to the contract the gwb can never be more than  million including upon stepup and the gwb is reduced by each withdrawal withdrawals withdrawals may cause both the gwb and gawa to be recalculated depending on whether or not the withdrawal plus all prior withdrawals in the current contract year is less than or equal to the gawa or for certain taxqualified contracts only the rmd if greater than the gawa the two tables below clarify what happens in either instance rmd denotes the required minimum distribution under the internal revenue code for certain taxqualified contracts only there is no rmd for nonqualified contracts required minimum distribution calculations for certain taxqualified contracts this gmwb allows withdrawals greater than gawa to meet the contracts rmd without compromising the endorsements guarantees examples   and  in appendix b supplement this description because the intervals for the gawa and rmds are different namely contract years versus calendar years and because rmds are subject to other conditions and limitations if your contract is a taxqualified contract then please see rmd notes below for more information  when a withdrawal plus all the gwb is recalculated equaling the prior withdrawals in the greater of current contract year is less than or equal to the greater of  the gwb before the withdrawal the gawa or rmd as applicable  less the withdrawal or  zero the gawa  is unchanged while the for life guarantee is in effect otherwise  is recalculated equaling the lesser of the gawa before the withdrawal or the gwb after the withdrawal  the gawa is not reduced if all withdrawals during any one contract year do not exceed the greater of the gawa or rmd as applicable you may withdraw the greater of the gawa or rmd as applicable all at once or throughout the contract year withdrawing less than the greater of the gawa or rmd as applicable in a contract year does not entitle you to withdraw more than the greater of the gawa or rmd as applicable in the next contract year the amount you may withdraw each contract year and not cause the gwb and gawa to be recalculated does not accumulate withdrawing more than the greater of the gawa or rmd as applicable in a contract year causes the gwb and gawa to be recalculated see below in recalculating the gwb the gwb could be reduced by more than the withdrawal amount  even set equal to the contract value the gawa is also potentially impacted  when a withdrawal plus all the gwb is recalculated equaling the prior withdrawals in the lesser of current contract year exceeds the greater of the gawa or rmd  contract value after the as applicable  withdrawal or  the greater of the gwb before the withdrawal less the withdrawal or zero the gawa is recalculated

withdrawn including any charges andor adjustments withdrawals in excess of free withdrawals may be subject to a withdrawal charge any withdrawals from contract value allocated to a fixed account option may be subject to an excess interest adjustment for more information please see the fixed account beginning on page  withdrawals under this gmwb are considered the same as any other partial withdrawals for the purposes of calculating any other values under the contract and any other endorsements for example the contracts death benefit all withdrawals count toward the total amount withdrawn in a contract year including systematic withdrawals rmds for certain taxqualified contracts withdrawals of asset allocation and advisory fees and free withdrawals under the contract they are

contract value on the date the endorsement is added to the contract the gwb can never be more than  million including upon stepup and the gwb is reduced by each withdrawal withdrawals withdrawals may cause both the gwb and gawa to be recalculated depending on whether or not the withdrawal plus all prior withdrawals in the current contract year is less than or equal to the gawa or for certain taxqualified contracts only the rmd if greater than the gawa the two tables below clarify what happens in either instance rmd denotes the required minimum distribution under the internal revenue code for certain taxqualified contracts only there is no rmd for nonqualified contracts required minimum distribution calculations for certain taxqualified contracts this gmwb allows withdrawals greater than gawa to meet the contracts rmd without compromising the endorsements guarantees examples   and  in appendix b supplement this description because the intervals for the gawa and rmds are different namely contract years versus calendar years and because rmds are subject to other conditions and limitations if your contract is a taxqualified contract then please see rmd notes below for more information  when a withdrawal plus all the gwb is recalculated equaling the prior withdrawals in the greater of current contract year is less than or equal to the greater of  the gwb before the withdrawal the gawa or rmd as applicable  less the withdrawal or  zero the gawa  is unchanged while the for life guarantee is in effect otherwise  is recalculated equaling the lesser of the gawa before the withdrawal or the gwb after the withdrawal  the gawa is not reduced if all withdrawals during any one contract year do not exceed the greater of the gawa or rmd as applicable you may withdraw the greater of the gawa or rmd as applicable all at once or throughout the contract year withdrawing less than the greater of the gawa or rmd as applicable in a contract year does not entitle you to withdraw more than the greater of the gawa or rmd as applicable in the next contract year the amount you may withdraw each contract year and not cause the gwb and gawa to be recalculated does not accumulate withdrawing more than the greater of the gawa or rmd as applicable in a contract year causes the gwb and gawa to be recalculated see below in recalculating the gwb the gwb could be reduced by more than the withdrawal amount  even set equal to the contract value the gawa is also potentially impacted  when a withdrawal plus all the gwb is recalculated equaling the prior withdrawals in the lesser of current contract year exceeds the greater of the gawa or rmd  contract value after the as applicable  withdrawal or  the greater of the gwb before the withdrawal less the withdrawal or zero the gawa is recalculated equaling the lesser of   of the contract value after the withdrawal or  the greater of  of the gwb after the withdrawal or zero  withdrawals under this gmwb are assumed to be the total amount withdrawn including any charges andor adjustments withdrawals in excess of free withdrawals may be subject to a withdrawal charge any withdrawals from contract value allocated to a fixed account option may be subject to an excess interest adjustment for more information please see the fixed account beginning on page  withdrawals under this gmwb are considered the same as any other partial withdrawals for the purposes of calculating any other values under the contract and any other endorsements for example the contracts death benefit all withdrawals count toward the total amount withdrawn in a contract year including systematic withdrawals rmds for certain taxqualified contracts withdrawals of asset allocation and advisory fees and free withdrawals under the contract they are subject to the same restrictions and processing rules as described in the contract they are also treated the same for federal income tax purposes for more information about your nonqualified contract please see nonqualified contracts  withdrawals and income payments beginning on page  for more information about your taxqualified contract please see taxqualified contracts  withdrawals and income payments beginning on page   rmd notes notice of an rmd is required at the time of your withdrawal request and there is an administrative form for such notice the administrative form allows for one time or systematic withdrawals eligible withdrawals that are specified as rmds may only be taken based on the value of the contract to which the endorsement applies even where the internal revenue code allows for the taking of rmds for multiple contracts from a single contract initiating and monitoring for compliance with the rmd requirements is the sole responsibility of the owner under the internal revenue code rmds are calculated and taken on a calendar year basis but with this gmwb the gawa is based on contract years because the intervals for the gawa and rmds are different the for life guarantee may be more susceptible to being invalidated with taxqualified contracts if the sum of your total partial withdrawals in a contract year exceed the greatest of the rmd for each of the two calendar years occurring in that contract year and the gawa for that contract year then the gwb and gawa could be adversely recalculated as described above if your contract year is the same as the calendar year then the sum of your total partial withdrawals should not exceed the greater of the rmd and the gawa below is an example of how this modified limit would apply assume a taxqualified contract with a contract year that runs from july  to june  and that there are no withdrawals other than as described the gawa for the  contract year ending june  is  the rmds for calendar years  and  are  and  respectively if the owner takes  in each of the two halves of calendar year  and  in each of the two halves of calendar year  then at the time the withdrawal in the first half of calendar year  is taken the owner will have withdrawn  because the sum of the owners withdrawals for the  contract year is less than the higher rmd for either of the two calendar years occurring in that contract year the gwb and gawa would not be adversely recalculated an exception to this general rule is that with the calendar year in which your rmds are to begin generally when you reach age   however you may take your rmds for the current and next calendar years during the same contract year as necessary see example below the following example illustrates this exception it assumes an individual owner born january   of a taxqualified contract with a contract year that runs from july  to june  if the owner delays taking his first rmd the  rmd until march   he may still take the  rmd before the next contract year begins june   without exposing the gwb and gawa to the possibility of adverse recalculation however if he takes his second rmd the  rmd after june   he should wait until the next contract year begins that is after june   to take his third rmd the  rmd because except for the calendar year in which rmds begin taking two rmds in a single contract year could cause the gwb and gawa to be adversely recalculated if the two rmds exceeded the applicable gawa for that contract year examples that are relevant or specific to taxqualified contracts illustrating this gmwb in varying circumstances and with specific factual assumptions are at the end of the prospectus in appendix b particularly examples   and  please consult the representative who is helping or who helped you purchase your taxqualified contract and your tax adviser to be sure that this gmwb ultimately suits your needs relative to your rmd  premiums  premiums are accepted during the gwb is recalculated increasing by the first six contract months the amount of the premium net of any only however with each applicable premium taxes subsequent premium payment on the contract  the gawa is also recalculated increasing by   of the premium net of any applicable premium taxes or   of the increase in the gwb  if the maximum gwb is hit  we require prior approval for a subsequent premium payment that would result in your contract having  million of premiums in the aggregate we also reserve the right to refuse subsequent premium payments the gwb can never be more than  million stepup in the event contract value is greater than the gwb this gmwb allows the gwb to be reset to the contract value a stepup upon election of a stepup the gwmb charge may be increased subject to the maximum charges listed above  with a stepup  the gwb equals contract value the gawa is recalculated equaling the greater of   of the new gwb or  the gawa before the stepup  stepups occur automatically upon each of the first ten contract anniversaries from the endorsements effective date thereafter a stepup is allowed at any time upon your request so long as there is at least one year between stepups the gwb can never be more than  million with a stepup a request for stepup is processed and effective on the date received in good order please consult the representative who helped you purchase your contract to be sure if a stepup is right for you and about any increase in charges upon a stepup upon election of a stepup the applicable gmwb charge will be reflected in your confirmation owners death the contracts death benefit is not affected by this gmwb so long as contract value is greater than zero and the contract is still in the accumulation phase upon the death of the owner or the death of either joint owner of a nonqualified contract while the contract is still in force and before the income date this gmwb terminates without value unless continued by the spouse contract value is zero with this gmwb in the event contract value is zero the gawa is unchanged and payable so long as the for life guarantee is in effect otherwise payments will be made while there is value to the gwb until depleted payments are made on the periodic basis you elect but no less frequently than annually  after each payment when the the gwb is

owners or either joint owners death the surviving spousal beneficiary may elect to  continue the contract with this gmwb  so long as the contract value is greater than zero and the contract is still in the accumulation phase the date the spousal beneficiarys election to continue the contract is in good order is called the continuation date  if the surviving spouse is a covered life and the for life guarantee is already in effect then the for life guarantee remains effective on and after the continuation date if the for life guarantee is not already in effect and the surviving spouse is a covered life the for life guarantee becomes effective on the contract anniversary on or immediately following the youngest original covered lifes th birthday and the above rules for the for life guarantee apply the effective date of the for life guarantee will be set on the effective date of the endorsement if the surviving spouse is not a covered life the for life guarantee is null and void however the surviving spouse will be entitled to make withdrawals until the gwb is exhausted  for a surviving spouse who is a covered life continuing the contract with this gmwb is necessary to be able to fully realize the benefit of the for life guarantee the for life guarantee is not a separate guarantee and only applies if the related gmwb has not terminated  stepups will continue

latest income date is approaching and you are thinking about electing or have elected a gmwb effect of gmwb on tax deferral this gmwb may not be appropriate for owners who have as a primary objective taking maximum advantage of the tax deferral that is available to them under an annuity contract please consult your tax and financial advisors before adding this gmwb to a contract systematic withdrawal program you can arrange to have money automatically sent to you periodically while your contract is still in the accumulation phase you may withdraw a specified dollar amount of at least  per withdrawal a specified percentage or earnings your withdrawals may be on a monthly quarterly semiannual or annual basis if you have arranged for systematic withdrawals schedule any planned stepup under a gmwb to occur prior to the withdrawal example  in appendix b illustrates the consequences of a withdrawal preceding a stepup there is no charge for the systematic withdrawal program however you will have to pay taxes on the money you receive you may also be subject to a withdrawal charge and an excess interest adjustment suspension of withdrawals or transfers we may be required to suspend or delay withdrawals or transfers to or from an investment division when  the new york stock exchange is closed other than customary weekend and holiday closings  under applicable sec rules trading on the new york stock exchange is restricted  under applicable sec rules an emergency exists so that it is not reasonably practicable to dispose of securities in an investment division or determine the value of its assets or  the sec by order may permit for the protection of contract owners we have reserved the right to defer payment for a withdrawal or transfer from the fixed account for up to six months or the period permitted by law income payments the income phase the income phase of your contract occurs when you begin receiving regular income payments from us the income date is the day those payments begin once income payments begin the contract cannot be returned to the accumulation phase you can choose the income date and an income option all of the contract value must be annuitized the income options are described below if you do not choose an income option we will assume that you selected option  which provides a life annuity with  months of guaranteed payments you can change the income date or income option at least  days before the income date but changes to the income date may only be to a later date you must give us written notice at least seven days before the scheduled income date income payments must begin by your th birthday under a nonqualified contract or by such earlier date as required by the applicable qualified plan law or regulation unless otherwise approved by the company under a traditional individual retirement annuity required minimum distributions must begin in the calendar year in which you attain age   or such other age as required by law distributions under qualified plans and taxsheltered annuities must begin by the later of the calendar year in which you attain age   or the calendar year in which you retire you do not necessarily have to annuitize your contract to meet the minimum distribution requirements for individual retirement annuities qualified plans and taxsheltered annuities distributions from roth iras are not required prior to your death at the income date you can choose to receive fixed payments or variable payments based on the investment divisions unless you tell us otherwise your income payments will be based on the fixed and variable options that were in place on the income date you can choose to have income payments made monthly quarterly semiannually or annually or you can choose a single lump sum payment if you have less than  to apply toward an income option and state law permits we may provide your payment in a single lump sum part of which may be taxable as federal income likewise if your first income payment would be less than  and state law permits we may set the frequency of payments so that the first payment would be at least  variable income payments if you choose to have any portion of your income payments based upon one or more investment divisions the dollar amount of your initial annuity payment will depend primarily upon the following  the amount of your contract value you allocate to the investment divisions on the income date  the amount of any applicable premium taxes or withdrawal charges and any excess interest adjustment deducted from your contract value on the income date  which income option you select and  the investment factors listed in your contract that translate the amount of your contract value as adjusted for applicable charges frequency of payment and commencement date into initial payment amounts that are measured by the number of annuity units of the investment divisions you select credited to your contract the investment factors in your contract are calculated based upon a variety of factors including an assumed investment rate of  state variations may apply if the actual net investment rate experienced by an investment division exceeds the assumed net investment rate variable annuity payments will increase over time conversely if the actual net investment rate is less than the assumed net investment rate variable annuity payments will decrease over time if the actual net investment rate equals the assumed net investment rate the variable annuity payments will remain constant if assumed net investment rate is a lower percentage for example  versus  under a particular annuity option the initial payment will be smaller if the  assumed net investment rate applies instead of the  assumed net investment rate but all other things being equal the subsequent  assumed net investment rate payments have the potential for increasing in amount by a larger percentage and for decreasing in amount by a smaller percentage we calculate the dollar amount of subsequent income payments that you receive based upon the performance of the investment divisions you select if that performance measured by changes in the value of annuity units exceeds the assumed investment rate then your income payments will increase if that performance is less than the assumed investment rate then your income payments will decrease neither expenses actually incurred other than taxes on investment return nor mortality actually experienced will adversely affect the dollar amount of subsequent income payments income options the annuitant is the person whose life we look to when we make income payments each description assumes that you are the owner and annuitant the following income options may not be available in all states option   life income this income option provides monthly payments for your life option   joint and survivor this income option provides monthly payments for your life and for the life of another person usually your spouse selected by you option   life annuity with at least  or  monthly payments this income option provides monthly payments for the annuitants life but with payments continuing to the beneficiary for the remainder of  or  years as you select if the annuitant dies before the end of the selected period if the beneficiary does not want to receive the remaining scheduled payments a single lump sum may be requested which will be equal to the present value of the remaining payments as of the date of calculation discounted at an interest rate that will be no more than  higher than the rate used to calculate the initial payment option   income for a specified period this income option provides monthly payments for any number of years from  to  if the beneficiary does not want to receive the remaining scheduled payments a single lump sum may be requested which will be equal to the present value of the remaining payments as of the date of calculation discounted at an interest rate that will be no more than  higher than the rate used to calculate the initial payment additional options  we may make other income options available no withdrawals are permitted during the income phase under an income option that is life contingent death benefit the contract has a death benefit namely the basic death benefit which is payable during the accumulation phase instead you may choose an optional death benefit for an additional charge availability of which may vary by state for more information about the availability of an optional death benefit in your state please see the application check with the registered representative helping you to purchase the contract or contact us at our annuity service center our contact information is on the first page of this prospectus the optional death benefits are only available upon application and once chosen cannot be canceled the effects of any gmwb on the amount payable to your beneficiaries upon your death should be considered in selecting the death benefits in combination with a gmwb the death benefit paid to your beneficiary upon your death is calculated as of the date we receive all required documentation in good order which includes but is not limited to due proof of death and a completed claim form from the beneficiary of record if there are multiple beneficiaries we will calculate the death benefit when we receive this documentation from the first beneficiary payment will include any required interest from the date of death the death benefit paid will be the basic death benefit unless you have selected one of the other death benefit endorsements if you have a guaranteed minimum death benefit the amount by which the guaranteed minimum death benefit exceeds the account value will be put into your account as of the date we receive all required documentation from the beneficiary of record and will be allocated among the investment divisions and fixed account according to the current allocation instructions on file for your account as of that date each beneficiary will receive their portion of the remaining value subject to market fluctuations when their option election form is received at our home office in lansing michigan basic death benefit if you die before moving to the income phase the person you have chosen as your beneficiary will receive a death benefit if you have a joint owner the death benefit will be paid when the first joint owner dies the surviving joint owner will be treated as the beneficiary any other beneficiary designated will be treated as a contingent beneficiary only a spousal beneficiary has the right to continue the contract in force upon your death the death benefit equals the greater of your contract value on the date we receive all required documentation from your beneficiary optional death benefits optional death benefits are available that are designed to protect your contract value from potentially poor investment performance and the impact that poor investment performance could have on the amount of the basic death benefit because there is an additional annual charge for each of these optional death benefits and because you cannot change your selection please be sure that you have read about and understand the contracts basic death benefit before selecting an optional death benefit optional death benefits are available if you are  years of age or younger on the contracts issue date however the older you are when your contract is issued the less advantageous it would be for you to select an optional death benefit these optional death benefits are subject to our administrative rules to assure appropriate use which administrative rules may be changed as necessary depending on when and in what state you apply for the contract the availability of an optional death benefit may be different and how an optional death benefit is calculated varies  all as noted below for purposes of these optional death benefits net premiums are defined as your premium payments net of premium taxes reduced by any withdrawals including applicable charges and deductions at the time of the withdrawal in the same proportion that the contract value was reduced on the date of the withdrawal accordingly if a withdrawal were to reduce the contract value by  for example net premiums would also be reduced by  similarly with the highest anniversary value component the adjustment to your contract value for applicable charges will have occurred proportionally at the time of the deductions following are the calculations for the optional death benefits return of premium death benefit changes your basic death benefit to the greatest of a your contract value on the date we receive all required documentation from your beneficiary or b total net premiums since your contract was issued all withdrawals will reduce this portion of the calculation in the same proportion that the contract value was reduced on the date of the withdrawal highest anniversary value death benefit changes your basic death benefit to the greatest of a your contract value as of the end of the business day on which we receive all required documentation from your beneficiary or b total net premiums since your contract was issued or c your greatest contract value on any contract anniversary prior to your st birthday minus any withdrawals including any applicable withdrawal charges and adjustments plus any premiums paid net of any applicable premium taxes subsequent to that contract anniversary payout options the basic death benefit and the optional death benefits can be paid under one of the following payout options  single lump sum payment or  payment of entire death benefit within  years of the date of death or  payment of the entire death benefit under an income option over the beneficiarys lifetime or for a period not extending beyond the beneficiarys life expectancy or payment of a portion of the death benefit under an income option over the beneficiarys lifetime or for a period not extending beyond the beneficiarys life expectancy with the balance of the death benefit payable to the beneficiary any portion of the death benefit not applied under an income option within one year of the owners death however must be paid within five years of the date of the owners death under these payout options the beneficiary may also elect to receive additional lump sums at any time the receipt of any additional lump sums will reduce the future income payments to the beneficiary unless the beneficiary chooses to receive the entire death benefit in a single sum the beneficiary must elect a payout option within the day period beginning with the date we receive proof of death and payments must begin within one year of the date of death if the beneficiary chooses to receive some or all of the death benefit in a single sum and all the necessary requirements are met we will pay the death benefit within seven days if your beneficiary is your spouse heshe may elect to continue the contract at the current contract value in hisher own name for more information please see special spousal continuation option beginning on page  preselected payout options as owner you may also make a predetermined selection of the death benefit payout option if your death occurs before the income date however at the time of your death we may modify the death benefit option if the death benefit you selected exceeds the life expectancy of the beneficiary if this preselected death benefit option election is in force at the time of your death the payment of the death benefit may not be postponed nor can the contract be continued under any other provisions of this contract this restriction applies even if the beneficiary is your spouse unless such restriction is prohibited by the internal revenue code if the beneficiary does not submit the required documentation for the death benefit to us within one year of your death however the death benefit must be paid in a single lump sum within five years of your death the preselected death benefit option may not be available in your state special spousal continuation option if your spouse is the beneficiary and elects to continue the contract in his or her own name after your death pursuant to the special spousal continuation option no death benefit will be paid at that time moreover if the contract has another optional death benefit instead of the basic death benefit we will contribute to the contract a continuation adjustment which is the amount by which the death benefit that would have been payable exceeds the contract value we calculate this amount using the contract value and death benefit as of the date we receive completed forms and due proof of death from the beneficiary of record and the spousal beneficiarys written request to continue the contract the continuation date we will add this amount to the contract based on the current allocation instructions at the time of your death subject to any minimum allocation restrictions unless we receive other allocation instructions from your spouse the special spousal continuation option may not be available in your state see your financial advisor for information regarding the availability of the special spousal continuation option if your spouse continues the contract in hisher own name under the special spousal continuation option the new contract value will be considered the initial premium for purposes of determining any future death benefit under the contract the age of the surviving spouse at the time of the continuation of the contract will be used to determine all benefits under the contract prospectively so the death benefit may be at a different level if your spouse elects to continue the contract your spouse as new owner cannot terminate most of the optional benefits you elected however a gmwb will terminate upon your death and no further gmwb charges will be deducted unless your spouse is eligible for the benefit and elects to continue it with the contract the contract and its optional benefits remains the same except as described above there is no charge for the spousal continuation option however your spouse will also be subject to the same fees charges and expenses under the contract as you were the special spousal continuation option is available to elect one time on the contract however if you have elected the preselected death benefit option the contract cannot be continued under the special spousal continuation option unless preventing continuation would be prohibited by the internal revenue code the preselected death benefit option may not be available in your state death of owner on or after the income date if you or a joint owner dies and is not the annuitant on or after the income date any remaining payments under the income option elected will continue at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution in effect at the date of death if you die the beneficiary becomes the owner if the joint owner dies the surviving joint owner if any will be the designated beneficiary any other beneficiary designation on record at the time of death will be treated as a contingent beneficiary a contingent beneficiary is entitled to receive payment only after the beneficiary dies death of annuitant if the annuitant is not an owner or joint owner and dies before the income date you can name a new annuitant subject to our underwriting rules if you do not name a new annuitant within  days of the death of the annuitant you will become the annuitant however if the owner is a nonnatural person for example a corporation then the death of the annuitant will be treated as the death of the owner and a new annuitant may not be named if the annuitant dies on or after the income date any remaining guaranteed payment will be paid to the beneficiary as provided for in the income option selected any remaining guaranteed payment will be paid at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution in effect at the annuitants death taxes  the initial offering of

or certain other entities other than a trust holding the contract as an agent for a natural person loans based on a nonqualified contract are treated as distributions nonqualified contracts  aggregation of contracts for purposes of determining the taxability of a distribution the code provides that all nonqualified contracts issued by us or an affiliate to you during any calendar year

grandchild or ancestor constructive withdrawals  investment adviser fees withdrawals from nonqualified contracts for the payment of investment adviser fees will be considered taxable distributions from the contract in a series of private letter rulings however the internal revenue service has held that the payment of investment adviser fees from a taxqualified contract need not be considered a distribution for income tax purposes under the facts in these rulings  there was a written agreement providing for payments of the fees solely from the annuity contract  the contract owner had no liability for the fees and  the fees were paid solely from the annuity contract to the adviser extension of latest income date if you do not annuitize your nonqualified contract on or before the latest income date it is possible that the irs could challenge the status of your contract as an annuity contract for tax purposes the result of such a challenge could be that you would be viewed as either constructively receiving the increase in the contract value each year from the inception of the contract or the entire increase in the contract value would be taxable in the year you attain age  in either situation you could realize taxable income even if the contract proceeds are not distributed to you at that time accordingly before purchasing a contract you should consult your tax advisor with respect to these issues death benefits none of the death benefits paid under the contract to the beneficiary will be taxexempt life insurance benefits the rules governing the taxation of payments from an annuity contract as discussed above generally apply to the payment of death benefits and depend on whether the death benefits are paid as a lump sum or as annuity payments estate or gift taxes may also apply assignment an assignment of your contract will generally be a taxable event assignments of a taxqualified contract may also be limited by the code and the employee retirement income security act of  as amended these limits are summarized in the sai you should consult your tax adviser prior to making any assignment of your contract diversification the code provides that the underlying investments for a nonqualified variable annuity must satisfy certain diversification requirements in order to be treated as an annuity contract we believe that the underlying investments are being managed so as to comply with these requirements owner control in a revenue ruling issued in  the internal revenue service irs considered certain variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts and held that the types of actual and potential control that the contract owners could exercise over the investment assets held by the insurance company under these variable contracts was not sufficient to cause the contract owners to be treated as the owners of those assets and thus to be subject to current income tax on the income and gains produced by those assets under the contract like the contracts described in the revenue ruling there will be no arrangement plan contract or agreement between the contract owner and jackson national regarding the availability of a particular investment option and other than the contract owners right to allocate premiums and transfer funds among the available subaccounts all investment decisions concerning the subaccounts will be made by the insurance company or an advisor in its sole and absolute discretion the contract will differ from the contracts described in the revenue ruling in two respects the first difference is that the contract in the revenue ruling provided only  investment options with the insurance company having the ability to add an additional  options whereas a contract offers  investment divisions and at least one fixed account option although a contract owner can select no more than  fixed and variable options at any one time the second difference is that the owner of a contract in the revenue ruling could only make one transfer per day period without a fee whereas during the accumulation phase a contract owner will be permitted to make up to  transfers in any one year without a charge the revenue ruling states that whether the owner of a variable contract is to be treated as the owner of the assets held by the insurance company under the contract will depend on all of the facts and circumstances jackson national does not believe that the differences between the contract and the contracts described in the revenue ruling with respect to the number of investment choices and the number of investment transfers that can be made under the contract without an additional charge should prevent the holding in the revenue ruling from applying to the owner of a contract at this time however it cannot be determined whether additional guidance will be provided by the irs on this issue and what standards may be contained in such guidance we reserve the right to modify the contract to the extent required to maintain favorable tax treatment withholding in general distributions from a contract are subject to  federal income tax withholding unless you elect not to have tax withheld some states have enacted similar rules different rules may apply to payments delivered outside the united states any distribution from a taxqualified contract eligible for rollover will be subject to federal tax withholding at a mandatory  rate unless the distribution is made as a direct rollover to a taxqualified plan or to an individual retirement account or annuity the code generally allows the rollover of most distributions to and from taxqualified plans taxsheltered annuities individual retirement annuities and eligible deferred compensation plans of state or local governments distributions which may not be rolled over are those which are a one of a series of substantially equal annual or more frequent payments made a over the life or life expectancy of the employee b the joint lives or joint life expectancies of the employee and the employees beneficiary or c for a specified period of ten years or more b a required minimum distribution c a hardship withdrawal or d the nontaxable portion of a distribution jnl taxation we will pay company income taxes on the taxable corporate earnings created by this separate account product adjusted for various permissible deductions and certain tax benefits discussed below while we may consider company income tax liabilities and tax benefits when pricing our products we do not currently include our income tax liabilities in the charges you pay under the contract we will periodically review the issue of charging for these taxes and may impose a charge in the future we do impose a socalled federal dac tax charge under variable life insurance policies but the federal dac tax charge merely compensates us for the required deferral of acquisition cost and does not constitute company income taxes in calculating our corporate income tax liability we derive certain corporate income tax benefits associated with the investment of company assets including separate account assets that are treated as company assets under applicable income tax law these benefits reduce our overall corporate income tax liability under current law such benefits may include dividends received deductions and foreign tax credits which can be material we do not pass these benefits through to the separate accounts principally because i the great bulk of the benefits results from the dividends received deduction which involves no reduction in the dollar amount of dividends that the separate account receives ii product owners are not the owners of the assets generating the benefits under applicable income tax law and iii while we impose a socalled federal dac tax charge under variable life insurance policies we do not currently include company income taxes in the charges owners pay under the products other information dollar cost averaging if the amount allocated to the investment divisions plus the amount allocated to a fixed account option is at least  you can arrange to have a dollar amount or percentage of money periodically transferred automatically into the investment divisions and other fixed account options from the oneyear fixed account or any of the investment divisions if the fixed account options are not available or otherwise restricted dollar cost averaging will be exclusively from the investment divisions in the case of transfers from the oneyear fixed account or investment divisions with a stable unit value to the investment divisions this can let you pay a lower average cost per unit over time than you would receive if you made a onetime purchase transfers from the more volatile investment divisions may not result in lower average costs and such investment divisions may not be an appropriate source of dollar cost averaging transfers in volatile markets there is no charge for dollar cost averaging certain restrictions may apply dollar cost averaging plus dca the dca fixed account is a source account designed for dollar cost averaging transfers to investment divisions or systematic transfers to other fixed accounts the dca fixed account is credited with an enhanced interest rate if a dca fixed account is selected monies in the dca fixed account will be systematically transferred to the investment divisions or other fixed accounts chosen over the dca term selected there is no charge for dca the dca fixed account is only available for new premiums premiums are accepted during the first six contract months only you should consult your jnl representative with respect to the current availability of the fixed account options and the availability of dca earnings sweep you can choose to move your earnings from the source accounts only applicable from the one year fixed account option if currently available and the money market investment division there is no charge for earnings sweep rebalancing you can arrange to have us automatically reallocate your contract value among investment divisions and the oneyear fixed account if currently available periodically to maintain your selected allocation percentages rebalancing is consistent with maintaining your allocation of investments among market segments although it is accomplished by reducing your contract value allocated to the better performing investment divisions there is no charge for rebalancing you may cancel a dollar cost averaging earnings sweep or rebalancing program using whatever methods you use to change your allocation instructions free look you may return your contract to the selling agent or us within ten days or longer if required by your state after receiving it we will return  the contract value plus  any fees other than assetbased fees and expenses deducted from the premiums we will determine the contract value in the investment divisions as of the date we receive the contract or the date you return it to the selling agent we will return premium payments where required by law in some states we are required to hold the premiums of a senior citizen in the fixed account during the free look period unless we are specifically directed to allocate the premiums to the investment divisions state laws vary your free look rights will depend on the laws of the state in which you purchased the contract advertising from time to time we may advertise several types of performance of the investment divisions  total return is the overall change in the value of an investment in an investment division over a given period of time  standardized average annual total return is calculated in accordance with sec guidelines  nonstandardized total return may be for periods other than those required by or may otherwise differ from standardized average annual total return for example if a fund has been in existence longer than the investment division we may show nonstandardized performance for periods that begin on the inception date of the fund rather than the inception date of the investment division  yield refers to the income generated by an investment over a given period of time performance will be calculated by determining the percentage change in the value of an accumulation unit by dividing the increase decrease for that unit by the value of the accumulation unit at the beginning of the period performance will reflect the deduction of the mortality and expense risk and administration charges and may reflect the deduction of the annual contract maintenance and withdrawal charges but will not reflect charges for optional features except in performance data used in sales materials that promote those optional features the deduction of withdrawal charges andor the charges for optional features would reduce the percentage increase or make greater any percentage decrease restrictions under the texas optional retirement program orp contracts issued to participants in orp contain restrictions required under the texas administrative code in accordance with those restrictions a participant in orp will not be permitted to make withdrawals prior to such participants retirement death attainment of age   or termination of employment in a texas public institution of higher education the restrictions on withdrawal do not apply in the event a participant in orp transfers the contract value to another approved contract or vendor during the period of orp participation these requirements will apply to any other jurisdiction with comparable requirements modification of your contract only our president vice president secretary or assistant secretary may approve a change to or waive a provision of your contract

the stepup is a beneficial election  your gwb will only automatically step up to the contract value if the contract value is greater than your gwb at the time of the automatic stepup example  impact of the order of transactions  if prior to any transactions your contract value is  your gwb is  and you wish to step up your gwb or your gwb is due to step up automatically and you also wish to take a withdrawal of an amount equal to your gawa   if you request the withdrawal after the stepup upon stepup your gwb is set equal to  which is your contract value at that time your gawa is recalculated

if your endorsement is a for life gmwb with joint option even beyond  years prior to the latest income date  if you requested the withdrawal prior to the stepup immediately following the withdrawal transaction your new gwb is  which is your gwb less the amount of the withdrawal      and your contract value becomes  which is your contract value prior to the withdrawal less the amount of the withdrawal      upon stepup following the withdrawal your gwb is set equal to  which is your contract value at that time your gawa is recalculated and is equal to  which is the greater of  your gawa prior to the stepup  or   of your new gwb    if you continued to take annual withdrawals equal to your gawa it would take an additional  years to deplete your gwb    per year   years provided that

surviving covered life if your endorsement is a for life gmwb with joint option even beyond  years prior to the latest income date  notes  as the example illustrates when considering a request for a withdrawal at or near the same time as the election or automatic application of a stepup the order of the transactions may impact your gawa if the stepup would result in an increase in your gawa and the requested withdrawal is less than or equal to your new gawa your gawa resulting after the two transactions would be greater if the withdrawal is requested after the stepup is applied if the stepup does not increase your gawa or the withdrawal requested is greater than your new gawa your gawa resulting from the transactions is the same regardless of the order of the transactions  this example would also apply in situations when the withdrawal exceeded your gawa but not your permissible rmd  the election of an ownerinitiated stepup may result in an increase in the gmwb charge  your gwb will only automatically step up to the contract value if the contract value is greater than your gwb at the time of the automatic stepup  if your endorsement does not include a for life guarantee or if the for life guarantee is not in effect your gawa would not be permitted to exceed your remaining gwb  withdrawals taken in connection with a gmwb are considered the same as any other withdrawal for the purpose of determining all other values under the contract in the case where your minimum death benefit is reduced proportionately for withdrawals your death benefit may be reduced by more than the amount of the withdrawal example  for life guarantee becomes effective after the effective date of the endorsement at the time the for life guarantee becomes effective your gawa is redetermined this example only applies if your endorsement is a for life gmwb  example a if on the contract anniversary on or immediately following your th birthday your contract value is  your gwb is  and your gawa is

herein and upon the authority of said firm as experts in accounting and auditing jackson national life insurance companys audit report refers to the adoption effective january   of the accounting

compensate brokerdealers selling the contracts calculation of performance when jackson national advertises performance for an investment division except the jnlselect money market division we will include quotations of standardized average annual total return to facilitate comparison with standardized average annual total return advertised by other variable annuity separate accounts standardized average annual total return for an investment division will be shown for periods beginning on the date the investment division first invested in the corresponding funds we will calculate standardized average annual total return according to the standard methods prescribed by rules of the securities and exchange commission standardized average annual total return for a specific period is calculated by taking a hypothetical  investment in an investment division at the offering on the first day of the period initial investment and computing the average annual compounded rate of return for the period that would equate the initial investment with the ending redeemable value redeemable value of that investment at the end of the period carried to at least the nearest hundredth of a percent standardized average annual total return reflects the deduction of all recurring charges that are charged to all contracts the redeemable value also reflects the effect of any applicable withdrawal charge or other charge that may be imposed at the end of the period no deduction is made for premium taxes that may be assessed by certain states jackson national may also advertise nonstandardized total return on an annualized and cumulative basis nonstandardized total return may be for periods other than those required to be presented or may otherwise differ from standardized average annual total return the contract is designed for longterm investment therefore jackson national believes that nonstandardized total return that does not reflect the deduction of any applicable withdrawal charge may be useful to investors reflecting the deduction of the withdrawal charge decreases the level of performance advertised nonstandardized total return may also assume a larger initial investment that more closely approximates the size of a typical contract standardized average annual total return quotations will be current to the last day of the calendar quarter preceding the date on which an advertisement is submitted for publication both standardized average annual total return quotations and nonstandardized total return quotations will be based on rolling calendar quarters and will cover at least periods of one five and ten years or a period covering the time the investment division has been in existence if it has not been in existence for one of the prescribed periods quotations of standardized average annual total return and nonstandardized total return are based upon historical earnings and will fluctuate any quotation of performance should not be considered a guarantee of future performance factors affecting the performance of an investment division and its corresponding fund include general market conditions operating expenses and investment management an owners withdrawal value upon surrender of a contract may be more or less than its original cost jackson national may advertise the current annualized yield for a day period for an investment division the annualized yield of an investment division refers to the income generated by the investment division over a specified day period because this yield is annualized the yield generated by an investment division during the day period is assumed to be generated each day period the yield is computed by dividing the net investment income per accumulation unit earned during the period by the price per unit on the last day of the period according to the following formula   ab  yield         cd  where download table a  net investment income earned during the period by the fund attributable to shares owned by the investment division b  expenses for the investment division accrued for the period net of reimbursements c  the average daily number of accumulation units outstanding during the period d  the maximum offering price per accumulation unit on the last day of the period the maximum withdrawal charge is  net investment income will be determined in accordance with rules established by the securities and exchange commission accrued expenses will include all recurring fees that are charged to all contracts because of the charges and deductions imposed by the separate account the yield for an investment division will be lower than the yield for the corresponding funds the yield on amounts held in the investment division normally will fluctuate over time therefore the disclosed yield for any given period is not an indication or representation of future yields or rates of return an investment divisions actual yield will be affected by the types and quality of portfolio securities held by the fund and the fund operating expenses any current yield quotations of the jnlselect money market division will consist of a seven calendar day historical yield carried at least to the nearest hundredth of a percent we may advertise yield for the division based on different time periods but we will accompany it with a yield quotation based on a seven calendar day period the jnlselect money market divisions yield will be calculated by determining the net change exclusive of capital changes in the value of a hypothetical preexisting account having a balance of one accumulation unit at the beginning of the base period subtracting a hypothetical charge reflecting deductions from contracts and dividing the net change in account value by the value of the account at the beginning of the period to obtain a base period return and multiplying the base period return by  the jnlselect money market divisions effective yield is computed similarly but includes the effect of assumed compounding on an annualized basis of the current yield quotations of the division the jnlselect money market divisions and effective yield will fluctuate daily actual yields will depend on factors such as the type of instruments in the funds portfolio portfolio quality and average maturity changes in interest rates and the funds expenses although the investment division determines its yield on the basis of a seven calendar day period it may use a different time period on occasion the yield quotes may reflect the expense limitations described in the funds prospectus or statement of additional information there is no assurance that the yields quoted on any given occasion will be maintained for any period of time and there is no guarantee that the net asset values will remain constant it should be noted that neither a contract owners investment in the jnlselect money market division nor that divisions investment in the jnlselect money market division is guaranteed or insured yields of other money market funds may not be comparable if a different base or another method of calculation is used additional tax information note information contained herein should not be substituted for the advice of a personal tax adviser jackson national does not make any guarantee regarding the tax status of any contract or any transaction involving the contracts purchasers bear the complete risk that the contracts may not be treated as annuity contracts under federal income tax laws it should be further understood that the following discussion is not exhaustive and that other special rules may be applicable in certain situations moreover no attempt has been made to consider any applicable state or other tax laws or to compare the tax treatment of the contracts to the tax treatment of any other investment jackson nationals tax status jackson national is taxed as a life insurance company under the code for federal income tax purposes the separate account is not a separate entity from jackson national and its operations form a part of jackson national taxation of annuity contracts in general section  of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code governs taxation of annuities in general an individual owner is not taxed on increases in the value of a contract until distribution occurs either in the form of a withdrawal or as annuity payments under the annuity option elected for a withdrawal received as a total surrender total redemption or a death benefit the recipient is taxed on the portion of the payment that exceeds the cost basis of the contract for a payment received as a partial withdrawal from a nonqualified contract federal tax liability is generally determined on a lastin firstout basis meaning taxable income is withdrawn before the cost basis of the contract is withdrawn in the case of a partial withdrawal under a taxqualified contract a ratable portion of the amount received is taxable for contracts issued in connection with nonqualified plans the cost basis is generally the premiums while for contracts issued in connection with taxqualified plans there may be no cost basis the taxable portion of a withdrawal is taxed at ordinary income tax rates tax penalties may also apply for annuity payments a portion of each payment in excess of an exclusion amount is includable in taxable income all annuity payments in excess of the exclusion amount are fully taxable at ordinary income rates the exclusion amount for payments based on a fixed annuity option is determined by multiplying the payment by the ratio that the cost basis of the contract adjusted for any period certain or refund feature bears to the expected return under the contract the exclusion amount for payments based on a variable annuity option is determined by dividing the cost basis of the contract adjusted for any period certain or refund guarantee by the fixed or estimated number of years for which annuity payments are to be made no exclusion is allowed with respect to any payments received after the investment in the contract has been recovered ie when the total of the excludable amounts equals the investment in the contract for certain types of taxqualified plans there may be no cost basis in the contract within the meaning of section  of the code owners annuitants and beneficiaries under the contracts should seek competent financial advice about the tax consequences of distributions withholding tax on distributions the code generally requires jackson national or in some cases a plan administrator to withhold tax on the taxable portion of any distribution or withdrawal from a contract for eligible rollover distributions from contracts issued under certain types of taxqualified plans  of the distribution must be withheld unless the payee elects to have the distribution rolled over to another eligible plan in a direct transfer this requirement is mandatory and cannot be waived by the owner an eligible rollover distribution is the taxable portion of any amount received by a covered employee from a plan qualified under section a or a of the code from a tax sheltered annuity qualified under section b of the code or an eligible deferred compensation plan of a state or local government under section b of the code other than  a series of substantially equal periodic payments not less frequently than annually for the life or life expectancy of the employee or joint lives or joint life expectancies of the employee and his or her designated beneficiary or for a specified period of ten years or more  minimum distributions required to be made under the code and  hardship withdrawals failure to roll over the entire amount of an eligible rollover distribution including the amount equal to the  portion of the distribution that was withheld could have adverse tax consequences including the imposition of a penalty tax on premature withdrawals described later in this section withdrawals or distributions from a contract other than eligible rollover distributions are also subject to withholding on the taxable portion of the distribution but the owner may elect in such cases to waive the withholding requirement if not waived withholding is imposed  for periodic payments at the rate that would be imposed if the payments were wages or  for other distributions at the rate of  if no withholding exemption certificate is in effect for the payee the rate under  above is computed by treating the payee as a married individual claiming three withholding exemptions generally the amount of any payment of interest to a nonresident alien of the united states shall be subject to withholding of a tax equal to  of such amount or if applicable a lower treaty rate a payment may not be subject to withholding where the recipient sufficiently establishes that such payment is effectively connected to the recipients conduct of a trade or business in the united states and such payment is included in the recipients gross income diversification  separate account investments section h of the code imposes certain asset diversification standards on variable annuity contracts the code provides that a variable annuity contract will not be treated as an annuity contract for any period and any subsequent period for which the investments held in any segregated asset account underlying the contract are not adequately diversified in accordance with regulations prescribed by the united states treasury department treasury department disqualification of the contract as an annuity contract would result in imposition of federal income tax to the owner with respect to earnings allocable to the contract prior to the receipt of payments under the contract the code contains a safe harbor provision which provides that annuity contracts such as the contracts meet the diversification requirements if as of the last day of each calendar quarter or within  days after such last day the underlying assets meet the diversification standards for a regulated investment company and no more than  of the total assets consist of cash cash items us government securities and securities of other regulated investment companies the treasury department has issued regulations establishing diversification requirements for the mutual funds underlying variable contracts these regulations amplify the diversification requirements for variable contracts set forth in the code and provide an alternative to the safe harbor provision described above under these regulations a mutual fund will be deemed adequately diversified if  no more than  of the value of the total assets of the mutual fund is represented by any one investment  no more than  of the value of the total assets of the mutual fund is represented by any two investments  no more than  of the value of the total assets of the mutual fund is represented by any three investments and  no more than  of the value of the total assets of the mutual fund is represented by any four investments jackson national intends that each fund of the jnl series trust will be managed by its respective investment adviser in such a manner as to comply with these diversification requirements at the time the treasury department issued the diversification regulations it did not provide guidance regarding the circumstances under which contract owner control of the investments of a segregated asset account would cause the contract owner to be treated as the owner of the assets of the segregated asset account revenue ruling  provides such guidance by describing the circumstances under which the owner of a variable contract will not possess sufficient control over the assets underlying the contract to be treated as the owner of those assets for federal income tax purposes rev rul  considered certain variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts and held that the types of actual and potential control that the contract owners could exercise over the investment assets held by the insurance company under these variable contracts was not sufficient to cause the contract owners to be treated as the owners of those assets and thus to be subject to current income tax on the income and gains produced by those assets under the contracts in rev rul  there was no arrangement plan contract or agreement between the contract owner and the insurance company regarding the availability of a particular investment option and other than the contract owners right to allocate premiums and transfer funds among the available subaccounts all investment decisions concerning the subaccounts were made by the insurance company or an advisor in its sole and absolute discretion twelve investment options were available under the contracts in rev rul  although the insurance company had the right to increase but to no more than  or decrease the number of subaccounts at any time the contract owner was permitted to transfer amounts among the various investment options without limitation subject to incurring fees for more than one transfer per day period like the contracts described in rev rul  under the contract there will be no arrangement plan contract or agreement between a contract owner and jackson national regarding the availability of a particular allocation option and other than the contract owners right to allocate premiums and transfer funds among the available allocation options all investment decisions concerning the allocation options will be made by jackson national or an advisor in its sole and absolute discretion the contract will differ from the contracts described in rev rul  in two respects the first difference is that the contracts described in rev rul  provided only  investment options with the insurance company having the ability to add an additional  options whereas the contract offers  investment divisions and  fixed account options although a contract owner can select no more than  allocation options at any one time the second difference is that the owner of a contract in rev rul  could only make one transfer per day period without a fee whereas during the accumulation phase a contract owner can make  transfers in any one year without a charge rev rul  states that whether the owner of a variable contract is to be treated as the owner of the assets held by the insurance company under the contract will depend on all of the facts and circumstances jackson national does not believe that the differences between the contract and the contracts described in rev rul  with respect to the number of investment choices and the number of investment transfers that can be made under the contract without an additional charge should prevent the holding in rev rul  from applying to the owner of a contract at this time however it cannot be determined whether additional guidance will be provided by the irs on this issue and what standards may be contained in such guidance jackson national reserves the right to modify the contract to the extent required to maintain favorable tax treatment multiple contracts the code provides that multiple nonqualified annuity contracts that are issued within a calendar year to the same contract owner by one company or its affiliates are treated as one annuity contract for purposes of determining the tax consequences of any distribution such treatment may result in adverse tax consequences including more rapid taxation of the distributed amounts from such multiple contracts for purposes of this rule contracts received in a section  exchange will be considered issued in the year of the exchange owners should consult a tax adviser prior to purchasing more than one annuity contract in any calendar year partial  exchanges section  of the code provides that an annuity contract may be exchanged in a taxfree transaction for another annuity contract historically it was presumed that only the exchange of an entire contract as opposed to a partial exchange would be accorded taxfree status in  in conway vs commissioner the tax court held that the direct transfer of a portion of an annuity contract into another annuity contract qualified as a nontaxable exchange in response to the conway decision the irs issued notice  announcing that pending the publication of final regulations the irs will consider all the facts and circumstances using general principles of tax law to determine whether a partial exchange and a subsequent withdrawal from or surrender of either the surviving annuity contract or the new annuity contract within  months of the date on which the partial exchange was completed should be treated as an integrated transaction in the absence of further guidance from the internal revenue service it is unclear what specific types of partial exchange designs and transactions will be challenged by the internal revenue service due to the uncertainty in this area owners should consult their own tax advisers prior to entering into a partial exchange of an annuity contract contracts owned by other than natural persons under section u of the code the investment earnings on premiums for contracts will be taxed currently to the owner if the owner is a nonnatural person eg a corporation or certain other entities such contracts generally will not be treated as annuities for federal income tax purposes except for the taxation of life insurance companies however this treatment is not applied to contracts held by a trust or other entity as an agent for a natural person nor to contracts held by certain taxqualified plans purchasers should consult their own tax counsel or other tax adviser before purchasing a contract to be owned by a nonnatural person tax treatment of assignments an assignment or pledge of a contract may have tax consequences any assignment or pledge of a taxqualified contract may also be prohibited by erisa in some circumstances owners should therefore consult competent legal advisers should they wish to assign or pledge their contracts an assignment or pledge of all or any portion of the value of a nonqualified contract is treated under section  of the code as an amount not received as an annuity the value of the contract assigned or pledged that exceeds the aggregate premiums paid will be included in the individuals gross income in addition the amount included in the individuals gross income could also be subject to the  penalty tax discussed below under nonqualified contracts an assignment or pledge of all or any portion of the value of a qualified contract will disqualify the qualified contract if the qualified contract is part of a qualified pension or profitsharing plan the code prohibits the assignment or alienation of benefits provided under the plan if the qualified contract is an ira annuity or a b annuity the code requires the qualified contract to be nontransferable if the qualified contract is part of an eligible deferred compensation plan amounts cannot be made available to plan participants or beneficiaries  until the calendar year in which the participant attains age    when the participant has a severance from employment or  when the participant is faced with an unforeseeable emergency death benefits any death benefits paid under the contract are taxable to the beneficiary the rules governing the taxation of payments from an annuity contract as discussed above generally apply to the payment of death benefits and depend on whether the death benefits are paid as a lump sum or as annuity payments estate or gift taxes may also apply taxqualified plans the contracts offered by the prospectus are designed to be suitable for use under various types of taxqualified plans taxation of owners of a taxqualified contract will vary based on the type of plan and the terms and conditions of each specific plan owners annuitants and beneficiaries are cautioned that benefits under a taxqualified contract may be subject to the terms and conditions of the plan regardless of the terms and conditions of the contracts issued to fund the plan owners annuitant and beneficiaries are also reminded that a taxqualified contract will not provide any necessary or additional tax deferral if it is used to fund a taxqualified plan that is already taxdeferred tax treatment of withdrawals nonqualified contracts section  of the code governs treatment of distributions from annuity contracts it provides that if the contract value exceeds the aggregate premiums made any amount withdrawn not in the form of an annuity payment will be treated as coming first from the earnings and then only after the income portion is exhausted as coming from the principal withdrawn earnings are included in a taxpayers gross income section  further provides that a  penalty will apply to the income portion of any distribution the penalty is not imposed on amounts received  after the taxpayer reaches    upon the death of the owner  if the taxpayer is totally disabled as defined in section m of the code  in a series of substantially equal periodic payments made at least annually for the life or life expectancy of the taxpayer or for the joint lives or joint life expectancies of the taxpayer and his beneficiary  under an immediate annuity or  which are allocable to premium payments made prior to august   with respect to  above if the series of substantially equal periodic payments is modified before the later of your attaining age   or five years from the date of the first periodic payment then the tax for the year of the modification is increased by an amount equal to the tax which would have been imposed the  penalty tax but for the exception plus interest for the tax years in which the exception was used taxqualified contracts in the case of a withdrawal under a taxqualified contract a ratable portion of the amount received is taxable generally based on the ratio of the individuals cost basis to the individuals total accrued benefit under the retirement plan special tax rules may be available for certain distributions from a taxqualified contract section t of the code imposes a  penalty tax on the taxable portion of any distribution from qualified retirement plans including contracts issued and qualified under code sections  pension and profit sharing plans b taxsheltered annuities individual retirement accounts and annuities under a and b iras and roth iras under a to the extent amounts are not included in gross income because they have been rolled over to an ira or to another eligible qualified plan no tax penalty will be imposed the tax penalty will not apply to the following distributions  distributions made on or after the date on which the owner or annuitant as applicable reaches age    distributions following the death or disability of the owner or annuitant as applicable for this purpose disability is defined in section m of the code  upon separation from service after attainment of age  distributions that are part of a series of substantially equal periodic payments made not less frequently than annually for the life or life expectancy of the owner or annuitant as applicable or the joint lives or joint life expectancies of such owner or annuitant as applicable and his or her designated beneficiary  distributions to an owner or annuitant as applicable who has separated from service after he has attained age   distributions made to the owner or annuitant as applicable to the extent such distributions do not exceed the amount allowable as a deduction under code section  to the owner or annuitant as

qualified plans and other employersponsored retirement plans such classification is not permitted and age of the annuitant and designated second person if any the dollars applied are divided by  and the result multiplied by the appropriate annuity factor appearing in the table to compute the amount of the first monthly payment that amount is divided by the value of an annuity unit as of the income date to establish the number of annuity units representing each variable payment the number of annuity units determined for the first variable payment remains constant for the second and subsequent monthly variable payments assuming that no reallocation of contract values is made the amount of the second and each subsequent monthly variable payment is determined by multiplying the number of annuity units by the annuity unit value as of the business day next preceding the date on which each payment is due the mortality and expense experience will not adversely affect the dollar
