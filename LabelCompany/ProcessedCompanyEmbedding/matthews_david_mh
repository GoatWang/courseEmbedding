since using and understanding medical statistics was first published  years ago without question the single greatest change has been the inclusion of source code together with selected output for the awardwinning opensource statistical package known as r this innovation has enabled the authors to deemphasize formulae and calculations and let software do all of the heavy lifting this edition also introduces readers to several graphical statistical tools such as qq plots to check normality residual plots for multiple regression models funnel plots to detect publication bias in a metaanalysis and blandaltman plots for assessing agreement in clinical measurements new examples that better serve the expository goals have been added to a halfdozen chapters in addition there are new sections describing exact confidence bands for the kaplanmeier estimator as well as negative binomial and zeroinflated poisson regression models for overdispersed count data the end result is not only an excellent introduction to medical statistics but also an invaluable reference for every discerning reader of medical research literature follow matthews book co on copyright   matthews book company
