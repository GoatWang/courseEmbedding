overviewinvestment teamcontactoverviewhmcs value strategy seeks to provide superior riskadjusted returns by investing primarily in a focused portfolio of fundamentally selected equity securities on both the long and short sides investment approach we employ a disciplined approach to securities and valuation analysis in an effort to uncover companies we perceive to be mispriced by the marketplace the core principles of the strategy are a disciplined emphasis on absolute value fundamentallybased analysis of investment opportunities a focused portfolio selective shortselling and a longterm analytical view when determining a potential investment’s intrinsic or expected value we perform fundamental analysis including financial statement analysis industry analysis and an estimation of free cash flow generation value is typically determined based on these factors and selected valuation methods with the free cash flow capability of the given business over the longterm often taking precedent over other factors in some cases we identify these opportunities in special situations such as spinoffs holding company discounts and stub positions where we attempt to capitalize on valuation dislocations resulting from corporate actions or structural complexity we also engage in selective shortselling in situations where we identify securities that we believe are unsustainably overvalued relative to our assessment of fundamental underlying value while some of our short positions have direct or indirect relationships to long positions we typically target individually
