reporting requirements of the cftc and the national futures association nfa registrants objectives registrants objectives are • significant profits over time • performance volatility commensurate with profit potential • controlled risk of loss and • diversification within a traditional portfolio typically consisting entirely of long equity and debt positions and reduced dependence on a single nations economy by accessing global financial commodity and other nonfinancial futures markets registrants potential for aggressive capital growth arises from the profit possibilities offered by the global futures forward and options markets and the skills of the professional trading organizations selected to manage the assets of registrant the fact that registrant can profit from both rising and falling markets adds an element of profit potential that is not present in longonly strategies however registrant can also incur losses from both rising and falling markets that adds to the risk of loss in addition to its profit potential and risk of loss registrant also could help reduce the overall volatility or risk of a portfolio by investing in markets that operate independently from us stock and bond markets and therefore may be considered as noncorrelated registrant may provide positive returns even when us stock and bond markets are experiencing flat to negative performance and may provide negative returns even when us stock and bond markets are experiencing flat to positive performance noncorrelation should not be confused with negative correlation where the performance would be exactly opposite between registrant and us stock and bond markets the managing member makes no guarantee that the investment objectives for registrant will be achieved past performance is not

help preserve capital while awaiting more favorable market cycles the managing member currently does not intend to use notional equity the managing member also performs ongoing due diligence with

managing member on behalf of registrant will take such actions as it deems appropriate which may include terminating the trading advisors similarly if the managing members ongoing due diligence leads the managing member to determine that it is in the best interests of registrant to add an additional trading advisor it will do so in its sole discretion if the managing member concludes based upon

investment process is probably best understood by starting with the founding principle and philosophy of winton laid down by its founder david harding this is the belief that robust statistical and other mathematical research provides the richest and most reliable source of information on market behavior david harding has spent the past  years leading research into market behavior and built an investment process that seeks to identify trends and patterns in short the investment process is best described as quantitative systematic and researchdriven which seeks to identify explanatory variables that have some predictive power over future returns in markets within a carefully developed risk driven process the investment objective is to achieve longterm capital appreciation through compound growth this goal is achieved by pursuing a diversified trading scheme that does not rely upon favorable conditions in any particular market nor on market direction   table of contents the diversified trading program the diversified program seeks to combine liquid financial instruments offering positive but low sharpe ratios meaning that profits have been achieved with a certain level of risk and generally low correlations over the long term to other markets such as equities and fixed income the diversified program employs what is traditionally known as a systematic approach to trading financial instruments in this context the term systematic implies that the vast majority of the trading decisions are executed without discretion either electronically or by a team responsible for the placement of orders the trading team based upon the instructions generated by the winton computer trading system the trading system the diversified program blends shortterm trading with longterm trend following using multiple time frames in addition to multiple models please note that although the diversified programs historic correlations have been low in relation to major asset classes over the longterm over shorter timeframes the diversified program can be significantly correlated background of graham and its trading and operational principals graham was organized as a

been no material administrative civil or criminal proceedings against graham its affiliates or its principals any of which are pending are on appeal or have concluded at any time during the last five years overview of the kdv program the kdv quantitative investment program has its origin in grahams legacy trendfollowing systems dated as far back as  grahams trend systems are designed to participate selectively in potential profit opportunities that can occur during periods of price trends in a diverse number of us and international markets the trend systems establish positions in markets where the price action of a particular market signals the computerized systems used by graham that a potential trend in prices is occurring the trend systems are designed to analyze mathematically the recent trading characteristics of each market and statistically compare such characteristics to the historical trading patterns of the particular market the trend systems also   table of contents employ proprietary risk management and trade filter strategies that seek to benefit from sustained price trends while reducing risk and volatility exposure the kdv program utilizes multiple computerized trading models and offers broad diversification in both financial and nonfinancial markets trading in approximately  global markets it is intended to generate significant returns over time with an acceptable degree of risk and volatility the computer models on a daily basis analyze the recent price action the relative strength and the risk characteristics of each market and compare statistically the quantitative results of this data to years of historical data on each market in addition to the trend system or systems at its base the kdv quantitative investment program has added substantial other trading strategies developed by grahams research department graham believes strongly in the importance of research and development activity and particularly in the development of new trading strategies as one example of such efforts graham has incorporated a proprietary multifactor leverage model within each of its trendfollowing programs to adjust the programs exposure to key market sectors systematically based on proprietary factors that assess the potential of prices to trend in the near term other trading strategies developed by graham research and added to graham investment programs include not only a broad array of trend systems with varying time horizons but also countertrend trading systems and trading systems that do not seek to identify or follow price trends at all such systems generally are based on computerized mathematical models and rely primarily on technical rather than fundamental information as the basis for their trading decisions graham intends to add new trading strategies to its investment programs as well as to modify the systems currently in place in such programs in its ongoing efforts to keep pace with changing market conditions and it anticipates that the constellation of trading strategies comprising each investment program will continue to grow and evolve over time the decision to add or subtract systems or strategies from any investment program shall be at the sole discretion of graham clients will not be informed of these changes as they occur the futures clearing broker ubs securities llc serves as

statements included in its annual report for the year ended december   registrants  annual report which is filed as an exhibit to registrants form k for the fiscal year ended december   critical accounting policies preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires the application of appropriate accounting rules and guidance applying these policies requires the managing member to make judgments estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of registrants financial statements actual results may differ from the estimates used the managing member has evaluated registrants financial statements and related disclosures and has determined that the policies discussed below are critical accounting policies because they involve estimates judgments and assumptions that are particularly complex subjective or uncertain for further discussion of registrants significant accounting policies see note  of registrants  annual report filed as an exhibit to registrants form k the valuation of registrants investments that are not traded on a united states us or internationally recognized futures exchange is a critical accounting policy the market values of futures exchange traded contracts is verified by registrants administrator which obtains valuation data from third party data providers such as bloomberg reuters and super derivatives and compares those prices with registrants clearing broker the market value of currency swap and forward nonexchange traded contracts is extrapolated on a forward basis from the spot prices quoted as of  pm on the last business day of the reporting period all values assigned by the administrator and confirmed by the managing member are final and conclusive as to all of registrants members as such if actual results vary from estimates used they are not anticipated to have a material impact on the financial statements and related disclosures registrant records all investments at fair value in its financial statements with changes in fair value reported as a component of trading profits losses in the condensed statements of operations generally fair values are based on quoted market prices however in certain circumstances significant judgments and estimates are involved in determining fair value in the absence of an active market closing price registrant considers prices for exchange traded commodity futures and options contracts to be based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets level  the values of forwards swaps and certain option contracts for which market quotations are not readily available are priced by lme cme and ice exchanges as well as super derivatives bloomberg reuters and or other third party data providers who derive fair values for those assets from observable inputs level  level  inputs reflect registrants assumptions that it believes market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability registrant develops level  inputs based on the best information available in the circumstances which may include indirect correlation to a market value combinations of market values or registrants proprietary data level  inputs generally include information derived through extrapolation or interpolation of observable market data registrant does not currently have any investments valued using level  inputs   table of contents of the registrants investments at june    or  of registrants investments are classified as level  and  or  as level  of the registrants investments at december    or  of registrants investments are classified as level  and  or  as level  there are no level  investments at june   or december   the managing member has determined that it is in the best interest of the registrant to invest a portion of nonmargin assets either directly or indirectly through certain investment funds which invest primarily in i us government securities which include any security issued or guaranteed as to principal or interest by the united states ii any certificate of deposit for any of the foregoing including us treasury bonds us treasury bills and issues of agencies of the united states government iii corporate bonds or notes or iv other instruments permitted by applicable rules and regulations at the end of each month the managing member will be paid  of  a  annual rate of the first  of the returns earned on its investment of nonmargin assets registrant will be credited with all additional returns earned on registrants investment of nonmargin assets in january  the fasb amended the existing disclosure guidance on fair value measurements which was effective for registrant on january   except for disclosures about purchases sales issuances and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level  fair value measurements which is effective for registrant on january   among other things the updated guidance requires additional disclosure for the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level  and level  measurements and requires certain level  disclosures on a gross basis additionally the updates amend existing guidance to require a greater level of disaggregated information and more robust disclosures about valuation techniques and inputs to fair value measurements since the amended guidance requires only additional disclosures the adoption of the provisions effective january   will not impact the registrants financial position or results of operations the implementation of this guidance did not have a material impact on the registrants financial statements liquidity and capital resources registrant commenced operations on january   contributions were raised and redemptions paid through new members investments in and redemptions out of the aggregate trading vehicle through december   beginning january   individual members may redeem from the direct investment vehicle interests in registrant may be redeemed on a monthly basis subscriptions and redemptions second quarter  subscriptions of interests for the second quarter  were  redemptions of interests for the second quarter  were  second quarter  subscriptions of interests for the second quarter  were  redemptions of interests for the second quarter  were  liquidity a portion of registrants net assets has been held in cash which was used as margin for trading in commodities in as much as the sole business of registrant is to trade in commodities registrant continues to own such liquid assets to be used as margin the clearing broker and bank credit registrant with interest income on  of its average daily equity maintained in its accounts with the clearing broker and bank during each month at competitive interest rates the commodities contracts may be subject to periods of illiquidity because of market conditions regulatory considerations and other reasons for example commodity exchanges limit fluctuations in certain commodity futures contract prices during a single day by regulations referred to as daily limits during a single day no trades may be executed at prices beyond the daily limit once the price of a futures contract for a particular commodity has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit positions in the commodity can neither be taken nor liquidated unless traders are willing to effect trades at or within the limit commodity futures prices have occasionally moved the daily limit for several consecutive days with little or no trading such market conditions could prevent the registrant from promptly liquidating its commodity futures positions   table of contents since registrants business is to trade futures forward and options contracts its capital is at risk due to changes in the value of these contracts market risk or the inability of counterparties to perform under the terms of the contracts credit risk registrants exposure to market risk is influenced by a number of factors including the volatility of interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates the liquidity of the markets in which the contracts are traded and the relationships among the contracts held the inherent uncertainty of registrants speculative trading as well as the development of drastic market occurrences could result in losses considerably beyond registrants experience to date and could ultimately lead to a loss of all or substantially all of investors capital the managing member attempts to minimize these risks by requiring registrant and the trading advisor to abide by various trading limitations and policies which include limiting margin amounts trading only in liquid markets and permitting the use of stop loss provisions see note  of registrants  annual report for a further discussion on the credit and market risks associated with registrants futures forwards and option contracts there are no known material trends demands commitments events or uncertainties at the present time that are reasonably likely to result in registrants liquidity increasing or decreasing in a material way capital resources registrant does not intend to raise additional capital through the sale of interests offered or through any borrowing due to the nature of registrants business registrant does not contemplate making capital expenditures registrant does not have nor does it expect to have any capital assets redemptions exchanges and sales of interests in the future will affect the amount of funds available for investments in futures interests in subsequent periods it is not possible to estimate the amount and therefore the impact of future inflows and outflows of interests there are no known material trends favorable or unfavorable that would affect nor any expected material changes to registrants capital resource arrangements at the present time market overview following is a market overview for second quarter  and second quarter  second quarter  the second quarter of  was volatile in the financial markets although risk assets ended the quarter not too far from where they began the early part of the quarter saw the global economy carrying the momentum from the first quarter however the last two months of the quarter were marked by a slew of generally disappointing economic data from around the world while political tensions in the middle east and north africa faded from the headlines markets were roiled by another episode of the unfolding eurozone drama toward the end of the quarter an th hour bailout of greece sparked a powerful rally in equities us gdp growth decelerated in the first quarter to a disappointing  annual rate to date the data released for the second quarter indicate no reacceleration in the gdp growth moreover the hopes for a robust increase in employment that were spurred by the first quarters rise in hiring activity were belied as job growth fizzled and the unemployment rate climbed back above the  mark the housing market remained in the doldrums however oil prices fell toward the end of the quarter providing relief for consumers and stoked hopes of acceleration in consumer spending in the second half interest rates treasuries rallied across the curve as confidence in the economic recovery faltered and concerns about eurozone fueled safe haven demand the year yield decreased by  basis points to end the quarter at  at one point in the quarter the year yield had fallen well below the  level for the first time since november  the year yield also declined by  basis points the year note rallied even more with the yield falling by  basis points thus the yield curve from the  year to the  year steepened however the shortend of the curve flattened as the year yield fell only by  basis points the fed kept rates unchanged throughout the quarter and acknowledged that the economy and the labor markets had underperformed expectations the ecb was the most hawkish raising interest rates in april and becoming the first among the major central banks to do so in the recovery the boe continued to be divided over elevated inflation but the fragile and stalling economy prevented any action the bank of japan kept key rates unchanged throughout the quarter as well currencies the greenbacks slide contoured in the quarter although the rate of decline stabilized the dollar index dropped  falling to its lowest level since  notwithstanding the continued troubles over sovereign debt the euro ended the quarter up  against the dollar the british pound on the other hand was flat during the quarter reflecting the boes dovish stance the swiss franc surged  climbing to a new record level against the dollar as the spate of european deposits fleeing to switzerland boosted the franc the japanese yen appreciated  as the economy appeared to be putting the earthquake behind the australian and the canadian dollar continued to rally rising  and  respectively   table of contents indices after three consecutive quarterly gains the rally in us equities paused in the second quarter although the dow managed to eke out a gain of  for the quarter the performance across the sectors was mixed utilities and transportation posted solid gains while the sp® financial index slipped over  the sp ® and nasdaq® edged down approximately  and  respectively for the quarter european stocks outperformed us equities as well as global equities the stoxx  a broad measure of european equities gained  in dollar terms the cac edged down  while the ftse ® and dax® closed the quarter with gains of approximately  and  respectively asian markets were mixed japan bounced back from the earthquake induced drop of the previous quarter and the nikkei climbed up  however the hang seng fell  and the korean kospi® edged down  the australian all ordinaries index declined  energies commodities slipped for the first time in four quarters as middle east tensions eased crop acreage and inventories turned out higher and fears of a hard landing in china gained some credence while much of the commodity complex declined during the quarter sugar gold and copper were the notable exceptions crude fell  during the quarter and heating oil declined  gasoline bucked the trend rising  natural gas slipped further declining  as the market remained oversupplied metals silver ended the quarter down  but not before getting close to the oz mark gold continued its steady climb breaching the  mark and gaining  for the quarter base metals were mixed while copper recorded a gain of  aluminum nickel and zinc experienced losses of   and  respectively agriculturals softs and grains grains suffered from the strong usda report showing acreage and inventories well above analysts expectations wheat plunged  corn and soybeans fell  and  respectively cotton corrected from its all time high declining  the softs complex went against the trend in the broader agricultural complex with sugar coffee and cocoa all recording gains second quarter  the second quarter of  jolted the global financial markets the economy took a backseat as the escalating sovereign debt problems in some eurozone countries questions about the european banking system and renewed misgivings about the ultimate fate of the euro dominated the financial markets economic data was simply not strong enough to overcome the negative influence of european developments the tone of economic data deteriorated during the quarter consumer spending failed to follow up on that of the robust first quarter after starting the quarter on a bright note private payroll employment slipped back to a disappointing pace other labor market indicators also appeared to be stalling commodities had a mixed quarter which was surprising given the broad based risk aversion while industrial commodities were hurt by the fears surrounding global growth prospects agricultural commodities rallied thanks to strong emerging market demand and the unusually hot dry weather interest rates with all the stars lining up global financial turmoil disappointing us growth and the renewed threat of deflation us treasury bonds had their best quarter since the fourth quarter of  yields dropped below the  level for the first time since april  the federal reserve kept policy unchanged throughout the quarter and there were no indications of imminent change in interest rate policy the major federal reserve actions during the quarter were the reestablishment of the temporary dollar liquidity swaps with various central banks in order to contain the fallout from the eurozone crisis the european central bank the bank of england and the bank of japan kept key rates unchanged throughout the quarter as well the reserve bank of australia continued its rate hike cycle that began late in  as the economy and labor markets strengthened on the back of strong demand for commodities from its asian trading partners currencies the us dollar rally that began in december  reached a crescendo in the second quarter in addition to the euros weakness the dollar was buoyed by global risk aversion and flight to quality in the second quarter the us dollar index gained approximately  and climbed above  for the first time since april  the dollar appreciated smartly against the euro as the storm clouds quickly spread from greece to engulf portugal spain and ireland and threatened the very future of the european monetary union the euro finished the second quarter down approximately  against the dollar the british pound fared better declining  in the second quarter against the greenback the japanese yen not surprisingly rallied with the rising global risk aversion gaining  against the dollar the two currencies heavily influenced by commodities the australian and canadian dollars fell sharply despite solid economic data the australian and canadian dollars dropped  and  respectively against the us dollar   table of contents indices the strongest equity rally since the s hit a brick wall in the second quarter as stock prices suffered their first quarterly decline since the first quarter of  unlike in the first quarter robust earnings were not enough to overcome the eurozone jitters and growing fears of sovereign debt crisis around the developed world the losses were broadbased across most sectors the dow jones industrial average sp  and nasdaq fell approximately   and  respectively for the quarter european stocks weighed down by problems in greece lagged us equities although the german markets were an exception the stoxx  a broad measure of european equities declined approximately  in dollar terms although in euro terms it showed a smaller loss of  the cac ftse  and dax closed the quarter with losses of approximately   and  respectively asian markets were more mixed as the nikkei fell  and the hang seng declined  the korean kospi edged up  the australian all ordinaries index posted an  decline energies crude oil fell  on the back of macro risk aversion and softening freight data natural gas soared  reflecting the fact that at current prices it is an attractive substitute for other energy products heating oil ended the quarter with an approximate  loss reformulated gasoline followed crude and heating oil and declined  in the quarter metals gold registered a solid  gain during the quarter although the dollar remains the preferred safe haven the euros troubles appear to have supported gold the international communitys desire to diversify their reserves may be helping gold given the euro and the sterlings weakness silver lagged gold rising  but the performance was surprising given that base metals which often have a strong correlation to silver fell steeply copper aluminum and nickel ended the quarter with declines of   and  respectively agriculturals softs and grains agricultural commodities generally gained during the quarter coffee led the way with a  surge on the back of weak harvests in vietnam and central america sugar rebounded back from a steep
