murphy on march   at pm i think gulfport bought all of palomas acreage paloma is gone especially if they have changed the name and before this downturn is over someone else my owner your lease a lot of acreage is already up for sale all over the  state area ▶ reply permalink reply by renee e dorsey on march   at pm paloma partners iii llc has not changed its name  they just sold most of their ohio acreage to gulfport hess and aep utica httpwwwgasandoilmagcomgasoilgulfporte     now i signed with paloma and was expecting aep to have the leases at the last minute aep didnt happen  i ended up with xto  that is better for us anyway   ▶ reply permalink reply by terry giuliani on march   at pm renee im surrounded by two year old aep leases but was bought by gulfport buckeye they said they go by the name buckeye ▶ reply permalink reply by renee e dorsey on march   at pm probably a way for gulfport to keep track of which tracts they own i wonder if they added the hess acerage into that as well   i just know that paloma still exists in texas  here you go   httpwwwpalomaresourcescompartnerspalomapartnersiii     looks like they have a iv  now too   they have a good systemget a lot of leases and either drill or hold until someone bigger comes along  they were good to work with so i was pleased   gulfport tried too but they would not alter the lease any per my attorney    i hope it goes well for you terry   ▶ reply permalink reply by terry giuliani on march   at pm what surprised me was im  acres in steubenville township jefferson co and aep would not give me the  per acre to match the paloma offer aep said it was because i was on the steubenville side of the township line but paloma bought me in the middle of aep acre plus tracks i guess im the monkey in the middle ill
