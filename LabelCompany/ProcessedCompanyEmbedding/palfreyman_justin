of the river mauritius now hudson on the d of september they report that our people are in good spirit and live in peace the women also have borne some children there they have purchased the island manhattes from the indians for the value of 6 guilders it is  morgens in size about  acres they had all their grain sowed by the middle of may and reaped by the middle of august they sent samples of these summer grains wheat rye barley oats buckwheat canary seed beans and flax the cargo of the aforesaid ship is6 beaver skins½ otter skins6 otter skins mink skins lynx skins minks muskrat skinsmany oak timbers and nut wood herewith high and mighty lords be commended to the mercy of the almighty in amsterdam the th of november anno 66your high and mightinesses obedient p schaghentranslationnew yorks first exporthenry hudson probably considered his 6 voyage to new york a failure  he never found the quick water route to east asia he was hoping for but buried in an entry in a journal kept by robert juet hudsons first mate dutch merchants found something else that piqued their interest look closely at the entry for september  6there was after all money to be made in new yorkmany local indians seemed more than happy to trade animal pelts for knives pots guns alcohol and other manufactured goods meanwhile back in europe demand for products made from north american mammals epsecially the beaver was skyrocketing hats clothing and medicines made from north american animals particularly the beaver animal pelts especially beavers were the largest industry in early new amsterdam this letter which includes a listing of the cargo carried by a ship returning to amsterdam in 66 indicates the scale and importance of the early fur trade touch here to read the full translationotter skinsotter skinsmink skinslynx skinsminksmuskrat skinswhat valuable commodities are in the ships hold now its unclear if local indians really meant to sell manhattan island as we understand it today and dutch settlers certainly got a good deal but there is no doubt that beaver furs meant big money how did the first europeans in new york make money they didnt trade stocks they traded skins henry hudson came to new york looking for a faster route to the far east dutch merchants came back to set up a trading post where they could buy animal furs from local indians european traders prized one pelt above all the rest castor canadensis the north american beaver how did new yorks first export drive a fashion craze across the atlantic making a business out of beaverswhy were europeans so interested in beaver furswe know beavers like to live near fresh water running downhillthe socalled british headquarters map drawn by english military surveyors during the american revolution and currently located at the national archives in england shows the original natural landscape of manhattan british cartographers were looking for the best places to build fortifications to defend manhattan which they occupied throughout most of the revolutionary war luckily for us they also paid close attention to the locations of the islands original hills and streams but almost all of manhattan island has been leveled and built overhow can we know exactly where the hills and streams were beaver probabilitylocation of streams from the british headquarters map we can isolate the locations of manhattans original running streams and based on this data in addition to similar calculations about other natural elements that attract beavers  including for example high concentrations of aspen and alder trees  we can make a safe guess about the most likely locations of beaver habitats intromotivation demand for beaver skins in europe creates an opportunity to make moneyaction the beaver pelt tradeconclusion beavers are back a simple answerhats europeans produced and consumed massive amounts of beaver felt hats the soft under fur of the beaver was removed from the skins and the hairs formed into a sturdy felt using heat and pressure beaver felt could then be molded into a variety of styles depending on what was popular at the time three hundred years of beaver hat styles6s

lincolnat least one early observer thought beavers were so important that he proposed this design as the official city seal dutchnota dit waepen was een concept doch niet goet gevondenenglishnote this coat of arms was a draft and was not approved the directors of the dutch west india were less than impressed as this inscription indicates the answer a very old but very detailed mapvalue of the

itself would not last long europeans quickly realized that a wealth of pelts could be purchased from indians who trapped across the interior of the continent from new england to the great lakes the
