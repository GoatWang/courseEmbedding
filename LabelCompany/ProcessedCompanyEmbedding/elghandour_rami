turn the call over to rami rami elghandour thank you katie and thanks everyone for dialing in today for todays call i’ll start with reviewing our third quarter performance and operating highlights as well as providing additional color on our us launch andrew will follow with a deeper review of the third quarter financials and expectations for worldwide revenue gross margins and operating expenses for  then well open up the call for your questions nevros worldwide revenue for the third quarter was  million an increase of  as reported compared to the same period of the prior year us revenue was  million and international revenue was  million the latter representing an increase of  as reported and  in constant currency these results are driven by continued adoption and excitement for hf therapy we now estimate our us market share is approximately  as of the end of the third quarter of  with opportunities for further growth driven by the ongoing expansion of our outstanding sales organization and access to the broader us market to the launch of our paddle lead in  the rapid growth in our us share underscores that hf therapy is becoming the therapy of choice for leading physicians and at this community of clinically driven physicians will continue to shape the neuro modulation landscape for years to come with over one fullyear into our us launch we have gained meaningful insight from our customers and commercial organization which now allow us to better predict our us business as a result we are increasing and narrowing the fullyear  total revenue guidance to  million to  million as compared to our august  guidance of  to  million for the full year we remain ever focused on ensuring chronic pain patients have access to our clinically superior therapy hf therapy remains the only paresthesiafree scs therapy has demonstrated nearly twice the efficacy and responder rates as traditional scs and other new low frequency stimulation wave forms and is the only therapy to demonstrate clinical superiority to traditional scs our strategy of delivering clinically superior outcomes continues to serve us well driving both adoption and increased awareness and demand for our therapy at the core of our growth in a physician community that has demonstrated they are innovators and embracing new technology clinically driven in their search for improved outcomes and sophisticated in elevating the scs space by embracing level one clinical evidence we are still early in our controlled launch and over time expect hf therapy to be the marketleading scs therapy i have the opportunity to meet with clinicians in europe and the us throughout the third and continuing into the fourth quarter through these meetings it’s clear how far we have come since our launch last year the number of physicians that are interested in adopting hf therapy continues to grow and reflects the excitement our early adopters have generated due to the outcomes they have been able to deliver to their patients recently one of these pioneering us clinicians presented outcomes for nearly  patients treated with hf therapy within this practice since launch it’s these types of positive results and every day clinical practice that have established hf therapy in the us market and around the world finally with respect to our paddle lead we continue to be ontrack for a full launch in the first half of  as discussed on our last call as we have worked through our operational ramp we have identified a minor design improvement that will aid in the transition to fullscale manufacturing we have submitted this change to the fda and are simultaneously ramping manufacturing operations in preparation for the launch on the hiring front in the us we ended the third quarter with  hired and trained reps and that increase of  reps from the previous quarter count of  we have now exceeded our minimum hiring goal for the year and are continuing to hire into the fourth quarter two factors have driven us towards accelerated hiring first we have seen more rapid uptick in the us market due to many leading early adopters utilizing the therapy second due to the demonstrated ability to treat back pain we are finding that our territories have greater potential than the historical scs market data suggests as a function of this procedure density coupled with the uptick to date our reps have been quite busy in their accounts limiting their ability to broaden access to hf therapy to new physicians as a result we have worked earnestly over the past several months to add to our outstanding sales organization in order to ensure expanded access to hf therapy this concerted effort has reflected in our yeartodate hiring and we expect to continue hiring to keep up with the demand for the therapy internationally we ended the quarter with  sales reps trained and in the field and we continue to add field support as needed additionally we have continued investing in our commercial infrastructure internationally in order to drive further adoption of hf therapy worldwide transitioning to reimbursement we’re pleased to announce that we are now broadly covered by top national insurance providers in august we announced that cigna and certain blue cross blue shield regional plans published updated policies designating high frequency as investigational and experimental we believe these decisions failed to align with the clinical superiority of hf therapy which is backed by two twoyear published clinical studies the latest of which was published in the preeminent journal neurosurgery we have made positive progress in our dialog with commercial payers and in the third quarter cigna reversed its prior decision on the strength of our clinical evidence hf therapy is now fully covered for cigna beneficiaries we continue to work with certain blue cross blue shield regional plans to address their decisions and our continued effort to ensure broader access to this clinically superior therapy finally last week the  cms scs reimbursement rates were published the facility rates were increased or largely unchanged representing stability in the current reimbursement landscape medicare facility reimbursement for trials increased  in the hospital outpatient setting and  in the afc setting in the afc medicare facility reimbursement for permanent implants increased  for implants with percutaneous leads and  for implants with surgical leads in the hospital setting reimbursement was increased  for both percutaneous lead and surgical lead ipg implants nevro is recognized as a leader and innovator in neuro modulation due in large part to our investment in rigorous longterm studies in areas with unmet clinical needs in order to maintain our position and drive longterm growth of our business we continue to invest in scientific research and clinical evidence to develop new applications of our proprietary therapy in recognition of these efforts we recently learned that two hf therapy related abstracts were selected for presentation during the groundbreaking study portion of the plenary program at the th annual north american neuro modulation society meeting in january the first abstract featuring results from a prospective study on the application of hf therapy for the treatment of upper limb and neck pain will be presented during the groundbreaking clinical trial plenary session this will be the first time these study results will be presented publicly and i know the investigators of this study are honored by the recognition of nanms ph for their important work the second abstract detailing results from basic science research on  hertz stimulation will be presented during the groundbreaking basic science plenary session this study represents the latest work regarding the mechanism of action of hf therapy i’m excited by the progress of our pipeline and i look forward to discussing it in more details in  in closing i’m proud of our dedicated team and i’m excited about what we will continue to build together as we grow more and more people contribute to our mission and i know they embrace the opportunity ahead of us as much as i do i’m pleased with our progress in both our clinical and commercial operations as we continue to make decisions that we believe will drive longterm value it’s especially rewarding to know that our strategy of focusing on patient outcomes has proven successful both in our controlled us launch and continued international adoption through this focus we have built a foundation for the longterm adoption of hf therapy with our outstanding people and company culture we will find success by continuing to do the right thing and supporting the physicians and patients that depend on us it’s clear we have invigorated the scs market and i’m confident there is more we can do to improve the lives of many more patients in need and with that i’d like to turn the call over to andrew galligan our cfo for a more detailed review of our financials and guidance andrew andrew galligan thank you rami revenue for the three months ended september   was  million an increase of  yearoveryear on a reported basis this increase was primarily due to the continued success of the us launch of hf therapy us revenue was  million in the third quarter as we said on our previous earnings call industry results in the third quarter tend to be flat or down on a sequential basis due to seasonality we expected our growth to attenuate in the quarter but given that we’re still in the highgrowth stage of our launch revenues did grow sequentially in q in the us albeit at a slower rate than in previous quarters international revenue was up  to  million from  million during the same period of the prior year we achieved a constant currency growth rate of  going forward on this call all revenue growth rates will be stated on a constant currency basis europe had  yearoveryear growth for the quarter and australia had growth of  compared to the prior year quarter after the impact of our recent price increases taken into account actual unit shipments were down in australia due to some shortterm local factors we’re increasing our focus on local marketing reimbursement and clinical activities specific to the international markets to continue to drive broader adoption of hf therapy we continue to expect that due to constraints such as capitation and increasing market share in international markets our international growth will moderate we’ve seen this in the first three quarters of  and continue to expect a moderation of international growth rates in the future as we said in our previous earnings call due to seasonality and the summer months we expected a sequential decline in international revenue in q gross profit for the third quarter of  was  million or  gross margin as compared to  million or  gross margin in the same period of the prior year gross margins increased yearoveryear primarily due to fundamental cost improvements as we continue to grow revenue we additionally expect to expand gross margin by improving efficiency and further leveraging our manufacturing overhead operating expenses for the third quarter of  were  million an increase of  compared to the third quarter of  the increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by increased headcount and related personnel costs net loss from operations for the period was  million compared to  million for the third quarter of  and at the end of the third quarter of  we had  million in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments now on to some considerations regarding profitability this quarter our net operating loss was  million as compared to a loss from operations of  million in the second quarter our revenue growth is far surpassed expectations and we’re still ramping our rd spend as we get new clinical trials and development projects up and running we do not plan to slow down the spending and plan to robustly invest in future opportunities to drive innovation as a result when we do achieve profitability it may or may not persist in subsequent quarters in this transition we want to be clear that we’re focused on growing our markets and expanding the reach of our groundbreaking technology there are new markets where we can bring the power of hf therapy to patients and we intend to do so when faced with a choice between the bottomline and investing in the future of the company we intend to invest in the future the time will come when we focus on profitability but that time some distance away turning to our outlook we are increasing our worldwide revenue guidance for  and narrowing the guidance range we’re updating our guidance for the fiscal year  to be in the range of  million to  million up from our previous worldwide revenue guidance of  million to  million we’re still projecting productivity in the range of an average of  million to  million per rep after  to  months in the near term productivity continues to be positively impacted by the uptake of early adopter accounts over time we expect productivity to be more in line with our current guidance for gross margins in  we expect to end the year at approximately  absent any material writedowns of inventory as we continue our rapid production expansion this is an increase over our prior guidance of  due to our achieving fundamental cost improvements with regard to our operating expenses for  we now expect to end the year at approximately  million in operating expenses plus or minus a few million dollars this is a decrease from our prior guidance of  million to  million as our spending on clinical trials and development projects has lagged our expectations as rami outlined we also plan to continue hiring experienced sales representatives to support the rollout of hf therapy and back to you rami rami elghandour thanks andrew so that will conclude our prepared remarks for today blair please open up the call for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions the first question comes from the line of mike weinstein from jpmorgan your line is open mike weinstein good evening guys and first off i apologize im on my cell phone so sorry if its not a great connection but i was hoping you could talk about the sales force growth over the last six months obviously the business continues to grow very nicely but you increased the size of your sales force by  in the last six months so i’m interested in one for you to comment just on the aggressiveness of the adds obviously it suggests a fair amount of enthusiasm for the outlook of the business but two talk a little bit about how youre managing that if you add that many reps over a short period of time its not always easy to manage through thanks rami elghandour thanks mike so happy to address both of those questions i think in terms of the as we call it the drive to add or the aggressiveness to add i think we’re obviously very pleased with the progress of the business thus far but we continue to hear and i know many on the investment community side who have done their own research and surveys have heard that there continues to be strong demand for hf therapy that we haven’t quite been able to meet just simply by not having enough boots on the ground to get there even in territories where we had boots on the ground i think it’s clear due to the rate of adoption of the therapy as well as just the efficacy in back pain and the ability for those physicians that are engaged with our therapy to treat many more of the patients it’s been hard for our existing sales force to really branch out and broaden access to the therapy so it’s really primarily driven by our desire to meet more and more of the demand in the united states we’ve obviously been in the market here for over a year and we certainly appreciate the patience of the physician community as we scale our sales force and try to do things the right way but we know that we have to continue to add in order to get this therapy in the hands of many more physicians to your next point dovetails are very nicely in which is how do we manage that well we still have a lot of control i mean we still interview every single person that comes through we have scaled the organization internally from a marketing training and otherwise to make sure that we have the appropriate support for the sales force to be successful so we are managing that very closely we certainly feel very comfortable about the rates that we’re growing and we as i said intend to continue to add in order to keep up with the demand in the market mike weinstein rami did the decisions by cigna which first off congratulations on getting that reversed but did cigna and the regional blues is that impacting you at all did it show up at all in the quarter or is that a nonissue rami elghandour it’s generally a nonissue look i would say on the margins there is some impact in certain territories more than others where you’re going to get some kind of residual impact but by and large it hasn’t been an issue and we’re certainly pleased that cigna ultimately recognized the strength of the evidence and we hope that the blues will follow soon enough mike weinstein okay and then maybe if i could sneak in two more europe was very strong this quarter but australia was lighter than it had been and you commented on some local factors maybe you could shed a little bit more light there and then the gross margins are ramping very quickly every quarter here and obviously operating spend we heard the commentary there and couldnt agree more in terms of investing in the business but you just want to update us on your thoughts on how gross margins scale from here now that youre approaching  or do you think gross margins ultimately reach for this company and how you think about longterm profitability and not the short term thanks andrew galligan thanks mike rami elghandour yes so with respect to australia look i think we’ve talked about it and we have significant share in that area with a couple of physicians having either travel or changing hospitals and kind of idiosyncratic issues like that and with the concentration of generally the way the markets are internationally and specifically australia there was some impact we think it’s obviously something we’re very confident in the australia business and our team and the ability to continue to grow there but there is definitely kind of a nearterm impact that we’re enhanced to work through i’ll ask andrew to address the margin question andrew galligan yes mike so obviously i think we’ve got to a volume player we’ve got some good cost improvements that now has worked its way through the system so we were seeing them in the fields i don’t think we’re prepared to change our longterm view of low to mids for gross margin and the bottom line we’ve always guided towards mids we can guess operating income we’re pleased of where we are but not ready to change anything thanks mike operator the next question comes from the line of david lewis from morgan stanley your line is open david lewis good morning i’m sorry good afternoon a few quick questions so just coming back to mikes question here on revenue per rep rami so interesting dynamics for investors i think this afternoon you have revenue per rep was down a little bit sequentially but yet youre adding very aggressively into reps i guess a couple questions is this more about market expansion now rami versus actually supporting the existing physicians you’ve already adopted and i guess for andrew just thinking sequentially here sga has been roughly flattish sequentially even though youre hiring very aggressively is that just timing dynamic rami elghandour sure yes to answer your first question yes you’re absolutely right david this is more about expanding access to the therapy as i’ve said and we certainly have plenty of room for growth there our footprint remains quite small in the united states market and we know that’s something we have to continue to address andrew galligan yes and as for the revenue per rep coming down a little sequentially i think we’re pretty clear of it longterm we expect  million to  million so that also is fairly a surprise to us the other question on… david lewis just spending andrew obviously a lot of aggressive hiring but the sga was relatively flat sequentially was it timing andrew galligan yes it’s deferred timing people actually come on board david lewis okay and just a couple more rami heading into next year it was nice to see the paddle lead timing is on track for ‘ how are you thinking about paddle lead obviously you have one competitor who has a dramatic outsize exposure to paddle leads they have a new therapy which recently got a superior label theyre also talking a lot about their primary cell versus your rechargeable device how are you feeling about the ability to take share with the paddle lead and expand your market opportunity in light of some of these competitive changes with one of your competitors rami elghandour yes our view on that despite those developments that you mentioned our view on the paddle launch is unchanged we feel very good about our ability to take share in that segment of the market we know that there is demand there and we look forward to meeting it david lewis okay rami just lastly clinically i guess you werent expecting any upper extremity data this early certainly not at nanms how are you thinking about timing for a us id perhaps a little too early but we werent thinking us id for upper extremity for at least two more years should we take this early data syndication that we could see upper extremities trials moving forward earlier than expected and ill jump back in queue thanks guys rami elghandour thanks david at this point we’re not going to comment on the regulatory strategy we’re certainly very excited about the data and very excited those investigators will get to present it in that groundbreaking session but we’ll talk about the regulatory strategy and timelines in the future operator your next question comes from the line of bob hopkins from bank of america your line is open bob hopkins thank you can you hear me okay rami elghandour yes andrew galligan hi bob bob hopkins great great good afternoon so just a couple of followup questions here i was wondering if you wouldnt mind quantifying the issue in australia and how much it impacted you this quarter or was that a couple million dollars or was it less and does that get fixed in q just curious if you could clarify australia andrew galligan it’s a very small part of our overall market so yes we’re talking about a few million a couple of million dollars here and so one of those things are australia is a very concentrated market like most international markets and so it only takes one or two doctors to actually be doing something different like taking a very long vacation or changing their practice to actually impact you and it usually takes a couple of quarters to work its way through and the main factor there is despite all of those perpetuations and the underlying units we actually grew revenue in that market rami elghandour and just want to clarify something that andrew said it was important the reason it takes a couple of quarters to work through is because of the way our business works so when they go back to practice they have to rebuild their pipeline and they have to build through their implants so in fact when you have a quarter kind of perturbation it doesn’t necessarily resolve immediately it starts to resolve but it’s not wholly made up of second quarter just because of the way the pipeline kind of works on our business bob hopkins okay and then just two other quantitative followups to that andrew you mentioned a few times ous growth was slow thats obvious that larger numbers and faster growth rates but i was wondering given your emphasis from where you sit today is there a decent way you would advise us to think about the ous growth prospects for the company as we look forward and then a little bit more shorter term i just wanted to ask about the implied q guidance for the fourth quarter because it suggested the midpoint maybe somewhere in the neighborhood of  sequential growth was there anything going on in the fourth quarter thats worth noting about it seems like thats maybe a conservative estimate for q so just wanted to chat a little bit more about longer term ous growth and the fourth quarter guide andrew galligan sure i think we’ve been saying for quite some time but international is slowing down as a function of just the underlying dynamic for those markets and the fact that we have such large shares we think it’s harder and harder to actually grow them so we are seeing the slowdown there is no question about it and then part of it i think really is and we’ve said that in today’s script which is to actually build our international markets now we’re actually going to have to move beyond having a sales focused organization to having a much broader organization on the ground there that’s working on local reimbursement issues local clinical trials and local marketing that’s really specific to the individual markets i think to guess the next stage of growth when you do an increased sophistication of resources on the ground in our international markets and with regard to q guide we really do tend to guide towards what we believe is achievable and that’s really how we set guidance and i think we have lot better than we have now and there are fewer uncertainties than there were earlier this year and we believe we’re really homing in our guidance much better nowadays bob hopkins okay thank you very much rami elghandour thanks bob operator your next question comes from the line of danielle antalffy from leerink partners your line is open danielle antalffy thanks so much good afternoon guys and thanks for taking the questions you have a competitor thats going to be releasing their own highfrequency clinical trial data i guess actually not at nanms what were hearing is theyll be discussing it on their q call im not asking you to speculate on what that means the data is but if you could walk us through now that that event is getting closer how you guys are preparing one way or the other if its negative or if its positive from a competitive perspective rami elghandour sure so i think first of all there is not a lot of clarity on when or if any data will be release so i think just like everybody else we’ll kind of see what happens there look we’re very confident obviously in our products in our portion of our market we demonstrated the superiority of hf therapy not just in terms of data but i think it’s reflected in our adoption to date so to the extent that there is other data that’s presented by another company that may or may not have had the experience with high frequency stimulation we’re not really sure that will weigh very much on the market and the other thing that i’ve said and i’ll repeat again is that we have invested a lot of time and money and infrastructure and people into building this company to what it is and we very much plan on defending our intellectual property really vigorously if the path lines up for us danielle antalffy okay great thanks so much and then again from a competitive perspective you do now have a competitor that got their first product approved with a superiority label just wondering what youre seeing from them specifically from a counter detailing or competitive perspective if youre seeing them yet at all and then any changes in competitive counter detailing this quarter versus the last few since you first launched thanks so much rami elghandour thanks danielle so i think as everybody knows we don’t really like to talk about our competition however i think i’ll go into more detail on this because i think some clarification is required i’ll certainly address this question just based on the evidence presented in the sunburst study and as detailed in their fda disclosures the whole premise of this burst question claiming superiority is to effectively draft on the branding of hf therapy first our superiority claim is based on superiority and responder rates vast cores and functional outcomes at multiple time points and across all primary and secondary endpoints conversely burst ran only two superiority tests and failed one of the two the one failed test was done in a similar manner to how hf superior test was performed so the superiority effectively which has been referenced a couple of times on this call today is effectively due to technical difficulty they were not superior in response rates and functionality or across group comparisons looking at the underlying data i think it gives a little bit more clarity for example if you look at responder rates hf has responder rates in the s burst and st jude are in the s and traditional scs historically based on published evidence is in the s and s so i think that kind of gives you an idea of that comparison between therapies because this comparison kind of comes up a lot however they do have strong marketing programs and i’m sure they’re going to push burst as a clinically meaningful option but i think anyone who digs deeper i think the evidence kind of speaks for itself and further we ultimately believe the difference between the therapists will be evident to the physicians operator the next question comes from the line of dave troncalli from jmp securities your line is open dave troncalli thanks i was just wondering if you could maybe provide a little additional color on the clinical spending i think you said it lagged your expectations so what other areas were you looking to start on and is it just a timing issue i imagine andrew galligan yes thanks clinical trials is all about how fast you can get on setup and also then the pace at which patients go through the trial so it really is a lot of it didn’t say timing issue on the number of patients through the trials but also there were clearly some clinical trials that we expected to have up and running by now that aren’t it takes longer to get through efficacy approval doctor’s site signed up financial agreements etcetera etcetera it just takes longer than we are hoping dave troncalli i guess the flip side the good news is the markets that youre going after are large enough to that shouldnt be an issue at least from our point of view but the other quick one i would have is the upper limb and neck market do you have an estimate of the size of that today rami elghandour well we’re going to talk more about our pipeline in  so we’re not ready to talk about it yet dave troncalli okay thanks rami elghandour thanks dave operator the next question comes from the line of joanne wuensch from bmo capital markets your line is open joanne wuensch can i bug you for a little bit more specificity on the pipeline rami elghandour yes do that joanne wuensch youve got some data coming out in january we all love what youre doing here in back and leg but i mean clearly theres other things that youre coming up upon how should we think about it or when will you start sharing it rami elghandour i think we’ve consistently said that there is maybe i can provide some more detail joanne just in terms of the process so there were couple of different data points that we’re looking at here i think certainly there is the evidence that we get from these studies the enrollment there is the aspect of regulatory strategy which a number of these indications were continuing to work through and then there is the kind of the market research aspects which informs what the best approach to the market and market size is while obviously we’ve announced and we’re very excited about this data being presented in january a number of these other process points are in the middle of and working through once we have kind of a broader view we’re certainly going to be happy and excited to share joanne wuensch okay and as a second question could you remind us of the size of the paddle lead market and how you approach taking share in that segment of the market opportunity thank you rami elghandour sure thanks joanne we believe that the paddle is comprised about  plus or minus  of the us market the way we go after that is really on a high level really no different than the way we’ve approached the rest of the market there are physicians who primarily prefer to use paddle leads and they’re part of a lot of the territories we’re in today some of them we’re willing and have use percutaneously its fact just the therapy up until this point but many others just prefer to stay with the paddle so it will be an opportunity for us to more broadly engage that physician community and just to be clear it doesn’t require different or a new sales force it’s just a function of continuing to expand our existing sales organization or provide access to therapy once this particular product is available joanne wuensch thank you rami elghandour thanks joanne operator the next question comes from the line of larry biegelsen from wells fargo your line is open larry biegelsen hi guys good afternoon thanks for taking the questions a couple clarification questions on the again upper limb and neck trial thats off label today correct its the other indication that youre studying the extremity trial thats on label so upper limb and neck is technically off label is that correct rami rami elghandour neck pain is offlabel limb as our indication is pain of the trunk and limbs is generally considered onlabel larry biegelsen so with this data thats positive youd be able to promote that data rami elghandour if the data is positive you can certainly based on our existing labeling we believe treat limb pain however the other notable thing in this particular market is reimbursement the upper limb and that does not broadly cover so that’s another kind of hurdle that has to be worked in larry biegelsen and then on the paddle lead have you refiled it yet and is that more of like q or q launch and i did have one more question rami elghandour we have submitted to fda given obviously we’re working through something with fda we haven’t specified specifically if it’s q or q for exactly that reason so i think we’ll work through that larry biegelsen okay fair enough and then on the guidance just kind of a twopart back to bobs question about your sequential the guidance implies about  to  sequentially if i look back the markets been up about  to  on a worldwide basis in q so any commentary on if youre expecting the market to slow or anything like that because obviously we can see your guidance and we can see what the markets done sequentially and just lastly andrew any opportunity here to comment on  just puts and takes or color commentary to make sure that people are kind of on the right track thanks for taking the questions guys andrew galligan larry so we’re not ready to talk about  i think that’s too early to really get involved in my conversation going back to  we’ve always given what we believe is conservative guidance its solid guidance and they’re numbers that we believe that we can achieve rami elghandour as far as i think it is worth clarifying i think if you look at as far as the third quarter i think if you look at our competitors they’re generally flat to down this quarter and we obviously grew sequentially so i think there is a little bit of a clarification there where there is a look at yearoveryear growth for our competitors but sequential growth for us i think if you look at every one from a sequential growth view you’ll see that their numbers were up  million or  million over much larger denominators but with the additions of new products whether those are acquisitions or etcetera that inherently are growing which implies that there is actually a sequential decline likely in their core scs businesses but i think that’s kind of the commentary i’ll make on q on q i think we have a reputation for giving for being conservative and we certainly are confident in the business we also are trying to as we learn more to try to be more active so we’re certainly trying to balance that and but we certainly want to make sure that it’s clear that we’re very comfortable with our business going into the fourth quarter operator the next question comes from the line of margaret kaczor from william blair your line is open margaret kaczor hi good afternoon guys so the first question for me is on us territories i think you guys referenced towards the beginning of the commentary that youve seen greater potential i guess on the historical scs market suggested and i think you referenced that that was due to back pain so is there any details that you can give us in terms of how many more patients per account youre seeing are you seeing more new accounts and is it certain geographies or across the board nationally andrew galligan that’s a good question margaret i think our comments apply pretty much broadly i mean there is going to be variability as to the extent of the growth driven in any given geography but i think it’s fair to say that physicians that already have back pain patients that they’ve now been able to treat and those who embrace the therapy certainly see utility in that patient population margaret kaczor and to follow up on that i guess is that twice as many patients that these guys are seeing or treating and then as you look at your reps and sales rep productivity youve hired a few reps maybe from your competitors how does their productivity at nevro compare to what theyve seen maybe at their respective shops before you guys rami elghandour sure yes i mean i think i’ve said before on the first part of the question that we believe that both the back pain patients are multiple existing scs patient population so i think i don’t want to put a specific number on it but there is certainly ample room for growth from a productivity perspective i’ll start and maybe andrew can comment to it i think the biggest difference that we see there are two differences that we see in terms of our productivity one is that the magnitude of productivity is higher certainly but even more importantly the acceleration or the pace at which they get to that part of giving number is probably the biggest difference between us and traditional standalone offstandard to maybe standalone andrew galligan yes so when you look at competitive reps for those reps that really have to go out and build a new territory there aren’t really that many of them those competitor reps in territories which are already sizeable and it actually takes them many many years to get up to a  million to  million type run rate which is a really good territory i think for many of our competitors so it takes them much longer time to get up that lateral and by and large that’s kind of our average productivity so i think we get to our we have higher productivity and we get there a lot faster  to  months margaret kaczor great and then if i could sneak one more in in terms of  without obviously going into details on your expectations what do you think is a bigger impact on your growth is it going to be hiring more and more new reps or maybe going after the paddle lead or i guess do the two go handinhand thank you andrew galligan we follow by reps i mean we don’t i think we need to emphasize more there are no products dropped at a hospital i mean we actually have to be or we have to program patients so that revenue is really driven by number of people in the field without those people in the field you can’t have the revenue you cannot drop product off at the hospital so the main driver of our business is hiring reps rami elghandour having said that there are certainly territories that are overwhelmingly paddled i think is much sense to have reps in theory than it will once we have all available so that will certainly be a growth driver as well but underlying as andrew said is the people without the people the product itself isn’t going to solve a lot operator the next question comes from the line of brooks west from piper jaffray your line is open brooks west hi thanks can you hear me rami elghandour yes hi brooks andrew galligan yes brooks west great just a couple of clarifications at this point guys andrew on the gross margin guidance you said you expect to end the year at approximately  is that  for q or is that a full year number or is that a q number andrew galligan that’s a q number brooks west okay thats what i thought and then you gave your share assumption for the us market at about  can you update us on where you think your share is in europe and australia andrew galligan it’s really as you know there is rather some data in australia there is no great data in europe at all we think roughly we have about a third of the market brooks west about a third in each of those territories andrew galligan up and down around that but overall probably if you take them all together probably about a third brooks west okay thats helpful and then just last for me is there any other major reimbursement hurdles from a coverage standpoint or an experimental decision standpoint i know youre working through some of the blues but anything else out there that youre working on thats meaningful that we should be aware of rami elghandour no we’re just working through the blues at this point brooks west perfect thanks guys rami elghandour thanks brooks operator and your last question is from the line of suraj kalia from northland securities your line is open suraj kalia good afternoon everyone thank you for taking my questions so rami i know on the upper limb a lot of questions have been asked let me ask some more highlevel question does the funnel for upper limb and neck work the same way as the lowerback and leg pain by that i mean just the algorithm of how things are done on these patients and how they land up with scs is the algorithm the same rami elghandour it’s somewhat similar suraj i think there is probably a lower failed surgical component but overall they are generally viewed as the second kind of largest population seen by this specialty but they tend to have lower rates of failed surgery relative to the existing market suraj kalia fair enough and understandably i guess you dont want to give specifics i would get that but rami based on what youll have seen so far in the us launch can you directionally characterize for us what your percent of initial implants are “de novo” patients or other failed scs patients rami elghandour they are overwhelming de novo patients suraj kalia de novo okay and andrew one final thing the comps for reps do they change after year one or do they stay the same or do the metrics change just working the rep productivity numbers and curious if there any net drop offs and is that due to comp or any color there would be great thank you for taking my questions andrew galligan okay and the  million to  million is kind of the peak at that point they pretty much run out of time because again they actually have to be in the or so they have to do the patient educations the programming for the files the implants help on insurance etcetera so they really can get to  million to  million a year and then they’re kind of there i think that’s it operator there are no further questions at this time i’ll turn the call back over to the presenters for closing remarks rami elghandour thanks blair and thanks again everyone for joining our call today we

near and longterm success by expanding access to hf therapy to the launch of our surpass surgical lead scaling our commercial organization and investing in leveraging our proprietary platform to investigate new clinical applications that said our us revenue in the first quarter fall short of our expectations we believe weve identified the contributing factors which ill talk about shortly and which we are in the process of addressing we remain confident in our business and are reiterating our worldwide revenue guidance for the fullyear  earlier this afternoon we reported worldwide revenue for the first quarter of  million an increase of  as reported compared to the same period of the prior year us revenue for the quarter was  million an increase of  first quarter international revenue was  million representing an increase of  on a constant currency basis these results were driven by the continued global adoption of hf therapy in the us we saw strong growth from our most recent classes of hires to reach their fourth and fifth quarters in the field however our q results were affected by greater than expected seasonality coupled with growing pains relating to scaling specifically the expansion of our sales management team did not keep pace relative to the rapid growth rates weve experienced we believe this impacted our execution in q particularly with respect to business planning and customer engagement in some of our existing accounts we have taken steps to improve execution as we scale our sales organization in order to broaden access the hf therapy over the past two quarters weve added to our sales management team with our expanded team we are resourced to maintain focused on our existing accounts as we scale as always we are focused on continuous improvement and will continue to strengthen and support our team our us sales team has done a tremendous job of driving rapid market adoption and we remain confident in our team and our business both this year as well as over the longterm on the hiring front in the us we ended the first quarter with  hired and trained reps and net increase of  reps from the previous quarter count of  we have doubled down on our hiring efforts and are pleased to have been able to invest in the expansion of our us sales force as we work towards covering the broader us market this new class of hires positions us for success in  and beyond internationally we have continued to build upon our strong share position in our key markets underpinning our strengths in q with strong performances in europe and australia this performance is a credit to our outstanding sales organization which continues to demonstrate the longterm benefits of our therapy we ended the quarter with  international sales reps trained and in the field and we continue to invest in our team as needed to support our growth with respect to the launch of our surpassed surgical leads we are pleased to announce that after receiving approval for the pma supplement in january our controlled launch is underway to date feedback on our surgical lead has been very positive most notably with respect to reproducing the clinically superior outcomes of hf therapy on the operations front we believe the designs changed successfully address the yield issues we experienced and we are continuing to ramp inventory to meet demand in the market from a market perspective our sales team continues to be busy engaging in the account opening and onboarding process which was a particular area of focus for us in q we are excited to broaden access to hf therapy to the surgeon community and ive been very pleased with our early experience thus far on the topic of rd our product pipeline is progressing in line with our plans we are working on a number of product enhancements that we believe will strengthen our portfolio and business first we are planning to launch a new smaller profile ipg in the next twelve months we believe this new product will provide a number of benefits to our patients customers and business additionally we continue to pursue mri compatibility for our system enhanced mri compatibility for our system as a reminder our product currently supports mri compatibility for the head and extremities for t and t machines which retroactively apply to every patients implanted with nevro system a significant advantage to our approach on the clinical research front building on early evidence suggesting that painful diabetic neuropathies can be effectively treated with hf therapy we are initiating a larger randomized controlled trial to generate level one evidence in support of this patient population we view this as a potentially meaningful opportunity and are excited to again lead the field in pursuing the evidence needed to advance patient care while the scs market is increasingly competitively driven by studies that focus on product feature differentiation we continue to commit resources to expand and enhance patient care through meaningful clinical evidence and new indications as you recall promising early preliminary results were presented at the  nans meeting in january stay tune for an update on our progress with this initiative with respect to study design and timelines in terms of reimbursement we have positive news to report blue cross blue shield has updated their evidence review on scs and concluded that high frequency scs results in a meaningful improvement in that health outcomes this is a reflection of the strength of our clinical evidence base as well as the efforts of our market access team with this update blue cross is one of the largest policy makers in us now considers hf therapy to be a technology that can benefit patients and that is therefore appropriate for regional plans to reimburse for the technology as you may recall a small number of blue cross regional plans did not cover hf therapy we have already heard from some of those plans that they plan on adopting the updated policy starting june  and we are working to ensure the small number of remaining regional plans do so as quickly as possible we are pleased that hf therapy and the clinical evidencebased supporting it have been validated by another independent agency and that it is covered by all major commercial payers in us providing more patients access to this clinically superior therapy in closing i remain excited about the impact of hf therapy on the patients we serve and the physicians we support it is clear we have reinvigorated the scs market and i remain confident in our ability to establish a global leadership position in the space our team has built a strong foundation over the last two years in this short time we have continued to grow internationally establish the substantial us business and scale their organization in a way that means teams are entrepreneurial culture and values additionally we have worked towards delivering on the promise of neuromodulation by investing in meaningful new indications which we believe will continue to set us apart in the field we will lead by delivering a superior therapy that truly makes a difference in patients lives across a range of meaningful indications i know the talented nevro team is up to the challenge of building on the great foundation we have established and reaching new highs and with that id like to turn the call over to andrew galligan our cfo for a more detailed review of our financials andrew andrew galligan thank you rami revenue for the three months ended march   was  million an increase of  yearoveryear on a reported basis this increase was primarily due to the continued global adoption of hf therapy us revenue in the first quarter was  million up  from  during the same of period of prior year back in february we forecasted that on a sequential basis our us revenue for the first quarter would be more in line with the fourth quarter  however as rami noted our us revenue for the quarter came in below our expectation international revenue was up   million or  million during the same period at the prior year this represents a constant currency growth rate of  both europe and australia did well in the quarter as weve previously stated we believe that the international market is subject to capitation constraints which will result in moderation of our international growth rates over time gross profit for the first quarter of  was  million or   gross margin as compared to  million or  gross margin in the same period of the prior year gross margins increased yearoveryear primarily due to fundamental cost improvements sequentially gross margins were down slightly due to an additional  million writedown of inventory but did not conform to our product requirements after that margins would have been in line with the fourth quarter operating expenses for the first quarter of  were  million an increase of  compared to the first quarter of  the increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by scaling the organization for the increasing size of our business legal expense in connection with the boston scientific litigation was  million for the quarter net loss from operations for the period was  million compared to  million for the first quarter of  at the end of the first quarter of  we had  million in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investment turning to our outlook we are reiterating our worldwide revenue guidance for  we continue to anticipate worldwide revenue for  to be in the range of  million to  million as weve announced back in february and expect productivity in the range of an average of  million to  million per rep after  to  months for gross margin from  we still expect to the end the year as approximately  with progress towards this number during the year excluding any material writedowns of inventory with regard to our operating expenses for  we now expect to end the year as approximately  million to  million in operating expenses excluding litigation expense this is a  million increase over our previous guidance in february due in part to our plan to continue to scale our sales force and back to you rami rami elghandour thanks andrew so that will conclude our prepared remarks for today leandra please open up the call up for your questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of mike weinstein from jp morgan your line is open michael weinstein thank you and lets start if we can with the commentary just on the quarter as you are aware you came in generally in line with our expectations in the street but street was a bit more optimistic and you commented that us business didnt do as well as you are hoping this quarter so could you just spend a minute on why that was the case and then second could you share with us your thoughts going forward obviously youre still incredibly bullish based on the rep hires that you continue to do certainly no one was even close to taking to it higher end of the  reps this quarter so whats driving that thought process how much of a challenge is it to keep adding reps at the rate youve been adding over the last  months and then will go from there thanks rami elghandour great thanks mike for the question so i think let me start by saying the fundamentals in our business havent changed we remain very confident in our business both in the near and longterm but as i discussed there were some operational things that we have to work through so let me maybe build on that a little bit to provide a little bit more context sales management are core to execution i think we can all agree that management and leadership matters and we were shorthanded with respect to our sales management team which i think was also further magnified by our increased hiring of late new reps that we add for the company certainly need support in terms of building their territories but established territories as well need support with respect of adding additional targets continuing to open accounts bringing on clinical support and integrating that clinical support additionally sales management plays a pretty critical role in customer engagement there in the field every week and that layer of engagement with our customers is critical to our near and longterm success as a result that absence of management really puts a lot of undue burden on the field and i think certainly we saw that impact execution this past quarter our existing sales management team frankly did an admirable job when considering the hiring that they were able to produce as well as managing the overall scale of the business that grew very rapidly and weve really been working to address this particular challenge in the last two quarter and in fact weve nearly doubled our sales management team over that time period so weve got a great sales team we remain very confident in our business we dont see or believe that anything is fundamentally changed but we have to make sure that our team is well supported in their endeavors and i think we feel very good about where we are in terms of addressing this challenge at this point in time michael weinstein yes so let me ask the  if i listen to just the commentary just on sales management part of it is that youve gone through this last year the second wave of hiring as i think about it you added  to  reps in q q q now youve added  reps is part of the challenge getting all these new reps that youve hired in more youre recutting territories getting the territory settled and is part of it just getting these new reps who are new to scs of the productivity curve rami elghandour thats a great insightful question mike this really doesnt have anything to do per se with cutting territories i think weve talked about in the past that our territories are pretty down and where we felt like we werent going to be able to expand coverage in a timely fashion we have been adding to our sales team but this doesnt have to do with the overall just number of hires if you will the number of folks that each individual manager have to cover on top of hiring and top of customer engagement just ballooned to levels that were just supposed to manage we didnt see this coming i think effectively you have a couple different choices when youre faced with the situation want us to try to do both in parallel which is meaning fill in your management team as you continue to hire or to take a pause in terms of hiring and then fill in the management team and put in the hiring afterwards we certainly chose to do the former and i think thats the reflection of the strength of the managers that we did have in place but i think eventually that caused us in this particular quarter and the execution wasnt up to the level that we have come to expect and its principally in view and my belief that just came down to having people that were stretched to thing to be able to deliver on everything that we needed to deliver michael weinstein okay last couple questions so if we think about the paddle lead launch lets call it a baseball game are you still in the first inning of that launches is that the right way to think about it in terms of us seeing a benefit from them rami elghandour yes i think were just  just early first inning i would say i mean we spent a lot of time as you know opening accounts those are a longer term type of accounts to open because these are more than in hospitals primarily than in hospitals so were very early and very encouraged by the feedback that weve received as i mentioned i think our sales team is doing a great job of executing on this particular launch but we still have a long way to go here and a lot of opportunity ahead of us michael weinstein understood the second last question is one of the questions have read pass is that st jude had a very good quarters if you look at the sequential performance bostons us scs business i think was down about  sequentially but still a bit better than what industry was modeling the st jude business grew by our numbers about  sequentially that obviously theyre reflecting some benefit from the drg stimulation but on the pain stem business inand last had a good quarter is there any sense in your view that momentum has shipped is just anything in your and to be competitive issue recognizing that senza was trying to get out in front of your paddle lead launch as well rami elghandour i think its hard for us to comment on how their particular business is going i think as you mentioned theres a lot that was added to that portfolio which makes it a little bit harder for us to comment i think we saw the pure portfolio boston demonstrates the typical seasonality that you would expect to see in q so its hard to comment i think generally speaking my comment on competition is that its intensifying i think theres a reaction to our increasing success and the execution of our sales team and we see all sorts of things that whether its bulking or pricing or dissipative marketing or all sorts of different tactics employed in different areas of the country i dont know that i would hang my hat on that i think for us its weve got a lot that going for us in a very positive direction and i think we will continue to execute at a high level going forward michael weinstein understood thank you rami elghandour thanks mike operator your next question comes from the line of david lewis from morgan stanley your line is open david lewis good afternoon rami i just want to pick up on some of those last points so i guess the first thing youre talking a lot about middle management on this call but as i just think about the business rami it feels like and perhaps youre talking about the sales leadership but how much this is just you dont have enough reps it feels like in the earliest part of  you may have been under rep for an investment perspective i noticed youve added in the last two quarters more reps than you added in the prior three quarters so a lot of focus on management just sort of wondering is this just about not having enough reps to grow at the rate you can grow at rami elghandour i think david that sort of the underlying reason why we got  successfully were expecting flat revenue in q right is because we havent hired enough folks earlier on that we should have  where we would have expect it that kind of continue to grow sequentially so that sort of the underlying basis but thats not really the reason why we had this challenge in q right it is particularly related to this management challenge that i discussed so in a sense you can address your question specifically it would be both right that we were under staff in the reps department and we had this issue as well and that would be  that would argue why we came in both lower than and we guide at this one close place is that makes sense david lewis okay thats very helpful couple quick ones here revenues throughout this quarter was down yearonyear and i guess it just some that may seem surprising a lot of the fact that i want to hit and you have more reps so that would suppress revenue per rep but then you have paddle lead a little bit of contribution from uln postnand so could you just walk us through that the driving force there between things that are helping revenue per rep and things are working against it rami elghandour sure yes i think you hit me on the head david i think there are some things that are working towards in terms of new data i think the paddle will could potentially help but again were very very early innings there but i think the reality is we continue to talk about that that we expect our productivity to be in the range that we described and i think there was a whole host of different reasons why that was overshooting at the beginning so the mix of reps thats changed over time to more nonscs reps which i think puts some weight on that and i think if you can imagine that our mix from a quartertoquarter basis my shift as well in terms of number of reps versus clinicals and thats sort of can weigh on it as well so theres all source of different puts and takes on that but overall the core message is still the same though we have expected productivity in this range we dont have data to suggest that it will be out of this range and the fact that were beating it was had a lot to do probably would be early launch days than anything else david lewis okay one last question for me is just two parts one we talked a lot about the sales related dynamics but you also mentioned seasonality i sort of come back to that is that selling days classic scs first quarter to first quarter dynamics or is that the timing of nans this year and then related to that maybe for andrew just second quarter expectations just so we can levels that expectations is a way to think about the second quarter similar rates of revenue on a percentage basis in the second quarter of  like we saw in the second quarter  ish percent which should be sort of in that mid s range for the second quarter and ill jump back in queue thanks so much andrew galligan well let me hit the guidance up front we dont want to actually give quarterly guidance and so not really prepared to go there at the moment so what i will say background is if you remember back to we had a perturbation in australia in q and it takes a quarter or two in this industry before you can turn anything around because you have this whole reestablishing files and the delay between trial and the actual implant which was the focus of the revenue so i mean i would say this is going to turn around overnight so it will have an impact on the second quarter david lewis in theres a seasonality rami anything specific about seasonality you wanted to call out rami elghandour i think nothing specific david primarily its the q to q right so we talked about this in the past and q positions both for move up  spend more doing permanent implants which also kind of robs from doing additional trials in the fourth quarter which generally carries over into the first quarter i think thats primarily im sure have some fact as well as being on the margin so but thats kind of what you would expand and i think has mike mentioned earlier thats likely with the selfannouncement david lewis thank you very much rami elghandour thanks david operator your next question comes from the line of bob hopkins from merrill lynch your line is open robert hopkins hi thanks can you hear me okay rami elghandour yes andrew galligan hi bob robert hopkins hey great good afternoon so when i look at then numbers for the us it seems like sort of the simplest way of saying this is that the market was very healthy in the first quarter but your market share in the first quarter was pretty flat relative to the fourth quarter and thats sort of the first time thats happened since the launch and i guess were trying to understand why share was flat sequentially because again the market seemed very healthy so i guess my question is just to be super specific on the issues that youre calling out in terms of the scaling issues was turnover in the rep or support base or was this really just a matter of scale just trying to understand kind of a little bit more what happened because on again in the face of it so it seems like some competitors launching products and that that hurt your ability to take share rami elghandour yes thanks for the question bob i think in terms of turnover that thats sort of  that was on different in this particular quarter so i think weve talked about that in the past but there was nothing there in particular that drove yes i think your assessment is right i think they just really came down to us to our execution weve been pretty deep on this and looked that it a bunch of different ways and also really came down to being stretched a bit thin and not you know pushing and getting the type of close that we typically expect that the end of any given quarter just didnt happen based on our prior experience and i think a lot of that is just being underresourced to make it happen robert hopkins it didnt seem like the competitors are doing anything different in the quarter they did have a couple new products obviously to launch but im just curious on the competitive front we really dont think theres anything different happening in this quarter rami elghandour no i think every quarter we see a new different attempts from the competition to be honest so there clearly were weve really disrupted this market and yes having some new products in the market im sure on the margin gets a little bit more share a voice maybe you got a little bit file here and there but you know we dont really view that again we want very deep and we certainly consider that as a possibility but now truthfully we dont really see that as a driving factor in this particular quarter again on the margin there have some  i think similar to for example the paddle launch right im sure on the margin we spent a lot of time opening accounts on paddle and those things on the margin might have some impact but overriding it was really execution or and then something we feel pretty confident robert hopkins okay and then lastly on a positive note i mean in this first quarter it looked like the us market actually accelerated a little bit and is now growing close to  obviously a year and a half ago this mark was fairly growing and now its growing its one of the best growth markets in all of medtech so as you guys look forward to this us market in the in the trends that are driving the acceleration in growth how sustainable do you think this highteens market growth is if we kind of hit at inflection point in terms of you know awareness and data new products i mean is this high teens market growth sustainable you think rami elghandour yes i mean we are confident and a doubledigit growth rate for some time given i think our confidence in our ability to continue to take share and grow the market i think that you know sort of the extra boost to that top end perhaps its being driven as you said by some new products that our competitors can talk about in our experience internationally is that those kind of get a bounce and then kind of fade because a lot of the followup through on those products is just not as good as our product right so i dont know that i am comfortable saying that i think this is going to be a  growth rate going forward but i am confident in a doubledigit growth rate because i can attest to what i believe will be able to contribute to it on a go forward basis robert hopkins great thanks very much for taking the questions rami elghandour thanks bob operator your next question comes from the line of danielle antalffy from leerink partners your line is open danielle antalffy good afternoon guys thanks so much for taking the question rami i was hoping you could give a little bit more color into i am sorry to harp on that but into the issues permanent execution perspective in the quarter just wondering did it had more to do with impact from getting new centers onboard or existing users using the last and i guess the followup there would be what gives you guys confidence that if it is the existing users using west so thats not suggestive of a longerterm trend here maybe they did from trialing and now theyre going back with these before or what have you rami elghandour sure thanks for the question danielle so i think as i mentioned in the script our newer classes of hiring are actually ramping up quite well so this was more of an established business challenge again there is some expected level of seasonality that we would have thought we would see and i think we certainly saw that i think what were saying is that that changes there was greater than just simply the seasonality i think the reason were confident in addressing it is that this isnt simply trials that were early on and went away i think this was a little bit of share shifting within accounts to a greater degree than we would have expected you have to remember that a lot of our accounts were not necessarily be only person in there and i think to the extent that we havent been as present in those accounts and i think has organized that weve been in the past and were going to see some impact to our business so thats the reason why were confident in addressing this we think that obviously with the updates both to our management team as well as our overall sales team where well be in better position to continue to grow in those accounts we have in the past danielle antalffy okay thats helpful i know you guys dont want to necessarily give the metric fair amount of trials from an implant ratio perspective but just curious if theres been any change on the types of metrics from your… rami elghandour we are comparable saying that that national average has fell where its been  there has been no change there danielle antalffy okay great thanks so much guys operator your next question comes from the line of dave troncalli from jmp securities your line is open dave troncalli thanks and then just as it relates to the management  the sales management did you guys commented all that i may have missed it but like how many folks you have and then sort of as you look at the understaffed issue i mean where you talking about five to  individuals and they already hired now so we feel good going forward just any other color you could give there rami elghandour sure thanks troncalli obviously we didnt give out a model where we give out how many regions we have but i will say it was a significant number ive said weve doubled it and yes we are at this point fully staffed so were just playing catch up over the last two quarters and i asked that we made a strategic decision to parallel have that with sales hiring and i think the net results obviously again were disappointed but will take where we are because i think it positions us for the future dave troncalli and then if any change that you noticed in the pricing or anything else from the quarter just to i guess take that off to table as well has a potential concern for folks rami elghandour sorry the question was related to pricing dave troncalli yes rami elghandour yes i think we  again weve seen that on the margin pricing bulking there are certainly  our competitors on any market are kind of taking a variety of steps to combat us so we definitely do see that but im not sure we can say that this is kind of like a national strategy or national kind of wave that were up against it certainly theres pockets of when were dealing with it dave troncalli thanks a lot rami elghandour thanks operator your next question comes from the line of joanne wuensch from bmo capital markets your line is open joanne wuensch thank you for taking the question just shift to the conversation a little bit we saw a slowdown in the international sales in the fourth quarter and weve been sort of thinking about market or markets would slow for some time and then here we go and rebound in the first quarter to  growth organic or x effects can you comment on what the rebound is or if there was anything in particular that helped the first quarter out outside the united states rami elghandour yes sure so i think interestingly in the fourth quarter we talked about first time that we actually saw a bit of a slowdown because the counts just running out of budget and i think that probably lowered the q international revenue which we talked about i think whats really has happened when you look at the numbers is that there was a rebound in those accounts in the first quarter as we try to catch up with the patients that they had been treated in the fourth quarter so thats one element of what happened and the other is as i mentioned earlier we have that perturbation in australia in the third quarter and we said it would take a couple of quarters for it to turn around in australia frankly is back on track so you have those combined in the first quarter because i think they gave us a pretty strong first quarter and then the caution there is i think in the first quarter in europe thats a one quarter bump and now theyre going to go back to kind of a more subdued growth rate and again australia is kind of back on track so i think there were two elements of why this quarter in particular was a little higher internationally that really dont continue for the rest of the year joanne wuensch okay and then one of the things that youve been spending more time in meetings talking about our other applications of the scs technology and clearly theres still a lot more to go and back in leg but can you sort of discuss some of the timelines for neck shoulder peripheral neuropathy thank you rami elghandour thanks joanne yes like  i think you highlighted that well were very excited about the potential to expand to a number of new applications and unfortunately i think as i mentioned before were still sorting through a lot of different things like regulatory strategy and clinical timelines so i think well reserve updating specific timelines with respect to those indications as we have more clarity around some of the road ahead of us in those fronts we are excited about this in next particular study that will be launching soon with respect to diabetic neuropathy and i will certainly update you and we have more information there joanne wuensch thank you operator your next question comes from the line of larry biegelsen from wells fargo your line is open larry biegelsen hey guys thanks for taking the question one of the pipeline one of the competition mri safe timing i mean im sorry if you mentioned it but the full body i did hear it timings and i was just curious on upper linen neck you showed good data nans but that was not one of the pivotal trials you mentioned earlier why no plan to do a pivotal trial there i thought you said you really need that to drive reimbursement and i had one followup thanks rami elghandour sure larry yes so we didnt mention a specific timeline with respect to mri i mention one with respect to the smaller profile ipg with mri i talked about that previously that were evaluating from a regulatory perspective and from a testing perspective what our approach looks like were gaining  increasing information and confidence in that program but we want to make sure that we have further clarity before we comment on the timeline with respect to uln we have won three different studies on that particular indication and i think were evaluating our regulatory and health economic perspective on that  based on that clinical set while assessing if and what type of further studies are needed i think also we want to prioritize  while we have a lot of resources to do important clinical work ultimately everything is limited and so we want to prioritize running larger we want to prioritize the studies that we want to potentially more meaningful indication and thats why you see the diabetic neuropathy study taking center stage here larry biegelsen thank you does that on the competition  the multipart question so given your success obviously the competition is its counter detailing you and so of couple of issues it would be helpful i think to hear you address one is the explant issue which is real or not hes in the market anecdotally and i just wanted to hear your perspective and the other is related to the question that i asked in the last call about the options that the competition is offering in for example first the data may not be as strong as your data but some positions like the optionality of tonic and burst that you mentioned on the last call me rami that you have something you can address that you just need to communicate that better so im wondering if you could help on this call maybe talk a little bit about more how youre trying to avoid being seen is kind of one size fits all so apologize for the multipart question but if you need to be repeatedly of that im happy to thanks rami rami elghandour thanks very much larry both relevant questions so lets address the explant point first i think this is where if you heard my reference earlier to deceptive marketing i believe this for very frankly could squarely there so we have one of our competitors and i which is abbott seems youre pushing the narrative that primary cell devices are somehow better for patients than rechargeable i think theres  let me first state that i believe this is a disservice to patients and physicians and frankly in our view raises the issue of patient safety theres a reason why the us market in the australian market have long shifted to rechargeable devices into patient benefits and improved safety around with fewer surgical interventions the only markets that really operate but primary cells are that way due to cost constraints particularly in europe so this is push for primary cells is really largely a deceptive marketing effort by shown selective data that purports to support the position that primary cell batteries have lower explant rates them rechargeable systems in a recent study that was shown in fact hf therapy have the lower to explant rate even though it was a study that was supported by abbott and i think the reality is given the increasing we reported a high proportion of primary cells that this particular company notes of having they will likely be on a path to have larger explant because the reality is that those devices have a relatively high explant rate to rechargeables in a pretty short period of time i think the kind of rep is up this sort of marketing i believe isnt good for the industry its not good for the space i think its continues to draw attention to something that actually frankly plagues the rest of the industry a heck of the lot more than it hits us i think clearly when you have a therapy that works  of the time and twoyears competing against therapies that work in the case of the st jude burst  of the time in three months and in case a traditional stem in the  range after two years one of those is going to have a lot worse explant rate than the others you guys can do the math so i think this was a misguided attempt by you know a competitor and ultimately i think we have a lot of great things to talk about so we generally tend to focus on talking about our products and companies that dont have a lot of great thank thought  with respect to the options again i think the same data is relevant our product works in a clinically superior way traditional scs therapy we do have a ways for optimize that therapy and as i talk about on the prior call there are we know we have to do a better job of communicating that and i think better than that we have to do a better job of explaining to the market and to our customers that the level of investment and that we make in patient care and followup which is unparalleled in the space i think a lot of our competitors have taken to borrowing or replicating our messaging but no other company actually commit the resources or as the product to followup through on delivering the best possible patient outcomes that population so i think we have certainly some work we can continue to do from a marketing perspective but i feel pretty strongly that were offering the very best product for patients in the market and will continue to do that and be successful as a result because larry biegelsen thanks for taking the questions operator your next question comes from the line of margaret kaczor from william blair your line is open margaret kaczor hi good afternoon guys first question for me is on the sales force i think you can probably have the largest sales force in the industry at this point you mentioned being fully staffed on the sales management side but you guys continue to expect a higher throughout the year and then in terms of the reps those are bringing on today how do they differ maybe from the original reps that were maybe more scs focused where maybe if learned something about the culture of the reps or hiring practices that could actually work out in your favor longterm rami elghandour thanks margaret so first of all we do not have the largest sales force in the space at least not yet i think obviously we expect to continue to grow and hope to grow into that position but were not there yet i think what we talked about in the past is that we want to hire the best fit for a particular market and either due to available talent or noncompete so other factors that may or may not always be somebody with prior scs experience i think what weve also found is that our sales team that dont have the sales experience of ramp have done fairly well they are just on a delayed cadence thats where the  to  months comes in relative to our scs trained reps so we feel pretty good about that weve obviously shifted the mix and some of that was early but some of that was playing out and so for… margaret kaczor and then in terms of the neurosurgeon accounts the surgical lead accounts how many of those  if you guys can share have you guys gotten into maybe how many hospitals have you guys gone into and gotten positive back opinions verses maybe the number that youre still waiting on or targeting and how does this compare the original hf launch rami elghandour so we dont get into the whole level of detail with respect to accounts i can just say that it was  it certainly a core focus and i think i mentioned in the past that this was fairly regional in the certain areas of the country where this is more prominent than others so we are going to keep plugging away i think the important thing to take into consideration here is this is not like a relaunch in a sense that we are starting from ground zero obviously got a fair amount of coverage around the country and so this becomes optionality in terms of when youre adding additional accounts now you can service a part of the market that we penetrate easily service but we are effectively constrained by people right so just having this doesnt necessarily just wind up creating instant greenfield that just gives us long range ability to continue to grow on certain territories margaret kaczor got it and then maybe one more on the smaller profile ipg have you guys file that with the fda and is it going to impact the life of the device at all thank you rami elghandour no comments on the first and you can actually technically comment on the second with the fda the term but the intent is no that it should not impact the life of the product but that certainly is where labeling comes in so we are hopeful margaret kaczor got it thanks rami elghandour thanks margaret operator your next question comes from the line of jason mills from canaccord genuity your line is open jason mills rami thanks for adding me to the call can you hear me okay rami elghandour yes andrew galligan hey jason jason mills andrew again thanks for adding me to the call so couple questions on the sales force maybe one other followup so as david mentioned earlier in the call your addition to the sales force for the last two quarters you said the only addition you have over the previous three almost four im just wondering given the complexion of your sales rep hires changed marginally and youve also talked a lot about of sales management on this call im wondering if the ramp algorithm if you will from sort of the initial hire to  productivity im wondering that algorithm has changed youve seen any major fluctuations in the past quarter rep and average rep from zero to  is way to  productivity andrew galligan im proud to take that jason so we are still predicting the  to  months and weve said that the nonscs people are on the higher end of that range and then as our mix has moved towards more scs people on average that productivity ramp will be a little bit later than it has been in the initial launch where it was mostly a scs people so i think there is some motivations there but frankly at this stage we have no data to suggest that its any different than our guidance at the moment which is  to  months  million to  million which is moving around in that range jason mills okay thats helpful and ultimately based on what youve seen thus far with the nonscs reps i know you commented earlier this year i dont know if it was an investor meeting or somewhere else that you saw some scs reps sort of lose focus maybe in the fourth quarter and you had to do some rep turnover wondering the nonscs rep whether youre seeing those reps or hiring folks that are perhaps a bit hungrier that are used to a bit more competitive landscape whether be in orthopedics or spine a little more competitive areas and whether or not that sort of  you have some optimism as it relates to how theyll climb the curve and integrate within the sales force andrew galligan so i think scs has historically been a very competitive industry i mean then abbott and st jude medtronic and boston were always fiercely competitive i dont think theres any difference in rest of ability to deal with competition between the nonscs and the scs its just the nonscs people come in and they need about a quarter to familiarize themselves with the industry but from there the real ability i think is about the same as the scs people is just we go we go for athletes of our kind of knowledge jason mills all right okay thats helpful i appreciate that and to earlier question on pricing you havent seen any  youve seen pockets of pricing and bundling competition im wondering if you could comment on your pricing whether or not these activities on the part of your competitors has caused anything notable in terms of your pricing on average across the country to find notable i know its difficult thing to do lets say anything north  or so an average over the course of the last  months as it relates to your product rami elghandour jason we find actually our pricing has been pretty stable and the  to  average over the nation i mean they are obviously different since regionally in that pricing but it all averages us  to  jason mills perfect last question for me weve talked to a few folks in different parts of the country maybe characterize them as sort of medium volume versus the highvolume and in certain geographies highvalue account to do a lot of hf therapy and then five miles away medium volume accounts havent had whenever rep calling them wondering is that sort of obviously thats an example being under rep but how do you think about the complexion companies of your account base at this point in time where you move only in the surprisingly but downstream to a lower volume accounts is the number of reps in your ability to cover the industry to expand or how should we think about the complexion of your counsel the next  to  months thanks for taking the question rami elghandour sure yes so let me clarify we dont actually target purely on volume and in fact some of our best accounts and best customers are lower or medium volume accounts that because if we have an account that is patient focused and buys into the therapy and the technology they can meaningfully grow that business by and really help a lot more patients by leveraging our platform so the size of a particular account isnt really the primary driver for adoption its just maybe happenstance in a particular areas where you look that we were still under service and i think that is just a function of the fact that theres still lot more opportunity to go after theres still a lot of places for us to go and it is really purely a function of having our feet on the street and as you can see we are working hard to address that but certainly trying to do that and in a way that were structured have the same sort of control that we had at the beginning of our launch operator your next question comes from the line of suraj kalia from northland securities your line is open suraj kalia good afternoon everyone thanks for taking my question rami most of my questions have been answered while ill just take two one can you give us the status of explants and the reason i ask is just trying to understand how youll manage the patients implanted with senza obviously there is a desire for solid growth but then you have to balance the outcomes in these patients also somewhat and not all comers are going to get senza what im trying to understand is how do you all train your reps you know to go out in the field and basically provide this balance so that we dont get poor outcomes once and as implanted thank you for taking my questions rami elghandour so i think this is not something that is unique to us all scs companies have a longterm followup component to their business i think the difference between us and everyone else is that one our therapy is more effective and more durable has been proven and clinical studies so that naturally provides a huge benefit in this particular component but i think two we have built and the support team that  and teams of folks that dont exist in other companies whose responsibility is to help with longerterm followup and i think the combination of those two things being more effective in severe therapy coupled with dedicated resources to address this particular challenge in scs as whats a lot us to be successful i think when you look at our international success where we continue to grow and now youre seven of our commercialization are there perturbations based on competitive stuff like the sort of messaging and any given quarter yes absolutely but over the longterm i think weve demonstrated that our model and our therapy can list and i think that test of time and thats what we look forward to proving here over the longterm to us as well suraj kalia thanks operator and there are no further questions at this time i will turn the call back over to the presenters rami elghandour thanks leandra and thanks everyone for joining the call today we sincerely appreciate your continued interest in nevro and look forward to our next progress
