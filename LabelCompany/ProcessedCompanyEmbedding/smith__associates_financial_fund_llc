based on an algorithm of qualitative and quantitative data rating thousands of wealth advisors with a minimum of seven years of experience ranking algorithm is based on quality of practice including telephone and inperson interviews client retention industry experience review of compliance records firm nominations and quantitative criteria including assets under management and revenue generated for their firms investment performance is not a criteria because client objectives and risk tolerances vary and advisors rarely have audited performance reports rankings are based on the opinions of shook research llc which does not receive compensation from the advisors or their firms in exchange for placement on the ranking research summary as of july   advisor nominations were received based on thresholds  advisors were invited to complete the online survey  advisors were interviewed by telephone  advisors were interviewed in person at the advisors location final list of the top  advisors was then compiled based upon the quantitative criteria raymond james is not affiliated with forbes or shook research llc this ranking is not indicative of future investment performance is not an endorsement and may not be representative of individual clients experience neither raymond james nor any of its financial advisors or ria firms pay a fee in exchange for this awardrating  barrons top  advisors  winners circle a barrons research organization produced the rankings based on data provided by over  individual advisors and their firms advisor data is confirmed via regulatory databases crosschecks with securities firms and conversations with individual advisors among the factors considered for the rankings are assets under management revenue that the advisors generate for their firms and the quality of their practices data points that relate to quality of practice include length of service designations held and services beyond investments offered including estates and trusts and an evaluation of each advisors regulatory record etc investment performance is not an explicit component because not all advisors have audited results and because performance figures often are influenced more by clients risk tolerance than by an advisors investment picking abilities the ranking may not be representative of any one clients experience is not an endorsement and is not

qualified advisers were then scored on six attributes aum aum growth rate compliance record experience industry certifications and online accessibility aum is the top factor accounting for roughly
