afternoon everyone thank you for joining us today well review recent progress and upcoming activities across our corporate priorities first building adcetris into a major global brand second advancing our pipeline notably sgncda and third investing in rd to enhance our leadership in antibodydrug conjugates total revenues in the first quarter were a record  million this includes adcetris net sales of  million up  compared to the first quarter of  although there were some seasonal factors that affected q sales were confident in our guidance for  adcetris net sales in the us and canada of  million to  million darren and todd will provide further context on our results globally our partner takeda continues to make progress in its territory adcetris was recently approved in two additional countries russia and egypt and its now commercially available in  countries worldwide ultimately our goal is to establish adcetris as the foundation of care for cdexpressing lymphomas which we are pursuing through three ongoing phase  trials alcanza echelon and echelon we expect topline data from alcanza in the third quarter of this year this is a refinement of our previous guidance that data would be available in the second half of  the phase  alcanza trial is in patients with cdexpressing cutaneous tcell lymphoma or ctcl who have relapsed following at least one prior systemic therapy patients were randomized to receive singleagent adcetris or physicians choice of either bexarotene or methotrexate the primary endpoint is the rate of objective response lasting at least four months this is a novel endpoint that was negotiated with fda under a special protocol assessment the alcanza trial represents a potential fourth indication for adcetris to address an unmet need among ctcl patients in later stages of their disease the echelon and echelon phase  studies are intended to redefine the way newlydiagnosed advanced hodgkin lymphoma and mature tcell lymphoma patients are treated we completed enrollment of the echelon trial late last year and are following patients for pfs events we expect topline data in the  to mid timeframe this has been a major effort over multiple years and we are excited to be approaching the data readout from this important trial our echelon trial continues to enroll up to  patients with cdexpressing untreated mature tcell lymphoma the unmet need in tcell lymphoma is significant as these are generally aggressive forms of nonhodgkin lymphoma that are currently underserved by existing chemotherapy regimens our goal is to complete accrual of echelon this year with topline data in the  to  timeframe beyond adcetris our lead clinical stage program is sgncda we are on track to advance a into a phase  registrational trial in frontline older patients with acute myeloid leukemia by the third quarter of this year the randomized phase  trial will compare a plus decitabine or azacitidine to either of these hypomethylating agents alone hmas are commonly used in the treatment of older aml patients but deliver modest benefit our planned phase  trial is based on encouraging phase  data presented at ash including a high response rate manageable tolerability profile and low early mortality we plan to present updated data from these patients as well as data from approximately  additional patients in an oral presentation at the european hematology association annual meeting in june because the cd target is broadly expressed in myeloid malignancies including aml and myelodysplastic syndrome we believe sgncda could have broad application during the first quarter we initiated a phase  trial of a plus azacitidine in previously untreated intermediate and highrisk mds patients we believe this may provide another compelling opportunity for a we also have an ongoing trial evaluating a in frontline younger aml patients in combination with the  regimen as well as a trial of a monotherapy in pre and postallogeneic transplant patients a is one of more than a dozen clinical and preclinical programs in our development pipeline these include sgncda which is advancing in two phase  trials one in relapsed dlbcl and another planned in frontline dlbcl and sgnliva which is in a phase  trial for metastatic breast cancer we anticipate generating data from several clinical stage programs during  that will showcase our pipeline for example at the upcoming asco annual meeting we will present the first clinical data from our phase  programs asgme and asgme these two programs are being codeveloped with astellas for patients with solid tumors primarily bladder cancer looking to the future and to our goal of becoming a global multiproduct company we have opened our european headquarters in switzerland this office will be the base for our european regulatory medical affairs clinical development market access and commercial operations for potential future products including a we recently hired chris thomson as vice president commercial planning to lead this effort chris has strong experience in setting up a europeanwide oncology business and has worked in business development marketing and portfolio management for several global pharma companies we are enthusiastic about the progress we are making with adcetris with the breadth of our pipeline and with our scientific innovation in empowered antibodies our strong financial position enables us to continue investing in the exciting opportunities in front of us at this point ill turn the call over to darren to discuss commercial activities next todd will discuss our financial results and then jonathan will highlight research and development including our strong showing at the recent aacr annual meeting darren darren s cline  executive vice president commercial thanks clay during the first quarter of  adcetris net sales were  million which was a  increase compared to q  this was a modest decrease from a strong fourth quarter several seasonal factors impacted our first quarter sales customer ordering patterns showed that some larger accounts accelerated adcetris purchases in late  ahead of actual patient demand additionally transplant registry data indicate that fewer transplants typically occur around the end of the year which would lead to fewer patients becoming eligible for adcetris consolidation in the aethera setting and lastly as todd will discuss there was an increase in gross to net during the quarter overall sales increased as the first quarter progressed and we remain confident in our fullyear sales guidance our commercial team continues to execute well on the launch of the adcetris indication in the aethera setting for the treatment of patients with classical hodgkin lymphoma at high risk of relapse following autologous stem cell transplant the fda added this indication to the label in august  the share of patients receiving adcetris in this setting has ramped up quickly following approval and we continue to see upside from share growth in  for posttransplant consolidation commercial planning is underway for a potential new adcetris indication in cdexpressing ctcl based on results of the alcanza trial this trial includes patients with primary cutaneous alcl and mycosis fungoides cutaneous alcl is closely related to systemic alcl while mf is more of a heterogeneous condition with varying cd expression one of our ongoing strategic initiatives is to educate physicians and pathologists on cd and ensure cd testing is available weve been working with ventana on a companion diagnostic that has been utilized in the alcanza clinical trial with the intent of it being approved by fda in parallel with approval of adcetris for this indication weve also begun planning for potential fda approval of adcetris in the frontline hodgkin lymphoma setting in anticipation of results from the echelon trial current work is focused on understanding payers and physicians perceptions of medical need in this setting were also developing the value story for adcetris in the frontline and shelf setting by assessing health economic implications of preventing a relapse and avoiding toxicity of bleomycin additionally we are finalizing a launch preparation plan that will guide our activities from now to the commercial launch period i look forward to updating you on the continued progress of our commercial activities in future calls now id like to turn the call over to todd to discuss our financial results todd e simpson  chief financial officer great thanks darren and thanks everyone for joining us on the call this afternoon we ended the first quarter with more than  million in cash and investments this along with our strong adcetris franchise and our collaborations enables us to continue executing on our strategy of extending the adcetris label broadening our a program and advancing our growing pipeline today ill summarize our financial results for the first quarter of  total revenues in the first quarter were a record  million up  from the first quarter of  this includes adcetris net sales of  million one of the factors impacting q net sales was an increase in gross to net discounts we saw a higher proportion of sales at sites eligible for government discounts primarily phs this occurred early in the quarter and resulted in part from account ordering patterns in late  as darren described royalty revenues were  million for the first quarter coming primarily from takedas international sales of adcetris this included a onetime  million sales milestone triggered by takeda surpassing  million in adcetris sales during  first quarter royalties also reflected the higher royalty tier reached at the end of last year the royalty rate paid by takeda begins in the midteens on the first  million in annual sales increases to the highteens between  million and  million and increases again to the lows above  million there is also a fourth royalty tier in the mids which we would expect to reach if we successfully expand into the frontline settings since the first quarter included a  million milestone and rates reset annually royalty revenue will decrease in the second quarter we continue to expect though that fullyear royalty revenues will be in the range of  million to  million collaboration revenues were  million in the first quarter consistent with our guidance these revenues are driven by amounts earned under our adcetris collaboration with takeda and our adc deals rd expenses were  million in the first quarter in line with our expectations of  million to  million for the full year in  the increase over the first quarter of  primarily reflects the investment being made on adcetris and expanded activities for a as we prepare to initiate the phase  trial sga expenses were  million for the quarter and in line with our guidance the decrease from  reflects legal costs that were incurred last year with that ill now turn the call over to jonathan jonathan drachman  chief medical officer evpresearch  development thanks todd good afternoon everyone as clay described our clinical team has been very productive with substantial effort underway on adcetris sgncda and our extensive pipeline programs data from the global phase  trials with adcetris will be reported starting with alcanza in the third quarter of this year followed by echelon and echelon readouts during  or  we and others continue to generate interesting data about the use of adcetris in patients with cdpositive lymphomas previously presented data in hodgkin lymphoma using adcetris in frontline older patients and in the secondline salvage setting led to recent additions to nccn treatment guidelines reflecting the clinical importance of these data we are advancing a into an important phase  trial for aml and conducting four additional trials to assess antileukemic activity and tolerability across multiple populations including younger fit patients and mds patients and we continue to show progress across our pipeline with data trial initiations and novel programs entering the clinic between now and the end of  we anticipate reporting data on multiple programs including asgme and asgme under development for bladder cancer sgnliva being developed in multiple subtypes of metastatic breast cancer including triple negative disease the first interim data combining adcetris with the pd inhibitor nivolumab in salvage hodgkin lymphoma and seacd a novel immunooncology antibody in solid tumors next im delighted to highlight the significant accomplishments of our research organization which were showcased at the american association for cancer research annual meeting earlier this month our aacr presentations fell generally into three categories advances in our adc technology preclinical data on our adcs under development and progress with our immunooncology programs one exciting technology advance presented at aacr is a new auristatinbased drug linker that is both more potent and has a wider therapeutic index in preclinical models than current auristatin technology we also described two novel linkers that enable stable conjugation and release of payloads that were previously unaccessible for adcs and importantly we showed that tumorassociated macrophages may contribute to antitumor activity by releasing mmae in the tumor microenvironment additionally at aacr we highlighted preclinical data supporting the clinical development of two adcs for sgnliva our data showed enhanced preclinical activity when combined with standard of care agents for breast cancer including doxorubicin paclitaxel carboplatin and everolimus as a reminder sgnliva is in phase  for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer and we described for the first time a novel adc designed for the treatment of multiple myeloma called sgncda this adc utilizes our proprietary pbd dimer payload and sitespecific conjugation technology we plan to advance sgncda into clinic by the end of  finally id like to summarize the exciting progress were making in the field of immunooncology we continue to build our extensive knowledge regarding the ability of auristatinbased adcs including adcetris to initiate immunogenic cell death these data support our hypothesis that adcs may be a preferred partner for combination with checkpoint inhibitors which is being evaluated in ongoing clinical trials combining adcetris and nivolumab in relapsed hodgkin and nonhodgkin lymphomas we highlighted data at aacr on two novel immunooncology agents that activate the immune system in distinct and complementary ways compared to checkpoint inhibitors the first is seacd a novel cd agonistic antibody developed using our proprietary sugarengineered antibody technology data from this program demonstrated that preclinical models predicted early cytokine evidence for immune activation in patients the second program is a small molecule fluorofucose or ff which mediates multiple potential antitumor mechanisms of action at aacr we showed for the first time that ff enhances tcell mediated antitumor activity through tcell receptor signaling and activation of dendritic cells in preclinical models taken together these presentations at aacr illustrate seattle genetics continued leadership in the field of adcs with significant advances in technology and understanding additional mechanisms of action we also further described the potential of our adcs to be used in combination with immunooncology agents and highlighted two novel immunooncology programs in our pipeline this is a time of great progress in the field of oncology and im excited about the work being conducted in our labs and the enthusiasm among the medical community for our innovative science with that ill turn the call back over to clay clay b siegall  chairman president  chief executive officer thanks jonathan before we open the line for questions id like to recap a few of the key upcoming activities across adcetris and our pipeline for adcetris these include reporting data from the phase  alcanza trial in ctcl in the third quarter reporting data from the phase  echelon trial in frontline hodgkin lymphoma in the  through mid timeframe and completing enrollment of the phase  echelon trial in frontline mtcl during  and reporting data in the  to  timeframe nearterm events for a and our other pipeline programs include initiating a phase  trial with a plus hmas in older patients with aml by the third quarter of  reporting data at eha from a phase  trial of a in combination with hmas and reporting phase  data at asco from asgme and asgme we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress at this point well open the line for qa operator please open the call for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you so much well take the first question from the line of adnan butt from rbc capital markets please go ahead adnan shaukat butt  rbc capital markets llc hey thanks hope you can hear me so first a question on sales in terms of adcetris post label expansion with aethera have you seen any meaningful sales in that setting since then and do you expect that – well im wondering if thats partly tied to the seasonality that weve seen clay b siegall  chairman president  chief executive officer adnan thanks for the question on aethera thats something that were very excited – the launch has gone great and were building aethera and the market there so we think things are going really well as far as the adcetris sales and your general question please keep in mind we had a really strong fourth quarter in  and when you look at q we were  higher than the q of  so yes there were some seasonal factors darren can go through them a little bit more but we do remain confident in the guidance that we have of the full year of  million to  million darren do you want to make any comments on aethera or the seasonal factors darren s cline  executive vice president commercial yeah adnan the launch is going very well were eight months in into the aethera launch physician interest remains high and we have a lot of headroom we feel in  as aethera gets into institutional guidelines we feel that again weve got a lot of headroom both on market share and then also duration as you recall this trial is up to  cycles and were focused commercially on our four strategic imperatives there identifying patients ensuring transition of care for those patients that want to be treated back in the community the third is ensuring access and weve had no payer resistance in the eight months since the label was added and then lastly as i spoke about duration of therapy is an important driver so were focused we continue to execute and we feel weve got a lot of headroom there regarding the seasonality and i spoke about it is we just saw the main driver was just – and its some of our larger accounts ordering ahead of patient demand and then we do see the cyclical lack of transplants around the holidays and so those are really the two drivers of that two of the three drivers adnan shaukat butt  rbc capital markets llc then if i can get a pipeline question for vadastuximab is the company waiting for any more data prior to starting the phase  or is it more fixating on a design with the fda and then ramping up samplers  thanks clay b siegall  chairman president  chief executive officer we are really focused on getting the phase  going for a were really encouraged with our data we have presented as you know previously on a plus hmas we showed a  crcri rate we showed really low mortality rates at  days and  days we showed a good safety profile and so our planned phase  as we have discussed will be in older newly diagnosed aml patients and were moving forward we cant discuss the specifics of our discussions with the fda and with european regulators but were moving forward on our plans and it is important to note that at eha in june we plan to present additional data in an oral presentation and that includes  patients the first  patients and an additional  patients and well present data on response rates safety and the durability and survivability and so thats something were really excited about and also please note that weve treated well over  patients with a this is clearly an active drug we have very high response rates in singleagent and combination studies monotherapy is very interesting and also were really interested in the data with a plus  and late this year you should potentially see data there and stay tuned for more information on that aspect of the frontline fit patients as opposed to the frontline older unfit patients where were going to go in first in phase  with  plus hypomethylaters adnan shaukat butt  rbc capital markets llc okay great thank you operator thank you so much well take the next question from the line of kennen mackay please go ahead kennen mackay  credit suisse securities usa llc broker hi thanks for taking my question maybe a followup on cd i wanted to see if there are plans to file for breakthrough designation and clay maybe wanted to just get your take on how the drug would be competitive with venetoclax in aml clay b siegall  chairman president  chief executive officer sure so as far as breakthrough designation ill start out by just saying that were really encouraged with our data with a plus hmas were continuing to work in our phase  study and treating people and following this well report that at eha and so stay tuned for that but as far as the specifics on regulatory actions it is just really something we dont comment on until we have something specific to say so just stay tuned on our data and any further regulatory comments in the future and so you also asked about competition we see venetoclax and weve seen their data at ash and we thought it was very interesting we think that a is very competitive with that we had a substantive amount of data we think that as we put more data out at eha we think that it will go a long way to providing the rationale and all of our strength of data going forward into our phase  so i encourage you to look at our presentation at eha kennen mackay  credit suisse securities usa llc broker thanks fair enough and i look forward to seeing the durability out there  maybe just sort of a scientific followup for jonathan one of the sort of potential takeaways for me from the aacr conference related to some of the new payloads that are out there for adc particularly pbds is that were getting into a class of molecules that are now so toxic that you can begin to get concerns about buildup in tissues in say solid tumors and while pbds may be great payloads for liquid tumors might have issues with solid tumors i wanted to get the teams take on that and whether this type of payload would sort of have broad applicability or whether that might be more appropriate for liquid tumors clay b siegall  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah jonathan you go ahead you can do this and ill chime in if i need to jonathan drachman  chief medical officer evpresearch  development okay great so were really excited with all the enthusiasm and interest in adcs in general and we are continuing to look across broad technology in terms of payloads linkers targets ways of targeting tumors and so we are continuing to explore the broad range were very excited about – and as you know were developing multiple payloads we have mmae mmaf and pbd dimmers all in clinic right now and lots of new payloads that were studying preclinically some of which we presented at aacr so were excited about these and learning a tremendous amount about them not just preclinically but also in clinic i think that learning about how broadly pbd dimers will be applicable will come from these clinical explorations which are going on and as you probably noticed we also announced that we have another pbd dimerbased adc drug conjugate coming soon for multiple myeloma so i think that the story will be better understood as we get more data in patients kennen mackay  credit suisse securities usa llc broker okay thank you so much for taking my questions i really appreciate it operator the next question comes from the line of jon eckard of barclays please go ahead jonathan m eckard  barclays capital inc hi good afternoon thanks for taking the question i wanted to ask a quick question about the poster at aacr on the immunological deaths of auristatinbased adcs and i was wondering based on what you know about how these adcs can cause immunological cell death is there anything that youve learned from there that you could apply to the opdivo combo trial to try to understand if the added efficacy or any added efficacy youve seen with opdivo is contingent on patients having immunological cell death so i just want to try to figure out how basically does adcetris kind of stimulate the effects of the pds in these hodgkins lymphoma patients jonathan drachman  chief medical officer evpresearch  development okay so i think thats a great question and a complicated one the preclinical data clearly show that payloads such as auristatins that are able to cause immunogenic cell death have the potential to be additive or synergistic with immunooncology checkpoint inhibitors so were excited about seeing what the data will be like in patients i think its too early to say right now that we know the answer but that will come from patients we know what each drug is capable of doing by itself and so by looking at the combination well get that understanding jonathan m eckard  barclays capital inc well i guess are you clay b siegall  chairman president  chief executive officer and i think that at some jonathan m eckard  barclays capital inc sorry clay b siegall  chairman president  chief executive officer at some point in the nottoodistant future i imagine well present clinical data of the combination and while were not promising a specific time right now that trial is going well and its a robust trial jonathan m eckard  barclays capital inc okay so im just wondering if you guys are measuring things that could explore that if it were to come in the clinical data is there a way to tease that out do you think clay b siegall  chairman president  chief executive officer we have not put out the specifics of all the things were doing in the trial but we will try to – were trying to look at every parameter we can and as soon as we can report our data jonathan drachman  chief medical officer evpresearch  development but i will assure you that were looking at many correlative endpoints and to best understand the impacts on the immune system both throughout the patient as well as in the tumor microenvironment jonathan m eckard  barclays capital inc right and then i had a quick question on – or like a commercialrelated question on duration i know you said theres a lot more headroom for duration of treatment can i just ask what would be something that could drive duration is it just experience from the physician in that specific setting is it data is it something else if you could just give us an idea of what could be a driver of that duration therapy darren s cline  executive vice president commercial yeah so i think its a couple of things one if you look at the trial design treatment can be given up to  cycles that was both in the consolidation and also in our relapse refractory we feel in this setting that and our market research suggests that physicians and patients are willing to receive adcetris for that length of time and i think that weve been on the market now approaching five years and physician comfort is increasing and i think well see with this consolidation indication a potential to increase not only in the consolidation setting but also in the relapse refractory so its a little early in our launch to have a duration metric for you but its something that were continuing to follow closely jonathan m eckard  barclays capital inc right well thank you very much for taking the questions operator the next question comes from the line of cory kasimov of jpmorgan please go ahead sir brittany r terner  jpmorgan securities llc hi this is brittany on for cory thanks for taking the question just one on echelon if this study is positive what are your highlevel thoughts on how big adcetris could be and how do you think the io therapies in development could affect this clay b siegall  chairman president  chief executive officer so brittany thanks for the question i think that with echelon in hodgkin lymphoma you have about  patients or so in the united states and about the same amount in the eu and another big grouping of patients if you look internationally and so the standard of care has been around for almost  years now with abvd and as you know were trying to redefine that standard of care and so we think the opportunity is vast and our trial is with advanced patients and thats an appropriate way to do the trial in agreement with the fda and agreement with the ema and as you know we have a special protocol assessment so were working in the right way so we think that if you look at e and the opportunity in frontline hodgkin lymphoma its well in access of  billion and so thats important and dont forget e thats a big opportunity as well and i think both of those the e being in the frontline tcell lymphoma where for decades now its been frontline treated with chop chemotherapy and were working with chp adcetris and getting rid of the oncovit  and so were really excited with e and e now you asked a question about immunooncology we clearly think that some of the new pd molecules nivolumab pembrolizumab these have been shown to be active in hodgkin lymphoma the majority of the patients that are being treated with these drugs are after adcetris if a patient has been on adcetris and if they have responded and then relapsed at a later time or were refractory and so were very pleased that there are options for patients going forward but keep in mind that when you think about the future of treating hodgkin lymphoma and the nottoodistant future because weve been working on this for many years and were getting really close to where we have our e data that the goal is to cure a lot more patients and to have the number of patients being treated in the relapsed and refractory setting be much smaller than they are today which essentially in a sense cannibalizes some of our current market today but would also cannibalize other drugs that are used to treat relapsedrefractory hodgkin lymphoma so as we see e matriculate and when we look at our data from our leadin trial that we reported the data was spectacular and if we have data anywhere remotely close to those kind of data theres going to be a lot higher percentage of patients cured and a lot smaller of a need for any drugs whether it be adcetris in late lines or io drugs or anything so were really excited about trying to redefine the frontline of hodgkin lymphoma after  years brittany r terner  jpmorgan securities llc thats helpful thank you operator the next question comes from the line of boris peaker of cowen please go ahead boris peaker  cowen  co llc great my first question is on a as you try to bring on clinical sites on board and talk to physicians and trial participants im wondering do they compare it to mylotarg do they see it as maybe like mylotarg version  and do you have data to show them in terms of consistency of manufacturing or how it maybe is different from mylotarg so that would not stop them in any way clay b siegall  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah when we started a i think that some docs said well explain to us what this drug is – and these aml docs are all very aware of mylotarg and in fact most of them were not happy that mylotarg was taken off the market because they viewed mylotarg as being an effective drug for a lot of patients and so they were very disappointed that it wasnt on the market and so a lot of them asked questions and then as we got into this we have a highly engineered antibody we have two direct attachment sites we have a novel chemo type thats outside of mdr which calicheamicin wasnt we have a stable linker and maybe thats the most critical of all the pieces that the drug and the antibody were staying together in the bloodstream until it found the tumor where with mylotarg it clearly had a very short halflife and it was not outside of mdr and there was a lot of side effects from mylotarg so when you look at the kind of data we have and the sideeffect profile we have its like a different drug completely the similarity rests with the targeting of cd but outside of that its a completely different drug and i think that we used to hear some comments about mylotarg when we started the trial and i dont think we hear them anymore now we hear more about the drug and the data and its activity and its something thats – theres a lot of excitement in the oncology and in the hemonc community of the leukemia docs treating this devastating disease so accruals been great with a i mean we have docs that are really working hard to try to be on our trial so we have a lot of excitement there jonathan do you want to add anything jonathan drachman  chief medical officer evpresearch  development i think clay summarized it very well this is a different drug and i think the main way that people think about mylotarg is really validating cd as an important target for aml boris peaker  cowen  co llc got you and im just curious also from the regulatory perspective as you seek the breakthrough designation would the fda think of mylotarg as already kind of preexisting towards the same target would that in any way preclude you from getting breakthrough or is the fact that its not on the market altogether kind of removes that overhang clay b siegall  chairman president  chief executive officer i really think in our interactions with the fda which we dont really talk about much mylotarg has no bearing on the drug that we are developing a at all boris peaker  cowen  co llc got you and my last question and this is maybe to jonathan and very topical today we receive many more  questions regarding that do you have a technology in your kind of broad adc pipeline thats similar to stemcentrxs rovat and obviously that having to do with todays acquisition clay b siegall  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah ill start on that so were thrilled that theres a lot of interest in adcs earlier we had a question of the use of pbds in solid tumors and so what i thought about initially was a little bit about stemcentrx i mean stemcentrx has their lead drug is an antibody drug conjugate with a pbd which is very very similar to our pbd theyre not exact in chemical composition but very similar so the abbvie acquisition of stemcentrx we think is great for the field of adcs i mean adcs are a very interesting space we have a big pipeline of adc drugs we are the adc leader we have the best adc on the market with adcetris we have the most adcs in development we have multiple technologies including pbd technologies and im thrilled that abbvie thought high enough about an adc for solid tumors that they went ahead and acquired stemcentrx now we saw the data of stemcentrx weve been following the data of anybody with adcs and we saw their data a while ago whatever they presented publicly and it was a response rate in smallcell lung cancer i think it was around  or so response rate but it was early they didnt have at that point a lot of durability data so im eager to see what they present at this years asco and so i understand theyre going to be presenting there and im eager to see the data but based on the acquisition i would say that the data are probably going to be good but adcs are a hot area and were the leaders and we continue to innovate and yeah our pbd technology is very similar in fact we were working on it before they were working on it and kind of pioneered a lot of the adc technology and in fact thats whats in a which is starting in phase  later this year so yes we have a lot of technology boris peaker  cowen  co llc very well thank you very much for taking my questions operator the next question comes from the line of yatin suneja from suntrust robinson humphrey please go ahead yatin suneja  suntrust robinson humphrey inc hi guys thank you for taking my question so now that youve narrowed the timeline on alcanza so maybe could you put in perspective the expectation from that trial and if you could comment on the commercial opportunity i mean i know there is a compendia listing for the same indication but what do you envision once thats readout and what sort of potential should we expect from that trial clay b siegall  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah well thanks for asking about alcanza what i can tell you is theres about  of ctcl patients in entirety expressedcd at the kind of density that are part of our trial and would be part of what we think would be our prospective label and that means that in the united states thered be about  cdpositive ctcl patients diagnosed every year also keep in mind that theres a prevalence of cd positive ctcl in the us of about a little greater than  patients but a lot of those are earlystage and theyre treated with topical so we dont think that all of those patients are the type that would come there so there is an incident and a prevalent population that we could get with a new label here yes as you point out we are in guidelines so we wouldnt be going from  to  right away because we already have some patients that are being treated by docs under the guidelines that have been out there for some time now so we think that this is an important step an incremental step for us nowhere near the step commercially that echelon would be or for that matter echelon but nonetheless an important step for us to actually get label and allow our commercial team to actually go out there and talk about this drug where right now were in guideline so we have no commercial effort on it yatin suneja  suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay very helpful just maybe one more question on the partner program on astellas we see you have abstract data and the title suggests that you might see or we might see some form of antitumor activity in bladder cancer so maybe could you put in perspective or help us preview what sort of data you are presenting there and what are the expectations from those studies clay b siegall  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah sure thanks for the question i mean im really excited to actually get a question on this these are two programs that weve been working on with astellas these are  worldwide collaborations so theres no jurisdictions or anything there its just cofunded coowned so what are the – the programs names are asgme and asgme and both are currently in phase  and theyre in there one of them for bladder cancer one for bladder and other cancers under our collaboration and we have been for some time now accumulating a significant amount of data on these programs and mainly in bladder cancer now bladder cancer is an unmet need and a promising area for new drugs and we are very excited to present at asco and like i said this is not going to be – our first presentation here is not going to be one where we present four or six or seven patients theres going to be substantial number of patients youre going to see dose escalation work and expansion cohorts and so were really excited to come out at asco and really unveil these two drugs yatin suneja  suntrust robinson humphrey inc and then what are you terms there with the partner i mean at what point you might exercise that option and copromote it clay b siegall  chairman president  chief executive officer well its not – we dont have terms like that our terms are we  own the product development commercial and everything so we dont have to exercise any right these are coowned by the two companies yatin suneja  suntrust robinson humphrey inc got it thank you very much peggy pinkston  executive director corporate communications operator do we have another question operator yep theres the line of salveen richter next please go ahead thomas trimarchi  goldman sachs  co hi this is tom on for salveen so thanks so much for taking the question i wanted to come back to follow up on an earlier question about potential competition from checkpoint inhibitors in hl so i understand that longterm youre less concerned about this given you hope to actually cure more patients upfront in the frontline setting with adcetris but more nearterm how are you just thinking about the competitive landscape given bristol has filed already in the relapse setting for nivolumab singleagent and i think we just saw up on clin trials gov merck is also planning to run a headtohead study against adcetris in the relapse setting clay b siegall  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah so thanks for the question look like i said earlier were happy that patients have other options when they need them in late stage so thats a good thing for patients and were all about patients and their benefit there are quite a number of ongoing trials with checkpoint inhibitors some of them are in hodgkin lymphoma as you point out but when weve done a lot of market research we find that at set positions they know adcetris they want to use it first we have proven efficacy proven safety profile theyre really using adcetris and whats the most important is really pushing forward and getting in the nottoodistant future our data from echelon and the goal is really curing more patients in frontline and those data are not too distant in the future and lastly i want to point out that we have a ongoing robust study in collaboration with bristolmyers squibb combining adcetris and nivolumab in fact its in two corporate studies that theyre doing in hodgkin lymphoma and nonhodgkin lymphoma and this may be something that could be used in the future and in a big way so were really excited with that and we look forward to the opportunity to present some data and i just cant guide you as to when that would be but wed like to do it as soon as we can thomas trimarchi  goldman sachs  co okay thanks and then just in terms of expenses i see there was a big jump in rd from q to q i know youve initiated a bunch of trials but are you kind of at the level you need to be in terms of getting ready for the aml phase  or is there still more ramp needed there todd e simpson  chief financial officer so this is todd ill take that yeah youre right there was a pretty good size jump in q again this jump is consistent with where we were guiding and most of the growth we saw in q came from two places the first was some work we continued to do on adcetris but youre also right there is work that were embarking on now to be ready to get the  program into pivotal trials later this year so pretty good uptick in spend related to that thomas trimarchi  goldman sachs  co okay great thanks for taking my questions operator all right we have a question from the line of mara goldstein of cantor fitzgerald please go ahead mara goldstein  cantor fitzgerald securities oh thanks for taking the question just more of an update question on cd candidate and where that sits now in terms of the dose escalation and then expansion both on the solid and hematologic and how do you expect that data to come in clay b siegall  chairman president  chief executive officer sure ill start this and turn it over to jonathan we are excited about this program its an immunooncology program we call it sea it is not an antibodydrug conjugate it is an empowered antibody through our sea or sugarengineered antibody technology and we recently presented data at the aacr conference jonathan do you want to talk about that and where that fits in jonathan drachman  chief medical officer evpresearch  development yeah so mara the trial is ongoing and we cant really comment on exactly where we are in terms of dose escalation but we are committed to presenting data at an appropriate conference in the nottoodistant future the only thing that we did have at aacr was a lot of the preclinical data that supports the activation of antigenpresenting cells and the way it could work together with immunooncology agents and then we did have a little bit of very early data on cytokines from patients at low doses in the phase  study so thats really the only data that are available at this time mara goldstein  cantor fitzgerald securities and can i just ask maybe a more qualitative than anything else but given your expectation around this sort of novel immunooncology agent i guess what the registration – not registration excuse me but accrual process and how competitive that is versus sort of the more wellknown and characterized targets right now in immunooncology jonathan drachman  chief medical officer evpresearch  development well i think that theres a lot of excitement about cd as an immunooncology target and weve certainly gotten a lot of enthusiasm from investigators and the general community so yes theres a lot of competition in this space but cd is a nice complementary target its not a checkpoint inhibitor it works well potentially in preclinical settings with checkpoint inhibitors and so i think theres a lot of interest in it mara goldstein  cantor fitzgerald securities okay thanks so much operator there are no further questions at this time please continue ms pinkston peggy pinkston  executive director corporate communications okay thanks
