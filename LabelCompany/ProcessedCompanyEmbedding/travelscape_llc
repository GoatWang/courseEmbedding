instantly sent me an email confirming the payment sent and is now pending it took me back to hotelscom to a page saying was having problems but if i didnt receive confirmation email within  minutes to call i waited  then called it took me probably  minutest to talk to their customer service because they didnt have a direct link to them the first time i transferred they hung up on me the foreign customer service person asked me the same questions probably  times before telling me that reservations take  hours to get into their computers so id get an email by then by next day i still had not received anything from then i tried to just cancel the payment since i couldnt cancel the reservation since they were still trying to tell me i didnt make one however since they have yet to accept the payment and i have no doubt that they will at since point since they are already screwing me over paypal wont let me cancel it i left a bad review of web site and got an email back pretty quickly from a debra h who asked for my information so she could help i thought this might be fixed  days later i received an email from her again saying that the reservation was placed with an affiliate and there is nothing can do about it i never left hotelscoms web site and the payment confirmation has travelscape llc as who i paid and hotelscom as their web site i asked debra h who the affiliate was and why would the payment be to hotelscom i received a reply saying the affiliate i have yet to find out who is can only fix this problem and they were working  on it three days later and nothing from this so called affiliate ive wrote a letter to the email address my payment went to i received a response saying they could not help me ive my confirmation to them now i will never use hotelscom or any travelscape company again neither will anyone i know beware of this company and their crappy customer service  this report was posted on ripoff report on   pm and is a permanent record located here

llc thory may   negative experience i booked a holidays in turkey with this company two months before the trip i cancelled my booking because of several problems i had this company never paid me a refund and this was absolutely unreasonable they have fraudulent terms and conditions and they dont respect their customers after this experience i will never recommend this company to anyone disturbed jun   friedel carlton i paid for two nights at smokeyland motel for  by paypal and you didnt send me a confirmation i had an emergency and needed to cancel these dates and no way i called travelscapellc and motelscom and never got any satisfaction this is bad business on your part transaction oanld friedel carlton david tribulla feb   expedia i never have experience in my life such a faulty and disrespect to customers as i had experience that lasted days trying to use our tickets we had cancelled for a death and reuse them first it cost a to issue them again ok with that then the nightmare trying to tell them that we want to use them to go to florida again well they had us going to chicago and i tried to tell her that i am not going there after times i asked for english person she hung up on me so i had to wait the hrs on hold till my phone went dead and it was nearly midnight so i will try again and explain got hung up on and then finally after a new day i started to tell them and they promise to correct it not so i wait again this time hrs and min then i thought to myself they have our number and they dont want to fix it so i try my cell phone till it ran dead i sent my emails and saved them too to hear that they are sorry but to call those numbers to talk to customer service and i told them that i used everyone of those numbers and i am on day  now trying to get it fixed finally they dropped my name of the itenarary and that made me really upset so i call amex and they have on hold not yet charged two tickets i tell them not to let that go through and called delta and cancelled it still trying to get a person to handle this from expedia and not one person could get it right how disappointing is that i have used them for yearsbut this was horrible treatment i really became ill and finally used another credit card and made new res with another company and the tickets now became so much more expensive waiting on these nuts i had to get a new amex card hoping to start overwell  weeks now thinking this is over i get a bill for  airline ticket they still havent got it right and i have a charge and now ticket for me what is wrong with these people we just wanted to use are old tickets can you see this picture and now we have to get new cards  new airline tickets that cost more with some other company and another ticket just for person not my wife what do i need that for can you help us bkgrimes jun   would never recommend travelscape travelscape has such poor customer service that i wouldnt recommend them there has been  hours on the phone and online to get a refund for one nights reservation out of  nights travelscape or so we thought it was travelscape you are never quite sure who you are speaking with travelscape or expedia was notified five days prior to the checkin date that one of six rooms should only be reserved for three nights instead of four for whatever reason that communication never got to embassy suites so they didnt honor the one night refund upon checkin trying to correct the error is a nightmare like i said theres been  hours put into trying to right the wrong and were no closer to resolution than when we started so frustrating im asking for  for a room that was not used and notification was given  days in advance to help avoid these problems in the future we have found out if you want to make reservations with embassy suites directly be sure to go through httpembassysuiteshiltoncomenindexhtml or through the hiltoncom website hopefully this review will help us an others like us to have a better experience travellng in the future bkgrimes jun   buyer beware of travelscape ive just spent  hours trying to get a refund for one nights hotel room cancellation  that travelscape apparently did not communicate to embassy suites talk about the run around embassy wont help as they werent the ones who took the reservation travelscape wont help as they dont have record of the callin lesson learned make sure you have a cancellation number when you cancel a reservation the good news is i have learned that to make sure you are booking with embassy suites directly be sure to go start through hiltoncom our reservations were made by mistake through travelscape as they had made themselves look like they were embassy hopefully our bad experience will help you to avoid travelscapecom and avoid travel nightmares in the future amaj feb   travelscape ive had the worst time trying to first of all get confirmation of a reservation at the iberostar rose hall in montego bay jamaica it took more than a week to get a confirmation faxed not even emailed to me im now having the hardest time cancelling this mess stay away from travelscape im ashamed of expedia for being affiliated with them and on top of that so far not helpful in resolving issues related to this affiliate cokeyc jun   hotel cancelled we booked through travel republic for april who then go through travelscape for the hotel to be called two days before we were due to fly out they had told us the hotel has been cancelled due to maintenance work been carried out so we booked another hotel that was offered to us and to get there the hotel we had actually booked with had people staying there and to this day they are saying we will be not getting compensation as the hotel was having maintenance been done which it wasnt never will be booking with these again stephenim jun   delta and travelscape i booked a room through delta airlines for a room at the embassy suites in minneapolis and had to cancel the room i called to cancel the room but the receptionist said i had to cancel it with a third party which i assumed was delta airlines after what i thought was the right process the bill shows up on my credit card this marriage between delta and this company travelscape looks more like a scam waiting to happen trying to find out who to talk to has taken me all day and still have not resolved it if you are in the market to get screwed go with travelscape if not use someone else i would not recommend this company to anyone marge oct   travelscape i will never use this service again    they charged me almost  for taxes and fees love bookingcom laura feb   holiday on crete i holidayed on crete with my partner booking through a uk company but they use travelscape to provide accomodation we stayed half board as we have many times in crete previously although experiences obviously have differed we have never had such inadequate arrangements before breakfast was very basic and dinner was  euro towards dinner in a nearby restaurant which was overpriced despite complaining in resort and speaking to an expedia representative who agreed the evening meal provision was inadequate nothing was done now having complained to the uk travel agent travelscape have not anwsered the questions asked wilfuly misunderstanding the situation i am just disgusted with the whole incient and the complete lack of respect or professionalism from travelscape i will be sure to check they are not providers on future holidays alhalfm mar   booked us at a crack house on march   we pulled into phoenix from fort stockton tx very tired and needing a room we usually use choice hotels but believe it they were all sold out spring break somehow we connected with this travelscape llc   thinking we were calling red roof inn the lady foreign accent found us a room at the crossland phoenix west  w mcdowell rd a few blocks from i  at the cost of  it sounded ok so i took a chance and paid up with my visa when we pulled in it did not look safe unsavory characters milling about smoking ladies with back packs waiting out front etc after the desk clerk ided me i asked to check the room out reluctantly she complied my wife waited in the car when i got back my wife told me that she just watched a drug deal go down we had been booked at a drug house i imeditatly went in to get a refund oh we cant do that you have to contact the booking agency screwed i am waiting on travelscape to contact me for my refund which i dont plan to receive my next call is to the arizona attorney gennerals consumer protection office every state has one and that is what everyone who has been screwed by this llc should do use the www to file a complaint i pray we all receive refunds and travelscape llc gets shut down sincerely retired nuclear worker from kansas bert dougbecmitten apr   extremely frustrated my husband and i booked two rooms for a month and a half out we used this website and nowhere was it stated that the room was nonrefundable we dont book a room ever if its nonrefundable we didnt check a box werent told at all we received a confirmation and we looked at the dates and the amount to ensure it was correct it was we printed out one of the room confirmations to give it to the party we were travelling with and at the very bottom on the third page it stated the cancellation policy i have spent numerous hours on the phone and they were not willing to even listen to me couldnt prove to me that on the page that we made the reservation it said nonrefundable nothing very very unconcerned on the phone and i intend to take it up wthe credit card company i will never forget this and it has taught me to be even more cautious because it is totally wrong what they are doing to people jaimegonzaleshotmailcom apr   liers dont trust this company they try to get your money first if something goes wrong with the reservation they never will return the money garym may   travelscape llc non refundable not mentioned i made what i thought was a reservation only to find that it was billed to my  credit card immediately and said it was non changeable and non refundable this was not stated before making the reservation this is not an acceptable way to do business ralph jun   pet friendly booked a room at what said was a pet friendly motelsmall print said no catsyes i did not see thatbut to not be able to get a refund for a room  month in the future is ridiculous i thought i was dealing with vrbo but that and homeaway all belong to expedia who i would normally not deal with this is got to be a business model that cannot be sustainableyou can just call the business itself and can cancel with no problemnow the motel has a pissedoff guesthow is that good for
