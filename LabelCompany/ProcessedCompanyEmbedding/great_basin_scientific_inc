deep value special situations contrarian longshort equitysummarytwo reverse splits and a delisting letter have crippled the stockliquidity concerns raise doubts regarding the viability of the companyshort sellers smell bloodgreat basin scientific nasdaqgbsn is not and has never been a common name when talking about well performing stocks unlike most companies that have had a  drop in their stock price gbsn has sales of actual products and has a large staff of fulltime employees and has actual fda approvals for their equipment it is worth mentioning at this time that gbsn is not a startup drug company so what is going on with the stock a history of great basins stock great basin commenced their initial public offering on october   per the companys  sec annual report filing on october   the sec declared effective our initial public offering registration statement on form s file no  related to  shares of common stock and  series a warrants which were sold in combinations of one share of common stock and one series a warrant at a public offering price of  per unit each series a warrant is exercisable for one share of common stock and one series b warrant in addition the managing underwriter dawson james securities inc exercised its option to purchase  series a warrants from the humble beginnings of that  million share public offering gbsn went on an unprecedented dilution spree in december  a  reverse split was effected subsequently just four months later in march  a  reverse split was effected adjusted for these two splits the ipo shares have fallen from  a share to the current  at the close of trading april   despite trading on the nasd cm platform so lets examine how that transpired so what led to the free fall in the stock price thanks to warrants offerings and conversions the company issued shares at a pace that was similar to the pace of water falling from niagara falls management has been forthright regarding the dilution and the need for it to change in the future in the most recent press release where the company discussed their results they stated as weve outlined in two recent press releases we are preparing our plan for returning to compliance continuing compliance with nasdaq rules on the market value of listed securities and we are very optimistic that we will be granted the extension we need to regain compliance the plan for returning to compliance is also the same as the plan for simplifying our capital structure and over the past four months we have made significant progress in reducing those risks as well we eliminated the highly dilutive series c warrants we have also eliminated the series e warrants at a significantly reduced level of dilution than we would have faced at a later date and our finance team led by our cfo jeff rona and our new banker roth capital partners has worked to assure that our two recent financings have each been progressively less dilutive than the financings that preceded them and we are committed to do all we can to continue that trend as we look to return to the capital markets in the second half of  that last sentence is the one that stands out earlier this year gbsn announced that they received a delisting notice from nasd the company has requested a hearing with nasd to explain how they will be nasd compliant in the future but the company is offering no specifics to shareholders at the current time it is likely that it is this return to the capital markets that will enable gbsn to be nasd compliant in  hopefully this capital raise will not be highly dilutive to current shareholders but based on history that is an unlikely scenario operational metrics as mentioned earlier gbsn does indeed have actual products and sales here is the company description per their k we are a molecular diagnostic testing company focused on the development and commercialization of our patented molecular diagnostic platform designed to test for infectious disease especially hospitalacquired infections as of december   gbsn had  fulltime employees great basin is not a shell company or a scam that is undisputed what is disputed is whether the company has a viable business plan that will enable it to survive growth in the april   gbsn business update conference call extracted from sas archives ceo ryan ashton made the following comments regarding the business earlier this afternoon we released our preliminary first quarter revenues and customer numbers it was our strongest quarter to date by a significant margin with  where revenue increased  yearoveryear to approximately  this also represented a sequential increase of  over the prior quarter the fourth quarter of  we also announced that we ended the first quarter with  revenue generating customers an increase of  customers from  at the end of the fourth quarter this is more than double our customer acquisition rate in the first quarter of  when we added  new customers in  we added  customers ending the year at  and today we are providing guidance on our customer acquisition we expect to add between  and  new customers in  and end the year with between  and  customers the guidance for  and  are that in  we expect to end the year with  to  customers and four fda cleared tests another five tests either in trial or already submitted to the fda and in  we expect to end the year with  to  customers nine fda cleared tests and another five to six tests either in trial or already submitted to the fda there is no question that the company has productsmachines that are needed these productsmachines are fda approved the company is selling them but they are losing more and more money with every unit they sell how can gbsn reverse this and stop the need for more capital and subsequent dilution from the  annual report here are the revenue and pl numbers for  great basin recorded a net loss of  million of which  million was an operating loss on revenues of just  million to put it bluntly for every dollar in revenues the company generated they lose almost  in  this is a major deterioration from the  lost for every revenue dollar generated in  in other words the more gbsn sells the more they lose the companys products are manufactured manually the lack of automation allows no economies of scale in  gbsn ended the year with two fda cleared tests the company guidance calls for  to end with the company having four cleared fda tests and  projections are for nine fda cleared tests with another five to six tests either in trial or submitted to the fda research and development spending full speed ahead that is the only way of describing the rd spending of gbsn spending increased from  million in  to  million in  between the positive comments made by mr ashton regarding  and  guidance and the corresponding rd spending gbsn does indeed seem to have the potential to be a market mover in the coming years as long as the cash flow allows it short interest the stock of gbsn has clearly been on the radar of shorts and momentum players lately the following is the short interest as reported by nasdaqcom while  shares does not seem to be a large number you need to remember that there are only  million shares of gbsn stock outstanding also of note is that for april  the average trading volume is over  million shares a day that represents over  of the shares outstanding changing hands every day clearly this is not ordinary trading activity for gbsn or any stock conclusion so what does it all mean the business model may not be broken but it definitely exhibits stress fractures there seems to be a definite need for great basins products sales are ramping up quickly great basin however needs to find a way to produce their test units for less money this is key to their survival if we are to take management at their word regarding both the growth and the companys willingness to control future dilution gbsn is a very speculative opportunity with a market capitalization of  million most of the risk seems to have been eliminated disclaimer investing in penny stocks such as great basin can be risky there is no guarantee that your investment will

revenue nearly  million in potential pipeline revenue is from stool bacterial pathogenspanel currently awaiting fda clearance salt lake city june   – great basin scientific inc otcqb gbsn a molecular diagnostics company today provided a general business update on the company focusing on its efforts to drive growth in second half  and into  through an expanded menu of diagnostic panels and tests  highlights include new business pipeline exceeds  million an increase of  over the fourth quarter of  pipeline includes  million in expected annual revenue from the company’s stool bacterial pathogens panel sbpp currently awaiting expected k clearance from the us food and drug administration fda average expected annual revenue of sites in evaluation increases  to  compared with  in the second quarter of  and new customer sites now comprise  of new business pipeline “we are pleased to see such exciting results from the large investments we made in  to diversify and expand our product menu already we believe the potential revenues of our new business pipeline exceed our revenues for all of fiscal year ” said ryan ashton cofounder and chief executive officer of great basin scientific “especially encouraging has been the response to our most important product the stool bacterial pathogens panel currently awaiting fda clearance we will not commence sales and marketing outreach on that panel until we receive fda clearance but inbound demand has been promising and based on the preclearance demand we expect to see our new business pipeline growth accelerate once we receive fda clearance for this important assay” ashton continued “in addition to menu expansion and new business progress we also continue to execute our cash management program which was initiated in late  this program is intended to realign company resources from a heavy focus on product development to an increased focus on customer acquisition and revenue growth we expect our cash burn rate to continue to decline during  and reiterate our target for total operating expenses at or below  million for the third quarter of  proving our dedication to executing on the fundamentals that will both serve our target market and our stockholders” new business pipeline and product mix as of june   the company had approximately  million of potential new revenues in the new business pipeline these potential revenue estimates as well as those below are based on the evaluating site’s own estimate of their expected testing volumes multiplied by the product price offered to the prospective customer the company’s highestvalue multiplex panels – staph idr blood culture panel sidr and stool bacterial pathogens panel sbpp sbpp – comprise  of new customer site evaluations in the new business pipeline staph idr has a list price  above that of the company’s lowplex tests with the same general costofgoods as the lowplex assays sbpp which is awaiting k clearance from the fda comprises  of the new customer evaluations in the pipeline sbpp when commercially available will have a list price  times higher than the company’s lowplex tests based on customer feedback the company anticipates significant pipeline growth for sbpp once it receives fda clearance and the company is free to market the panel the new business pipeline follows to the extent these evaluations and scheduled evaluations are converted into customers we expect such conversions to occur between the fourth quarter of  and the first quarter of  the company’s historical “win rate” those evaluations that elect to become customers has been  new customers from larger hospitals and labs mark largest evaluation growth a substantial increase in the number of larger hospitals and labs in the new business pipeline along with greater interest in the company’s newest and higherpriced panels is resulting in significant growth in the company’s expected average annual revenue per customer expected annual revenue from new customers evaluating the company’s products increased approximately  from the second quarter of  and  from the third quarter of  this significant increase occurred prior to launch of the company’s first midplex panel its staph idr blood culture panel for blood sepsis caused by staphylococcus species the company believes its expanded product mix of low mid and multiplex assays is the primary driver of the increase in expected average revenue per customer and believes this trend will accelerate with the addition of sbpp to its commercial offerings as well as the anticipated development of other higherpriced assays in the future the chart below shows the average expected annual revenue of new customer evaluation starts by quarter stool bacterial pathogens panel sbpp the company expects its sbpp assay to be its primary growth driver in  having already seen large demand for this assay prefda clearance the company believes this response has been driven by three factors sbpp addresses by far the largest market of any of the company’s products—that for the approximately  million foodborne illnesses that occur annually in the united states the assay fulfills an unmet need by providing a powerful focused set of answers that allow clinicians to quickly and accurately diagnose and treat their patients suffering from foodborne gastrointestinal distress and the company’s lowcost structure allows it to offer its hospital and lab customers a powerful value proposition the test will be priced below expected reimbursement rates which means sbpp can be run profitably by customers according to the centers for disease control cdc there are  million foodborne bacterial illnesses annually in the united states sbpp powerfully addresses this large market where current solutions are either too slow culture or too expensive relative to reimbursement rates megaplex panels the company believes its lowcost easytouse solution will drive placements for its system accelerating revenue growth and because of sbpp’s higher selling price and exceptional gross margins resulting in profitability in late december  the company submitted its k application for sbpp to the fda previous k clearances for the company’s assays have been approximately  days from submission to clearance with the company’s first fdacleared midplex panel staph idr requiring  days midplex panels and reimbursement as a competitive driver in late april  medicare contractor palmetto gba issued a draft of local coverage determinations lcds proposing reimbursement coverage for a variety of diagnostic panels including foodborne gastrointestinal panels identified by multiplex nucleic acid amplification tests naats recommending the use of smaller more targeted panels over larger and broader panels their reasoning for noncoverage included the fact that the pathogen targets in larger more than five pathogens panels don’t represent a common syndrome and that many targets can be very rare “a panel that includes pathogens that are very rare or a panel in which all pathogens do not cause overlapping clinical syndromes or when some pathogens are found only in specific patient populations immunocompromised patients is not reasonable and necessary” palmetto wrote this recommendation supports great basin’s midplex panel approach of smaller panels that represent a common syndrome for which there is broad applicability and per palmetto’s recommendation offers a lower rate of reimbursement denial “in ongoing discussions with customers and prospects they report a strong preference for smaller panels targeting the most common pathogens noting highcost molecular diagnostic megapanels are meeting reimbursement resistance from payors and clinical resistance from clinicians who prefer a more targeted therapyfocused set of answers for their patients this preference maps to the updated reimbursement recommendations being issued from payors like palmetto reinforcing our midplex panel strategy” said sandra nielsen senior vice president of sales and marketing for great basin scientific “we are excited about the opportunity to serve the needs of clinicians with sbpp and our indevelopment stool parasite panel two rightsized cost effective panels that we believe will offer a significant competitive advantage over either culture or our competitors’ highcost molecular diagnostic megapanels” about great basin scientific great basin scientific is a molecular diagnostics company that commercializes breakthrough chipbased technologies

known as whooping cough is a very contagious disease caused by a type of bacteria called bordetella pertussis these bacteria attach to the cilia tiny hairlike extensions that line part of the upper respiratory system the bacteria release toxins poisons which damage the cilia and cause airways to swell pertussis is a very contagious disease only found in humans it is spread from person to person people with pertussis usually spread the disease to another person by coughing or sneezing or when spending a lot of time near one another where you share breathing space many babies who get pertussis

timesavings for a strained healthcare system and quicker recovery for patients overview great basin’s diagnostic system employs an integrated disposable cartridge containing all necessary reagents and an inexpensive benchtop analyzer that executes the assay interprets the results and provides electronic output to the clinician the process a clinician places an unprocessed clinical specimen into the cartridge caps then places the cartridge into the analyzer the test routine is initiated in the analyzer for a simple automated process  within the instrument simple mechanical valves are present to control the flow of fluid through the cartridge and to pierce the blister packs  low cost and reliable heaters are present for assay processing  imaging occurs with a simple ccd camera placed over a window in the cartridge above the chip  the image is converted into a clinical result that is provided to the clinical laboratory the disposable cartridge contains—in blister packs or lyophilized—all of the reagents required to run the test  the main analytical steps of the assay sample prep amplification and detection are performed in chambers present on the cartridge all waste is collected in a chamber and the system is closed so that no contamination of the laboratory occurs to simplify processing within the analyzer fluids are moved within the cartridge through relatively large channels by exploiting pressure differences  proprietary features have been designed into the cartridge to allow for bubblefree fluid movement and novel sensor design permits accurate and precise volumetric
