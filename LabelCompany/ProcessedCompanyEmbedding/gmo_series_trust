gmo free comes at a price  glutenfree living skip to content advertisement facebook twitter pinterest instagram search menu search for glutenfree living  glutenfree lifestyle  nongmo  gmo free comes at a price gmo free comes at a price published november   it takes time effort and money for glutenfree companies to avoid genetically modified organisms by mary beth schweigert third in a series people call the customerservice line at rudi’s glutenfree bakery with all kinds of questions and comments but lately a recurring theme has emerged callers want to know more about genetically modified organisms or gmos “when we first started in  a lot of people didn’t even know what gmos were” says denise day rudi’s senior marketing manager “all of the sudden everyone is asking” about gmos how they affect health and the environment and whether the company’s products contain them for rudi’s and a growing number of other glutenfree food companies the answer to that last question is “no” rudi’s bread hot dog and hamburger buns tortillas pizza crust and other glutenfree products are sold in natural food stores nationwide avoiding gmos is a deliberate decision that reflects the boulder colo company’s commitment to using only natural ingredients day says “we’ve been gmofree since the beginning” she says “it’s part of who we are and part of what we’re committed to doing” many other manufacturers are recognizing and responding to heightened consumer demand for foods that are both gluten and gmo free producing foods that are free of both ingredients can be more costly and timeconsuming but companies say they are committed to making the safest products possible—and giving consumers exactly what they want enjoy life an illinois company that produces  gluten and allergenfree items was prompted to make them all nongmo because of awareness in the market “we started hearing more about nongmo foods about three or four years ago” says scott mandell company ceo and founder “being a company that was specifically started to help consumers who have concerns about food ingredients we believe that it is our responsibility to continue to stay on top of ingredientrelated issues that affect our consumers” gmos entered the us food supply about  years ago when scientists began genetically altering plants to promote pesticide tolerance and other positive traits many scientists farmers and food manufacturers argue that gmos make food production more efficient and economical and are perfectly safe but in recent years gmos have become a subject of heated debate with rising consumer backlash tying them to possible health and environmental problems sales of verified nongmo products now top  billion annually according to the nongmo project a certifying group gmo awareness appears especially high among people with celiac disease or gluten intolerance who tend to be labelconscious corn soy and other ingredients common in glutenfree foods are often genetically modified which can make it difficult for consumers to find products that are free of both gluten and gmos “that’s a big issue with glutenfree foods” day says “a lot of them do contain gmos” lucy’s a norfolk vabased manufacturer of gluten and allergenfree cookies and brownies is among the companies both large and small that are producing more nongmo foods company founder and chair lucy gibney md says the nongmo trend is here to stay “since there are so many unresolved questions about gmos we don’t want to take any chances” she says “our customers don’t either” a healthy demand by early  the nongmo project which offers north america’s only thirdparty verification and labeling of nongmo products reported more than  products on the market the bellingham washbased nonprofit doesn’t specifically track glutenfree nongmo foods but like other categories the number clearly is growing eden foods maker of a wide variety of glutenfree products pledged in  not to use any genetically engineered foods or ingredients company president michael potter has been on the board of directors of the nongmo project since its founding in  today all eden foods’ products are made with nongmo ingredients and  sold in the united stated have verification eden has established grower and supplier bases and testing procedures to verify that ingredients considered highrisk are nongmo says jonathan wilson media manager of the michigan company he notes corn and cornbased ingredients are the most difficult to get nongmo but eden products do not contain corn glutino which is part of boulder brands in colorado makes a wide range of glutenfree products available at retailers nationwide director of marketing laura kuykendall says public awareness of gmos has grown in recent years fueled in part by individual states’ highprofile efforts to implement mandatory labeling and grocery chain whole foods’ pledge to require labeling of gmo and nongmo products by  “nongmo labeling for products has become increasingly more important to our consumers” she says “consumers are seeking greater levels of information about where their food comes from” gibney an emergency medicine physician started her company in  after experimenting in the kitchen to create safe healthy snacks for her son who has severe food allergies lucy’s products now are found in  stores in the united states and canada avoiding gmos is a logical leap for consumers who already gravitate toward highquality natural ingredients gibney says many people in the food business call the nongmo movement the “new organic” she says people on both sides of the gmo debate point to research that supports their position but gibney says she believes that in most consumers’ minds the argument already is resolved “though the conversation about nongmo vs gmo continues in the media for most consumers in north america and europe the issue is settled” she says “no gmos” “clean” products – for a price making foods that are free of both gluten and gmos can take more time and cost more money and the results have to taste good too “the challenges for making glutenfree and nongmo products is identifying sources of ingredients that meet the standards we have established for glutenfree ingredients and that will also meet the requirements for nongmo labeling” glutino’s kuykendall says corn and soy are common ingredients in glutenfree foods but nongmo versions can be difficult to find the nongmo project reports that  percent of corn and  percent of soy grown in the united states contain gmos soy is a main ingredient in house foods’ tofu shirataki glutenfree noodles consumer and retail demands prompted the company to use only nongmo suppliers and get nongmo verification says yoko difrancia a public relations and marketing specialist with the garden grove calif company “tofu is by nature gluten free and people in general are concerned about gmo soy” she says but nongmo soybeans do cost more ingredients that are both gluten and gmofree often are more expensive for example rudi’s day says canola oil that contains gmos costs considerably less than a comparable nongmo product “we typically can find an ingredient but you do have to look a little harder and do your due diligence” she says “we do believe it’s worth it … it’s something we’re committed to doing” enjoy life has not had difficulty finding any particular ingredient but higher cost is a reality according to mandell “being nongmo does add some cost to our product but we believe that the cost is well worth the positive tradeoff of having ‘clean products’ for our consumers which in turn translates into greater sales and a healthier business” he says some smaller companies feel the impact even more acutely gator ron’s makes barbecue and wing sauces and bloody mary mixes that are glutenfree dairyfree vegan kosher and nongmo president connie griffith says the yearold bethesda md company takes pride in making clean products that are free of gmos and other “junk” “because it’s clean the quality is higher and the cost is higher obviously” griffith says more than  retailers including smaller more upscale markets and whole foods sell gator ron’s sauces and mixes primarily in the washington dcbaltimore area some potential customers who taste the barbecue sauce at a store demonstration balk at the average price tag of  to  griffith says “the competition with barbecue sauce—there are hundreds of them out there” she says “our prices are higher” but other consumers see “nongmo” on the label and buy the sauce without even tasting it easing consumers’ minds dozens of other countries mandate labeling of gmo products but the united states currently has no such requirements the us food and drug administration allows food manufacturers to voluntarily label whether their products contain gmos as long as the statements are truthful and not misleading in an effort to boost consumer peace of mind a growing number of glutenfree food manufacturers choose to pursue verification from the nongmo project verified products are labeled with an orange butterfly perched on a green checkmark shaped leaf a blue background and the words “nongmo project verified product” according to nongmoprojectorg verification requires several layers of scrutiny which include ongoing testing of atrisk ingredients and tracking of a product’s entire supply chain the verification process generally takes about four to six months cost varies based on the number of products and whether they contain ingredients at high risk for gmos glutino currently offers  verified products including breakfast bars flour baking mixes and pie crust the rest of glutino’s product line is under consideration for verification consumers who want to avoid gmos trust the nongmo project’s independent verification process kuykendall says “through this certification we are able to provide our consumers with the power to make informed decisions based on their dietary preferences” she says “at glutino we are committed to full transparency when it comes to our products and ingredients” all of lucy’s products are nongmo verified the nongmo project label shows consumers that lucy’s is serious about producing gmofree foods and is willing to meet accepted standards gibney says “we always use the bestquality and most nutritious ingredient options” she says “so for us meeting the verification requirements was just a paperwork process” jessica mindell president and founder of jessica’s natural foods says she was motivated to get nongmo verification for the six types of granola made by her detroit company by her own interest as a consumer in nongmo labeling “i look for the nongmo verified label when i shop and wanted to provide the same level of comfort to my customers” mindell says “there is a level of security i feel when i see the nongmo certification on a package it is one less thing i have to worry about especially now that i know what a rigorous process it is to get certified i trust the logo even more” for mindell honey was surprisingly the most difficult nongmo ingredient to find her company switched to organic honey and had to get documentation verifying that the bees did not forage in an area within a mile radius of gmo crops and that the bees hadn’t been fed any feed “it never occurred to us that honey could be a gmo issue until we became certified” she says sugar was the issue for endangered species chocolate according to natalia wolting communications and customer service coordinator she says the indianapolisbased company had to switch the type of sugar it was using to get nongmo verifications for its dark chocolate products which are also certified gluten free “consumers are looking for the best ingredients possible and if they’re already looking for glutenfree products nongmo is just another way to ensure they are getting the best product available” she says bob’s red mill producer of a wide variety of glutenfree flours and mixes in march announced that the oregon company has enrolled in the nongmo project and will begin seeking verification of its products other glutenfree companies that use nongmo ingredients say the verification process is too costly instead of verification rudi’s requires suppliers to submit certificates or letters confirming that ingredients are gmofree day says “the no  reason rudi’s does not do nongmo project verification is … there’s a really strict qualifier on the type of yeast you have to use” she says “it’s crazyexpensive it would put us out of the market we couldn’t even sell the product” setting new limits debbie kaufmann is gator ron’s vice president of public relations and communications she also has celiac disease when kaufmann was first diagnosed  years ago she cut out gluten but changed little else about her diet through her work with gator ron’s she has recognized the strong connection between diet and overall health now that she’s more educated about ingredients kaufmann steers clear of much more than gluten she limits her diet to mostly vegetables fruit seafood and poultry “when i read labels i now look for more than just glutenfree” she says “i’ve learned so much about what is in foods that now i do try to stay away from fructose corn syrup gmos and other things that are unhealthy” kaufmann is used to paying more for healthy tasty glutenfree foods and doesn›t mind stretching her budget just a little farther to avoid gmos too “i know my diet is much healthier” kaufmann says “more and more people are realizing we really are what we eat” gf nongmo products here’s a sample of some of the glutenfree companies that use nongenetically modified
