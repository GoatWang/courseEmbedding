most of the eight to  members of the principal strategic investments group have left the wall street firm in the last few months including head gary offner the people said a morgan stanley spokesman declined to comment the move comes as morgan stanley like its wall street peers is looking to cut costs amid pressure on its bottom line it also comes as the group shifts its strategy to focus more on the investments strategic fit to the banks sales and trading operations rather than one that just looks at returns one of the people said the business will continue to exist with a smaller headcount
