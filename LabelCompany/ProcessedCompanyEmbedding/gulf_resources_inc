chemical element classified under halogen elements it is highly toxic and extremely reactive requiring proper precautions when handled at room temperature bromine is a thick reddish brown liquid the substance is found naturally in bromides or compounds of bromine which are ex­tracted from salt lakes seawater and underground brine wells elemental bromine is produced by extract­ing the bromine ion from natural brine    we use chlorine for the extraction process and sulfur or soda to absorb the elemental bromine this production method is simple with bromine extraction rates reaching  the process can also be completed in a closed system imposing minimal strain on the environment    elemental bromine is mainly used to manufacture flame retardants pharmaceuticals paper dyes insect repellents drilling fluids perfumes photographic chemicals watertreatment chemicals and sanitizers bromine is also a key component of other chemicals    crude salt is basic material in the chemical industry it is the principal material in alkali production as well as chlorine alkali production and is widely used in the manufacturing and national defense industries   current stock quote d d m m y click here
