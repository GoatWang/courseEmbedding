count i remember times we were on the road when i knew he was spitting up blood coughing up phlegm and this and that he never missed a note it was amazing just when we thought it might have been done sufficiently john szweds excellent so what the life of miles davis simon  schuster  stands alongside ian carrs miles the definitive biography harper  collins  and of course miles own book with quincy troupe miles the autobiography simon  schuster  as the best books on the music legend paul tingen superbly captured the trumpeters significance during his electric years with miles beyond the electric explorations of miles davis  billboard books  even more recently a pair of books came along not nearly as sharp as tingens but each adding interesting perspective on the later years and controversial recordingsphilip freemans running the voodoo down the electric music of miles davis backbeat  and george coles the last miles the music of miles davis  university of michigan press  we thought it was done for a while and now this a book about the man written by none other than his eldest son gregory davissomeone heretofore almost entirely unheard from on the subject in fact a man who some felt was unworthy himself due to a checkered past of his own gregory davis said he ruminated on dark magus the jekyll and hyde life of miles davis backbeat books  for sixteen years before bringing it to fruition its his right its his father the merits of the book wont be debated here nor will the family squabbles that left he and his brother miles dewey davis iv out of their archetypal fathers will they are also on bad terms with the davis estate that includes his sister cheryl that claimed in a short statement that it find no validity in the book gregory davis traveled with his father off and on lived with him saw good and bad saw tenderness and tantrums cruelty and compassion he saw the drugs come and go as well as the women and he recounts some of those tales in a style that is straightforward just as miles did some sound meaner in the book that they may really be since in talking with gregory there appears no sense of animosity miles got him into boxing which led to an awardwinning amateur career miles taught him in stern and uncompromising fashion the trumpet which gregory plays to this day including being a bandleader in search of a new cd in turn greg was his protector at times occasionally using his pugilistic skills to keep menacing drug dealers in their place when his father only  foot  and often in pain and bad health could not protector in drug situations it was a hot and cold relationship as one would expect when it involves the mercurial miles but water does travel under the bridge and move on it should anyway sketches of pain one headliner apparently couldnt resist above a recent review of gregorys book but in speaking with him he really doesnt project that pain surely he went through it but young davis had his own problems including drugs and brushes with the law sometimes it was a twoway street as to who hurt whom between father and son gregory reveals some of the outrageousness of miles behavior at times but speak with him and it appears to be a whats the big deal attitude he is proud of father he didnt call him dad as he aptly explains in his bookand feels he wasnt a failure as a father despite uncomfortable situations is there an axe being ground are efforts to tour with a band and come out with a cd a deliberate capitalization on the book one cant imagine davis having an impact on the trumpet especially at age  even remotely close to that which say ravi coltranea bitch of a playerhas on the saxophone and yet capitalization and manipulation is such a part of any rock stars career especially when it comes to cds and tours that its a surprise when it doesnt happen was rod stewarts followup of a shitfilled standards album with yet another an attempt at capitalizing thats really not important when it comes to the book which offers another perspective on a musical legend and this music that comes out will hopefully be judged of its own accord and davis is a decent guy approachable and open gregory davis spoke at length about miles music drug use the miles legacy the talk deliberately didnt try to hash through the problems among miles family thats for them to figure out all about jazz what are you up to nowadays besides being an author gregory davis going to the gym regularly practicing the horn we want to bring out a cd as fast as we can we want the book and the cd to synergize each other were gonna hit em with a onetwo punch if we can pull it off that way then probably a book tour were trying to set that up now ive been talking to people on the phone all day about this and that there are a lot of possibilities all this promotional stuff the promotional stuff has got to be set up right before anything else happens in the past ive recorded with people like lester bowie i did a movie score years ago when i was traveling with my father called god is not dead i did a bflat blues in the movie score in jimi hendrixs studio electric lady down in the west village nyc years and years ago this was when i first came to new york to help him out because he was going through so many changes and stuff what i wanted to do was learn music at the same time that we were helping each other father and son i figured im interested in this horn maybe my father who is a great player can show me something i wrote a suite and ive written a few songs also that i have copyrights on theyll probably go on this new cd along with other new material im calling the band mdx the x factor is after miles davis tags gregory davis interview rj deluke united states post a comment please
