helpeducationaustin collegebs political sciencebs political science – activities and societies baseball rho lambda theta model unrecommendationsa preview of what linkedin members have to say about davidi have collaborated with david on our executive leadership team for several years and have always enjoyed working with him david is smart  he assimilates information quickly and registers high on the creativity scale he is adept strategically and can also execute well if you want someone to think of the next thing and then drive it to market david is your guysee moresee lessi’m pretty sure that david was born with veins filled with pure marketing blood i’ve watched him work and had the pleasure of working closely with him for more than  years with only a few breaks during that time my advertising agency sicolamartin now yr austin worked with david when he was with motorola intel and corelogic here’s what i learned about david he’s smart not an “i’m smarter than you” irritating smart but a “this is what my experience tells me but let’s make certain this is the best path” smart he’s creative he’s fearless when it comes to thinking outside the box and seeking innovative solutions he always pushed our agency for leadingedge work that got results and even though he would always say “you guys are the creative ones” he often played a major role in the shaping of both the programs required and the creative executions he’s experienced he’s worked the full gamut in the marketing world he’s succeeded in a variety of different businesses cultures roles teams and markets he’s worn many hats and he can make even the newest ones look like old wellworn favorites in short order he’s genuine with david what you see is what you get there is no posturing no time wasted on political maneuvering and no “it’s all about me” he’s focused on aiming for success and being a supportive team player he’s dedicated he works extremely hard at everything he does and he’s as his resume will reveal loyal to the companies and the teams he serves he’s the opposite of a job hopper he’s the kind of professional that every company wants to attract and keep he’s a leader in fact he’s the kind of leader that ceos love team members admire and trust and advertising agencies rarely find from the “client” side of all the clients i‘ve worked with in my  years of having had an agency david is among those favorites that i can count on one hand he knows how to make you feel sincerely appreciated and it always brings out the best in everyone…including the agency he’s fun let me repeat that he’s fun and truly nice that may not mean much to you but when i’m working a hour day with someone fun is a quality that’s worth its weight in gold life is too short to work with mean people which is why i consider myself lucky to have worked with david for so many great fun years if you want to learn even more about david feel free to contact me and i just might share some of the

of helps for anyone that feels called to preach the word of god this book is broken out into three parts that cover the preacher and his walk then his efforts as they related to the sermon followed by the actual delivery of the sermon if that wasnt enough there are  appendices that cover the preacher and worship music evangelism and the book of romans i really appreciated the nd part of this book as the author nicely covered the inductive bible study approach as it closely reflects many of the steps that we did in the inductive bible study classes we did at our church this book is full of such valuable guidance wisdom and practical advice i would highly recommend this book to anyone that feels a calling to preach this for sure is a book that i will be referencing quite often over the years
