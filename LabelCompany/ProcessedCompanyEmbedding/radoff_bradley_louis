to vaalcos board set forth various operational and governance concerns with the company and its board including its recent adoption of a poison pillcommit to take actions necessary to ensure the board consists of directors committed to shareholders interests oct    et from group  new york oct   prnewswire  bradley radoff and related entities and group  inc who together are the beneficial owners of approximately  of the outstanding shares of common stock of vaalco energy inc vaalco or the company nyse egy today delivered a letter to the board of directors of vaalco setting forth their concerns regarding among other things the companys corporate governance particularly the boards recent adoption of a poison pill bloated ga expenses poor capital allocation poor decision making with respect to capital expenditures and the renewal of the ceos employment contract the full text of the letter is included below october   the board of directors vaalco energy inc  richmond ave suite  houston tx  board members as you know bradley radoff and related entities and group  inc together the group collectively own  of the outstanding common stock of vaalco energy the company in comparison to  of the companys outstanding common stock owned by the senior executive officers and you under your stewardship vaalco has seen significant shareholder value destruction – a  drop in the share price in the past twelve months that exceeds the decline in the price of oil as well as the market price of the companys peer group  this precipitous and disproportionate decline in stockholder value is an alarming fact that has the group very concerned as well as determined to take all necessary actions to protect the value of all stockholders investment in the company specifically the board is accountable for the following abysmal corporate governance  immediately after we disclosed the groups  ownership stake the board rushed to adopt a poison pill with a  ownership trigger thereby blocking the group from acquiring additional shares and purporting to restrict us from communicating with our fellow shareholders regarding the best means to increase the value of our investment in the company  given that in  vaalcos shareholders overwhelmingly voted against the adoption of a poison pill last weeks action by the board is a blatant disregard of shareholders views on this topic  in a difficult business environment your decision to spend precious corporate resources to entrench yourselves from the actual owners of the business will only serve to perpetuate the companys poor performance without accountability  bloated ga expenses the companys last twelve months of cash ga is approximately  of the companys enterprise value despite industry wide layoffs and ga reductions the company has failed to announce any specific cuts to ga and has offered shareholders nothing but vague promises of ga cost review and rationalization  poor capital allocation the company has engaged in inadequate risk management with no hedging excessive exploration risk and exploration commitments including most damagingly recklessly risking and losing almost  million in a failed high risk exploratory well in angola rampant capital expenditures despite industry wide cutting of capital expenditures vaalcos management has increased the companys toprange capex guidance for  from  million to  million in the last twelve months the companys capex has been an astounding  of the companys current enterprise value renewal of ceo contract despite a clear public record of value destruction during his tenure as ceo the board renewed mr guidrys contract while providing him with significant additional compensation in the event that he is terminated following a change in control—which includes a change in the majority of the board as a result of a proxy contest initiated by the companys stockholders  mr guidrys largecompany background has proved to be illsuited for vaalco as demonstrated by his failure to quickly and appropriately respond to a challenging commodity environment and his inability to manage with limited resources   the boards renewal of mr guidrys contract took place despite a letter from group  three weeks earlier requesting consultation regarding the hiring of a ceo  the board did not provide us with the courtesy of a response to this letter and instead ignored our input as well as our invitation to discuss this important management issue with a significant shareholder in summary shareholders deserve better  unlike senior management and yourselves the group has made a significant investment in vaalco  we are deeply troubled by the boards recent actions and we are prepared to take all actions necessary to ensure that the board is composed of individuals committed to act in the stockholders – as opposed to their own – best interests  sincerely yours s bradley l radoff bradley l radoff s paul a bell paul a bell chief executive
