gas royalty trust based in dallas texas with a market capitalization of us  and an average daily trading volume of about  shares at the end of  it is one of the largest royalty trusts in the united states its source of revenue is oil and gas pumped from the geologic formation for which it is named the permian basin in west texas as well as a few locations in other parts of the state most of the trusts properties are on the waddell ranch in crane county texas where it owns a  net overriding royalty interest in the fee mineral interests in this case oil and natural gas other properties of the trust are in  other texas counties most of which are in the western portion of the state on the high plains the trust owns a  net overriding royalty interest in all of its properties outside of the waddell ranch the principal productive zones for oil on the waddell ranch are in two geologic units the grayburg and the san andreas at a depth of from  to  feet  m below ground surface however there are a total of  producing zones on the ranch including one at a depth of  feet  m as of the end of  there were a total of  operational and productive oil wells and  natural gas wells on the waddell ranch in the trust on december   the trust claimed a lifetime of approximately  years for all mineral reserves of the trust permin basin royalty trust came into being in november  with an agreement between southland royalty company and the first national bank of fort worth as is the case with us royalty trusts the trust cannot function as a business and has no employees all operations and maintenance are carried out by the trustee and its subcontractors currently the assets of the trust are managed by conocophillips which acquired meridian oil the previous operator meridian changed its name to burlington resources oil and gas company lp in  prior to being acquired by conocophillips in  the trust pays a relatively high dividend yielding an annual rate of  in early  in addition it pays out monthly a relative rarity for us stocks however its distribution is dependent on the prices of oil and gas thus unlike traditional stocks who when declaring a dividend usually maintain it at the same amount for each quarter of the year the dividend payout will differ each month since the trusts assets are considered a depletable resource its dividend payments are not taxed at the regular dividend rate but rather as return of capital instead of return on investment this is an additional tax advantage in the united states and applies to all royalty trusts references and notesedit
