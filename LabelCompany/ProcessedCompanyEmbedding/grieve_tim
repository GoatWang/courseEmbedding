calderone tim grieve who recently jumped from politico to national journal and has been hiring up reporters has been named national journals editorinchief according to a memo from atlantic media chief david bradley the move puts grieve headtohead now with his former bosses at politico in competing for politics and policy scoops national journal editor charlie green who joined the publication in  will be leaving the company at the end of the year bradley praised the outgoing and incoming top editors while recalling the end of its a wonderful life in the memo below my colleagues at national journal as if in the same entering class at school charlie green and i joined the national journal group roughly contemporaneously charlie was recruited by steve smith as the magazines deputy editor in  i joined only a few months prior ive barely spent a working day in media without charlie green carrying the larger work now i will have to after  years at the national journal group rising to editor of the whole charlie has decided that he would like a new run with his career still at its zenith for reasons ill explain below im honor bound to acquiesce as charlie steps back im reassured of strong leadership by bruces and my decision to appoint tim grieve himself an extreme talent to the position of editorinchief overseeing all our journalism products as to charlieand as to my sense of being bound by honori want to tell the story of this great editors time with us on first purchasing the national journal and immediately trying to add columnist stuart taylor to our ranks i came across a large perception problem stuart had been on the threshold of accepting our offerand leaving the american lawyerwhen its very very smart owner steve brill asked stuart national journal  isnt that the washington reference publication with the threehole punch under steve smith then under michael kelly but then and most under charlie green the national journal became a firsttiertalent nationalclass magazine for  years charlie has edited the mostintelligent considered trustworthy prestigious public policy publishing property in the us all of us who love this brand are profoundly in his debt as wont surprise any of our editorial staff the degree of charlies talent caught me unaware michael kelly first told me you know this deputy editor steve hired  hes really something i mean the real deal then when michael left washington to edit the atlantic he added i dont really think we have to do any recruiting here charlies really it youll never hear him say it but he can do this better than i can demonstrating the highest ratio of exceptional talent over selfless regard ive ever seen charlie lead us from then on the honorbound story is more personal three years ago in a hard hour for the national journal i decided we needed to pursue a reorganization expecting some turnover in staff and not wanting to decide who i offered a buyout to  of the editorial staff i thought a few would choose to go in the event it was barely safe to stand between the elevators and the b garage so headlong was the rush for the door at the time i had told charlie that he too had a right to take the buyout but i asked him not to i understood by then acutely that i needed charlie probably atlantic medias single mostbeloved leader to hold the center in asking charlie to stay i committed that whenever he decided he did want to move on i would support that decision charlie brought me the news three months ago that that time had arrived he will be leaving at the end of the year i want to return to an image of charlie and his great service in life that ive had in mind for this writing but first let me turn to the unsurpassed good news that tim grieve has agreed to serve as national journal groups editorinchief tim joined us in may to recreate the national journal website like so much ambitious legal talenttim bruce stuart taylor steven brill metim devoted his legallytrained mind to getting out of law raised in california graduating stanford graduating georgetown law clerking in washington for the nations secondhighest court practicing  some  in california tim reported for the sacramento bee and leaving law behind became a senior writer at salon before joining national journal tim was a top editor at politico  having edited congressional coverage and then launched politicos politico pro product line tim is a force of nature and a professional on a vertical trajectory through life im not sure that he would have chosen to lead the whole of the national journal group surely not this early but charlie joins bruce and me in thinking tim is made for this work i am deeply appreciative of tim and deeply appreciative he is here closing and in an indulgence only the owner should risk i want to set down the mental image of charlie ive had since i began thinking about my letter to you most will know it though maybe our youngest staff not that is the closing scene from the  christmas drama its a wonderful life dear george bailey jimmy stewart is the man who has given up on everything he had intended in life instead to serve others as a yearold he saves his brother from drowning and in so doing loses his own hearing his brother goes on to become a wwii fighting ace loss of hearing keeps george from enlisting he gives up college to take over his fathers struggling savings  loan he uses savings for his honeymoon with mary donna reed to bail out depositors and then in the penultimate scene the closing crisis a careless uncle billy loses  of the banks deposits setting the bank on a course to insolvency unable to find a loan to carry the bank through george climbs out on a bridge to leap into the freezing december waters below george saved by an angel is shown how worse would have been the lives of the neighbors in bedford falls had george not devoted his life to them george returns home christmas eve house decked out for the holiday to find word has gone out  george is in trouble neighbors by the score are coming by to give of their savings ill switch to excerpts from the script uncle billy mary did it george mary did it she told a few people you were in trouble and they scattered all over town collecting money they didnt ask any questions  just said if george is in trouble count on me you never saw anything like it charlie adds his money to the pile martini dumps his money on the table mr gower enters with a large glass jar jammed full of notes violet arrives and takes out the money george had given her for her trip to new york violet im not going to go george i changed my mind annie ive been saving this money for a divorce if i ever get a husband people line up in the warmly decorated house to give their savings a crowd forms outside and begins to sing the festive scene ends with everyone singing auld lang syne should old acquaintance be forgot and never brought to mind should old acquaintance be forgot and old lang syne for auld lang syne my dear for auld lang syne well take a cup of kindness yet for auld lang syne and theres a hand my trusty friend and gives us a hand o thine and well take a right goodwill draught for auld lang syne maybe you had to be there but those who know the story will sense something of the direction my mind has taken in my career i dont think that ive known a man more beloved thought a more universal blessing than charlie green i dont know that charlie especially charlie can understand how broadly and how much he has meant thank you charlie thank you tim my best to all

main story share this page continue reading the main story photo credit nishant choksi i’m never going to die i’m sorry i can’t say the same for you my role models for how to do death are jesus and wile e coyote yours are other dead people however because i’m never going to die i’m super comfortable with the entire topic and the fact that i’m late turning in this column on books about death and dying has nothing to do with avoiding the subjectso an author who suggests the dead are not howling in the abyss but rather hanging out in what she imagines as a pretty “waiting area” — well that’s an author who’s easy for me to love theresa caputo’s television show “long island medium” has been a mainstay on tlc and in good grief heal your soul honor your loved ones and learn to live again atria  caputo with her cowriter kristina grish wants us to know what she has learned from all those years of channeling the dead “it’s their greatest hope that you learn to heal and carry on” the dead — or spirit as she calls them — are quite chatty and opinionated among the things spirit wants you to knowyour relationship with your loved one isn’t over it has merely changed even if the loved one can’t drive you to the airport if you ask nicely spirit might “help you get a cab” you can let your feelings rule you for short periods of time but “you must also take active steps to heal” spirit doesn’t like whiners when it’s your time it’s usually your time or at least in the “destiny window” of time caputo has a host of practical rather adorable ideas for honoring spirit which often involve giving gifts to others in spirit’s nameafter a while it occurred to me that if the departed behaved in the loving way caputo describes i would like them more when they were dead than when they were alive no matter i am entirely agnostic and still found this book comforting and quite touching i felt oddly close to my own dead parents as i read alongthose whose loss is more recent may prefer a less warm and fuzzy approach — more of a “what can i do to get on with my life right now” book resilience is a hot topic these days and lucy hone has written a book about bereavement reflecting both her own research and her own grief resilient grieving finding strength and embracing life after a loss that changes everything the experiment paper  begins with hone’s own tragedy in  her yearold daughter was killed in a car accident hone shows us how to harness the thankfully common power of our own resilience to work our way through a horrible loss continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story resilience is not a shield against suffering hone suggests it enables us to feel and to move through emotions like pain and guilt so that we can continue to feel alive and experience happiness hone does not buy into the idea that you just feel your feelings and take all the time in the world what if like hone herself you have other kids at home a demanding job and an urgent need to function in the real world hone offers concrete strategies for regaining your equilibrium even in the greatest pain among them choosing where to focus your attention not on hating someone or something which consumes energy taking your time with the body of the one you love there is no mad rush to bury or memorialize beloved and reestablish routines particularly if you have children who may need that structure even more than you dodespite her insistence to the contrary there is a strong whiff of “justgetonwithit” matteroffactness that may be a little beyond some of us patrick o’malley’s getting grief right finding your story of love in the sorrow of loss sounds true paper  cowritten by tim madigan is for those of us made of less stern stuff o’malley was trained as a counselor but when he lost his infant son and he tried to work through the famous küblerross stages of grieving — denial anger bargaining depression and finally acceptance — he felt like a failure grief was not linear it was more of an oscillation o’malley wanted to talk about his son to tell others who his son was even in the few months he was on this earth he began to see the wisdom of the writer isak dinesen who noted “all sorrows can be borne if you put them in a story or tell a story about them”o’malley gives us the tools to tell the story of the deceased favorite memories when he or she was happiest and saddest how you learned about the death and so forth different kinds of loss bring different stories and different kinds of pain telling the story of how you loved and how you

jessica nutik zitter is a physician who specializes in both critical care medicine and palliative care the yin and yang of medicine critical care specialists are taught to save lives with all the technology and machinery at their disposal palliative care specialists need the opposite skill set they have to know how to help a dying person let go zitter is trained in both advertisement continue reading the main story of course it was not always thus dr zitter describes her first code blue as a resident she rushes into the room to heroically save the patient and instead she is asked to resuscitate someone who is clearly dead or should be “with each compression there is a sickening click which i don’t recognize until i hear someone next to me whisper ‘his whole chest is breaking’” she writes “this man is dead”the patient stays dead but in that moment zitter realizes that there must be a better way to depart this earth she also discusses how palliative care can respond to many of the most painful symptoms of dying in a way that care geared toward prolonging life cannot and why at the end of life less is often more compassionate like atul gawande’s “being mortal” zitter’s book shows how knowing when to do nothing is as vital to being a good doctor as knowing when to do everythingas compared to the more philosophical “extreme measures” john abraham’s how to get the death you want a practical and moral guide upper access paper  is exactly as nuts and bolts as it sounds abraham a thanatologist and episcopal priest writes extensively about advance directives and how to ensure your wishes are abided by and then he tells us the least painful and messy ways to go it may not be easy to read about these methods but they affirm the idea expressed by a popular button worn by abraham and other members of the final exit network — “let me die like a dog” — because anyone who has ever had to euthanize a beloved pet knows how painless and peaceful death can be those of us who fear loss of control of our lives more than we fear death will find abraham’s book edifying i even appreciate the phrase he uses instead of assisted suicide he prefers “deliberate life completion”knowing nina riggs died shortly after writing the bright hour a memoir of living and dying simon  schuster  the story of her experience with metastatic breast cancer makes this moving and often very funny memoir almost unbearable to read but that’s because it is not one bromide after the other it is true and it might crush you there is one moment here that says everything about how lonely you can feel when you’ve been told you have a disease it’s past midnight and riggs and her husband are lying in bed “‘i just can’t wait for things to get back to normal’ says john from his side of the moon” riggs realizes there may not be a “normal” anymore and reacts with anger and a growing resolve that we all wish we could achieve “thinking that way kind of invalidates my whole life right now i have to love these days in the same way i love any other”i’ll just say this you can read a multitude of books about how to die but riggs a dying woman will show you how to live continue reading

health care decision key quotes from the ruling  short url url close email print roberts said the individual mandate survives because congress has power to impose taxes  ap photo close “given its expansive scope it is no surprise that congress has employed the commerce power in a wide variety of ways to address the pressing needs of the time but congress has never attempted to rely on that power to compel individuals not engaged in commerce to purchase an unwanted product  legislative novelty is not necessarily fatal there is a first time for everything but sometimes “the most telling indication of a severe constitutional problem    is the lack of historical precedent” for congress’s action”more roberts no really it’s not happening continue reading text size   reset more from the chief justice “as expansive as our cases construing the scope of the commerce power have been they all have one thing in common they uniformly describe the power as reaching ‘activity’ it is nearly impossible to avoid the word when quoting them     “the individual mandate however does not regulate existing commercial activity it instead compels individuals to become active in commerce by purchasing a product on the ground that their failure to do so affects interstate commerce    “people for reasons of their own often fail to do things that would be good for them or good for society those failures — joined with the similar failures of others — can readily have a substantial effect on interstate commerce under the government’s logic that authorizes congress to use its commerce power to compel citizens to act as the government would have them act that is not the country the framers of our constitution envisioned” ginsburg roberts is a throwback justice ruth bader ginsburg explains why she and the court’s other liberals think roberts has it wrong on the commerce clause “the provision of health care is today a concern of national dimension just as the provision of oldage and survivors’ benefits was in the ’s in the social security act congress installed a federal system to provide monthly benefits to retired wage earners and eventually to their survivors beyond question congress could have adopted a similar scheme for health care congress chose instead to preserve a central role for private insurers and state governments according to the chief justice the commerce clause does not permit that preservation this rigid reading of the clause makes scant sense and is stunningly retrogressive” more ginsburg oh and this ain’t broccoli this was probably inevitable “maintaining that the uninsured are not active in the healthcare market the chief justice draws an analogy to the car market an individual ‘is not ‘active in the car market’ the chief justice observes simply because he or she may someday buy a car  the analogy is inapt the inevitable yet unpredictable need for medical care and the guarantee that emergency care will be provided when required are conditions nonexistent in other markets that is so of the market for cars and of the market for broccoli as well although an individual might buy a car or a crown of broccoli one day there is no certainty she will ever do so and if she eventually wants a car or has a craving for broccoli she will be obliged to pay at the counter before receiving the vehicle or nourishment she will get no free ride or food at the expense of another consumer forced to pay an inflated price” «    »  short url url close email print back to top read more about supreme court health care affordable

erikwemple national journal today announced that editor in chief tim grieve will be leaving the company — hardly an unexpected move considering that the longtime beltway policy magazine in july announced that it would bag its print product grieve will be heading to mcclatchy company and will serve as head of news strategies “working on digital expansion for the company’s more than two dozen newspapers and news sites around the country including the miami herald and the sacramento bee” according to memo from tim hartman chief executive of the national journal group in a memo to staff grieve wrote in part “it’s been an absolute thrill and honor to work with you and i’m so proud of the journalism we produced together even more than that i’m proud of the newsroom we built — a newsroom full of people who care about and support each other at every turn i hope you’re all proud of the role you’ve played in that you should be” when the suspension of the national journal print operation was announced the company insisted it would redo its web site develop a “high velocity” news sensibility in part by recommitting itself to national journal daily and hotline lower its staff count as humanely as possible and take various other steps as it formulated a brandnew strategy after a string of failed efforts the search for grieve’s replacement is under way according to hartman’s
