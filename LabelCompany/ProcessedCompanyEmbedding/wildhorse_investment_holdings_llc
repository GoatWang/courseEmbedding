business overview wildhorse resource development corporation the “company” is a delaware corporation the common stock par value  per share of which are listed on the new york stock exchange “nyse” under the symbol “wrd” our predecessor was formed in   we operate in one reportable segment engaged in the acquisition exploitation development and production of oil natural gas and ngl resources our assets are characterized by concentrated acreage positions in southeast texas and north louisiana with multiple producing stratigraphic horizons or stacked pay zones and attractive singlewell rates of return in southeast texas we primarily operate in burleson lee and washington counties where we primarily target the eagle ford shale in north louisiana we operate in and around the highly prolific terryville complex where we primarily target the overpressured cotton valley play as of december   we had assembled a total leasehold position of approximately  gross  net acres across our expanding acreage including approximately  gross  net acres in the eagle ford and approximately  gross  net acres in north louisiana we have identified a total of approximately  gross  net drilling locations across our acreage for the year ended december   approximately   and  of our revenues were attributable to oil natural gas and ngls respectively recent developments eagle ford acquisitions in february  we announced multiple thirdparty transactions to acquire certain oil and natural gas producing and nonproducing properties in burleson county tx for an aggregate price of approximately  million subject to customary postclosing adjustments  one transaction closed in february  and the remaining transactions are expected to close in april   senior notes offering in february  we completed a private placement of  million aggregate principal amount of  senior unsecured notes due  the “ senior notes” at  of par  the  senior notes will mature on february   and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by all of our existing and certain future subsidiaries  we used the net proceeds of the offering to repay all of the borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes including funding our  capital expenditures initial public offering on december   we completed our initial public offering pursuant to which we sold  shares of our common stock at an offering price of  per share we received net proceeds from such offering of  million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and fees and expenses associated with such offering we used the net proceeds from our initial public offering along with approximately  million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility as described below to i fund the remaining portion of the burleson north acquisition purchase price and ii repay in full and terminate our prior revolving credit facilities and repay in full all notes payable by esquisto to its members in connection with our initial public offering we completed the corporate reorganization pursuant to which among other things whr ii esquisto and acquisition co were contributed to us by wildhorse holdings esquisto holdings and acquisition co holdings respectively on january   we also issued and sold  shares of our common stock at an offering price of  per share pursuant to the partial exercise of the underwriters’ overallotment option associated with our initial public offering the “option exercise” we received net proceeds of  million from the option exercise all of which was used to repay outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility      revolving credit facility in connection with the closing of our initial public offering we as borrower and our subsidiaries as guarantors entered into a fiveyear  billion senior secured revolving credit facility with an initial borrowing base of  million our “revolving credit facility” in connection with our  senior notes offering our borrowing base was automatically reduced by  million for more information please see “item  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources—debt agreements—revolving credit facility” rosewood acquisition in december  we acquired from certain third parties approximately  net acres consisting primarily of additional working interests in our eagle ford acreage in lee county in exchange for  shares of our common stock the acreage we acquired resulted in the addition of approximately  net drilling locations to our drilling inventory burleson north acquisition in december  we acquired approximately  net acres of oil and gas properties adjacent to our eagle ford acreage the “burleson north assets” from clayton williams energy inc for a purchase price of  million in cash the burleson north assets produced an average of approximately  mboed  oil for the three months ended september   and added  gross and net drilling locations to our drilling inventory november acquisition in november  we acquired from certain third parties approximately  net acres in burleson county for approximately  million such assets acquired added  gross  net drilling locations to our drilling inventory and produced approximately  boed as of october   our properties eagle ford acreage the eagle ford shale is one of the most active unconventional shale trends in north america according to weekly rig count metrics published by baker hughes the eagle ford shale has consistently been one of the most active basins in the united states since  and currently has the second highest rig count of all major us basins  the eagle ford shale trends across texas from the mexican border north into east texas and is roughly  miles wide and  miles long the eagle ford shale rests between the austin chalk and the buda lime at a depth of approximately  to  feet as of december   there were approximately  producing wells in the eagle ford with total production of  mmboed in december  we currently target a portion of the eagle ford shale at depths between  feet and  feet primarily in burleson lee and washington counties texas this portion of the eagle ford shale averages  feet in thickness and contains  carbonate we believe that the elevated carbonate percentages are in large part responsible for the brittleness of the eagle ford and successful completions which exhibit high productivity when fractured the overall clay content of the eagle ford increases regionally as it continues northeast into brazos grimes and madison counties texas we are focused on maximizing returns and expect operational efficiencies to extend beyond our existing drilling inventory to additional horizons in addition our acreage has been extensively developed for more than  years through the development of the giddings austin chalk trend based on analysis and interpretation of well results and other geologic and engineering data we believe our acreage is also prospective for the georgetown buda woodbine and pecan gap formations historical operators in the giddings austin chalk trend have experienced drilling and production success in these four horizons during our industry’s premultistage frac era ss future development results achieved by us and offset operators may allow us to expand our existing location inventory in these four intervals throughout our leasehold we entered the eagle ford with the goal of redeveloping the area with horizontal drilling and modern completion techniques since that time we have completed multiple bolton acquisitions and infill leases to build our current position in the eagle ford we divide our burleson county acreage into subregions which we refer to as burleson main burleson north burleson west and burleson south based on our assessment of depth and reservoir characteristics such as gas to oil ratio pressure and clay content all of our drilling activity has historically been focused in our burleson main area we have identified a substantial inventory of  gross drilling locations within our eagle ford acreage consisting of  gross drilling locations in burleson county texas  gross drilling locations in lee county texas and  gross drilling locations in washington county texas the wells in our eagle ford acreage have shown a strong track record of increasing eurs and a decreasing trend in drilling and completion capital costs    as of december   our eagle ford position included approximately  net acres also as of december    approximately  of our eagle ford acreage was held by production with an average working interest of  and as of december    of our  mmboe of proved reserves were developed  of which were liquids to date we have drilled and completed  wells acquired  wells and participated in  wells resulting in total net production of approximately  mboed  oil  natural gas and  ngls including nonoperated production north louisiana acreage within our north louisiana acreage we primarily target the overpressured cotton valley formation in the terryville complex the cotton valley formation extending across east texas north louisiana and southern arkansas has been under development since the s and is characterized by thick multizone natural gas and oil reservoirs with wellknown geologic characteristics and longlived predictable production profiles over  vertical and horizontal wells have been completed throughout the trend in  operators started redeveloping the cotton valley using horizontal drilling and advanced hydraulic fracturing techniques through december   operators have drilled over  horizontal cotton valley wells some large analogous redevelopment projects in the terryville complex include the terryville play in lincoln parish the nansugail area in freestone county east texas and the carthage complex in panola county east texas our north louisiana acreage spans across the webster claiborne bienville lincoln jackson and ouachita parishes focusing on the bear creek field and the rct and weyerhaeuser areas where we are targeting overpressured cotton valley opportunities in multiple zones we believe the terryville complex which has been producing since  is one of north america’s most prolific liquids rich natural gas plays characterized by high recoveries relative to drilling and completion costs high initial production rates with high liquids yields long reserve life multiple stacked pay zones available infrastructure and a large number of service providers the rct area is a direct offset of the terryville field and is part of the same terryville complex trend our drilling activity is expected to focus on producing natural gas from the overpressured cotton valley formation in the terryville complex where we intend to target the upper and lower red and upper deep pink intervals as of december   our north louisiana acreage included

december   was adjusted for energy content transportation fees and a regional price differential all prices are held constant throughout the lives of the properties the average adjusted product prices weighted by production over the remaining lives of our properties are  per barrel of oil  per barrel of ngl and  per mcf of natural gas as of december   business strategies to achieve our primary objective of delivering shareholder value we intend to execute the following business strategies    grow production reserves and cash flow through the dev elopment of our extensive drilling inventory we believe our extensive inventory of drilling locations in the eagle ford and the overpressured cotton valley formation in and around the terryville complex combined with our operating expertise will enable us to continue to deliver accretive production reserves and cash flow growth and create shareholder value we have identified a total of approximately  gross  net drilling locations across our acreage with further upside potential given the m ultiple stacked pay zones across much of our acreage in addition to potential downspacing we will continue to closely monitor offset operators as they delineate adjoining acreage and zones providing us further data to optimize our development plan over t ime we believe the location concentration and scale of our core leasehold positions coupled with our technical understanding of the reservoirs will allow us to efficiently develop our core areas and to allocate capital to maximize the value of our resou rce base maximize returns by optimizing drilling and completion techniques and improving operating efficiencies our management is intently focused on driving efficiencies in the development of our resource base by maximizing our hydrocarbon recovery per well while minimizing our drilling completion and operating costs to achieve these efficiencies we focus on   • minimizing the costs of drilling and completing horizontal wells through our knowledge of the target formations pad drilling and reduced drilling times   • maximizing eurs through advanced drilling completion and production techniques such as by optimizing lateral lengths the number of hydraulic fracturing stages and perforation intervals water and proppant volumes fluid chemistry choke management and the strategic use of artificial lift techniques   • maximizing our cash flows by targeting specific areas within our balanced portfolio of oil and natural gas drilling opportunities based on the existing commodity price environment and   • minimizing operating costs through our experience in efficient well management in our eagle ford acreage we have reduced our drilling and completion costs per completed lateral foot by approximately  from  per foot for our wells completed using generation  hydraulic fracturing design to approximately  per foot for our wells completed using generation  hydraulic fracturing design additionally as we have transitioned our completion techniques in our eagle ford acreage from generation  to generation  hydraulic fracturing designs we have increased eurs by approximately  per completed lateral foot from an average of  boe per foot to  boe per foot in our north louisiana acreage we have reduced our drilling and completion costs per completed lateral foot by approximately  from approximately  per foot for the year ended december   to approximately  per foot for the year ended december   our drilling and completion cost reductions coupled with our completion design improvements are generating enhanced singlewell recoveries and attractive returns in the current commodity environment and we believe we can further optimize our results through these and other technologies across our acreage position capture additional horizontal development opportunities on current acreage our existing asset base provides numerous opportunities for our management team to create shareholder value by increasing our inventory beyond our currently identified drilling locations based on results from our horizontal drilling program and those of offset operators including offset production trends mud logs d and d seismic well data analysis and geologic trend mapping we believe our acreage has multiple productive zones providing significant upside potential to our current inventory of identified drilling locations we have excluded from our identified drilling locations potential opportunities associated with downspacing and with additional horizontal drilling locations in i the austin chalk trend in burleson county ii the eagle ford shale in washington county iii the buda woodbine georgetown and pecan gap zones that are present across much of our eagle ford acreage and iv additional cotton valley intervals across our north louisiana acreage utilize extensive acquisition and technical expertise to grow our core acreage position we have a demonstrated track record of identifying and cost effectively acquiring attractive resource development opportunities including the recent acquisitions highlighted under “—recent developments”  to date our management and technical teams have completed numerous acquisitions and we expect to continue to identify and opportunistically lease or acquire additional acreage and producing assets to add to our multiyear drilling inventory we have followed a geologically driven strategy to establish large contiguous leasehold positions in our two basins and strategically expand those positions through bolton acquisitions over time we believe our eagle ford and north louisiana acreage create a platform upon which we can add value by acquiring additional acreage and incremental drilling locations near our current acreage in this regard ngp and its affiliates are not limited in their ability to compete with us for future acquisitions and we do not expect to enter into any agreements or arrangement to apportion future opportunities between us on the one hand and ngp and its affiliates on the other hand maintain a disciplined growthoriented financial strategy we prudently manage our liquidity and leverage levels by monitoring cash flow capital spending and debt capacity which being a twobasin company we believe will allow us to strategically deploy capital among projects across our acreage after giving effect to our  senior notes offering we have approximately     million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility we also had  million in cash and cash equivalents as of march   we intend to fund our growth primarily with internally generated cash flows while maintaining ample liquidity and access to the capital markets which we believe will allow us to accelerate our development program and maximize the present value of our resource potenti al consistent with our disciplined approach to financial management we have an active commodity hedging program that seeks to reduce our exposure to downside commodity price fluctuations enabling us to protect cash flows and maintain liquidity to fund o ur capital program and investment opportunities business strengths we believe that the following strengths will allow us to successfully execute our business strategies extensive contiguous acreage position in two of north america’s leading oil and gas plays  we own an extensive and substantially contiguous acreage position targeting two of the premier plays in north america the eagle ford shale and the overpressured cotton valley formation in and around the terryville complex as of december   we had approximately  gross  net acres and we had  mmboe of proved reserves  oil  natural gas and  ngls across our acreage we believe that our recent well results demonstrate that many of the wells on our highquality acreage are capable of producing singlewell rates of return that are competitive with many of the top performing basins in the united states furthermore the location of our acreage provides us with lower operating costs and better realized pricing than other companies operating in different basins around the country due to our acreage’s proximity to the end markets for oil natural gas and ngls multiyear inventory of drilling opportunities across our acreage position we have identified approximately  gross  net drilling locations across our acreage position providing us with approximately  years of drilling inventory based on our  drilling program on our eagle ford acreage our horizontal drilling locations target the eagle ford shale in burleson and lee counties and the austin chalk in washington county and on our north louisiana acreage our horizontal drilling locations target the upper red lower red and upper deep pink zones in the rct and weyerhaeuser areas in the overpressured cotton valley formation in the terryville complex in addition we believe our acreage position includes a number of additional areas and zones that are prospective for hydrocarbons for example we believe we may identify additional horizontal drilling locations in i the austin chalk trend in burleson county ii the eagle ford shale in washington county iii the buda woodbine georgetown and pecan gap zones that are present across much of our eagle ford acreage and iv additional cotton valley intervals across our north louisiana acreage furthermore we also believe that we may add horizontal drilling locations across our entire acreage position through downspacing significant operational control over our assets with lowcost operations as the operator of a majority of our acreage we have significant operational control over our assets we seek to allocate capital among projects in a manner that optimizes both costs and returns which we believe results in a highly efficient drilling program we believe maintaining operational control will enable us to enhance returns by implementing more efficient and costeffective operating practices such as through the selection of economic drilling locations the opportunistic timing of development and ongoing improvement of drilling completion and operating techniques our contiguous acreage blocks and our practice and history of exchanging and consolidating acreage with adjacent operators allow us to increase our working interest in our wells and provide flexibility to adjust our drilling and completion techniques such as pad drilling and the length of our horizontal laterals in order to optimize our well results drilling costs and returns balanced asset portfolio with significant capital allocation optionality  we believe our balanced exposure to both oil and natural gas gives us the ability to adjust our capital plan and drilling program to rebalance our production as market conditions evolve we have significant exposure to natural gas and ngls in our north louisiana acreage and significant exposure to oil and ngls in our eagle ford acreage as of december    and  of our total proved reserves were comprised of liquids and natural gas respectively  in addition approximately  and  of our production for the year ended december   was comprised of liquids and natural gas respectively as changes in the commodity price environment occur we intend to adapt and manage our capital spending and production profile to benefit from these trends management and technical teams with substantial technical and operational expertise our management and technical teams have significant industry experience and a long history of collaboration in the identification execution and integration of acquisitions and in costefficient management of profitable largescale drilling programs additionally we have substantial expertise in advanced drilling and completion technologies and decades of collective experience in operating in the eagle ford and north louisiana mr graham our chief executive officer and mr bahr our president cofounded one of the predecessors to and mr graham served as chief executive officer of memorial resource development corp “mrd” which pioneered the horizontal redevelopment of the terryville complex participating in the drilling of mrd’s initial  horizontal wells further our management team has a proven track record of returning value to shareholders and a significant economic interest in us directly and through its equity interests in each of wildhorse holdings and esquisto holdings  we believe our management team is motivated to use its experience in identifying    and creating value across our acreage and drilling highly productive wells to delive r attractive returns maintain safe and reliable operations and create shareholder value geographically advantaged assets with significant midstream infrastructure to service our production our acreage position is in close proximity to end markets for oil natural gas and ngls providing us with a regional price advantage for example low oil and natural gas basis differentials along the gulf coast represent a competitive advantage when compared to other plays such as the marcellus utica permian and dj recently developed and lowcost legacy infrastructure is in place across significant portions of our acreage to support our development program in addition we own and operate a large portion of our necessary midstream infrastructure which provides us with improved netbacks on our north louisiana acreage we own and operate a gathering system with capacity of approximately  mmcfd as of december   as well as a saltwater disposal well on our eagle ford acreage we own substantial fresh water supply and storage and are in the process of developing a saltwater disposal well our midstream infrastructure allows us to realize lower operating costs and provides us with increased flexibility in our development program in addition while not currently contemplated our midstream infrastructure could prove to be a future source of additional capital if monetized at an attractive valuation our principal stockholders wildhorse holdings esquisto holdings acquisition co holdings ngp xi us holdings lp “ngp xi” and management

our reserve estimates as of december   included in this annual report are based on evaluations prepared by our management and audited by the independent petroleum engineering firm of cawley in accordance with standards pertaining to the estimating and auditing of oil and gas reserves information promulgated by the society of petroleum evaluation engineers and definitions and guidelines established by the sec our independent reserve engineers were selected for their historical experience and geographic expertise in engineering similar resources proved reserves are reserves which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expires unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for estimation if deterministic methods are used the term “reasonable certainty” implies a high degree of confidence that the quantities of oil or natural gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate if probabilistic methods are used there should at least be a  probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate the technical and economic data used in the estimation of our proved reserves include but are not limited to well logs geologic maps welltest data production data including flow rates well data including lateral lengths historical price and cost information and property ownership interests our independent reserve engineers use this technical data together with standard engineering and geoscience methods or a combination of methods including performance analysis volumetric analysis and analogy the proved developed reserves and eurs per well are estimated using performance analysis and volumetric analysis the estimates of the proved developed reserves and eurs for each developed well are used to estimate the proved undeveloped reserves for each proved undeveloped location utilizing type curves statistical analysis and analogy internal controls our internal staff of petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals works closely with our independent reserve engineers to ensure the integrity accuracy and timeliness of data furnished to our independent reserve engineers in their reserve auditing process periodically our technical team meets with the independent reserve engineers to review properties and discuss methods and assumptions used by us to prepare reserve estimates reserve engineering is and must be recognized as a subjective process of estimating volumes of economically recoverable oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation as a result the estimates of different engineers often vary in addition the results of drilling testing and production may justify revisions of such estimates accordingly reserve estimates often differ from    the quantities of oil natural gas and ngls that are ultimately recovered estimates of economically recoverable oil natural gas and ngls and of future net revenues are based on a number of variables and assumptions all of which may vary from actual results including geologic interpretation prices and future production rates and costs  please read “item a risk factors” appearing elsewhere in this annual report for the year ended december   our reserve estimates and related reports were prepared internally and reviewed and approved by jason pearce  mr pearce is our senior vice president reserves and has approximately  years of experience in oil and gas operations reservoir engineering reserve management unconventional reservoir characterization and strategic planning  cawley performed audits of our internally prepared reserves estimates on our proved reserves as of december   our proved reserves are in the aggregate reasonable and within the established audit tolerance guidelines of  the reports of cawley contain further discussion of the reserves estimates and its audit procedure cawley was founded in  and performs consulting petroleum engineering services under texas board of professional engineers registration no f within cawley the technical person primarily responsible for preparing the estimates

reconciliation of pv to standardized measure pv is a nongaap financial measure and differs from the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows which is the most directly comparable gaap financial measure pv is a computation of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows on a pretax basis pv is equal to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows at the applicable date before deducting future income taxes discounted at  percent we believe that the presentation of pv is relevant and useful to investors because it presents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to our estimated net proved reserves prior to taking into account future corporate income taxes and it is a useful measure for evaluating the relative monetary significance of our oil and    natural gas properties further investors may utilize the measure as a basis for comparison of the relative size and valu e of our reserves to other companies without regard to the specific tax characteristics of such entities we use this measure when assessing the potential return on investment related to our oil and natural gas properties pv however is not a substitu te for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows our pv measure and the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows do not purport to represent the fair value of our oil and natural gas reserves the following table provides a reconciliation of pv of our proved reserves to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows at december    and        for the year

sensitivity historically commodity prices have been extremely volatile and we expect this volatility to continue for the foreseeable future for example for the three years ended december   the nymexwti oil spot price ranged from a high of  per bbl to a low of  per bbl while the nymexhenry hub natural gas spot price ranged from a high of  per mmbtu to a low of  per mmbtu for the year ended december   the west texas intermediate posted price ranged from a high of  per bbl on december   to a low of  per bbl on february   and the henry hub spot market price ranged from a high of  per mmbtu on december   to a low of  per mmbtu on march   ngl prices have also suffered significant recent declines  the continuation of low prices for oil or natural gas could materially and adversely affect our financial position our results of operations the quantities of oil and natural gas reserves that we can economically produce and our access to capital while it is difficult to quantify the impact of the continuation of low commodity prices on our estimated proved reserves with any degree of certainty because of the various components and assumptions used in the process of estimating reserves the following sensitivity table is provided to illustrate the estimated impact of pricing changes on our estimated proved reserve volumes and standardized measure in addition to different price

twophase and threephase separation equipment flowlines metering equipment and safety systems predominate artificial lift methods include foamer gas plunger and rod lift   in the eagle ford our crude oil is trucked by thirdparty purchasers in a process which is actively managed to ensure the best available market for our oil for gas gathering processing and fractionation our eagle ford assets are in proximity to active third party lowpressure systems across our acreage we have favorable longterm agreements in place with two gas gathering and processing companies with the benefit of minimal connection costs  we own substantial fresh water supply and storage and are in the process of developing a saltwater disposal well in north louisiana approximately half of our gas production is gathered into a company owned highpressure pipeline system and then delivered and sold to various intrastate and interstate markets on a competitive pricing basis the majority of our gas production is not currently processed due to current processing economics but we have access to several thirdparty gas processors if processing is economically justified we also own and operate a salt water disposal well which currently receives the majority of our associated water production we own another saltwater disposal well that is currently inactive we have also purchased a site for an additional disposal well where we intend to construct the facility as needed to support our development program marketing and customers   the following table sets forth the percentage of our revenues attributed to our customers who have accounted for  or more of our revenues during  or  and  or more of our predecessors’ revenue during    major customers   years ending december                       energy

        the amounts listed represent the percentage of whr ii and esquisto’s total revenue on a combined basis we market the majority of our production from properties we operate for both our account and the account of the other working interest owners in these properties we sell our oil natural gas and ngl production to purchasers at market prices we sell all of our oil and certain of our natural gas and ngls under contracts with terms of twelve months or less and the remainder of our natural gas and ngls under contracts with terms of greater than twelve months no other purchaser accounted for  or more of our revenue on a combined basis in the years ended december   or  or of our predecessors’ revenue in the year ended december   the loss of any such purchaser could adversely affect our revenues in the short term however based on the current demand for oil and natural gas and the availability of other purchasers we believe that the loss of any such purchaser as a purchaser would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations because crude oil and natural gas are fungible products with wellestablished markets and numerous purchasers competition the oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive and we compete with other companies that have greater resources many of these companies not only explore for and produce oil and natural gas but also carry on midstream and refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional national or worldwide basis these companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects or to define evaluate bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit in addition these companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low oil and natural gas market prices our larger or more integrated competitors may be able to absorb the burden of existing and any changes to federal state and local laws and regulations more easily than we can which would adversely affect our competitive position our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the    future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to c onsummate transactions in a highly competitive environment in addition because we have fewer financial and human resources than many companies in our industry we may be at a disadvantage in bidding for exploratory prospects and producing oil and natural gas properties there is also competition between oil and natural gas producers and other industries producing energy and fuel furthermore competitive conditions may be substantially affected by various forms of energy legislation andor regulation considered from time to time by the governments of the united states and the jurisdictions in which we operate it is not possible to predict the nature of any such legislation or regulation which may ultimately be adopted or its effects upon our future operations such laws and regulations may substantially increase the costs of developing oil and natural gas and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuation of a given operation our larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of existing and any changes to federal state and local laws and regulations more easily than we can which would adversely affect our competitive position seasonality of business weather conditions can affect the demand for and prices of oil and natural gas demand for natural gas is typically higher in the fourth and first quarters resulting in higher prices while the demand for oil is typically higher during the second and third quarters due to these seasonal fluctuations results of operations for individual quarterly periods may not be indicative of the results that may be realized on an annual basis title to properties as is customary in the oil and natural gas industry we initially conduct only a cursory review of the title to our properties in connection with acquisition of leasehold acreage at such time as we determine to conduct drilling operations on those properties we conduct a thorough title examination and perform curative work with respect to significant defects prior to commencement of drilling operations to the extent title opinions or other investigations reflect title defects on those properties we are typically responsible for curing any title defects at our expense we generally will not commence drilling operations on a property until we have cured any material title defects on such property we have obtained title opinions on substantially all of our producing properties and believe that we have satisfactory title to our producing properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and natural gas industry prior to completing an acquisition of producing oil and natural gas leases we perform title reviews on the most significant leases and depending on the materiality of properties we may obtain a title opinion obtain an updated title review or opinion or review previously obtained title opinions our oil and natural gas properties are subject to customary royalty and other interests liens for current taxes and other burdens which we believe do not materially interfere with the use of or affect our carrying value of the properties we believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our material assets although title to these properties is subject to encumbrances in some cases such as customary interests generally retained in connection with the acquisition of real property customary royalty interests and contract terms and restrictions liens under operating agreements liens related to environmental liabilities associated with historical operations liens for current taxes and other burdens easements restrictions and minor encumbrances customary in the oil and natural gas industry we believe that none of these liens restrictions easements burdens and encumbrances will materially detract from the value of these properties or from our interest in these properties or materially interfere with our use of these properties in the operation of our business in addition we believe that we have obtained sufficient rightsofway grants and permits from public authorities and private parties for us to operate our business in all material respects as described in this annual report oil and natural gas leases the typical oil and natural gas lease agreement covering our properties provides for the payment of royalties to the mineral owner for all oil and natural gas produced from any wells drilled on the leased premises the lessor royalties and other leasehold burdens on our properties generally range from approximately  to  regulation of the oil and natural gas industry our operations are substantially affected by federal state and local laws and regulations in particular oil and natural gas production and related operations are or have been subject to price controls taxes and numerous other laws and regulations all of the jurisdictions in which we own or operate producing oil and natural gas properties have statutory provisions regulating the development and production of oil and natural gas including provisions related to permits for the drilling of wells bonding requirements to drill or operate wells the location of wells the method of drilling and casing wells the surface use and restoration of    properties upon which wells are drilled sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling and completion proce ss and the abandonment of wells our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations these include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units the number of wells which may be drilled in an area and the unitization or pooling of crude oil or natural gas wells as well as regulations that generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability or fair apportionment of production from fields and individual wells failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties the regulatory burden on the industry increases the cost of doing business and affects profitability such laws and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted therefore we are unable to predict the future costs or impact of compliance additional proposals and proceedings that affect the oil and natural gas industry are regularly considered by congress the states the federal energy regulatory commission “ferc” the united states environmental protection agency “epa” the bureau of land management “blm”  the department of transportation “dot” other federal agencies and the courts we cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective in addition unforeseen environmental incidents may occur or past noncompliance with environmental laws or regulations may be discovered regulation of production of oil and natural gas the production of oil and natural gas is subject to regulation under a wide range of local state and federal statutes rules orders and regulations federal state and local statutes and regulations require permits for drilling operations drilling bonds and reports concerning operations we own interests in properties located in texas and louisiana which regulate drilling and operating activities by among other things requiring permits for the drilling of wells maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells and regulating the location of wells the method of drilling and casing wells the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled and the plugging and abandonment of wells the laws of both states also govern a number of conservation matters including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties the establishment of maximum allowable rates of production from oil and natural gas wells the regulation of well spacing or density and plugging and abandonment of wells the effect of these regulations is to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill although we can apply for exceptions to such regulations or to have reductions in well spacing or density moreover various states impose a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil natural gas and ngls within its jurisdiction the failure to comply with these rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties our competitors in the oil and natural gas industry are subject to the same regulatory requirements and restrictions that affect our operations regulation of sales and transportation of oil sales of oil condensate and ngls are not currently regulated and are made at negotiated prices nevertheless congress could reenact price controls in the future our sales of oil are affected by the availability terms and cost of transportation the transportation of oil in common carrier pipelines is also subject to rate and access regulation ferc regulates interstate oil pipeline transportation rates under the interstate commerce act in general interstate oil pipeline rates must be costbased although settlement rates agreed to by all shippers are permitted and marketbased rates may be permitted in certain circumstances intrastate oil pipeline transportation rates are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions the basis for intrastate oil pipeline regulation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate oil pipeline rates varies from state to state insofar as effective interstate and intrastate rates and regulations regarding access are equally applicable to all comparable shippers we believe that the regulation of oil transportation will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors who are similarly situated regulation of transportation and sales of natural gas historically the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce have been regulated by agencies of the us federal government primarily ferc in the past the federal government has regulated the prices at which natural gas could be sold while sales by producers of natural gas can currently be made at uncontrolled market prices congress could reenact price controls in the future deregulation of wellhead natural gas sales began with the enactment of the ngpa and culminated in adoption of the natural gas wellhead decontrol act which removed controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas effective january      the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce is regulated primarily under the nga and by regulatio ns and orders promulgated under the nga by ferc in certain limited circumstances intrastate transportation and wholesale sales of natural gas may also be affected directly or indirectly by laws enacted by congress and by ferc regulations the ep act of  is a comprehensive compilation of tax incentives authorized appropriations for grants and guaranteed loans and significant changes to the statutory policy that affects all segments of the energy industry among other matters the ep act of  amends the nga to add an antimarket manipulation provision which makes it unlawful for any entity to engage in prohibited behavior to be prescribed by ferc and furthermore provides ferc with additional civil penalty authority the ep act of  provides ferc with the power to assess civil penalties of up to  per day for violations of the nga and increases ferc’s civil penalty authority under the ngpa from  per violation per day to  per violation per day the civil penalty provisions are applicable to entities that engage in the sale of natural gas for resale in interstate commerce on january   ferc issued order no  a rule implementing the antimarket manipulation provision of the ep act of  and subsequently denied rehearing the rules make it unlawful to i in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of ferc or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of ferc for any entity directly or indirectly use or employ any device scheme or artifice to defraud ii make any untrue statement of material fact or omit to make any such statement necessary to make the statements made not misleading or iii engage in any act or practice that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person the new antimarket manipulation rule does not apply to activities that relate only to intrastate or other nonjurisdictional sales or gathering but does apply to activities of gas pipelines and storage companies that provide interstate services as well as otherwise nonjurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted “in connection with” gas sales purchases or transportation subject to ferc jurisdiction which now includes the annual reporting requirements under order  described below the antimarket manipulation rule and enhanced civil penalty authority reflect an expansion of ferc’s nga enforcement authority on december   ferc issued order  a final rule on the annual natural gas transaction reporting requirements as amended by subsequent orders on rehearing under order  wholesale buyers and sellers of more than  million mmbtus of physical natural gas in the previous calendar year including natural gas producers gatherers and marketers are now required to report on may  of each year aggregate volumes of natural gas purchased or sold at wholesale in the prior calendar year to the extent such transactions utilize contribute to or may contribute to the formation of price indices it is the responsibility of the reporting entity to determine which individual transactions should be reported based on the guidance of order  order  also requires market participants to indicate whether they report prices to any index publishers and if so whether their reporting complies with ferc’s policy statement on price reporting gathering service which occurs upstream of jurisdictional transmission services is regulated by the states onshore and in state waters section b of the nga exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by ferc as a natural gas company under the nga although ferc has set forth a general test for determining whether facilities perform a nonjurisdictional gathering function or a jurisdictional transmission function ferc’s determinations as to the classification of facilities are done on a casebycase basis to the extent that ferc issues an order that reclassifies certain jurisdictional transmission facilities as nonjurisdictional gathering facilities and depending on the scope of that decision our costs of getting gas to point of sale locations may increase we believe that the natural gas pipelines in our gathering systems meet the traditional tests ferc has used to establish a pipeline’s status as a gatherer not subject to regulation as a natural gas company however the distinction between fercregulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services is the subject of ongoing litigation so the classification and regulation of our gathering facilities are subject to change based on future determinations by ferc the courts or congress state regulation of natural gas gathering facilities generally includes various occupational safety environmental and in some circumstances nondiscriminatorytake requirements although such regulation has not generally been affirmatively applied by state agencies natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny in the future the price at which we sell natural gas is not currently subject to federal rate regulation and for the most part is not subject to state regulation however with regard to our physical sales of these energy commodities we are required to observe antimarket manipulation laws and related regulations enforced by ferc under the ep act of  and under the commodity exchange act “cea” and regulations promulgated thereunder by the cftc the cea prohibits any person from manipulating or attempting to manipulate the price of any commodity in interstate commerce or futures on such commodity the cea also prohibits knowingly delivering or causing to be delivered false or misleading or knowingly inaccurate reports concerning market information or conditions that affect or tend to affect the price of a commodity should we violate the antimarket manipulation laws and regulations we could also be subject to related thirdparty damage claims by among others sellers royalty owners and taxing authorities intrastate natural gas transportation is also subject to regulation by state regulatory agencies the basis for intrastate regulation of natural gas transportation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate natural gas pipeline rates and services varies from state to state insofar as such regulation within a particular state will generally affect all intrastate natural gas shippers within the state on a comparable basis we believe that the regulation of similarly situated intrastate natural gas transportation in any states in which we operate and ship natural gas on an intrastate basis will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from    those of our competitors like the regulation of interstate transportation rates the regulation of intrastate transportation rates affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas changes in law and to ferc or state policies and regulations may adversely affect the availability and reliability of firm andor interruptible transportation service on interstate and intrastate pipelines and we cannot predict what future action ferc or state regulatory bodies will take we do not believe however that any regulatory changes will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way they will affect other natural gas producers and marketers with which we compete regulation of pipeline safety and maintenance we are subject to regulation by the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration “phmsa” of the dot pursuant to the ngpsa and the pipeline safety improvement act of  or the psia which was reauthorized and amended by the pipeline inspection protection enforcement and safety act of  the ngpsa regulates safety requirements in the design construction operation and maintenance of gas pipeline facilities while the psia establishes mandatory inspections for all us oil and natural gas transportation pipelines and some gathering lines in highconsequence areas phmsa has developed regulations implementing the psia that require transportation pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs including more frequent inspections and other measures to ensure pipeline safety in “high consequence areas” such as high population areas areas unusually sensitive to environmental damage and commercially navigable waterways on january   the pipeline safety regulatory certainty and job creation act of  or the pipeline safety act was signed into law in addition to reauthorizing the psia through  the pipeline safety act expanded the dot’s authority under the psia and requires the dot to evaluate whether integrity management programs should be expanded beyond high consequence areas authorizes the dot to promulgate regulations requiring the use of automatic and remotecontrolled shutoff valves for new or replaced pipelines and requires the dot to promulgate regulations requiring the use of excess flow values where feasible in addition new pipeline safety legislation the “protecting our infrastructure of pipelines and enhancing safety act of ” the “pipes act” was signed into law in june  the pipes act provides phmsa with additional authority to address imminent hazards by imposing emergency restrictions prohibitions and safety measures on owners and operators of gas or hazardous liquids pipeline facilities the act also directs phmsa to issue minimum safety standards for natural gas storage facilities by june  and calls for a review study and analysis of a number of issues related to pipeline management and safety phmsa has also proposed additional regulations for gas pipeline safety for example in march  phmsa proposed a rule that would explain integrity management requirements beyond “high consequence areas” to apply to gas pipelines in newly defined “moderate consequence areas” many gas pipelines that were in place before  and thus grandfathered from certain pressure testing obligations would be required to be pressure tested to determine their maximum allowable operating pressures many gathering lines in rural areas that are currently not regulated at the federal level would also be covered by this proposal any new or amended pipeline safety regulations may require us to incur additional capital expenditures and may increase our operating costs we cannot predict what future action the dot will take but we do not believe that any regulatory changes will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way they will affect other natural gas gatherers with which we compete states are largely preempted by federal law from regulating pipeline safety for interstate lines but most are certified by the dot to assume responsibility for enforcing federal intrastate pipeline regulations and inspection of intrastate pipelines in practice because states can adopt stricter standards for intrastate pipelines than those imposed by the federal government for interstate lines states vary considerably in their authority and capacity to address pipeline safety changes in existing regulations or future pipeline construction activities may subject some of our pipelines to more stringent dot regulations and could adversely affect our business regulation of environmental and occupational safety and health matters our oil and natural gas development operations are subject to numerous stringent federal regional state and local statutes and regulations governing occupational safety and health the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection some of which carry substantial administrative civil and criminal penalties for failure to comply these laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling or other regulated activity commences restrict the types quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling production and transporting through pipelines govern the sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling and completion process limit or prohibit drilling activities in certain areas and on certain lands lying within wilderness wetlands frontier seismically active areas and other protected areas require some form of remedial action to prevent or mitigate pollution from former operations such as plugging abandoned wells or closing earthen pits establish specific safety and health criteria addressing worker protection and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from operations or failure to comply with regulatory filings in addition these laws and regulations may restrict the rate of production    the following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulat ions as amended from time to time to which our business operations are subject and for which compliance may have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures results of operations or financial position hazardous substances and waste handling the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of  “cercla” also known as the “superfund” law and comparable state laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment these persons include the current and past owner or operator of the disposal site or the site where the release occurred and persons that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the site where the release occurred under cercla such persons may be subject to joint and several strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment we are able to control directly the operation of only those wells with respect to which we act as operator notwithstanding our lack of direct control over wells operated by others the failure of an operator other than us to comply with applicable environmental regulations may in certain circumstances be attributed to us we generate materials in the course of our operations that may be regulated as hazardous substances but we are unaware of any liabilities for which we may be held responsible that would materially and adversely affect us the resource conservation and recovery act “rcra” and analogous state laws impose detailed requirements for the generation handling storage treatment and disposal of nonhazardous and hazardous solid wastes rcra specifically excludes drilling fluids produced waters and other wastes associated with the development or production of crude oil natural gas or geothermal energy from regulation as hazardous wastes however these wastes may be regulated by the epa or state agencies under rcra’s less stringent nonhazardous solid waste provisions state laws or other federal laws moreover it is possible that these particular oil and natural gas development and production wastes now classified as nonhazardous solid wastes could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future for example from time to time various environmental groups have challenged the epa’s exemption of certain oil and gas wastes from rcra a loss of the rcra exclusion for drilling fluids produced waters and related wastes could result in an increase in our costs to manage and dispose of generated wastes which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position in addition in the course of our operations we generate some amounts of ordinary industrial wastes such as paint wastes waste solvents laboratory wastes and waste compressor oils that may be regulated as hazardous wastes if such wastes have hazardous characteristics although the costs of managing hazardous waste may be significant we do not believe that our costs in this regard are materially more burdensome than those for similarly situated companies we currently own lease or operate numerous properties that have been used for oil and natural gas development and production activities for many years although we believe that we have utilized operating and waste disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time hazardous substances wastes or petroleum hydrocarbons may have been released on under or from the properties owned or leased by us or on under or from other locations including offsite locations where such substances have been taken for recycling or disposal in addition some of our properties have been operated by third parties or by previous owners or operators whose treatment and disposal of hazardous substances wastes or petroleum hydrocarbons was not under our control these properties and the substances disposed or released on under or from them may be subject to cercla rcra and analogous state laws under such laws we could be required to undertake response or corrective measures which could include removal of previously disposed substances and wastes cleanup of contaminated property or performance of remedial plugging or pit closure operations to prevent future contamination water discharges the clean water act and comparable state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants including produced waters and other oil and natural gas wastes into or near navigable waters the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the epa or the state the discharge of dredge and fill material in regulated waters including wetlands is also prohibited unless authorized by a permit issued by the us army corps of engineers the “corps” in september  the epa and the corps issued new rules defining the scope of the epa’s and the corps’ jurisdiction under the clean water act with respect to certain types of waterbodies and classifying these waterbodies as regulated wetlands the rule has been challenged in court on the grounds that it unlawfully expands the reach of the clean water act and implementation of the rule has been stayed pending resolution of the court challenge in february  president trump issued an executive order directing the epa and the corps to review the rule and to publish a proposed rule rescinding or revising the rule  at present we cannot predict the outcome of the pending litigation or any revisions to the rule  to the extent the rule expands the scope of the clean water act’s jurisdiction we could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas  obtaining permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects these laws and any    implementing regulations provide for administrative civil and criminal penalties for any unauth orized discharges of oil and other substances in reportable quantities and may impose substantial potential liability for the costs of removal remediation and damages pursuant to these laws and regulations we may be required to obtain and maintain approvals or permits for the discharge of wastewater or storm water and are required to develop and implement spill prevention control and countermeasure plans also referred to as “spcc plans” in connection with onsite storage of significant quantities of oil we are currently undertaking a review of recently acquired oil properties to determine the need for new or updated spcc plans and where necessary we will be developing or upgrading such plans and implementing the physical and operation controls imposed by these plans the costs of which are not expected to be material the primary federal law related specifically to oil spill liability is the oil pollution act of  “opa” which amends and augments the oil spill provisions of the clean water act and imposes certain duties and liabilities on certain “responsible parties” related to the prevention of oil spills and damages resulting from such spills in or threatening waters of the united states or adjoining shorelines for example operators of certain oil and natural gas facilities must develop implement and maintain facility response plans conduct annual spill training for certain employees and provide varying degrees of financial assurance owners or operators of a facility vessel or pipeline that is a source of an oil discharge or that poses the substantial threat of discharge is one type of “responsible party” who is liable the opa applies joint and several liability without regard to fault to each liable party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages although defenses exist they are limited as such a violation of the opa has the potential to adversely affect our operations air emissions the federal clean air act and comparable state laws restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources eg compressor stations through the imposition of air emissions standards construction and operating permitting programs and other compliance requirements these laws and regulations may require us to obtain preapproval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions obtain and strictly comply with stringent air permit requirements or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions of certain pollutants for example in october  the epa lowered the national ambient air quality standard “naaqs” for ozone from  to  parts per billion state implementation of the revised naaqs could result in stricter permitting requirements delay or prohibit our ability to obtain such permits and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment the costs of which could be significant over the next several years we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures for air pollution control equipment or other air emissions related issues in addition the epa has adopted new rules under the clean air act that require the reduction of volatile organic compound and methane emissions from certain fractured and refractured oil and natural gas wells for which well completion operations are conducted and further require that most wells use reduced emission completions also known as “green completions” these regulations also establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from productionrelated wet seal and reciprocating compressors and from pneumatic controllers and storage vessels in addition the regulations place new requirements to detect and repair volatile organic compound and methane at certain well sites and compressor stations in may  the epa also finalized rules regarding criteria for aggregating multiple small surface sites into a single source for airquality permitting purposes applicable to the oil and gas industry this rule could cause small facilities on an aggregate basis to be deemed a major source thereby triggering more stringent air permitting processes and requirements compliance with these and other air pollution control and permitting requirements has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects and increase our costs of development which costs could be significant regulation of ghg emissions in response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide methane and other ghgs present an endangerment to public health and the environment the epa has adopted regulations pursuant to the federal clean air act to reduce ghg emissions from various sources for example the epa requires certain large stationary sources to obtain preconstruction and operating permits for pollutants regulated under the prevention of significant deterioration and title v programs of the clean air act facilities required to obtain preconstruction permits for such pollutants are also required to meet “best available control technology” standards that are being established by the states these regulatory requirements could adversely affect our operations and restrict or delay our ability to obtain air permits for new or modified sources the epa has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of ghg emissions from specified onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production sources in the united states on an annual basis which include certain of our operations in may  the epa finalized rules that establish new controls for emissions of methane from new modified or reconstructed sources in the oil and natural gas sector including production processing transmission and storage activities compliance will require enhanced recordkeeping practices the purchase of new equipment and increased frequency of maintenance    and repair activities to address emissions leakage at certain well sites and compressor stations and also may require hiring additional personnel to support these activities or the engagement of third party contractors to assist with and verify compliance the new rule will and proposed rules could result in increased compliance costs on our operations the epa has also announced that it intends to impose methane emission standards for existing source s but to date has not yet issued a proposal and in  epa published a rule known as the clean power plan to limit ghgs from electric power plants in february  the supreme court stayed the implementation of the clean power plan while legal cha llenges to the rule proceed depending on the ultimate outcome of those challenges and how various states choose to implement this rule it may alter the power generation mix between natural gas coal oil and alternative energy sources which would ulti mately affect the demand for natural gas and oil in electric generation while congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of ghgs there has not been significant activity in the form of adopted legislation to reduce ghg emissions at the federal level in recent years in the absence of such federal climate legislation a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking andor reducing ghg emissions by means of cap and trade programs cap and trade programs typically require major sources of ghg emissions to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those ghgs in addition efforts have been made and continue to be made in the international community toward the adoption of international treaties or protocols that would address global climate change issues for example in april  the united states signed the paris agreement which requires member countries to review and “represent a progression” in their intended nationally determined contributions which set ghg emission reduction goals every five years beginning in  the paris agreement entered into force in november  and includes pledges to voluntarily limit or reduce future emissions  under the obama administration the united states was one of over  nations that indicated an intent to comply with the agreement although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address ghg emissions would impact our business any such future laws and regulations imposing reporting obligations on or limiting emissions of ghgs from our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of ghgs associated with our operations substantial limitations on ghg emissions could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas we produce finally increasing concentrations of ghgs in the earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects such as increased frequency and severity of storms floods and other climatic events if any such effects were to occur they could have a material adverse effect on our operations hydraulic fracturing activities hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of oil andor natural gas from dense subsurface rock formations the hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water proppants and chemicals under pressure into targeted subsurface formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production we regularly use hydraulic fracturing as part of our operations hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions but the epa has asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the sdwa over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuels and published permitting guidance in february  addressing the performance of such activities using diesel fuels the epa has issued final regulations under the federal clean air act establishing performance standards including standards for the capture of air emissions released during hydraulic fracturing and an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking under the toxic substances control act to require companies to disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing and also finalized rules in june  that prohibit the discharge of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants in addition congress has from time to time considered legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the sdwa and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process at the state level several states have adopted or are considering legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities for example in may  the railroad commission of texas the “railroad commission” issued a “well integrity rule” which updates the requirements for drilling putting pipe down and cementing wells the rule also includes new testing and reporting requirements such as i the requirement to submit cementing reports after well completion or after cessation of drilling whichever is later and ii the imposition of additional testing on wells less than  feet below usable groundwater the well integrity rule took effect in january  local governments also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular certain governmental reviews are either underway or have been conducted that focus on the environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices for example in december  the epa released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources the epa report concluded that “water cycle” activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources “under some circumstances” noting that the following hydraulic fracturing water cycle activities and local or regionalscale factors are more likely than others to result in more frequent or more severe impacts  water withdrawals for fracturing in times or areas of low water availability surface spills during the management of fracturing fluids chemicals or produced    water injection of fracturing fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity inje ction of fracturing fluids directly into groundwater resources discharge of inadequately treated fracturing wastewater to surface waters and disposal or storage of fracturing wastewater in unlined pits compliance with existing laws has not had a material adverse effect on our operations or financial position but if new or more stringent federal state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of development activities and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells esa and migratory birds the endangered species act “esa” and in some cases comparable state laws were established to protect endangered and threatened species pursuant to the esa if a species is listed as threatened or endangered restrictions may be imposed on activities adversely affecting that species’ habitat we may conduct operations on oil and natural gas leases in areas where certain species that are or could be listed as threatened or endangered are known to exist the us fish and wildlife service may designate critical habitat and suitable habitat areas that it believes are necessary for survival of a threatened or endangered species a critical habitat or suitable habitat designation could result in further material restrictions to land use and may materially delay or prohibit land access for oil and natural gas development moreover as a result of a settlement approved by the us district court for the district of columbia in september  the us fish and wildlife service is required to make a determination on listing of more than  species as endangered or threatened under the esa by no later than completion of the agency’s  fiscal year similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the migratory bird treaty act the federal government in the past has pursued enforcement actions against oil and natural gas companies under the migratory bird treaty act after dead migratory birds were found near reserve pits associated with drilling activities the identification or designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where underlying property operations are conducted could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our development activities that could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce reserves if we were to have a portion of our leases designated as critical or suitable habitat it could adversely impact the value of our leases osha we are subject to the requirements of the occupational safety and health act “osha” and comparable state statutes whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers in addition the osha hazard communication standard the emergency planning and community righttoknow act and comparable state statutes and any implementing regulations require that we organize andor disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees state and local governmental authorities and citizens related permits and authorizations many environmental laws require us to obtain permits or other authorizations from state andor federal agencies before initiating certain drilling construction production operation or other oil and natural gas activities and to maintain these permits and compliance with their requirements for ongoing operations these permits are generally subject to protest appeal or litigation which can in certain cases delay or halt projects and cease production or operation of wells pipelines and other operations related insurance we maintain insurance against some risks associated with above or underground contamination that may occur as a result of our development activities however this insurance is limited to activities at the well site and there can be no assurance that this insurance will continue to be commercially available or that this insurance will be available at premium levels that justify its purchase by us the occurrence of a significant event that is not fully insured or indemnified against could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and operations

sustained decline in oil natural gas and ngl prices could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our capital expenditure obligations and financial commitments the prices we receive for our oil natural gas and ngl production heavily influence our revenue profitability access to capital future rate of growth and the carrying value of our properties oil natural gas and ngls are commodities and their prices may fluctuate widely in response to market uncertainty and to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil natural gas and ngls historically oil natural gas and ngl prices have been volatile for example during the period from january   through january   the wti spot price for oil declined from a high of  per bbl on june   to a low of  per bbl on february   and the henry hub spot price for natural gas has declined from a high of  per mmbtu on february   to a low of  per mmbtu on march   likewise ngls which are made up of ethane propane isobutane normal butane and natural gasoline each of which have different uses and different pricing characteristics have suffered significant recent declines in realized prices the prices we receive for our production and the levels of our production depend on numerous factors beyond our control which include the following   • worldwide and regional economic conditions impacting the global supply and demand for oil natural gas and ngls   • the price and quantity of foreign imports of oil natural gas and ngls   • political and economic conditions in or affecting other producing regions or countries including the middle east africa south america and russia   • actions of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries its members and other state controlled oil companies relating to oil price and production controls   • the level of global exploration development and production   • the level of global inventories   • prevailing prices on local price indexes in the areas in which we operate   • the proximity capacity cost and availability of gathering and transportation facilities   • localized and global supply and demand fundamentals and transportation availability   • the cost of exploring for developing producing and transporting reserves   • weather conditions and natural disasters   • technological advances affecting energy consumption   • the price and availability of alternative fuels   • expectations about future commodity prices and   • us federal state and local and nonus governmental regulation and taxes in the second half of  oil prices began a rapid and significant decline as the global oil supply began to outpace demand during  and  and thus far in  the global oil supply has continued to outpace demand resulting in persistently low realized prices for oil production in general this imbalance between supply and demand reflects the significant supply growth achieved in the united states as a result of shale drilling and oil production increases by certain other countries including russia and saudi arabia as part of an effort to retain market share combined with only modest demand growth in the united states and lessthanexpected demand in other parts of the world particularly in europe and china although there has been a dramatic decrease in drilling activity in the industry oil storage levels in the united states remain at historically high levels until supply and demand balance and the overhang in storage levels begins to decline prices will likely remain under pressure the us dollar has also strengthened relative to other leading currencies which has caused oil prices to weaken as they are us dollardenominated in addition the lifting of economic sanctions on iran has resulted in increasing supplies of oil from iran adding further downward pressure to oil prices ngl prices generally correlate to the price of oil also adversely affecting the price for ngls is the supply of ngls in the united states which has continued to grow due to an increase in industry participants targeting projects that produce ngls in recent years prices for domestic natural gas began to decline during the third quarter of  and remained weak throughout  and  and thus far in  the declines in natural gas prices are primarily due to an imbalance between supply and demand    across north america the continued duration and magnitude of these commodity price declines cannot be accurately predicted compare d to  our realized oil price for  fell  to  per barrel and our realized oil price for the year ended december   has further decreased to  per barrel similarly our realized natural gas price for  decreased  to  per mcf and our realized price for ngls declined  to  per barrel for the year ended december   our realized price for natural gas was  per mcf and our realized price for ngls was  per barrel lower commodity prices may reduce our cash flow and borrowing ability if we are unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms our ability to develop future reserves could be adversely affected also using lower prices in estimating proved reserves may result in a reduction in proved reserve volumes due to economic limits in addition sustained periods with oil and natural gas prices at levels lower than current wti or henry hub strip prices may adversely affect our drilling economics and our ability to raise capital which may require us to reevaluate and postpone or eliminate our development program and result in the reduction of some of our proved undeveloped reserves and related standardized measure if we are required to curtail our drilling program we may be unable to continue to hold leases that are scheduled to expire which may further reduce our reserves as a result a substantial or extended decline in commodity prices may materially and adversely affect our future business financial condition results of operations liquidity and ability to finance planned capital expenditures our development projects and acquisitions require substantial capital expenditures we may be unable to obtain required capital or financing on satisfactory terms which could lead to a decline in our ability to access or grow production and reserves the oil and natural gas industry is capitalintensive we make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures related to our development projects and acquisitions our  capital budget is  million to  million we expect to fund our  capital budget with cash generated by operations borrowings under our revolving credit facility and proceeds from our  senior notes offering however our financing needs may require us to alter or increase our capitalization substantially through the issuance of debt or equity securities or the sale of assets the issuance of additional indebtedness would require that an additional portion of our cash flow from operations be used for the payment of interest and principal on our indebtedness thereby further reducing our ability to use cash flow from operations to fund working capital capital expenditures and acquisitions the issuance of additional equity securities would be dilutive to our existing stockholders the actual amount and timing of our future capital expenditures may differ materially from our estimates as a result of among other things commodity prices actual drilling results the availability of drilling rigs and other services and equipment and regulatory technological and competitive developments a reduction in commodity prices from current levels may result in a decrease in our actual capital expenditures which would negatively impact our ability to grow production our cash flow from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables including   • the prices at which our production is sold   • our proved reserves   • the amount of hydrocarbons we are able to produce from existing wells   • our ability to acquire locate and produce new reserves   • the amount of our operating expenses   • cash settlements from our derivative activities   • our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility and   • our ability to access the capital markets if our revenues or the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility decrease as a result of lower oil natural gas and ngl prices operational difficulties declines in reserves or for any other reason we may have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations at current levels if additional capital is needed we may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us if at all for a period of  days following the date of the prospectus used in our initial public offering we will not be able to sell any shares of our common stock whether pursuant to a private or public offering without the prior written consent of barclays capital inc if cash flow generated by our operations or available borrowings under our revolving credit facility are insufficient to meet our capital requirements the failure to obtain additional financing could result in a curtailment of the development of our properties which in turn could lead to a decline in our reserves and production and could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations    part of our business strategy involves using some of the latest available horizontal drilling and completion techniques which involve ri sks and uncertainties in their application our operations involve utilizing some of the latest drilling and completion techniques as developed by us and our service providers the difficulties we face drilling horizontal wells include   • landing our wellbore in the desired drilling zone   • staying in the desired drilling zone while drilling horizontally through the formation   • running our casing the entire length of the wellbore and   • being able to run tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal wellbore difficulties that we face while completing our wells include the following   • the ability to fracture stimulate the planned number of stages   • the ability to run tools the entire length of the wellbore during completion operations and   • the ability to successfully clean out the wellbore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage in addition certain of the new techniques we are adopting may cause irregularities or interruptions in production due to offset wells being shut in and the time required to drill and complete multiple wells before any such wells begin producing furthermore the results of drilling in new or emerging formations are more uncertain initially than drilling results in areas that are more developed and have a longer history of established production newer and emerging formations and areas have limited or no production history and consequently we are more limited in assessing future drilling results in these areas if our drilling results are less than anticipated the return on our investment for a particular project may not be as attractive as we anticipated and we could incur material writedowns of unevaluated properties and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline in the future drilling for and producing oil and natural gas are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations our future financial condition and results of operations will depend on the success of our development production and acquisition activities which are subject to numerous risks beyond our control including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable oil and natural gas production our decisions to develop or purchase prospects or properties will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses production data and engineering studies which are often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations for a discussion of the uncertainty involved in these processes see “—reserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate any material inaccuracies in reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves” in addition our cost of drilling completing and operating wells is often uncertain further many factors may curtail delay or cancel our scheduled drilling projects including   • delays imposed by or resulting from compliance with regulatory requirements including limitations on wastewater disposal emission of greenhouse gases “ghgs” and hydraulic fracturing   • pressure or irregularities in geological formations   • shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment and qualified personnel or in obtaining water for hydraulic fracturing activities   • equipment failures accidents or other unexpected operational events   • lack of available gathering facilities or delays in construction of gathering facilities   • lack of available capacity on interconnecting transmission pipelines   • adverse weather conditions   • issues related to compliance with environmental regulations   • environmental hazards such as oil and natural gas leaks oil spills pipeline and tank ruptures and unauthorized discharges of brine well stimulation and completion fluids toxic gases or other pollutants into the surface and subsurface environment      • declines in oil and natural gas prices   • limited availability of financing on acceptable terms   • title issues and   • other market limitations in our industry we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our debt obligations that may not be successful our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our indebtedness obligations including the  senior notes and our revolving credit facility depends on our financial condition and operating performance which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and certain financial business and other factors beyond our control we may not be able to maintain a level of cash flow from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on the notes and our other indebtedness if our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund debt service obligations we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures sell assets seek additional capital or restructure or refinance indebtedness our ability to restructure or refinance indebtedness will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time any refinancing of indebtedness may be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants which could further restrict business operations the terms of our existing or future debt instruments may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives in addition any failure to make payments of interest and principal on outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis including the notes would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness in the absence of sufficient cash flows and capital resources we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet debt service and other obligations the indenture governing the notes restricts and our revolving credit facility restricts our ability to dispose of assets and imposes limitations on our use of proceeds from dispositions we may not be able to consummate those dispositions and the proceeds of any such disposition may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet scheduled debt service obligations restrictions in our existing and future debt agreements could limit our growth and our ability to engage in certain activities the terms and conditions governing our indebtedness   • require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our existing debt thereby reducing the cash available to finance our operations and other business activities and could limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate   • increase our vulnerability to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business   • limit our ability to access the capital markets to raise capital on favorable terms or to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures or acquisitions or to refinance existing indebtedness   • place restrictions on our ability to obtain additional financing make investments lease equipment sell assets and engage in business combinations   • place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors with lower levels of indebtedness in relation to their overall size or less restrictive terms governing their indebtedness and   • limit management’s discretion in operating our business our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance which will be affected by financial business economic regulatory and other factors we will not be able to control many of these factors such as economic conditions and governmental regulation we cannot be certain that our cash flow will be sufficient to allow us to pay the principal and interest on our debt and meet our other obligations if we do not have enough money we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt sell assets borrow more money or raise equity we may not be able to refinance our debt sell assets borrow more money or raise equity on terms acceptable to us if at all for example our existing and future debt agreements will require that we satisfy certain conditions including coverage and leverage ratios to borrow money our existing and future debt agreements will also restrict the payment of dividends and distributions by certain of our subsidiaries to us which could affect our access to cash in addition our ability to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness will be affected by the levels of    cash flow from our o perations and future events and circumstances beyond our control failure to comply with these covenants would result in an event of default under our indebtedness and such an event of default could adversely affect our business financial condition and r esults of operations any significant reduction in our borrowing base under our revolving credit facility as a result of the periodic borrowing base redeterminations or otherwise may negatively impact our ability to fund our operations our revolving credit facility limits the amounts we can borrow up to a borrowing base amount which the lenders in their sole discretion will unilaterally determine based upon projected revenues from our oil natural gas and ngl properties and our commodity derivative contracts such determinations will be made on a regular basis semiannually each a “scheduled redetermination” at our option in connection with a material acquisition at our option no more than twice in any fiscal year and at the option of lenders with more than  of the loans and commitments under the facility the “required lenders” no more than twice in any fiscal year each such redetermination other than a scheduled redetermination an “interim redetermination” and any scheduled redetermination or interim redetermination a “redetermination” in connection with a redetermination any increase in the borrowing base requires the consent of the lenders holding  of the commitments and maintaining or any decrease in the borrowing base requires the consent of the required lenders the borrowing base will also automatically decrease upon the issuance of certain debt including the recent offering of the  senior notes the sale or other disposition of certain assets and the early termination of certain swap agreements our initial borrowing base of  million was reduced to  million in connection with the consummation of our  senior notes offering in february  and our next scheduled redetermination is expected in april  in the future we may not be able to access adequate funding under our revolving credit facility as a result of a decrease in our borrowing base due to the issuance of new indebtedness the outcome of a borrowing base redetermination or an unwillingness or inability on the part of lending counterparties to meet their funding obligations and the inability of other lenders to provide additional funding to cover a defaulting lender’s portion declines in commodity prices could result in a determination to lower the borrowing base and in such a case we could be required to repay any indebtedness in excess of the redetermined borrowing base as a result we may be unable to implement our drilling and development plan make acquisitions or otherwise carry out business plans which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations our derivative activities could result in financial losses or could reduce our earnings we enter into derivative instrument contracts for a portion of our oil and natural gas production as of march   we had entered into swaps collars and deferred premium puts through december  covering a total of  mbbl of our projected oil production and  mmbtu of our projected natural gas production accordingly our earnings may fluctuate significantly as a result of changes in fair value of our derivative instruments derivative instruments also expose us to the risk of financial loss in some circumstances including when   • production is less than the volume covered by the derivative instruments   • the counterparty to the derivative instrument defaults on its contractual obligations   • there is an increase in the differential between the underlying price in the derivative instrument and actual prices received or   • there are issues with regard to legal enforceability of such instruments the use of derivatives may in some cases require the posting of cash collateral with counterparties if we enter into derivative instruments that require cash collateral and commodity prices or interest rates change in a manner adverse to us our cash otherwise available for use in our operations would be reduced which could limit our ability to make future capital expenditures and make payments on our indebtedness and which could also limit the size of our borrowing base future collateral requirements will depend on arrangements with our counterparties oil natural gas and ngl prices and interest rates in addition derivative arrangements could limit the benefit we would receive from increases in the prices for oil natural gas and ngls or from reductions in interest rates which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition in addition our revolving credit facility limits our ability to enter into commodity hedges covering greater than  of our reasonably anticipated projected proved production for the first two years of the facility and  of reasonably anticipated projected proved production for the following three years our derivative contracts expose us to risk of financial loss if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract disruptions in the financial markets could lead to sudden decreases in a counterparty’s liquidity which could make the counterparty unable to perform under the terms of the contract and we may not be able to realize the benefit of the contract we are unable to predict sudden changes    in a counterparty’s creditworthiness or ability to perform even if we do accurately predict sudden changes our ability to nega te the risk may be limited depending upon market conditions during periods of declining commodity prices or to the extent we have interest rate derivative instrument contracts increasing interest rates our derivative contract receivable positions would generally increase which increases our counterparty credit exposure if the creditworthiness of our counterparties deteriorates and results in their nonperformance we could incur a significant loss with respect to our derivative contracts reserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate any material inaccuracies in reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves the process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex it requires interpretations of available technical data and many assumptions including assumptions relating to current and future economic conditions and commodity prices any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves in order to prepare reserve estimates we must project production rates and timing of development expenditures we must also analyze available geological geophysical production and engineering data the extent quality and reliability of this data can vary the process also requires economic assumptions about matters such as oil and natural gas prices drilling and operating expenses capital expenditures taxes and availability of funds actual future production oil natural gas and ngl prices revenues taxes development expenditures operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves may vary from our estimates for instance initial production rates reported by us or other operators may not be indicative of future or longterm production rates our recovery efficiencies may be worse than expected and production declines may be greater than we estimate and may be more rapid and irregular when compared to initial production rates in addition we may adjust reserve estimates of proved reserves to reflect additional production history results of development activities current commodity prices and other existing factors any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves moreover there can be no assurance that our reserves will ultimately be produced or that our proved undeveloped reserves will be developed within the periods anticipated you should not assume that the present value of future net revenues from our reserves presented in this annual report is the current market value of our estimated reserves actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the present value estimate for example our estimated proved reserves as of december   and related standardized measure were calculated under sec rules using twelvemonth trailing average benchmark prices of  per barrel of oil wti and  per mmbtu of natural gas henry hub spot which for certain periods in  were substantially higher than the available spot prices if spot prices are below such calculated amounts using more recent prices in estimating proved reserves may result in a reduction in proved reserve volumes due to economic limits the standardized measure of our estimated reserves is not an accurate estimate of the current fair value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves standardized measure is a reporting convention that provides a common basis for comparing oil and natural gas companies subject to the rules and regulations of the sec standardized measure requires historical twelve month pricing as required by the sec as well as operating and development costs prevailing as of the date of computation consequently it may not reflect the prices ordinarily received or that will be received for oil and natural gas production because of varying market conditions nor may it reflect the actual costs that will be required to produce or develop the oil and natural gas properties in addition whr ii and esquisto were generally not subject to us federal state or local income taxes other than certain state franchise taxes and federal income tax on one of our predecessor’s subsidiaries  we are subject to us federal state and local income taxes as a result estimates included herein of future net cash flow may be materially different from the future net cash flows that are ultimately received therefore the standardized measure of our estimated reserves included in this annual report should not be construed as accurate estimates of the current fair value of our proved reserves properties we acquire may not produce as projected and we may be unable to determine reserve potential identify liabilities associated with the properties that we acquire or obtain protection from sellers against such liabilities acquiring oil and natural gas properties requires us to assess reservoir and infrastructure characteristics including recoverable reserves future oil and gas prices and their applicable differentials development and operating costs and potential liabilities including environmental liabilities in connection with these assessments we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices such assessments are inexact and inherently uncertain for these reasons the properties we have acquired or will acquire in the future in connection with the acquisitions or otherwise may not produce as expected in connection with the assessments we perform a review of the subject properties but such a review may not reveal all    existing or potential problems in the course of our due diligence we may not review ev ery well pipeline or associated facility we cannot necessarily observe structural and environmental problems such as groundwater contamination when a review is performed we may be unable to obtain contractual indemnities from the seller for liabilitie s created prior to our purchase of the property we may be required to assume the risk of the physical condition of the properties in addition to the risk that the properties may not perform in accordance with our expectations we will not be the operator on all of our acreage or drilling locations and therefore we will not be able to control the timing of exploration or development efforts associated costs or the rate of production of any non operated assets and could be liable for certain financial obligations of the operators or any of our contractors to the extent such operator or contractor is unable to satisfy such obligations we have identified  potential drilling locations on our acreage we do not expect to operate  of such locations and there is no assurance that we will operate all of our other drilling locations in addition unless we are successful in increasing our working interest in our other drilling locations through acreage exchanges and consolidation efforts we will not be the operator with respect to these other identified horizontal drilling locations we have limited ability to exercise influence over the operations of the drilling locations operated by our partners and there is the risk that our partners may at any time have economic business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours furthermore the success and timing of development activities operated by our partners will depend on a number of factors that will be largely outside of our control including   • the timing and amount of capital expenditures   • the operator’s expertise and financial resources   • the approval of other participants in drilling wells   • the selection of technology and   • the rate of production of reserves if any this limited ability to exercise control over the operations and associated costs of some of our drilling locations could prevent the realization of targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities further we may be liable for certain financial obligations of the operator of a well in which we own a working interest to the extent such operator becomes insolvent and cannot satisfy such obligations  similarly we may be liable for certain obligations of our contractors to the extent such contractor becomes insolvent and cannot satisfy their obligations the satisfaction of such obligations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition our identified drilling locations are scheduled out over many years making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling in addition we may not be able to raise the substantial amount of capital that would be necessary to drill such locations our management and technical teams have specifically identified and scheduled certain drilling locations as an estimation of our future multiyear drilling activities on our existing acreage these drilling locations represent a significant part of our growth strategy our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties including oil and natural gas prices the availability and cost of capital drilling and production costs availability of drilling services and equipment drilling results lease expirations gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints access to and availability of water sourcing and distribution systems regulatory approvals the cooperation of other working interest owners and other factors because of these uncertain factors we do not know if the numerous drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce natural gas or oil from these or any other drilling locations in addition unless production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres on which some of the drilling locations are obtained the leases for such acreage will expire as such our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified as of december   we had identified  gross horizontal drilling locations on our eagle ford acreage and  gross horizontal drilling locations on our north louisiana acreage as a result of the limitations described in this annual report we may be unable to drill many of our identified locations in addition we will require significant additional capital over a prolonged period in order to pursue the development of these locations and we may not be able to raise or generate the capital required to do so see “— our development projects and acquisitions require substantial capital expenditures we may be unable to obtain required capital or financing on satisfactory terms which could lead to a decline in our ability to access or grow production and reserves” any drilling activities we are able to conduct on these locations may not be successful may not result in production or additions to our estimated proved reserves and could result in a downward revision of our estimated proved reserves which could have a material adverse effect on the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility or our future business and results of operations additionally    if we curtail our drilling program we may lose a portion of our acreage through lease expirations and may be required to reduce our estim ated proved reserves which could reduce the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility certain of our undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on units containing the acreage or the leases are renewed as of december   approximately  of our total net acreage was held by production the leases for our net acreage not held by production will expire at the end of their primary term unless production is established in paying quantities under the units containing these leases or the leases are renewed for example as of december    and  of our net undeveloped acreage was set to expire in  and  respectively if our leases expire and we are unable to renew the leases we will lose our right to develop the related properties although we intend to extend substantially all of our net acreage associated with identified drilling locations through a combination of development drilling the payment of preagreed leasehold extension and renewal payments pursuant to an option to extend or the negotiation of lease extensions we may not be successful in extending our leases additionally where we do not have options to extend a lease we may not be successful in negotiating extensions or renewals or any payments related to such extensions or renewals may be more than anticipated please see “item  business—reserve data—undeveloped acreage expirations” for more information regarding acreage expirations and our plans for extending and renewing our acreage our ability to drill and develop our acreage and establish production to maintain our leases depends on a number of uncertainties including oil natural gas and ngl prices the availability and cost of capital drilling and production costs availability of drilling services and equipment drilling results lease expirations gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints access to and availability of water sourcing and distribution systems regulatory approvals and other factors adverse weather conditions may negatively affect our operating results and our ability to conduct drilling activities adverse weather conditions may cause among other things increases in the costs of and delays in drilling or completing new wells power failures temporary shutin of production and difficulties in the transportation of our oil natural gas and ngls any decreases in production due to poor weather conditions will have an adverse effect on our revenues which will in turn negatively affect our cash flow from operations our operations are substantially dependent on the availability of water restrictions on our ability to obtain water may have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows water is an essential component of oil and natural gas production during both the drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes drought conditions have persisted in our areas of operation in past years these drought conditions have led governmental authorities to restrict the use of water subject to their jurisdiction for hydraulic fracturing to protect local water supplies if we are unable to obtain water to use in our operations we may be unable to economically produce oil and natural gas which could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows our producing properties are located in the eagle ford and in north louisiana making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in a limited number of geographic areas all of our producing properties are geographically concentrated in the eagle ford and in north louisiana at december   all of our total estimated proved reserves were attributable to properties located in these areas as a result of this concentration we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors delays or interruptions of production from wells in these areas caused by governmental regulation processing or transportation capacity constraints market limitations availability of equipment and personnel water shortages or other drought related conditions or interruption of the processing or transportation of oil natural gas or ngls the marketability of our production is dependent upon transportation and other facilities certain of which we do not control if these facilities are unavailable our operations could be interrupted and our revenues reduced the marketability of our oil and natural gas production depends in part upon the availability proximity and capacity of transportation facilities owned by third parties our oil production is transported from the wellhead to our tank batteries by our gathering systems the oil is then transported by the purchaser by truck to a transportation facility our natural gas production is generally transported by our or thirdparty gathering lines from the wellhead to a gas processing facility or transmission pipeline we do not control these trucks and other thirdparty transportation facilities and our access to them may be limited or denied insufficient production from our wells to support the construction of pipeline facilities by our purchasers or a significant disruption in the availability of our or thirdparty transportation facilities or other production facilities could adversely impact our ability to deliver to market or produce our oil and natural gas and thereby cause a significant interruption in our operations if in the future we are unable for any sustained period to implement acceptable delivery or transportation arrangements or encounter production related difficulties    we may be required to shut in or curtail production any such shutin or curtailment or an inability to obtain favor able terms for delivery of the oil and natural gas produced from our fields would materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we may incur losses as a result of title defects in the properties in which we invest the existence of a material title deficiency can render a lease worthless and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition while we typically obtain title opinions prior to commencing drilling operations on a lease or in a unit the failure of title may not be discovered until after a well is drilled in which case we may lose the lease and the right to produce all or a portion of the minerals under the property the development of our estimated puds may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate therefore our estimated puds may not be ultimately developed or produced as of december   approximately  of our total estimated proved reserves were classified as proved undeveloped  development of these proved undeveloped reserves may take longer and require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate estimated future development costs relating to the development of our puds at december   are approximately  billion over the next five years we expect to fund these expenditures through cash generated by operations borrowings under our revolving credit facility and other sources of capital our ability to fund these expenditures is subject to a number of risks see “—our development projects and acquisitions require substantial capital expenditures we may be unable to obtain required capital or financing on satisfactory terms which could lead to a decline in our ability to access or grow production and reserves” delays in the development of our reserves increases in costs to drill and develop such reserves or decreases in commodity prices will reduce the value of our estimated puds and future net revenues estimated for such reserves and may result in some projects becoming uneconomic in addition delays in the development of reserves could cause us to have to reclassify our puds as unproved reserves furthermore there is no certainty that we will be able to convert our puds to developed reserves or that our undeveloped reserves will be economically viable or technically feasible to produce further sec rules require that subject to limited exceptions puds may only be booked if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years after the date of booking this requirement has limited and may continue to limit our ability to book additional puds as we pursue our drilling program as a result we may be required to write down our puds if we do not drill those wells within the required fiveyear timeframe certain factors could require us to writedown the carrying values of our properties including commodity prices decreasing to a level such that our future undiscounted cash flows from our properties are less than their carrying value accounting rules require that we periodically review the carrying value of our properties for possible impairment based on prevailing commodity prices and specific market factors and circumstances at the time of prospective impairment reviews and the continuing evaluation of development plans production data economics and other factors we may be required to writedown the carrying value of our properties a writedown constitutes a noncash impairment charge to earnings commodity prices have declined significantly since  on march   the wti spot price for crude oil was  per barrel and the henry hub spot price for natural gas was  per mmbtu representing decreases of  and  respectively from the high of  per barrel of oil and  per mmbtu for natural gas during  likewise ngls have suffered significant recent declines in realized prices lower commodity prices in the future could result in impairments of our properties which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the periods in which such charges are taken as a result of lower commodity prices we recorded  million and  million of impairment expense during the years ended december   and  respectively we could experience further material writedowns as a result of lower commodity prices or other factors including low production results or high lease operating expenses capital expenditures or transportation fees unless we replace our reserves with new reserves and develop those new reserves our reserves and production will decline which would adversely affect our future cash flows and results of operations producing oil and natural gas reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors unless we conduct successful ongoing exploration and development activities or continually acquire properties containing proved reserves our proved reserves will decline as those reserves are produced our future reserves and production and therefore our future cash flow and results of operations are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves we may not be able to develop find or acquire sufficient additional reserves to replace our current and future production if we are unable to replace our    current and future production the value of our reserves will decrease and our busines s financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected conservation measures and technological advances could reduce or slow the demand for oil and natural gas fuel conservation measures alternative fuel requirements increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil natural gas and ngls technological advances in fuel economy and developments in energy generation devices could reduce or slow the demand for oil natural gas and ngls the impact of the changing demand for oil natural gas and ngls may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows we depend upon a small number of significant purchasers for the sale of most of our oil natural gas and ngl production we normally sell our production to a relatively small number of customers as is customary in our business for the years ended december   and  there were three purchasers who accounted for an aggregate  and  respectively of whr ii’s and esquisto’s total revenue on a combined basis during such years no other purchaser accounted for  or more of whr ii’s and esquisto’s revenue on a combined basis the loss of any such greater than  purchaser as a purchaser could adversely affect our revenues in the short term our operations may be exposed to significant delays costs and liabilities as a result of environmental and occupational health and safety requirements applicable to our business activities our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment health and safety aspects of our operations or otherwise relating to environmental protection these laws and regulations may impose numerous obligations applicable to our operations including the acquisition of a permit or other approval before conducting regulated activities the restriction of types quantities and concentration of materials that can be released into the environment the limitation or prohibition of drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness wetlands seismically active areas and other protected areas the application of specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection and the imposition of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations numerous governmental authorities such as the epa and analogous state agencies have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them such enforcement actions often involve difficult and costly compliance measures or corrective actions failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions including administrative civil or criminal penalties natural resource damages the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations and the issuance of orders limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations in addition we may experience delays in obtaining or be unable to obtain required permits which may delay or interrupt our operations and limit our growth and revenue certain environmental laws impose strict liability ie no showing of “fault” is required as well as joint and several liability for costs required to remediate and restore sites where hazardous substances hydrocarbons or solid wastes have been stored or released we may be required to remediate contaminated properties currently or formerly owned or operated by us or facilities of third parties that received waste generated by our operations regardless of whether such contamination resulted from the conduct of others or from consequences of our own actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken in connection with certain acquisitions we could acquire or be required to provide indemnification against environmental liabilities that could expose us to material losses in certain instances citizen groups also have the ability to bring legal proceedings against us if we are not in compliance with environmental laws or to challenge our ability to receive environmental permits that we need to operate in addition claims for damages to persons or property including natural resources may result from the environmental health and safety impacts of our operations our insurance may not cover all environmental risks and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage if an environmental claim is made against us moreover public interest in the protection of the environment has increased dramatically in recent years the trend of more expansive and stringent environmental legislation and regulations applied to the crude oil and natural gas industry could continue resulting in increased costs of doing business and consequently affecting profitability to the extent laws are enacted or other governmental action is taken that restricts drilling or imposes more stringent and costly operating waste handling disposal and cleanup requirements our business prospects financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected we may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of our operations additionally we may not be insured for or our insurance may be inadequate to protect us against these risks we are not insured against all risks losses and liabilities arising from uninsured and underinsured events could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations    our developme nt activities are subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing oil and natural gas including the possibility of   • environmental hazards such as uncontrollable releases of oil natural gas brine well fluids toxic gas or other pollution into the environment including groundwater air and shoreline contamination   • abnormally pressured formations   • mechanical difficulties such as stuck oilfield drilling and service tools and casing collapse   • fires explosions and ruptures of pipelines   • personal injuries and death   • natural disasters and   • terrorist attacks targeting oil and natural gas related facilities and infrastructure any of these events could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial loss to us as a result of claims for   • injury or loss of life   • damage to and destruction of property natural resources and equipment   • pollution and other environmental damage   • regulatory investigations and penalties and   • repair and remediation costs we may elect not to obtain insurance for any or all of these risks if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented in addition pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable the occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our business is difficult to evaluate because we have a limited operating history and we are susceptible to the potential difficulties associated with rapid growth and expansion whr ii and esquisto were formed in  and  respectively as a result there is only limited historical financial and operating information available upon which to base your evaluation of our performance in addition we have grown rapidly over the last several years our management believes that our future success depends on our ability to manage the rapid growth that we have experienced and the demands from increased responsibility on management personnel prior to our initial public offering whr ii and esquisto had separate management teams and going forward we will have one management team further the transition services agreement we entered into with affiliates of esquisto holdings in connection with the closing of our initial public offering is effective for six months additionally the following factors could present difficulties   • increased responsibilities for our executive level personnel   • increased administrative burden   • increased capital requirements and   • increased organizational challenges common to large expansive operations our operating results could be adversely affected if we do not successfully manage these potential difficulties the historical financial information incorporated herein is not necessarily indicative of the results that may be realized in the future in addition our operating history is limited and the results from our current producing wells are not necessarily indicative of success from our future drilling operations properties that we decide to drill may not yield oil or natural gas in commercially viable quantities properties that we decide to drill that do not yield oil or natural gas in commercially viable quantities will adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition there is no way to predict in advance of drilling and testing whether any particular    prospect will yield oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to recover drilling or completion costs or to b e economically viable the use of microseismic data and other technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area will not enable us to know conclusively prior to drilling whether oil or natural gas will be present or if present whether oil or natural gas will be present in commercial quantities we cannot assure you that the analogies we draw from available data from other wells more fully explored prospects or producing fields will be applicable to our drilling prospects further our dril ling operations may be curtailed delayed or cancelled as a result of numerous factors including   • unexpected drilling conditions   • title issues   • pressure or lost circulation in formations   • equipment failures or accidents   • adverse weather conditions   • compliance with environmental and other governmental or contractual requirements and   • increases in the cost of and shortages or delays in the availability of electricity supplies materials drilling or workover rigs equipment and services we may be unable to make attractive acquisitions or successfully integrate acquired businesses and any inability to do so may disrupt our business and hinder our ability to grow in the future we may make acquisitions of assets or businesses that complement or expand our current business however there is no guarantee we will be able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities in the event we are able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities we may not be able to complete the acquisition or do so on commercially acceptable terms competition for acquisitions may also increase the cost of or cause us to refrain from completing acquisitions the success of completed acquisitions will depend on our ability to integrate effectively the acquired business into our existing operations the process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our managerial and financial resources in addition possible future acquisitions may be larger and for purchase prices significantly higher than those paid for earlier acquisitions no assurance can be given that we will be able to identify additional suitable acquisition opportunities negotiate acceptable terms obtain financing for acquisitions on acceptable terms or successfully acquire identified targets our failure to achieve consolidation savings to integrate the acquired businesses and assets into our existing operations successfully or to minimize any unforeseen operational difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition our revolving credit facility imposes certain limitations on our ability to enter into mergers or combination transactions and to incur certain indebtedness which could indirectly limit our ability to acquire assets and businesses certain of our properties are subject to land use restrictions which could limit the manner in which we conduct our business certain of our properties are subject to land use restrictions including city ordinances which could limit the manner in which we conduct our business such restrictions could affect among other things our access to and the permissible uses of our facilities as well as the manner in which we produce oil and natural gas and may restrict or prohibit drilling in general the costs we incur to comply with such restrictions may be significant in nature and we may experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of development activities and perhaps even be precluded from the drilling of wells the unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs equipment supplies personnel and oilfield services could adversely affect our ability to execute our development plans within our budget and on a timely basis the demand for drilling rigs pipe and other equipment and supplies as well as for qualified and experienced field personnel to drill wells and conduct field operations geologists geophysicists engineers and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry can fluctuate significantly often in correlation with oil natural gas and ngl prices causing periodic shortages of supplies and needed personnel our operations are concentrated in areas in which oilfield activity levels had increased rapidly and as a result demand for such drilling rigs equipment and personnel as well as access to transportation processing and refining facilities in these areas had increased as did the costs for those items however beginning in the second half of  commodity prices began to decline and the demand for goods and services subsided due to reduced activity to the extent that commodity prices improve in the future the demand for and prices of these goods and services are likely to increase and we could encounter delays in or an inability to secure the    personnel equipment power services resources and facilities access necessary for us to resume or increase our development activities which could result in production volumes being below our forecasted volu mes in addition any such negative effect on production volumes or significant increases in costs could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and profitability furthermore if we are unable to secure a sufficient number of drilling rigs at re asonable costs we may not be able to drill all of our acreage before our leases expire we could experience periods of higher costs if commodity prices rise these increases could reduce our profitability cash flow and ability to complete development activities as planned historically our capital and operating costs have risen during periods of increasing oil natural gas and ngl prices these cost increases result from a variety of factors beyond our control such as increases in the cost of electricity steel and other raw materials that we and our vendors rely upon increased demand for labor services and materials as drilling activity increases and increased taxes decreased levels of drilling activity in the oil and natural gas industry in recent periods have led to declining costs of some drilling equipment materials and supplies however such costs may rise faster than increases in our revenue if commodity prices rise thereby negatively impacting our profitability cash flow and ability to complete development activities as scheduled and on budget this impact may be magnified to the extent that our ability to participate in the commodity price increases is limited by our derivative activities a change in the jurisdictional characterization of some of our assets by federal state or local regulatory agencies or a change in policy by those agencies may result in increased regulation of our assets which may cause our revenues to decline and operating expenses to increase section b of the nga exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by the ferc as a natural gas company under the nga we believe that the natural gas pipelines in our gathering systems meet the traditional tests ferc has used to establish a pipeline’s status as a gatherer not subject to regulation as a natural gas company however the distinction between fercregulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services is the subject of ongoing litigation so the classification and regulation of our gathering facilities are subject to change based on future determinations by ferc the courts or congress if the ferc were to consider the status of an individual facility and determine that the facility andor services provided by it are not exempt from ferc regulation the rates for and terms and conditions of services provided by such facility would be subject to regulation by the ferc such regulation could decrease revenues increase operating costs and depending upon the facility in question could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows in addition if any of our facilities were found to have provided services or otherwise operated in violation of the nga this could result in the imposition of civil penalties as well as a requirement to disgorge charges collected for such service in excess of the costbased rate established by the ferc state regulation of gathering facilities generally includes various safety environmental and in some circumstances nondiscriminatory take requirements and complaintbased rate regulation we cannot predict what new or different regulations federal and state regulatory agencies may adopt or what effect subsequent regulation may have on our activities such regulations may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition result of operations and cash flows we may be involved in legal proceedings that could result in substantial liabilities like many oil and gas companies we are from time to time involved in various legal and other proceedings such as title royalty or contractual disputes regulatory compliance matters and personal injury or property damage matters in the ordinary course of our business such legal proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted regardless of the outcome such proceedings could have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs diversion of management and other personnel and other factors in addition it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in liability penalties or sanctions as well as judgments consent decrees or orders requiring a change in our business practices which could materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition accruals for such liability penalties or sanctions may be insufficient and judgments and estimates to determine accruals or range of losses related to legal and other proceedings could change from one period to the next and such changes could be material climate change laws and regulations restricting emissions of ghgs could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce while potential physical effects of climate change could disrupt our production and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects in response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide methane and other ghgs present an endangerment to public health and the environment the epa has adopted regulations pursuant to the federal clean air act to reduce ghg emissions from various sources for example the epa requires certain large stationary sources to obtain preconstruction and operating permits for pollutants regulated under the prevention of significant deterioration and title v programs of the clean air act facilities required to obtain    preconstruction permits for such pollutants are also required to meet “best available control technology” standards that are being established by the states these regulatory requirements could adversely affect our operations and restrict or delay our ability to obtain air permits for new or modified sources the epa has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of ghg emissions from specified onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production sources in the united states on an annual basis which include certain of our operations in may  the epa finalized rules that establish new controls for emissions of methane from new modified or reconstructed sources in the oil and natural gas sector including production processing transmission and storage activities compliance will require enhanced recordkeeping practices the purchase of new equipment and could result in the increased frequency of maintenance and repair activities to address emissions leakage at well sites and compressor stations and also may require additional personnel time to support these activities or the engagement of third party contractors to assist with and verify compliance the epa has also announced that it intends to impose methane emission standards for existing sources but to date has not yet issued a proposal and in  epa published a rule known as the clean power plan to limit ghg emissions from electric power plants in february  the supreme court stayed the implementation of the clean power plan while legal challenges to the rule proceed depending on the ultimate outcome of those challenges and how various states choose to implement this rule it may alter the power generation mix between natural gas coal oil and alternative energy sources which would ultimately affect the demand for natural gas and oil in electric generation while congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of ghgs there has not been significant activity in the form of adopted legislation to reduce ghg emissions at the federal level in recent years in the absence of such federal climate legislation a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking andor reducing ghg emissions by means of cap and trade programs cap and trade programs typically require major sources of ghg emissions to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those ghgs in addition efforts have been made and continue to be made in the international community toward the adoption of international treaties or protocols that would address global climate change issues for example in april  the united states signed the paris agreement which requires member nations to review and “represent a progression” in their intended nationally determined contributions which set ghg emission reduction goals every five years beginning in  the paris agreement which entered into force in november  includes pledges to voluntarily limit or reduce future emissions under the obama administration the united states was one of over  nations that have indicated an intent to comply with the agreement although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address ghg emissions would impact our business any such future laws and regulations imposing reporting obligations on or limiting emissions of ghgs from our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of ghgs associated with our operations substantial limitations on ghg emissions could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas we produce finally increasing concentrations of ghgs in the earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects such as increased frequency and severity of storms floods and other climatic events if any such effects were to occur they could have a material adverse effect on our operations federal state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing as well as governmental reviews of such activities could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and natural gas wells and adversely affect our production hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of oil andor natural gas from dense subsurface rock formations the hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water proppants and chemicals under pressure into targeted subsurface formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production we regularly use hydraulic fracturing as part of our operations hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions but certain federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process for example the epa has asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the federal safe drinking water act “sdwa” over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuels and published permitting guidance in february  addressing the performance of such activities using diesel fuels the epa has also issued final regulations under the federal clean air act establishing performance standards including standards for the capture of air emissions released during hydraulic fracturing and an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking under the toxic substances control act to require companies to disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing the epa also finalized rules in june  that prohibit the discharge of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants in addition congress has from time to time considered legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the sdwa and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process it is unclear how any additional federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing activities may affect our operations    certain governmental reviews are either underway or have been conducted that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices for example in december  the epa released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources the epa report concluded that “water cycle” activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources “under some cir cumstances” noting that the following hydraulic fracturing water cycle activities and local or regionalscale factors are more likely than others to result in more frequent or more severe impacts water withdrawals for fracturing in times or areas of low water availability surface spills during the management of fracturing fluids chemicals or produced water injection of fracturing fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity injection of fracturing fluids directly into groundwater resources discharge of inadequately treated fracturing wastewater to surface waters and disposal or storage of fracturing wastewater in unlined pits at the state level several states have adopted or are considering legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities for example in may  the railroad commission issued a “well integrity rule” which updates the requirements for drilling putting pipe down and cementing wells the rule also includes new testing and reporting requirements such as i the requirement to submit cementing reports after well completion or after cessation of drilling whichever is later and ii the imposition of additional testing on wells less than  feet below usable groundwater the well integrity rule took effect in january  local governments also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular if new or more stringent federal state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of development activities and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells legislation or regulatory initiatives intended to address seismic activity could restrict our drilling and production activities as well as our ability to dispose of produced water gathered from such activities which could have a material adverse effect on our business state and federal regulatory agencies have recently focused on a possible connection between the hydraulic fracturing related activities particularly the underground injection of wastewater into disposal wells and the increased occurrence of seismic activity and regulatory agencies at all levels are continuing to study the possible linkage between oil and gas activity and induced seismicity for example in  the united states geological study identified eight states including texas with areas of increased rates of induced seismicity that could be attributed to fluid injection or oil and gas extraction in addition a number of lawsuits have been filed in other states most recently in oklahoma alleging that disposal well operations have caused damage to neighboring properties or otherwise violated state and federal rules regulating waste disposal in response to these concerns regulators in some states are seeking to impose additional requirements including requirements in the permitting of produced water disposal wells or otherwise to assess the relationship between seismicity and the use of such wells for example in october  the railroad commission published a new rule governing permitting or repermitting of disposal wells that would require among other things the submission of information on seismic events occurring within a specified radius of the disposal well location as well as logs geologic cross sections and structure maps relating to the disposal area in question if the permittee or an applicant of a disposal well permit fails to demonstrate that the produced water or other fluids are confined to the disposal zone or if scientific data indicates such a disposal well is likely to be or determined to be contributing to seismic activity then the agency may deny modify suspend or terminate the permit application or existing operating permit for that well the railroad commission has used this authority to deny permits for waste disposal wells in some instances regulators may also order that disposal wells be shut in for example in september  the oklahoma corporations commission ordered that all disposal wells with a certain proximity to a particular earthquake in central oklahoma be shut in we dispose of large volumes of produced water gathered from our drilling and production operations by injecting it into wells pursuant to permits issued to us by governmental authorities overseeing such disposal activities while these permits are issued pursuant to existing laws and regulations these legal requirements are subject to change which could result in the imposition of more stringent operating constraints or new monitoring and reporting requirements owing to among other things concerns of the public or governmental authorities regarding such gathering or disposal activities the adoption and implementation of any new laws or regulations that restrict our ability to use hydraulic fracturing or dispose of produced water gathered from our drilling and production activities by limiting volumes disposal rates disposal well locations or otherwise or requiring us to shut down disposal wells could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations    competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense making it more difficult for us to acquire properties market oil or natural gas and secure trained personnel our ability to acquire additional prospects and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties for acquisitions and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties marketing oil and natural gas and securing trained personnel also there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and natural gas industry many of our competitors possess and employ greater financial technical and personnel resources than we do those companies may be able to pay more for productive properties and exploratory prospects and to evaluate bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or personnel resources permit in addition other companies may be able to offer better compensation packages to attract and retain qualified personnel than we are able to offer the cost to attract and retain qualified personnel has historically continually increased due to competition and may increase substantially in the future we may not be able to compete successfully in the future in acquiring prospective reserves developing reserves marketing hydrocarbons attracting and retaining quality personnel and raising additional capital which could have a material adverse effect on our business ngp and their affiliates are not limited in their ability to compete with us which could cause conflicts of interest and limit our ability to acquire additional assets or businesses our governing documents provide that ngp and their respective affiliates including ngp and its affiliates’ portfolio investments are not restricted from owning assets or engaging in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us in addition ngp and their respective affiliates may acquire develop or dispose of additional oil and natural gas properties or other assets in the future without any obligation to offer us the opportunity to purchase or develop any of those assets ngp are established participants in the oil and natural gas industry and have resources greater than ours which factors may make it more difficult for us to compete with them with respect to commercial activities as well as for potential acquisitions as a result competition from these affiliates could adversely impact our results of operations the loss of senior management or technical personnel could adversely affect operations we depend on the services of our senior management and technical personnel we do not maintain nor do we plan to obtain any insurance against the loss of any of these individuals the loss of the services of our senior management or technical personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations increases in interest rates could adversely affect our business we require continued access to capital and our business and operating results can be harmed by factors such as the availability terms of and cost of capital increases in interest rates or a reduction in credit rating we expect to use our revolving credit facility to finance a portion of our future growth and these changes could cause our cost of doing business to increase limit our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities reduce cash flow used for drilling and place us at a competitive disadvantage recent and continuing disruptions and volatility in the global financial markets may lead to a contraction in credit availability impacting our ability to finance our operations a significant reduction in cash flows from operations or the availability of credit could materially and adversely affect our ability to achieve our planned growth and operating results          certain us federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to natural gas and oil exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of future legislation in past years legislation has been proposed that would if enacted into law make significant changes to us tax laws including to certain key us federal income tax provisions currently available to oil and gas exploration and production companies such legislative changes have included but not been limited to i the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties ii the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs iii the elimination of the deduction for certain domestic production activities and iv an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures it is unclear whether these or similar changes will be enacted and if enacted how soon any such changes could become effective congress could consider and could include some or all of these proposals as part of tax reform legislation to accompany lower federal income tax rates  moreover other more general features of tax reform legislation including changes to cost recovery rules and to the deductibility of interest expense may be developed that also would change the taxation of oil and gas companies  it is unclear whether these or similar changes will be enacted and if enacted how soon any such changes could take effect  the passage of any legislation as a result of these proposals or any similar changes in us federal income tax laws could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that currently are available with respect to oil and gas development or increase costs and any such changes could have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows    our use of seismic data is subject to interpretation and may not accurately identify the presence of oil and natural gas which could adversely affect the results of our drilling operat ions even when properly used and interpreted seismic data and visualization techniques are only tools used to assist geoscientists in identifying subsurface structures and hydrocarbon indicators and do not enable the interpreter to know whether hydrocarbons are in fact present in those structures as a result our drilling activities may not be successful or economical in addition the use of advanced technologies such as d seismic data requires greater predrilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies and we could incur losses as a result of such expenditures restrictions on drilling activities intended to protect certain species of wildlife may adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities in areas where we operate oil and natural gas operations in our operating areas may be adversely affected by seasonal or permanent restrictions on drilling activities designed to protect various wildlife such restrictions may limit our ability to operate in protected areas and can intensify competition for drilling rigs oilfield equipment services supplies and qualified personnel which may lead to periodic shortages when drilling is allowed these constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay our operations or materially increase our operating and capital costs permanent restrictions imposed to protect threatened or endangered species or their habitat could prohibit drilling in certain areas or require the implementation of expensive mitigation measures the designation of previously unprotected species in areas where we operate as threatened or endangered could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our activities that could have a material and adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce our reserves the enactment of derivatives legislation could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price interest rate and other risks associated with our business the doddfrank act enacted on july   established federal oversight and regulation of the overthecounter derivatives market and of entities such as us that participate in that market the dodd frank act requires the cftc and the sec to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the dodd frank act in its rulemaking under the doddfrank act in november  the cftc proposed new rules that would place limits on positions in certain core futures and equivalent swaps contracts for or linked to certain physical commodities subject to exceptions for certain bona fide hedging transactions as these new position limit rules are not yet final the impact of those provisions on us is uncertain at this time the doddfrank act and cftc rules also will require us in connection with certain derivatives activities to comply with clearing and tradeexecution requirements or to take steps to qualify for an exemption to such requirements in addition the cftc and certain banking regulators have recently adopted final rules establishing minimum margin requirements for uncleared swaps although we currently qualify for the enduser exception to the mandatory clearing tradeexecution and margin requirements for swaps entered to hedge our commercial risks the application of such requirements to other market participants such as swap dealers may change the cost and availability of the swaps that we use for hedging in addition if any of our swaps do not qualify for the commercial enduser exception posting of collateral could impact liquidity and reduce cash available to us for capital expenditures therefore reducing our ability to execute hedges to reduce risk and protect cash flow it is not possible at this time to predict with certainty the full effects of the doddfrank act and cftc rules on us or the timing of such effects the doddfrank act and any new regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts materially alter the terms of derivative contracts reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter and reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts if we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the doddfrank act and cftc rules our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures finally the doddfrank act was intended in part to reduce the volatility of oil natural gas and ngl prices which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil natural gas and ngl our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the doddfrank act and cftc rules is to lower commodity prices any of these consequences could have a material and adverse effect on us our financial condition or our results of operations in addition the european union and other nonus jurisdictions are implementing regulations with respect to the derivatives market to the extent we transact with counterparties in foreign jurisdictions we may become subject to such regulations the impact of which is not clear at this time we may not be able to keep pace with technological developments in our industry the oil and natural gas industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancement and the introduction of new products and services using new technologies as others use or develop new technologies we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage or may be forced by competitive pressures to implement those new technologies at substantial costs in addition other    oil and natural gas companies may have greater financial technical and personn el resources that allow them to enjoy technological advantages and that may in the future allow them to implement new technologies before we can we may not be able to respond to these competitive pressures or implement new technologies on a timely basis o r at an acceptable cost if one or more of the technologies we use now or in the future were to become obsolete our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected our business could be adversely affected by security threats including cybersecurity threats and related disruptions we rely heavily on our information systems and the availability and integrity of these systems are essential for us to conduct our business and operations as a producer of natural gas and oil we face various security threats including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to our sensitive information or to render our information or systems unusable and threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure or thirdparty facilities and infrastructure such as gathering and processing and other facilities refineries and pipelines the potential for such security threats subjects our operations to increased risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows our implementation of various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate such security threats and to increase security for our information systems facilities and infrastructure may result in increased costs moreover there can be no assurance that such procedures and controls will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring if any of these security breaches were to occur they could lead to losses of or damage to sensitive information or facilities infrastructure and systems essential to our business and operations as well as data corruption communication interruptions or other disruptions to our operations which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and cash flows risks related our common stock if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our common stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations our stock price could decline we expect that the trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly we could lose visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline moreover if one or more of the analysts who cover our company downgrades our common stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations our stock price could decline ngp has the ability to direct the voting of a majority of our common stock and its interests may conflict with those of our other stockholders ngp and its affiliates through wildhorse holdings esquisto holdings acquisition co holdings and ngp xi beneficially own approximately  of our outstanding common stock as a result ngp is currently able to control matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors changes to our organizational documents and significant corporate transactions this concentration of ownership makes it unlikely that any other holder or group of holders of our common stock will be able to affect the way we are managed or the direction of our business the interests of ngp with respect to matters potentially or actually involving or affecting us such as future acquisitions financings and other corporate opportunities and attempts to acquire us may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders given this concentrated ownership ngp would have to approve any potential acquisition of us in addition certain of our directors are currently employees of ngp these directors’ duties as employees of ngp may conflict with their duties as our directors and the resolution of these conflicts may not always be in our or your best interest furthermore we are party to a stockholders’ agreement with wildhorse holdings esquisto holdings and acquisition co holdings that provides wildhorse holdings and esquisto holdings with the right to designate a certain number of nominees to our board of directors so long as they acquisition co holdings ngp xi and their affiliates collectively beneficially own more than  of the outstanding shares of our common stock  the existence of a significant stockholder and the stockholders’ agreement may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in management or limiting the ability of our other stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in the best interests of our company moreover ngp’s concentration of stock ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock to the extent investors perceive a disadvantage in owning stock of a company with a significant stockholder    certain of our directors have significant duties with and spend significant time serving entities that may compete with us in seeking acquisitions and business opportunities and according ly may have conflicts of interest in allocating time or pursuing business opportunities certain of our directors who are responsible for managing the direction of our operations and acquisition activities hold positions of responsibility with other entities including ngpaffiliated entities that are in the business of identifying and acquiring oil and natural gas properties for example three of our directors messrs gieselman hayes and weber are partners or managing partners of ngp which is in the business of investing in oil and natural gas companies with independent management teams that seek to acquire oil and natural gas properties and mr brannon is president of certain ngp portfolio companies the existing positions held by these directors may give rise to fiduciary or other duties that are in conflict with the duties they owe to us these directors may become aware of business opportunities that may be appropriate for presentation to us as well as to the other entities with which they are or may become affiliated due to these existing and potential future affiliations they may present potential business opportunities to other entities prior to presenting them to us which could cause additional conflicts of interest they may also decide that certain opportunities are more appropriate for other entities with which they are affiliated and as a result they may elect not to present those opportunities to us these conflicts may not be resolved in our favor ngp and its affiliates are not limited in their ability to compete with us and the corporate opportunity provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation could enable ngp to benefit from corporate opportunities that might otherwise be available to us our governing documents will provide that ngp and its affiliates including portfolio investments of ngp and its affiliates are not restricted from owning assets or engaging in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us in particular subject to the limitations of applicable law our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will among other things   • permit ngp and its affiliates to conduct business that competes with us and to make investments in any kind of property in which we may make investments and   • provide that if ngp or any of its affiliates or any employee partner member manager officer or director of ngp or its affiliates who is also one of our directors or officers becomes aware of a potential business opportunity transaction or other matter they will have no duty to communicate or offer that opportunity to us currently ngp has multiple portfolio companies operating in the oil and natural gas industry some of which may compete with us directly including one company which operates in the broader eagle ford further ngp or its affiliates may become aware from time to time of certain business opportunities such as acquisition opportunities and may direct such opportunities to other businesses in which they have invested in which case we may not become aware of or otherwise have the ability or option to pursue such opportunity such businesses may choose to compete with us for these opportunities possibly causing these opportunities to be unavailable to or more expensive for us to pursue in this regard we do not expect to enter into any agreement or arrangement with ngp and its affiliates to apportion opportunities between us on the one hand and ngp and its affiliates on the other hand in addition ngp and its affiliates may dispose of oil and natural gas properties or other assets in the future without any obligation to offer us the opportunity to purchase any of those assets as a result our renouncing our interest and expectancy in any business opportunity that may be from time to time presented to ngp or its affiliates could adversely impact our business or prospects if attractive business opportunities are procured by such parties for their own benefit rather than for ours ngp is an established participant in the oil and natural gas industry and has access to resources greater than ours which may make it more difficult for us to compete with ngp and its affiliates for commercial activities and potential acquisitions we cannot assure you that any conflicts that may arise between us and our stockholders on the one hand and ngp or its affiliates on the other hand will be resolved in our favor as a result competition from ngp and its affiliates could adversely impact our results of operations      we are a “co ntrolled company” and as a result qualify for and intend to rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements a group of stockholders that includes wildhorse investment holdings esquisto investment holdings wildhorse holdings esquisto holdings acquisition co holdings ngp xi ngp and certain of ngp’s affiliates collectively the “sponsor group” beneficially control a majority of the combined voting power of all classes of our outstanding voting stock as a result we qualify as a “controlled company” within the meaning of the nyse corporate governance standards under these rules a company of which more than  of the voting power for the election of directors is held by an individual group or another company is a “controlled company” and may elect not to comply with certain applicable corporate governance requirements including the requirements that   • a majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors   • the nominating and corporate governance committee be composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities   • the compensation committee be composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities and   • an annual performance evaluation of the nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees we utilize the foregoing exemptions from the applicable corporate governance requirements  as a result we do not have a majority of independent directors and do not have a compensation committee  accordingly you will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such corporate governance requirements the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly and you could lose all or part of your investment volatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent you from being able to sell your common stock at or above the price you paid for your common stock the market price for our common stock could fluctuate significantly for various reasons including   • our operating and financial performance and prospects   • changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts who track our common stock or industry   • market and industry perception of our success or lack thereof in pursuing our growth strategy and   • sales of common stock by us our stockholders including the sponsor group or members of our management team in addition the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations in recent years this volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies including companies in our industries the changes frequently appear to occur without regard to the operating performance of the affected companies hence the price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with us and these fluctuations could materially reduce our share price we currently have no plans to pay regular dividends on our common stock so you may not receive funds without selling your common stock we currently have no plans to pay regular dividends on our common stock any payment of dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board and will depend on among other things our earnings financial condition and business opportunities the restrictions in our debt agreements and other considerations that our board deems relevant accordingly you may have to sell some or all of your common stock in order to generate cash flow from your investment future sales of our common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales may occur could reduce our stock price and any additional capital raised by us through the sale of equity or convertible securities may dilute your ownership in us we may sell additional shares of common stock in subsequent public offerings or otherwise including to finance acquisitions we may also issue convertible securities we cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or securities convertible into common stock or the effect if any that future issuances and sales of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock sales of substantial amounts of our common stock including any shares issued in connection with an acquisition or the perception that such sales could occur may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock each of wildhorse holdings esquisto holdings acquisition co holdings and ngp xi are party to a registration rights agreement which requires us to effect the registration of its shares in certain circumstances    we filed a registration statement with the sec on form s providing for the registration of  shares of our common stock issued or reserved for issuance under our wildhorse resource development corporation  long term incentive plan subject to the satisfaction of vesting conditions and the expiration of lockup agreements shares registered under our registration statement on form s are available for resale immediately in the public market without restriction our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws as well as delaware law contain provisions that could discourage acquisition bids or merger proposals which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and could deprive our investors of the opportunity to receive a premium for their shares our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors without stockholder approval to issue preferred stock in one or more series designate the number of shares constituting any series and fix the rights preferences privileges and restrictions thereof including dividend rights voting rights rights and terms of redemption redemption price or prices and liquidation preferences of such series if our board of directors elects to issue preferred stock the terms of such stock could cause it to be more difficult for a third party to acquire us in addition some provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us even if the change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders these provisions include   • the sponsor group no longer collectively own or control the voting of more than  of our outstanding common stock   o dividing our board of directors into three classes of directors with each class serving a staggered threeyear term   o providing that all vacancies including newly created directorships may except as otherwise required by law or if applicable subject to the rights of holders of a series of preferred stock only be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office even if less than a quorum prior to such time vacancies may also be filled by stockholders holding a majority of the outstanding shares   o permitting any action by stockholders to be taken only at an annual meeting or special meeting rather than by a written consent of the stockholders subject to the rights of any series of preferred stock with respect to such rights   o permitting special meetings of our stockholders to be called only by our board of directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of the total number of authorized directors whether or not there exist any vacancies in previously authorized directorships prior to such time a special meeting may also be called at the request of stockholders holding a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote and   o requiring the affirmative vote of the holders of at least  in voting power of all then outstanding common stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors voting together as a single class to remove any or all of the directors from office at any time and directors will be removable only for “cause”   • prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors     • establishing advance notice provisions for stockholder proposals and nominations for elections to the board of directors to be acted upon at meetings of stockholders and   • providing that the board of directors is expressly authorized to adopt or to alter or repeal our bylaws we have engaged in transactions with our affiliates and expect to do so in the future the terms of such transactions and the resolution of any conflicts that may arise may not always be in our or our stockholders’ best interests we have engaged in transactions and expect to continue to engage in transactions with affiliated companies the resolution of any conflicts that may arise in connection with any related party transactions that we have entered into with ngp wildhorse holdings esquisto holdings acquisition co holdings or their affiliates including pricing duration or other terms of service may not always be in our or our stockholders’ best interests because ngp may have the ability to influence the outcome of these conflicts for a discussion of potential conflicts please read “—ngp has the ability to direct the voting of a majority of our common stock and its interests may conflict with those of our other stockholders” we may issue preferred stock the terms of which could adversely affect the voting power or value of our common stock our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue without the approval of our stockholders one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations preferences limitations and relative rights including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions as our board of directors may determine the terms of one or more classes or se ries of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our common stock for example we might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or    th e right to veto specified transactions similarly the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock for as long as we are an emerging growth company we will not be required to comply with certain reporting requirements including those relating to accounting standards and disclosure about our executive compensation that apply to other public companies we are classified as an “emerging growth company” under the jobs act for as long as we are an emerging growth company which may be up to five full fiscal years unlike other public companies we will not be required to among other things i provide an auditor’s attestation report on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section b of the sarbanesoxley act ii comply with any new requirements adopted by the pcaob requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and the financial statements of the issuer iii provide certain disclosures regarding executive compensation required of larger public companies or iv hold nonbinding advisory votes on executive compensation we will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years although we will lose that status sooner if we have more than  billion of revenues in a fiscal year have more than  million in market value of our common stock held by nonaffiliates or issue more than  billion of nonconvertible debt over a threeyear period to the extent that we rely on any of the exemptions available to emerging growth companies you will receive less information about our executive compensation and internal control over financial reporting than issuers that are not emerging growth companies if some investors find our common stock to be less attractive as a result there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile the requirements of being a public company including compliance with the reporting requirements of the exchange act and the requirements of the sarbanesoxley act may strain our resources increase our costs and distract management and we may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or costeffective manner as a public company we are required to comply with new laws regulations and requirements certain corporate governance provisions of the sarbanesoxley act related regulations of the sec and the requirements of the nyse which we were not required to comply with as a private company we expect efforts to comply with these statutes regulations and requirements may occupy a significant amount of time of our board of directors and management and may significantly increase our costs and expenses as a public company we are required to   • institute a more comprehensive compliance function   • comply with stock exchange rules     • continue to prepare and distribute periodic public reports in compliance with our obligations under the federal securities laws   • establish new internal policies such as those relating to insider trading and   • involve and retain to a greater degree outside counsel and accountants in the above activities furthermore while we generally must comply with section  of the sarbanes oxley act for our fiscal year ending december   we are not required to have our independent registered public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls until our first annual report subsequent to our ceasing to be an “emerging growth company” within the meaning of section a of the securities act accordingly we may not be required to have our independent registered public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls until as late as our annual report for the fiscal year ending december   once it is required to do so our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented designed operated or reviewed compliance with these requirements may strain our resources increase our costs and distract management and we may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or costeffective manner in addition being a public company subject to these rules and regulations makes it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage as a result it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers we are currently evaluating these rules and we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs    our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the court of chancery of the state of delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and pr oceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors officers employees or agents our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum the court of chancery of the state of delaware will to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law be the sole and exclusive forum for i any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf ii any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors officers employees or agents to us or our stockholders iii any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the delaware general corporation law our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our bylaws or iv any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine in each such case subject to such court of chancery having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation described in the preceding sentence this choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors officers employees or agents which may discourage such lawsuits against us and such persons alternatively if a court were to find these provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation inapplicable to or unenforceable in respect of one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations if we fail to develop or maintain an effective system of internal controls we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud as a result current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting which would harm our business and the trading price of our common stock effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports prevent fraud and operate successfully as a public company if we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud our reputation and operating results would be harmed we cannot be certain that our efforts to develop and maintain our internal controls will be successful that we will be able to maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future or that we will be able to comply with our obligations under section  of the sarbanes oxley act any failure to develop or maintain effective internal controls or difficulties encountered in implementing or improving our internal controls could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations ineffective internal controls could also cause

interests in esquisto investment holdings ii wildhorse investment holdings contributed all of the interests in whr ii to wildhorse holdings esquisto investment holdings contributed all of the interests in esquisto to esquisto holdings and the former owner of acquisition co contributed all of its interests in acquisition co to acquisition co holdings iii wildhorse holdings esquisto holdings and acquisition co holdings issued management incentive units to certain of our officers and employees as described in this annual report and iv wildhorse holdings esquisto holdings and acquisition co holdings contributed all of the interests in whr ii esquisto and acquisition co respectively to us in exchange for shares of our common stock we refer to these reorganization transactions as the “corporate reorganization” as a result of the corporate reorganization whr ii esquisto and acquisition co became direct wholly owned subsidiaries of wildhorse resource development corporation outlook our financial position and future prospects including our revenues operating results profitability liquidity future growth and the value of our assets depend primarily on prevailing commodity prices the oil and natural gas industry is cyclical and commodity prices are highly volatile  during  and the first half of  the global oil supply continued to outpace demand resulting in a decline in realized prices for oil production in general this imbalance between supply and demand reflects the significant supply growth achieved in the united states as a result of shale drilling and oil production increases by certain other countries including russia and saudi arabia as part of an effort to retain market share combined with only modest demand growth in the united states and lessthanexpected demand in other parts of the world particularly in europe and china starting in  and continuing into  commodity prices dropped significantly with the west texas intermediate posted price declining from  per bbl in june  to approximately  per bbl in january  and the henry hub spot market price declining from over  per mmbtu in february  to less than  per mmbtu in march  ngl prices have also suffered significant declines a combination of oversupply from production growth and weaker demand due to weak economic activity and increased efficiency has contributed to the falling prices the us energy information administration’s or eia’s february  shortterm energy outlook forecasts that brent crude oil prices will average  per bbl in  and  per bbl in  north sea brent crude oil spot prices averaged  per bbl in january  an increase of  per bbl from the january  average and the highest monthly average since july  world crude oil supply grew an estimated  mmbbld and global oil inventory draws will average  mmbbld and  mmbbld in  and  respectively like brent crude oil prices wti prices have increased the eia expects wti crude oil prices to average  per bbl lower than brent in  the eia expects that natural gas production will increase by  bcfd in  compared to   production is expected to increase by an additional  bcfd in   the eia expects increased capacity for natural gasfired electric generation growing domestic natural gas consumption and new export capabilities will cause the henry hub natural gas spot price to rise from a projected average of  per mmbtu in  to  per mmbtu in     we established a full year  drilling and completion capital expenditure budget that is  million to  million  in our north louisiana acreage we recommenced drilling by adding one rig in late  and intend to add one additional d rilling rig in   in our eagle ford acreage we are currently running a fiverig program and intend to remain at five rigs in   we expect to fund our  development from cash flows from operations borrowings under our revolving credit facility and from proceeds received from our  senior notes offering see “part i item  business—recent developments” for additional information regarding our  senior notes lower oil natural gas and ngl prices not only reduce our revenues and cash flows but also may limit the amount of oil natural gas and ngls that we can produce economically and therefore potentially lower our reserves lower commodity prices in the future could also result in impairments of our oil and natural gas properties and may also reduce the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility which will be determined by the lenders in their sole discretion based upon projected revenues from our oil natural gas and ngl properties and our commodity derivative contracts the occurrence of any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our future business financial condition results of operations operating cash flows liquidity or ability to finance planned capital expenditures alternatively higher oil natural gas and ngl prices may result in significant noncash fair value losses being incurred on our derivatives which could cause us to experience net losses when oil and natural gas prices rise sources of our revenues our revenues are derived from the sale of our oil and natural gas production the sale of ngls that are extracted from our natural gas during processing and the gathering charge paid by certain third parties for their share of volumes that run through our gathering system production revenues are derived entirely from the continental united states for the year ended december   we derived approximately  of our revenues from oil sales  from natural gas sales  from ngl sales and  from gathering charges natural gas ngl and oil prices are inherently volatile and are influenced by many factors outside our control in order to reduce the impact of fluctuations in natural gas and oil prices on revenues or to protect the economics of property acquisitions we intend to periodically enter into derivative contracts with respect to a significant portion of estimated natural gas and oil production through various transactions that fix the future prices received our oil natural gas and ngl revenues do not include the effects of derivatives principal components of cost structure costs associated with producing oil natural gas and ngls are substantial some of these costs vary with commodity prices some trend with the type and volume of production and others are a function of the number of wells we own the sections below summarize the primary operating costs we typically incur   • lease operating expenses lease operating expenses “loe” are the costs incurred in the operation of producing properties and workover costs expenses for utilities direct labor water injection and disposal workover rigs and workover expenses materials and supplies comprise the most significant portion of our loe certain items such as direct labor and materials and supplies generally remain relatively fixed across broad production volume ranges but can fluctuate depending on activities performed during a specific period for instance repairs to our pumping equipment or surface facilities result in increased loe in periods during which they are performed certain of our operating cost components are variable and increase or decrease as the level of produced hydrocarbons and water increases or decreases for example we incur power costs in connection with various productionrelated activities such as pumping to recover oil and natural gas and separation and treatment of water produced in connection with our oil and natural gas production we monitor our operations to ensure that we are incurring loe at an acceptable level for example we monitor our loe per boe to determine if any wells or properties should be shut in recompleted or sold this unit rate also allows us to monitor these costs in certain fields and geographic areas to identify trends and to benchmark against other producers although we strive to reduce our loe these expenses can increase or decrease on a per unit basis as a result of various factors as we operate our properties or make acquisitions and dispositions of properties for example we may increase fieldlevel expenditures to optimize our operations incurring higher expenses in one quarter relative to another or we may acquire or dispose of properties that have different loe per boe these initiatives would influence our overall operating cost and could cause fluctuations when comparing loe on a period to period basis   • gathering processing and transportation “gpt” these are costs incurred to deliver production of our natural gas ngls and oil to the market cost levels of these expenses can vary based on the volume of natural gas ngls and oil produced as well as the cost of commodity processing   • gathering system operating expense gathering system operating expenses include contract labor water disposal dehydration equipment rentals chemical and facilitiesrelated expenses and facility termination fees that are incurred in the operation of our north louisiana gathering system      • taxes other than income taxes production taxes are paid on produced oil and natural gas based on rates established by federal state or local ta xing authorities in general the production taxes we pay correlate to the changes in oil natural gas and ngls revenues production taxes for our texas properties are based on the market value of our production at the wellhead  production taxes for our l ouisiana properties are based on our gross production at the wellhead we are also subject to ad valorem taxes in the counties and parishes where our production is located ad valorem taxes for our texas properties are based on the fair market value of our mineral interests for producing wells ad valorem taxes for our louisiana properties are assessed based on the cost of our oil and gas properties louisiana imposes a capital based franchise tax on corporations based on capital employed within the state   • depreciation depletion and amortization depreciation depletion and amortization “dda” is the systematic expensing of the capitalized costs incurred to acquire and develop oil and natural gas properties we use the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and natural gas activities and as such we capitalize all costs associated with our development and acquisition efforts and all successful exploration efforts which are then allocated to each unit of production using the unit of production method please read “— critical accounting policies and estimates—successful efforts method of accounting for oil and natural gas activities” for further discussion our dda rate can fluctuate as a result of impairments dispositions finding and development costs and proved reserve volumes which are all impacted by oil natural gas and ngl prices   • impairment expense we review our proved properties and unproved leasehold costs for impairment whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that a decline in the recoverability of their carrying value may have occurred please read “—critical accounting policies and estimates—impairment of oil and natural gas properties” for further discussion   • general and administrative expenses general and administrative “ga” expenses are costs incurred for overhead including payroll and benefits for our corporate staff costs of maintaining our headquarters costs of managing our production and development operations stock based compensation public company expenses it expenses audit and other fees for professional services including legal compliance and acquisitionrelated expenses   • exploration expense exploration expense is geological and geophysical costs that include seismic surveying costs costs of unsuccessful exploratory dry holes and lease abandonment and delay rentals exploration expense also includes rig standby and rig contract termination fees   • incentive unit compensation expense see “— critical accounting policies and estimates—incentive units” contained herein for additional information   • interest expense we finance a portion of our working capital requirements and acquisitions with borrowings under revolving credit facilities and senior note issuances as a result we incur substantial interest expense that is affected by both fluctuations in interest rates and financing decisions we expect to continue to incur significant interest expense as we continue to grow  interest expense includes the amortization of debt issuance costs as well as the writeoff of unamortized debt issuance costs   • gain loss on derivative instruments net realized and unrealized gains on our derivatives are a function of fluctuations in the underlying commodity prices and the monthly settlement of the instruments given the volatility of commodity prices it is not possible to predict future reported unrealized marktomarket net gains or losses and the actual net gains or losses that will ultimately be realized upon settlement of the hedge positions in future years if commodity prices at settlement are lower than the prices of the hedge positions the hedges are expected to mitigate the otherwise negative effect on earnings of lower oil natural gas and ngl prices however if commodity prices at settlement are higher than the prices of the hedge positions the hedges are expected to dampen the otherwise positive effect on earnings of higher oil natural gas and ngl prices and will in this context be viewed as having resulted in an opportunity cost   • income tax expense we are a corporation subject to federal and certain state income taxes prior to our initial public offering we were primarily organized as passthrough entities for federal income tax purposes and were not subject to federal income taxes however one of our predecessor subsidiaries previously elected to be taxed as a corporation and was subject to federal and state income taxes critical accounting policies and estimates use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period we base our estimates on historical    experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basi s for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources we evaluate the estimates and assumptions on a regular basis however actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements significant estimates with regard to these financial statements include  the estimate of proved oil gas and ngl reserves and related present value estimates of future net cash flows therefrom  depreciation depletion and amortization expense  valuation of accounts receivable  accrued capital expenditures and liabilities  asset retirement obligations  environmental remediation costs  valuation of derivative instruments  contingent liabilities and  impairment expense although management believes these estimates are reasonable changes in facts and circumstances or discovery of new information may result in revised estimates and such revisions could be material successful efforts method of accounting for oil and natural gas activities we use the successful efforts method of accounting for natural gas and crude oil producing activities costs to acquire mineral interests in natural gas and crude oil properties are capitalized costs to drill and develop development wells and costs to drill and develop exploratory wells that find proved reserves are also capitalized  costs to drill exploratory wells that do not find proved reserves delay rentals and geological and geophysical costs are expensed impairment of oil and natural gas properties we acquire leases on acreage not associated with proved reserves or held by production with the expectation of ultimately assigning proved reserves and holding the leases with production the costs of acquiring these leases including primarily brokerage costs and amounts paid to lessors are capitalized and excluded from current amortization pending evaluation when proved reserves are assigned the leasehold costs associated with those leases are depleted as producing oil and gas properties costs associated with leases not held by production are impaired when events and circumstances indicate that carrying value of the properties is not recoverable capitalized costs of producing natural gas and crude oil properties and support equipment net of estimated salvage values are depleted by field using the unitsofproduction method well and well equipment and tangible property additions are depleted over proved developed reserves and leasehold costs are depleted over total proved reserves proved oil and gas properties are reviewed for impairment when events and circumstances indicate a potential decline in the fair value of such properties below the carrying value such as a downward revision of the reserve estimates or lower commodity prices we estimate the undiscounted future cash flows expected in connection with the properties and compare such future cash flows to the carrying amounts of the properties to determine if the carrying amounts are recoverable if the carrying value of the properties is determined to not be recoverable based on the undiscounted cash flows an impairment charge is recognized by comparing the carrying value to the estimated fair value of the properties the factors used to determine fair value include but are not limited to estimates of proved and probable reserves future commodity prices the timing of future production and capital expenditures and a discount rate commensurate with the risk reflective of the lives remaining for the respective oil and gas properties oil and natural gas reserve quantities the estimates of proved natural gas crude oil and ngl reserves utilized in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are estimated in accordance with guidelines established by the sec and the financial accounting standards board “fasb” which require that reserve estimates be prepared under existing economic and operating conditions using a month average price with no provision for price and cost escalations in future years except by contractual arrangements our estimates of proved reserves are based on the quantities of oil natural gas and ngls which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation reserves and economic evaluation of all of our properties are prepared on a wellbywell basis the accuracy of reserve estimates is a function of the   • quality and quantity of available data   • interpretation of that data   • accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions and   • judgment of the independent reserve engineer    one of the most significant estimates we make is the e stimate of oil natural gas and ngl reserves oil natural gas and ngl reserve estimates require significant judgments in the evaluation of all available geological geophysical engineering and economic data the data for a given field may change substant ially over time as a result of numerous factors including but not limited to additional development activity production history projected future production economic assumptions relating to commodity prices operating expenses severance and other taxe s capital expenditures and remediation costs and these estimates are inherently uncertain if estimates of proved reserves decline our dda rate will increase resulting in a decrease in net income a decline in estimates of proved reserves could also ca use us to perform an impairment analysis to determine if the carrying amount of oil and natural gas properties exceeds fair value and could result in an impairment charge which would reduce earnings we cannot predict what reserve revisions may be require d in future periods we intend to have our independent reserve engineer audit our internally prepared reserve report as of december  for each year depreciation depletion and amortization our dda rate is dependent upon our estimates of total proved and proved developed reserves which incorporate various assumptions and future projections if our estimates of total proved or proved developed reserves decline the rate at which we record dda expense increases which in turn reduces our net income such a decline in reserves may result from lower commodity prices or other changes to reserve estimates as discussed above and we are unable to predict changes in reserve quantity estimates as such quantities are dependent on the success of our exploration and development program as well as future economic conditions derivative instruments we utilize commodity derivative instruments including swaps and collars to manage the price risk associated with the forecasted sale of our oil and natural gas production a swap requires us to pay the counterparty if the settlement price exceeds the strike price and the same counterparty is required to pay us if the settlement price is less than the strike price a collar requires us to pay the counterparty if the settlement price is above the ceiling price and requires the counterparty to pay us if the settlement price is below the floor price the objective of our use of derivative financial instruments is to achieve more predictable cash flows in an environment of volatile oil gas and ngl prices and to manage our exposure to commodity price risk while the use of these derivative instruments limits the downside risk of adverse price movements such use may also limit our ability to benefit from favorable price movements we may from time to time add incremental derivatives to hedge additional production restructure existing derivative contracts or enter into new transactions to modify the terms of current contracts in order to realize the current value of the our existing positions we do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes our derivative instruments are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes accordingly changes in fair value are recognized in our consolidated and combined statements of operations in the period of change gains and losses on derivatives and premiums paid for put options are included in cash flows from operating activities our valuation estimate takes into consideration the counterparties’ credit worthiness our credit worthiness and the time value of money the consideration of the factors results in an estimated exitprice for each derivative asset or liability under a market place participant’s view we believe that this approach provides a reasonable nonbiased verifiable and consistent methodology for valuing commodity derivative instruments accounting for business combinations we account for all of our business combinations using the purchase method which involves the use of significant judgment any excess or shortage of amounts assigned to assets and liabilities over or under the purchase price is recorded as a gain on bargain purchase or goodwill the amount of goodwill or gain on bargain purchase recorded in any particular business combination can vary significantly depending upon the values attributed to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination we make various assumptions the most significant assumptions relate to the estimated fair values assigned to proved and unproved oil and gas properties if sufficient market data is not available regarding the fair values of proved and unproved properties we must prepare estimates to estimate the fair values of these properties we prepare estimates of oil natural gas and ngl reserves we estimate future prices to apply to the estimated reserves quantities acquired and estimate future operating and development costs to arrive at estimates of future net cash flows for estimated proved reserves the future net cash flows are discounted using a marketbased weighted average cost of capital rate determined appropriate at the time of the acquisition the marketbased weighted average cost of capital rate is subjected to additional projectspecific risking factors to compensate for the inherent risk of estimating and valuing unproved reserves when a discounted cash flow model is used the discounted future net cash flows of probable and possible reserves are reduced by additional risk factors in some instances market comparable information of recent transactions is used to estimate fair value of unproved acreage    estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired can have a significant effect on results of operations in the future a higher fair value assigned to a property results in higher dda expense which results in lower net earnings fair values are based on estimates of future commodity prices reserves quantities operating expenses and development costs th is increases the likelihood of impairment if future commodity prices or reserves quantities are lower than those originally used to determine fair value or if future operating expenses or development costs are higher than those originally used to determin e fair value impairment would have no effect on cash flows but would result in a decrease in net income for the period in which the impairment is recorded asset retirement obligations our asset retirement obligations “aro” consist of estimated future costs associated with the plugging and abandonment of oil natural gas and ngl wells removal of equipment and facilities from leased acreage and land restoration in accordance with applicable local state and federal laws the fair value of an aro liability is required to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred with the associated asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying cost of the oil and gas asset the recognition of an aro requires that management make numerous assumptions regarding such factors as the estimated probabilities amounts and timing of settlements the creditadjusted riskfree discount rate to be used inflation rates and future advances in technology in periods subsequent to the initial measurement of the aro we must recognize periodtoperiod changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time and revisions to either the timing or the amount of the original estimate of undiscounted cash flows increases in the aro liability due to the passage of time are recorded as accretion expense which is a component of dda the related capitalized cost including revisions thereto is charged to expense through dda over the life of the oil and gas property revenue recognition revenues from the sale of oil natural gas and ngls are recognized when the product is delivered at a fixed or determinable price title has transferred and collectability is reasonably assured and evidenced by a contract we recognize revenues from the sale of oil natural gas and ngls using the sales method of accounting whereby revenue is recorded based on our share of volume sold regardless of whether we have taken our proportional share of volume produced these differences result in gas imbalances we record a liability to the extent there are not sufficient reserves to cover an over delivered gas imbalance no receivables are recorded for those wells on which the company has taken less than its proportionate share of production we receive payment approximately one month after delivery for operated wells and up to three months after delivery for nonoperated wells at the end of each month we estimate the amount of production delivered to purchasers and the price we will receive variances between our estimates and the actual amounts received are recorded in the month payment is received a  change in our december    and  revenue accrual would have impacted total operating revenues by approximately  million  million and  million for the years ended december    and  respectively incentive units the governing documents of whr ii provided for the issuance of incentive units whr ii granted incentive units to certain of its members who were key employees at the time of grant holders of incentive units would have been entitled to distributions ranging from  to  when declared but only after cumulative distribution thresholds payouts had been achieved payouts were generally triggered after the recovery of specified members’ capital contributions plus a rate of return the incentive units were being accounted for as liabilityclassified awards as achievement of the payout conditions required settlement of such awards by transferring cash to the incentive unit holder compensation cost was recognized only if the performance condition was probable of being satisfied at each reporting date the payment likelihood related to the whr ii incentive units was not deemed probable for the year ended december    and  respectively  as such no compensation expense was recognized by our predecessor in connection with the corporate reorganization the whr ii incentive units were transferred to wildhorse investment holdings in exchange for substantially similar incentive units in wildhorse investment holdings which became responsible for making all payments distributions and settlements relating to the exchanged incentive units while any such payments distributions and settlements will not involve any cash payments by us we will recognize noncash compensation expense within ga expenses which may be material in the period in which the applicable performance conditions are probable of being satisfied we will receive a deemed capital contribution with respect to such compensation expense in connection with the corporate reorganization wildhorse holdings esquisto holdings and acquisition co holdings granted certain officers and employees awards of incentive units in wildhorse holdings esquisto holdings and acquisition co holdings the wildhorse holdings incentive units esquisto holdings incentive units and acquisition co holdings incentive units will each vest in three equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the applicable date of grant the incentive units are entitled to a portion of future distributions by each of wildhorse holdings esquisto holdings and acquisition co holdings in excess of the value of our common stock held by each of wildhorse holdings esquisto holdings and acquisition co holdings based upon the initial public offering price of such common stock plus a  internal rate of return wildhorse holdings esquisto holdings    and acquisition co holdings will be responsible for making all payments distributions and settlements to all award recipients relating to the wildhorse holdings incentive units esquisto holdings incentive units and acquisition co holdings incentive units respectively while any such payments distributions and settlements are not expected to involve any c ash payment by us we expect to recognize noncash compensation expense within ga expenses which may be material in the period in which the applicable performance conditions are probable of being satisfied we will receive a deemed capital contribution with respect to such compensation expense vesting of all incentive units is generally dependent upon an explicit service period a fundamental change as defined in the respective governing document and achievement of payout all incentive units not vested are forfeited if an employee is no longer employed all incentive units will be forfeited if a holder resigns whether the incentive units are vested or not if the payouts have not yet occurred then all incentive units whether or not vested will be forfeited automatically unless extended results of operations the selected financial data of our predecessor was retrospectively recast due to common control considerations because whr ii esquisto and acquisition co were under the common control of ngp the sale and contribution of the respective ownership interests were accounted for as a combination of entities under common control whereby the assets and liabilities sold and contributed were recorded based on historical cost as such the results of operations presented below i a for the year ended december   and b for the period from february   the inception of common control to december   have been derived from the combined results attributable to our predecessor and esquisto for periods prior to our initial public offering and ii a for the period from january   to february   and b for the year ended december   have been derived from the results attributable to our predecessor furthermore the results of operations attributable to acquisition co are reflected in the financial data presented herein beginning on december   for periods after the completion of our initial public offering our consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our subsidiaries in which we have a controlling interest factors affecting the comparability of the combined historical financial results the comparability of the results of operations among the periods presented is impacted by the following significant transactions   • combining the financial position and results of operations of esquisto with the predecessor beginning february     • public company expenses incurred in connection with our initial public offering and the corporate reorganization and     • esquisto’s third party acquisition of certain oil and natural gas producing properties undeveloped acreage and water assets located in the eagle ford in july

           year ended december   compared to the year ended december     • oil natural gas and ngl revenues were  million for  compared to  million for  an increase of  million approximately  production increased  mmboe approximately  primarily due to increased production from drilling successful wells in the eagle ford the average realized sales price increased  per boe approximately  due to a higher percentage of oil in the production mix a favorable oil production variance contributed to a  million increase in oil revenues offset by a  million decrease due to an unfavorable pricing variance   • loe was  million and  million for  and  respectively   the decrease primarily is due to operational efficiencies lower workover expense and lower service costs associated with industrywide service cost decreases  on a per boe basis loe was  and  for  and  respectively    the decrease was due to lower loe and certain items such as direct labor and materials and supplies generally remaining relatively fixed across broad production volume ranges   • gpt expenses were  million and  million for  and  respectively  the  increase in gpt expenses is primarily attributable

due the impact of passthrough entities and state income tax year ended december   compared to the year ended december     • oil natural gas and ngl revenues were  million for  compared to  million for  an increase of  million approximately  production increased  mmboe approximately  primarily due to combining the results of operations of esquisto with our predecessor beginning february   third party acquisitions and drilling activity oil natural gas and ngl revenues attributable to esquisto were  million from february   to december   the average realized sales price decreased  per boe approximately  due to lower commodity prices the favorable production variance contributed to an approximate  million increase in revenues and was offset by  million decrease due to the unfavorable pricing variances   • loe was  million and  million for  and  respectively  the increase is primarily due to loe associated with esquisto’s july  acquisition and increased water disposal charges related to our new wells  on a per boe basis loe was  and  for  and  respectively  the decrease was primarily due to certain items such as direct labor and materials and supplies generally remaining relatively fixed across broad production volume ranges   • gpt expenses were  million and  million for  and  respectively  the  increase was primarily due to an increase in production due to acquisitions and our drilling activities  on a per boe basis gpt expenses were  and  for  and  respectively  the decrease is primarily due to an increase in production from acquisitions and drilling successful wells    • taxes other than income tax were  million and  million for  and  respectively  the  million increase approximately  is primarily due to an increase in revenues associated with our oil and natural gas properties on a per boe basis taxes other than income tax were  and  for  and  respectively  the  decrease was primarily due to severance tax exemptions on high cost horizontal wells   • dda expense for  was  million compared to  million for  a  million increase primarily due to combining the results of operations of esquisto with our predecessor beginning february   increase in production volumes related to acquisitions and drilling activities  dda expense attributable to esquisto was  million from february   to december    increased production volumes caused dda expense to increase by approximately  million and the change in the dda rate between periods caused dda expense to increase by approximately  million   • impairment expense for  was  million compared

be unrecoverable primarily due to a decline in prices   • ga expenses were  million and  million for  and  respectively there was a reduction in ga reimbursements of  million associated with the termination of a management services agreement with a related party in february  a  million increase in salaries and wages and a  million increase in rent expense  these increases were largely offset by a  million decrease in shared ga costs billed to whr ii from an affiliate and  million decrease in acquisition related costs esquisto recorded ga expenses of  million from february   to december    during this same period esquisto accrued  million as ga expenses payable to its members and paid petromax  million for overhead charges on drilling and producing wells at market rates as set forth in

management and external users of our financial statements such as industry analysts investors lenders and rating agencies we include in this annual report the nongaap financial measure adjusted ebitdax and provide our calculation of adjusted ebitdax adjusted ebitdax is not a measure of net loss income as determined according to gaap we define adjusted ebitdax as net income loss plus   • interest expense   • income tax expense   • depreciation depletion and amortization “dda”   • exploration expense   • impairment of proved oil and gas properties   • loss on derivative instruments   • cash settlements received on expired derivative instruments   • stockbased compensation   • incentivebased compensation expenses   • acquisition related costs   • debt extinguishment costs   • loss on sale of properties   • initial public offering costs and   • other noncash and nonroutine operating items that we deem appropriate less   • interest income   • income tax benefit   • gain on derivative instruments   • cash settlements paid on expired commodity derivative instruments   • gain on sale of properties and   • other noncash and nonroutine operating items that we deem appropriate management believes adjusted ebitdax is a useful performance measure because it allows them to more effectively evaluate our operating performance without regard to our financing methods or capital structure we exclude the items listed above from net loss income in arriving at adjusted ebitdax because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired adjusted ebitdax should not be considered as an alternative to or more meaningful than net loss income as determined in accordance with gaap certain items excluded from adjusted ebitdax are significant components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial performance such as a company’s cost of capital and tax structure as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets none of which are components of adjusted ebitdax our presentation of adjusted ebitdax should not be construed as an inference that our results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items our computations of adjusted ebitdax may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies    the following table presents a reconciliation of adjusted ebitdax to net loss income our most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in

to make significant operating and capital expenditures our primary use of capital has been the acquisition and development of oil natural gas and ngl properties and facilities as we pursue reserve and production growth we plan to monitor which capital resources including equity and debt financings are available to us to meet our future financial obligations planned capital expenditure activities and liquidity requirements  historically whr ii’s and esquisto’s primary sources of liquidity were capital contributions from their former owners borrowings under their respective revolving credit facilities and second lien loans and cash generated by their operations our future success in growing proved reserves and production will be highly dependent on the capital resources available to us our  capital expenditures were  million of which  million was allocated to eagle ford locations and  million to north louisiana based on our current oil and natural gas price expectations we believe our cash flows provided by operating activities and availability under our revolving credit facility will provide us with the financial flexibility and wherewithal to meet our cash requirements including normal operating needs and pursue our currently planned  development drilling activities however future cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of our oil and natural gas production and the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production and significant additional capital expenditures will be required to more fully develop our properties and acquire additional properties we cannot assure you that operations and other needed capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all as of december   we had  million of cash and cash equivalents and  million of available borrowings under our revolving credit facility as of december   we had a working capital deficit balance of  million which includes a net liability balance of  million associated with our derivative instruments as of december   the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility was  million and we had  million of outstanding borrowings in connection with the february  issuance of our  senior notes our borrowing base was automatically reduced to  million  the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility is subject to redetermination on at least a semiannual basis based on an engineering report with respect to our estimated oil and natural gas reserves which will take into account the prevailing oil and natural gas prices at such time as adjusted for the impact of our commodity derivative contracts unanimous approval by the lenders is required for any increase to the borrowing base the next borrowing base redetermination is scheduled for april  a continuing decline in oil and natural gas prices could result in a reduction of our borrowing base under our revolving credit facility and could trigger mandatory principal repayments      capital expenditure budget our  drilling and completion capital expenditure budget is  million to  million from which we expect to drill  to  gross wells and complete  to  gross wells across our acreage we expect to fund our capital expenditures with cash generated by operations cash on hand borrowings under our revolving credit facility and proceeds from our  senior notes offering the amount timing and allocation of capital expenditures is largely discretionary and within our control and our  capital budget may be adjusted as business conditions warrant please see “item a risk factors — risks related to our business — our development projects and acquisitions require substantial capital expenditures we may be unable to obtain required capital or financing on satisfactory terms which could lead to a decline in our ability to access or grow production and reserves”  commodity prices declined significantly since june  and have remained low thus far in  if oil or natural gas prices remain at current levels or decline to levels below our acceptable levels or costs increase to levels above our acceptable levels we could choose to defer a significant portion of our budgeted capital expenditures until later periods to achieve the desired balance between sources and uses of liquidity and prioritize capital projects that we believe will have the highest expected rates of return and potential to generate nearterm cash flow we routinely monitor and adjust our capital expenditures in response to changes in commodity prices availability of financing drilling and acquisition costs industry conditions the timing of regulatory approvals the availability of rigs success or lack of success in drilling activities contractual obligations internally generated cash flow and other factors both within and outside our control any reduction in our capital expenditure budget could have the effect of delaying or limiting our development program which would negatively impact our ability to grow production and could materially and adversely affect our future business financial condition results of operations or liquidity we intend to fund our  capital expenditures and our cash requirements including normal cash operating needs debt service obligations and commitments and contingencies through december   with borrowings under our revolving credit facility our operating cash flow cash on hand and  senior notes however to the extent that we consider market conditions favorable we may access the capital markets to raise capital from time to time to fund acquisitions pay down our revolving credit facility balance and for general working capital purposes we plan to continue our practice of entering into hedging arrangements to reduce the impact of commodity price volatility on our cash flow from operations under this strategy we expect to maintain an active hedging program that seeks to reduce our exposure to commodity prices and protect our cash flow debt agreements revolving credit facility concurrently with the closing of our initial public offering we as borrower and certain of our current and future subsidiaries as guarantors entered into a fiveyear  billion senior secured revolving credit facility with an initial borrowing base of  million which was reduced to  million in connection with the consummation of our  senior notes offering in february  our revolving credit facility is reservebased and thus our borrowing base is primarily based on the estimated value of our oil ngl and natural gas properties and our commodity derivative contracts as determined by our lenders in their sole discretion consistent with their normal and customary oil and gas lending practices semiannually from time to time at our election in connection with material acquisitions or no more frequently than twice in any fiscal year at the request of the required lenders or us in each case based on engineering reports with respect to our estimated oil ngl and natural gas reserves and our commodity derivative contracts unanimous approval by the lenders is required for any increase to the borrowing base pursuant to a redetermination while only required lender approval is required to maintain or decrease the borrowing base pursuant to a redetermination the borrowing base will also automatically decrease upon the issuance of certain debt including the issuance of senior notes the sale or other disposition of certain assets and the early termination of certain swap agreements in the future we may be unable to access sufficient capital under our revolving credit facility as a result of i a decrease in our borrowing base due to a borrowing base redetermination or ii an unwillingness or inability on the part of our lenders to meet their funding obligations for more information please see “item a risk factors — risks related to our business—any significant reduction in our borrowing base under our revolving credit facility as a result of the periodic borrowing base redeterminations or otherwise may negatively impact our ability to fund our operations” a decline in commodity prices could result in a redetermination that lowers our borrowing base and in such case we could be required to repay any indebtedness in excess of the borrowing base or we could be required to pledge other oil and natural gas properties as additional collateral if a redetermination of our borrowing base results in our borrowing base being less than our aggregate elected commitments our aggregate elected commitments will be automatically reduced to the amount of such reduced borrowing base we do not anticipate having any substantial unpledged properties and we may not have the financial resources in the future to make any mandatory

will affect us see note  under “item  financial statements and supplementary data” of this annual report            item a quantitative and qualitat ive disclosur es about market risk we are exposed to market risk including the effects of adverse changes in commodity prices and interest rates as described below the primary objective of the following information is to provide quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks the term “market risk” refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil natural gas and ngl prices and interest rates the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses all of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than speculative trading commodity price risk our major market risk exposure is in the pricing that we receive for our oil natural gas and ngls production pricing for oil natural gas and ngls has been volatile and unpredictable for several years and we expect this volatility to continue in the future during the period from january   through january   the wti spot price for oil has declined from a high of  per bbl on june   to  per bbl on february   and the henry hub spot price for natural gas has declined from a high of  per mmbtu on february   to a low of  per mmbtu on march   the prices we receive for our oil natural gas and ngls production depend on numerous factors beyond our control some of which are discussed in “item a risk factors—risks related to our business—oil natural gas and ngl prices are volatile a sustained decline in oil natural gas and ngl prices could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our capital expenditure obligations and financial commitments” due to this volatility we have historically used and we expect to continue to use commodity derivative instruments such as collars puts and swaps to hedge price risk associated with a portion of our anticipated production our hedging instruments allow us to reduce but not eliminate the potential effects of the variability in cash flow from operations due to fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices and provide increased certainty of cash flows for our drilling program and debt service requirements these instruments provide only partial price protection against declines in oil and natural gas prices and may partially limit our potential gains from future increases in prices our revolving credit facility contains various covenants and restrictive provisions which among other things limit our ability to enter into commodity price hedges exceeding a certain percentage of production swaps in a typical commodity swap agreement we receive the difference between a fixed price per unit of production and a price based on an agreed upon published thirdparty index if the index price is lower than the fixed price we receive the difference if the index price is higher we pay the difference by entering into swap agreements we effectively fix the price that we will receive in the future for the hedged production  our swaps are settled in cash on a monthly basis as each month is due collars in a typical collar arrangement we receive the excess if any of the contract floor price over the reference price based on nymex or regional quoted prices and pay the excess if any of the reference price over the contract ceiling price collars are typically exercised in cash on a monthly basis only when the reference price is outside of floor and ceiling prices the collar otherwise they expire put options   in a typical put option we receive the difference between the agreed upon strike price of the option and the price of the underlying commodity if market prices decline below the strike price  when put options are settled we would receive the difference between the strike price and market price less any deferred premiums associated with the put option contract  if commodity markets rise above the strike price any losses incurred are limited to the deferred premium amount associated with the put option  put options typically settle in cash on a monthly basis otherwise they expire    the following table summarizes our derivative contracts as of december   and the average prices at which

our revolving credit facility based on choosing from two interest rates i the eurodollar rate which is based on london interbank offered rate “libor” plus an additional margin based on the percentage of the borrowing base being utilized ranging from  to  and ii the alternate base rate which is based on the highest of a the us prime rate b the federal funds effective rate in effect plus  of  and c adjusted libor plus  plus an additional margin based on the percentage of the borrowing base being utilized ranging from  to  from the inception of the credit agreement predominately all our debt outstanding was in the form of eurodollar borrowings based on the eurodollar rate assuming no change in the amount outstanding the impact on interest expense of a  increase or decrease in the assumed weighted average interest rate would be approximately  million per year we do not currently have any derivative arrangements to protect against fluctuations in interest rates applicable to our outstanding indebtedness but may enter into such derivative arrangements in the future to the extent we enter into any such interest rate derivative arrangement we would subject to risk for financial loss for more information please see “item a risk factors—risks related to our business—our derivative activities could result in financial losses or could reduce our earnings” counterparty and customer credit risk our derivative contracts expose us to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties while we do not require counterparties to our derivative contracts to post collateral we do evaluate the credit standing of such counterparties as we deem appropriate the counterparties to our derivative contracts currently in place have investment grade ratings    our principal exposures to credit risk are through receivables resulting from joint interest receivables and receivables from the sale of our oil and natural gas production due to the concentration of our oil and natural gas receivables with several significant customers the inability or failure of our significant customers to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect our financial results however we believe the credit quality of our customers is high by using derivative instruments that are not traded on an exchange to hedge exposures to changes in commodity prices we expose ourselves to the credit risk of our counterparties credit risk is the potential failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the contract when the fair value of a contract is positive the counterparty is expected to owe us which creates the credit risk to minimize the credit risk in derivative instruments it is our policy to enter into contracts only with counterparties that are creditworthy financial institutions deemed by management as competent and competitive marketmakers the creditworthiness of our counterparties is subject to periodic review as of december   our derivative contracts were with major financial institutions all of which were also lenders under our revolving credit facility while collateral is generally not required to be posted by counterparties credit risk associated with these instruments is minimized by limiting exposure to any single counterparty and entering into derivative instruments only with creditworthy counterparties that are generally large financial institutions additionally master netting agreements are used to mitigate risk of loss due to default with counterparties on derivative instruments we have also entered into the international swaps and derivatives association master agreements “isda agreements” with each of our counterparties the terms of the isda agreements provide us and each of our counterparties with rights of setoff upon the occurrence of defined acts of default by either us or our counterparty to a derivative whereby the party not in default may setoff all liabilities owed to the defaulting party against all net derivative asset receivables from the defaulting party at december   we had net derivative liabilities of  million as such had certain counterparties failed completely to perform according to the terms of their existing contracts we would not have been able to exercise our right to offset against amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility at december   since we were not in a net asset position see note  under “item  financial statements and supplementary data” for additional information regarding our revolving credit facility we are also subject to credit risk due to the concentration of our natural gas and oil receivables with several significant customers we do not require our customers to post collateral and the

public offering on december    in connection with our initial public offering and corporate reorganization defined below our accounting predecessor whr ii was contributed to us in addition to whr ii we received esquisto and acquisition co we are an independent oil and natural gas company focused on the acquisition exploitation development and production of oil natural gas and ngl resources initial public offering and corporate reorganization the company issued and sold to the public in its initial public offering  shares of common stock the gross proceeds from the sale of the common stock were  million net of underwriting discounts of  million and other offering costs of  million the net proceeds from our initial public offering were  million  debt issuance costs of  million related to the establishment of the company’s revolving credit facility were also incurred in conjunction with our initial public offering contemporaneously with our initial public offering i the owners of whr ii exchanged all of their interests in whr ii for equivalent interests in wildhorse investment holdings and the owners of esquisto exchanged all of their interests in esquisto for

eliminated in preparation of our consolidated and combined financial statements the accompanying consolidated and combined financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” note  summary of significant accounting policies use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources we evaluate the estimates and assumptions on a regular basis however actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements significant estimates with regard to these financial statements include  the estimate of proved oil and gas reserves and related present value estimates of future net cash flows therefrom  depreciation depletion and amortization expense  valuation of accounts receivable  accrued capital expenditures and liabilities  asset retirement obligations  environmental remediation costs  valuation of derivative instruments  contingent liabilities and  impairment expense although management believes these estimates are reasonable changes in facts and circumstances or discovery of new information may result in revised estimates and such revisions could be material cash and cash equivalents we consider all highly liquid investment instruments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents for purposes of the consolidated and combined statements of cash flows and other statements these investments are carried at cost which approximates fair value in case a book overdraft exists at the end of a period we reclassify the negative cash amount to accounts payable restricted cash restricted cash consists of certificates of deposit in place to collateralize letters of credit the letters of credit are required as part of normal business operations the certificates of deposit will be in place for a period greater than  months and are considered noncurrent oil and gas properties we use the successful efforts method of accounting for natural gas and crude oil producing activities costs to acquire mineral interests in natural gas and crude oil properties are capitalized costs to drill and develop development wells and costs to drill and develop exploratory wells that find proved reserves are also capitalized  costs to drill exploratory wells that do not find proved reserves delay rentals and geological and geophysical costs are expensed the following table reflects the net changes in capitalized exploratory well costs

consolidated and combined financial statements   we acquire leases on acreage not associated with proved reserves or held by production with the expectation of ultimately assigning proved reserves and holding the leases with production the costs of acquiring these leases inc luding primarily brokerage costs and amounts paid to lessors are capitalized and excluded from current amortization pending evaluation when proved reserves are assigned the leasehold costs associated with those leases are depleted as producing oil and g as properties costs associated with leases not held by production are impaired when events and circumstances indicate that carrying value of the properties is not recoverable we recorded impairment of  million and  million as exploration expense for unproved oil and gas properties for the year ended december   and  respectively we had no leasehold impairment expense for the year ended december   capitalized costs of producing natural gas and crude oil properties and support equipment net of estimated salvage values are depleted by field using the unitsofproduction method well and well equipment and tangible property additions are depleted over proved developed reserves and leasehold costs are depleted over total proved reserves proved oil and gas properties are reviewed for impairment when events and circumstances indicate a potential decline in the fair value of such properties below the carrying value such as a downward revision of the reserve estimates or lower commodity prices we estimate the undiscounted future cash flows expected in connection with the properties and compare such future cash flows to the carrying amounts of the properties to determine if the carrying amounts are recoverable if the carrying value of the properties is determined to not be recoverable based on the undiscounted cash flows an impairment charge is recognized by comparing the carrying value to the estimated fair value of the properties the factors used to determine fair value include but are not limited to estimates of proved and probable reserves future commodity prices the timing of future production and capital expenditures and a discount rate commensurate with the risk reflective of the lives remaining for the respective oil and gas properties we recorded impairment expense of  million and  million to proved oil and gas properties for the year ended december   and  respectively the impairment resulted from lower projected oil and gas prices and a drop in projected remaining reserves in east texas and our noncore fields oil and gas reserves the estimates of proved natural gas crude oil and natural gas liquids reserves utilized in the preparation of the financial statements are estimated in accordance with guidelines established by the securities and exchange commission “sec” and the financial accounting standards board “fasb” which require that reserve estimates be prepared under existing economic and operating conditions using a month average price with no provision for price and cost escalations in future years except by contractual arrangements proved reserves are with respect to whr ii prepared by whr ii and audited by cawley gillespie  associates inc “cawley” its independent reserve engineer with respect to esquisto the proved reserves were prepared by cawley its independent reserve engineer for   esquisto’s proved reserves for  were internally prepared and audited by cawley   we emphasize that reserve estimates are inherently imprecise accordingly the estimates are expected to change as more current information becomes available it is possible that because of changes in market conditions or the inherent imprecision of these reserve estimates the estimates of future cash inflows future gross revenues the amount of natural gas crude oil and natural gas liquids reserves the remaining estimated lives of the natural gas and crude oil properties or any combination of the above may be increased or reduced see note —“supplemental oil and gas information unaudited” for further information gathering system in  our oakfield subsidiary constructed and began operating a  mile ” natural

in business combinations assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination are required to be recorded at fair value if sufficient market data is not available we determine the fair values of proved and unproved properties acquired in transactions accounted for as business combinations by preparing our own estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves to compensate for the inherent risk of estimating and valuing unproved reserves discounted future net cash flows of probable and possible reserves are reduced by additional riskweighting factors see note —“acquisitions and divestitures” asset retirement obligations we recognize a liability equal to the fair value of the estimated cost to plug and abandon our natural gas and crude oil wells and associated equipment the liability and the associated increase in the related longlived asset are recorded in the period in which the related assets are placed in service or acquired the liability is accreted to its expected future cost each period and the capitalized cost is depleted using the unitsofproduction method of the related asset the accretion expense is included in depreciation depletion and amortization expense the fair value of the estimated cost is based on historical experience managements’ expertise and thirdparty proposals for plugging and abandoning wells the estimated remaining lives of the wells is based on reserve life estimates and federal and state regulatory requirements at the time the related longlived asset is placed in service the estimated cost is adjusted for inflation based on the remaining life then discounted using a creditadjusted riskfree rate to determine the fair value revisions to the liability could occur due to changes in estimates of plugging and abandonment costs including nonoperated plug and abandonment expense changes in the remaining lives of the wells or if federal or state regulators enact new plugging and abandonment requirements at the time of abandonment we recognize a gain or loss on abandonment to the extent that actual costs do not equal the estimated costs environmental costs as an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties we are subject to various federal state and local laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into and protection of the environment environmental expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations and that do not have future economic benefit are expensed liabilities related to future costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when environmental assessments andor remediation activities are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated revenue recognition and oil and gas imbalances revenues from the sale of oil natural gas and ngls are recognized when the product is delivered at a fixed or determinable price title has transferred and collectability is reasonably assured and evidenced by a contract we recognize revenues from the sale of oil natural gas and ngls using the sales method of accounting whereby revenue is recorded based on our share of volume sold regardless of whether we have taken our proportional share of volume produced these differences result in gas imbalances we record a liability to the extent there are not sufficient reserves to cover an over delivered gas imbalance no receivables are recorded for those wells on which the company has taken less than its proportionate share of production we receive payment approximately one month after delivery for operated wells and up to three months after delivery for nonoperated wells at the end of each month we estimate the amount of production delivered to purchasers and the price we will receive variances between our estimates and the actual amounts received are recorded in the

that we believe have minimal credit risks take the form of variable to fixed price swaps collars and puts the natural gas reference price upon which the commodity derivative contracts are based reflects market indices that have a high degree of historical correlation with actual prices received for natural gas sales all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet as either an

liability and amortized over the term of the associated debt using the effective yield method fair value measurements accounting guidance for fair value measurements establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted market prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level  level  inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level  which are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly we use level  inputs when available as level  inputs generally provide the most reliable evidence of fair value see note —“fair value measurements of financial instruments” income taxes we are a corporation subject to federal and certain state income taxes prior to our initial public offering we were primarily organized as passthrough entities for federal income tax purposes and were not subject to federal income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of  temporary differences between the tax basis in assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements and  operating loss and tax credit carry forwards deferred income tax assets and liabilities are based on enacted tax rates applicable to the future period when those temporary differences are expected to be recovered f   wildhorse resource development corporation notes to consolidated and combined financial statements   or settled  deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if based on the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of defe rred tax assets will not be realized we recognize interest and penalties accrued to unrecognized tax benefits in other income expense in our consolidated and combined statement of operations we recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefit recorded is equal to the largest amount that is greater than  likely to be realized through effective settlement with a taxing authority commitments and contingencies accruals for loss contingencies arising from claims assessments litigation environmental and other sources are recorded when it is

definition of a business in january  the fasb issued an accounting standards update to clarify the definition of a business the definition of a business affects many areas of accounting including acquisitions disposals goodwill and consolidation the amendments are intended to help companies and other organizations evaluate whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses the amendments provide a more robust framework to use in determining when a set of assets and activities is a business the amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after december   including interim periods within those periods early adoption is permitted and the guidance is to be applied on a prospective basis to purchases or disposals of a business or an asset the company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements statement of cash flows – restricted cash a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force  in november  the fasb issued an accounting standards update to clarify the guidance on the classification and presentation of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows the changes in restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents that result from the transfers between cash cash equivalents and restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should not be presented as cash flow activities in the statement of cash flows  the new guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years early adoption is permitted including adoption in an interim period the new guidance requires transition under a retrospective approach for each period presented the company is currently assessing the impact the adoption of this new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures statement of cash flows – classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments  in august  the fasb issued an accounting standards update to address eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the current and potential future diversity in practice the new guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years early adoption is permitted including adoption in an interim period the new guidance requires transition under a retrospective approach for each period presented if it is impracticable to apply the amendments retrospectively for some of the issues the amendments for those issues would be applied prospectively as of the earliest date practicable the company is currently assessing the impact the adoption of this new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting  in march  the fasb issued an accounting standards update to simplify the guidance on employee sharebased payment accounting the update involves several aspects of accounting for sharebased payment transactions including the income tax consequences classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification in the statement of cash flows entities will no longer record excess tax benefits and certain tax deficiencies in equity f   wildhorse resource development corporation notes to consolidated and combined financial statements   instead they will record all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement in addition the new guidance eliminates the requirement that excess tax benef its be realized before entities can recognize them and requires entities to present excess tax benefits as an operating activity on the statement of cash flows rather than as a financing activity furthermore the new guidance will increase the amount an e mployer can withhold to cover income taxes on awards and still qualify for the exception to liability classification for shares used to satisfy the employer’s statutory income tax withholding obligation the new guidance requires an entity to classify the cash paid to a tax authority when shares are withheld to satisfy its statutory income tax withholding obligation as a financing activity on the statement of cash flows in addition entities will now have to elect whether to account for forfeitures on shar ebased payments by i recognizing forfeitures of awards as they occur or ii estimating the number of awards expected to be forfeited and adjusting the estimate when it is likely to change as is currently required for the amendments that change the r ecognition and measurement of sharebased payment awards the new guidance requires transition under a modified retrospective approach with a cumulativeeffect adjustment made to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal period in which the guid ance is adopted prospective application is required for the accounting for excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies this new standard will be effective for annual periods beginning after december   early adoption is permitted  the company adopte d this guidance as of january   and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements  we elected to account for forfeitures on sharebased payments by recognizing forfeitures of awards as they occur leases in february  the fasb issued a revision to its lease accounting guidance the fasb retained a dual model requiring leases to be classified as either direct financing or operating leases the classification will be based on criteria that are similar to the current lease accounting treatment the revised guidance requires lessees to recognize a rightofuse asset and lease liability for all leasing transactions regardless of classification for leases with a term of  months or less a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities if a lessee makes this election it should recognize lease expense for such leases generally on a straightline basis over the lease term the amendments are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years early adoption is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period the revised guidance must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition and provides for certain practical expedients transition will require application of the new guidance at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented we are currently evaluating the standard and the impact on our financial statements and related footnote disclosures balance sheet classification of deferred taxes in november  the fasb issued an accounting standards update that requires entities with a classified balance sheet to present all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent the current requirement that deferred tax assets and liabilities of a taxpaying component of an entity be offset and presented as a single amount is not affected by the amendment the amendments are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after december   and interim periods within those annual periods early adoption is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period the amendments may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax assets and liabilities or retrospectively to all periods presented we early adopted this guidance and it did not have a material impact on our financial statements and related disclosures simplifying the accounting for measurementperiod adjustments in september  the fasb issued an accounting standards update that eliminates the requirement that an acquirer in a business combination account for measurementperiod adjustments retrospectively instead an acquirer will recognize a measurementperiod adjustment during the period in which it determines the amount of the adjustment disclosure of the effect on earnings of any amounts an acquirer would have recorded in previous periods if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date is required the disclosure is required for each affected income statement line item and may be presented separately on the face of the income statement or in the notes to the financial statements the new guidance should be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years the impact of adopting this guidance was not material to our financial statements and related disclosures presentation of debt issuance cost in april  the fasb issued an accounting standards update that requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of that debt liability consistent with debt discounts the guidance is effective retrospectively for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december   in august  the fasb issued an accounting standards update that incorporates sec guidance clarifying that the sec would not object to debt issuance costs related to lineofcredit arrangements being deferred and presented as an asset that is subsequently amortized over the term of the lineofcredit arrangement regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the lineofcredit arrangement the impact of adopting this guidance was not material to our financial statements and related disclosures   f   wildhorse resource development corporation notes to consolidated and combined financial statements   revenue from contracts with customers in may  the fasb issued a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard for contracts with customers that will supersede most current revenue recog nition guidance including industryspecific guidance the core principle of this standard is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which th e entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services to achieve this core principle the standard provides a fivestep analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized in august  the fasb issued

would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at a specified measurement date fair value estimates are based on either i actual market data or ii assumptions that other market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability including estimates of risk a threetier hierarchy has been established that classifies fair value amounts recognized or disclosed in the financial statements the hierarchy considers fair value amounts based on observable inputs levels  and  to be more reliable and predictable than those based primarily on unobservable inputs level  the characteristics of fair value amounts classified within each level of the hierarchy are described as follows level  — unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical unrestricted assets or liabilities an active market is one in which transactions for the assets or liabilities occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis level  — quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability substantially all of these inputs are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the derivative instrument can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace at december   and  all of the derivative instruments reflected on the accompanying balance sheets were considered level  level  — measure based on prices or valuation models that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and are less observable from objective sources ie supported by little or no market activity assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents restricted cash accounts receivables accounts payables including accrued liabilities and amounts outstanding under longterm debt agreements with variable rates included in the accompanying balance sheets approximated fair

commodity prices including nonperformance risk nonperformance risk is the risk that the obligation related to the derivative instrument will not be fulfilled financial assets and liabilities are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment

the fair values of proved and unproved properties acquired in transactions accounted for as business combinations are prepared by utilizing estimates of discounted cash flow projections the factors to determine fair value include but are not limited to estimates of i economic reserves ii future operating and development costs iii future commodity prices and iv a marketbased weighted average cost of capital to compensate for the inherent risk of estimating and valuing unproved properties the discounted future net revenues of probable and possible reserves are reduced by additional riskweighting factors the fair value of supporting equipment such as plant assets acquired in transactions accounted for as business combinations are commonly estimated using the depreciated replacement cost approach   • proved oil and natural gas properties are reviewed for impairment when events and circumstances indicate the carrying value of such properties may not be recoverable the factors used to determine fair value include but are not limited to estimates of proved reserves future commodity prices the timing of future production and capital expenditures and a discount rate commensurate with the risk reflective of the lives remaining for the respective oil and gas properties   ▪ during the years ended december   and  we recognized  million and  million respectively of impairments the

instruments we have entered into certain derivative arrangements with respect to portions of our oil and natural gas production to reduce our sensitivity to volatile commodity prices none of our derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedges we believe that these derivative arrangements although not free of risk allow us to achieve more predictable cash flows and to reduce exposure to commodity price fluctuations however derivative arrangements limit the benefit of increases in the prices of oil and natural gas sales moreover our derivative arrangements apply only to a portion of our production and provide only partial protection against declines in commodity prices such arrangements may expose us to risk of financial loss in certain circumstances we continuously reevaluate

gas reserves users of this information should be aware that the process of estimating quantities of “proved” and “proved developed” oil and natural gas reserves is very complex requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological engineering and economic data for each reservoir the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including but not limited to additional development activity evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions as a result revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time although every reasonable effort is made to ensure reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various reservoirs make these estimates generally less precise than other estimates included in the financial statement disclosures proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas that by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible — from a given date forward from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations — prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation the project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time proved reserves are with respect to whr ii prepared by whr ii and

increased proved reserves by  mboe and  mboe related to drilling in the rct field in louisiana and eagle ford respectively   • during  purchase of minerals in place of  mboe was primarily attributable to the burleson north acquisition   • during  we had downward revisions of proved reserves of  mboe of which  mboe related to commodity price changes and  mboe was performance related   • during  extensions discoveries and additions increased proved reserves by  mboe related to drilling in the rct field in louisiana by our predecessor  for the period from february   to december   extensions and discoveries increased proved reserves by  mboe related to drilling in the eagle ford horizons in burleson county texas by the previous owner   • for the period from february   to december   purchase of minerals in place by the previous owner of  mboe was primarily attributable to the producing wells acquired from a subsidiary of comstock resources inc in july    • during  our predecessor had downward revisions of proved reserves of  mboe of which  mboe related to commodity price changes and  mboe related to downward revisions resulting from technical changes  for the period from february   to december   revisions of previous estimates attributable to the previous owner were primarily due to operational efficiencies gained through increased experience in the eagle ford area increase of approximately  mboe partially offset by decreased commodity prices which decreased the useful lives of the wells decreasing ultimate reserves recovered decrease of approximately  mboe   • during  extensions discoveries and additions increased proved reserves by  mboe related to drilling two horizontal wells in east texas by our predecessor   • during  our predecessor acquired  mboe of proved reserves of which  mboe was for noncore properties acquired in east texas and  mboe was a result of leaseholds acquired in the rct field in louisiana   • during  our predecessor had upward performance revisions to total proved reserves of  mboe of which  mboe related to gas processing  mboe related to lease operating expense reductions and  mboe related to changes in commodity prices partially offset by a reduction of  mboe due to changes in ownership interest see note  for additional information on acquisitions and divestitures a variety of methodologies are used to determine our proved reserve estimates the principal methodologies employed are reservoir simulation decline curve analysis volumetric material balance advance production type curve matching petrophysicslog analysis and analogy some combination of these methods is used to determine reserve estimates in substantially all of our fields standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves as required by the fasb and sec the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows presented below is computed by applying firstdayofthemonth average prices yearend costs and legislated tax rates and a discount factor of  percent to proved reserves we do not believe the standardized measure provides a reliable estimate of the company’s expected future cash flows to be obtained from the development and production of its oil and gas properties or of the value of its proved oil and gas reserves the standardized measure is prepared on the basis of certain prescribed assumptions including firstdayofthemonth average prices which represent discrete points in time and therefore may cause significant variability in cash flows from year to year as prices change f

todd brooker pe   sr vice president   cawley gillespie  associates inc   texas registered engineering firm f         appendix methods employed in the estimation of reserves   the four methods customarily employed in the estimation of reserves are   production performance    material balance    volumetric  and   analogy  most estimates although based primarily on one method utilize other methods depending on the nature and extent of the data available and the characteristics of the reservoirs basic information includes production pressure geological and laboratory data however a large variation exists in the quality quantity and types of information available on individual properties operators are generally required by regulatory authorities to file monthly production reports and  may  be required to measure and report periodically such data as well pressures gasoil ratios well tests etc as a general rule an operator has complete discretion in obtaining andor making available geological and engineering data the resulting lack of uniformity in data renders impossible the application of identical methods to all properties and may result in significant differences in the accuracy and reliability of estimates a brief discussion of each method its basis data requirements applicability and generalization as to its relative degree of accuracy follows production performance  this method employs graphical analyses of production data on the premise that all factors which have controlled the performance to date will continue to control and that historical trends can be extrapolated to predict future performance the only information required is production history capacity production can usually be analyzed from graphs of rates versus time or cumulative production this procedure is referred to as “decline curve” analysis both capacity and restricted production can in some cases be analyzed from graphs of producing rate relationships of the various production components reserve estimates obtained by this method are generally considered to have a relatively high degree of accuracy with the degree of accuracy increasing as production history accumulates material balance  this method employs the analysis of the relationship of production and pressure performance on the premise that the reservoir volume and its initial hydrocarbon content are fixed and that this initial hydrocarbon volume and recoveries therefrom can be estimated by analyzing changes in pressure with respect to production relationships this method requires reliable pressure and temperature data production data fluid analyses and knowledge of the nature of the reservoir the material balance method is applicable to all reservoirs but the time and expense required for its use is dependent on the nature of the reservoir and its fluids reserves for depletion type reservoirs can be estimated from graphs of pressures corrected for compressibility versus cumulative production requiring only data that are usually available estimates for other reservoir types require extensive data and involve complex calculations most suited to computer models which makes this method generally applicable only to reservoirs where there is economic justification for its use reserve estimates obtained by this method are generally considered to have a degree of accuracy that is directly related to the complexity of the reservoir and the quality and quantity of data available volumetric  this method employs analyses of physical measurements of rock and fluid properties to calculate the volume of hydrocarbons inplace the data required are well information sufficient to determine reservoir subsurface datum thickness storage volume fluid                    appendix    cawley gillespie  associates inc      page           appendix methods employed in the estimation of reserves   content and location the volumetric method is most applicable to reservoirs which are not susceptible to analysis by production performance or material balance methods these are most commonly newly developed andor nopressure depleting reservoirs the amount of hydrocarbons inplace that can be recovered is not an integral part of the volumetric calculations but is an estimate inferred by other methods and a knowledge of the nature of the reservoir reserve estimates obtained by this method are generally considered to have a low degree of accuracy but the degree of accuracy can be relatively high where rock quality and subsurface control is good and the nature of the reservoir is uncomplicated analogy  this method which employs experience and judgment to estimate reserves is based on observations of similar situations and includes consideration of theoretical performance the analogy method is applicable where the data are insufficient or so inconclusive that reliable reserve estimates cannot be made by other methods reserve estimates obtained by this method are generally considered to have a relatively low degree of accuracy much of the information used in the estimation of reserves is itself arrived at by the use of estimates these estimates are subject to continuing change as additional information becomes available reserve estimates which presently appear to be correct may be found to contain substantial errors as time passes and new information is obtained about well and reservoir performance the securities and exchange commission in sx reg  dated november   as amended on september   and january   requires adherence to the following definitions of oil and gas reserves “     proved oil and gas reserves  proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible—from a given date forward from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations— prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation the project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time “i    the area of a reservoir considered as proved includes a the area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts if any and b adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can with reasonable certainty be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data “ii    in the absence of data on fluid contacts proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons lkh as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience engineering or performance data and reliable technology establishes a lower contact with reasonable certainty                    appendix    cawley gillespie  associates inc      page           appendix methods employed in the estimation of reserves   “iii    where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil hko elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience engineering or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty “iv    reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques including but not limited to fluid injection are included in the proved classification when a successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the reservoir as a whole the operation of an installed program in the reservoir or an analogous reservoir or other evidence using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based and b the project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities including governmental entities “v    existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined the price shall be the average price during the month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthemonth price for each month within such period unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements excluding escalations based upon future conditions “     developed oil and gas reserves  developed oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that can be expected to be recovered “i    through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well and “ii    through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well “     undeveloped oil and gas reserves  undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion “i    reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances “ii    undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years unless the specific circumstances justify a longer time “iii    under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique                    appendix    cawley gillespie  associates inc      page             appendix methods employed in the estimation of reserves   is contemplated unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir as defined in paragraph a of this section or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty “     probable reserves  probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which together with proved reserves are as likely as not to be recovered “i    when deterministic methods are used it is as likely as not that actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the sum of estimated proved plus probable reserves when probabilistic methods are used there should be at least a  probability that the actual quantities recovered will equal or exceed the proved plus probable reserves estimates “ii    probable reserves may be assigned to areas of a reservoir adjacent to proved reserves where data control or interpretations of available data are less certain even if the interpreted reservoir continuity of structure or productivity does not meet the reasonable certainty criterion probable reserves may be assigned to areas that are structurally higher than the proved area if these areas are in communication with the proved reservoir “iii    probable reserves estimates also include potential incremental quantities associated with a greater percentage recovery of the hydrocarbons in place than assumed for proved reserves “iv    see also guidelines in paragraphs iv and vi of this section below “     possible reserves  possible reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than probable reserves “i    when deterministic methods are used the total quantities ultimately recovered from a project have a low probability of exceeding proved plus probable plus possible reserves when probabilistic methods are used there should be at least a  probability that the total quantities ultimately recovered will equal or exceed the proved plus probable plus possible reserves estimates “ii    possible reserves may be assigned to areas of a reservoir adjacent to probable reserves where data control and interpretations of available data are progressively less certain frequently this will be in areas where geoscience and engineering data are unable to define clearly the area and vertical limits of commercial production from the reservoir by a defined project “iii    possible reserves also include incremental quantities associated with a greater percentage recovery of the hydrocarbons in place than the recovery quantities assumed for probable reserves “iv    the proved plus probable and proved plus probable plus possible reserves estimates must be based on reasonable alternative technical and commercial interpretations within the reservoir or subject project that are clearly documented including comparisons to results in successful similar projects                    appendix    cawley gillespie  associates inc      page             appendix methods employed in the estimation of reserves   “v    possible reserves may be assigned where geoscience and engineering data identify directly adjacent portions of a reservoir within the same accumulation that may be separated from proved areas by faults with displacement less than formation thickness or other geological discontinuities and that have not been penetrated by a wellbore and the registrant believes that such adjacent portions are in communication with the known proved reservoir possible reserves may be assigned to areas that are structurally higher or lower than the proved area if these areas are in communication with the proved reservoir “vi    pursuant to paragraph iii of this section above where direct observation has defined a highest known oil hko elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap proved oil reserves should be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir above the hko only if the higher contact can be established with reasonable certainty through reliable technology portions of the reservoir that do not meet this reasonable certainty criterion may be assigned as probable and possible oil or gas based on reservoir fluid properties and pressure gradient interpretations” instruction  of item b of securities and exchange commission regulation sk was revised january   to state that “a registrant engaged in oil and gas producing activities shall provide the information required by subpart  of regulation s–k” this is relevant in that instruction  to paragraph a states “the registrant is permitted  but not required  to disclose probable or possible reserves pursuant to paragraphs aiv through avii of this item” “     reserves  reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible as of a given date by application of development projects to known accumulations in addition there must exist or there must be a reasonable expectation that there will exist the legal right to produce or a revenue interest in the production installed means of delivering oil and gas or related substances to market and all permits and financing required to implement the project “ note to paragraph   reserves should not be assigned to adjacent reservoirs isolated by major potentially sealing faults until those reservoirs are penetrated and evaluated as economically producible reserves should not be assigned to areas that are clearly separated from a known accumulation by a nonproductive reservoir ie absence of reservoir structurally low reservoir or negative test results such areas may contain prospective resources ie potentially recoverable resources from undiscovered accumulations”

economically through application of improved recovery techniques including but not limited to fluid injection are included in the proved classification when a successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the reservoir as a whole the operation of an installed program in the reservoir or an analogous reservoir or other evidence using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based and b the project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities including governmental entities “v    existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined the price shall be the average price during the month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthemonth price for each month within such period unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements excluding escalations based upon future conditions “     developed oil and gas reserves  developed oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that can be expected to be recovered “i    through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well and “ii    through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well “     undeveloped oil and gas reserves  undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion “i    reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances “ii    undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years unless the specific circumstances justify a longer time “iii    under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique                    appendix    cawley gillespie  associates inc      page             appendix methods employed in the estimation of reserves   is contemplated unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir as defined in paragraph a of this section or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty “     probable reserves  probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which together with proved reserves are as likely as not to be recovered “i    when deterministic methods are used it is as likely as not that actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the sum of estimated proved plus probable reserves when probabilistic methods are used there should be at least a  probability that the actual quantities recovered will equal or exceed the proved plus probable reserves estimates “ii    probable reserves may be assigned to areas of a reservoir adjacent to proved reserves where data control or interpretations of available data are less certain even if the interpreted reservoir continuity of structure or productivity does not meet the reasonable certainty criterion probable reserves may be assigned to areas that are structurally higher than the proved area if these areas are in communication with the proved reservoir “iii    probable reserves estimates also include potential incremental quantities associated with a greater percentage recovery of the hydrocarbons in place than assumed for proved reserves “iv    see also guidelines in paragraphs iv and vi of this section below “     possible reserves  possible reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than probable reserves “i    when deterministic methods are used the total quantities ultimately recovered from a project have a low probability of exceeding proved plus probable plus possible reserves when probabilistic methods are used there should be at least a  probability that the total quantities ultimately recovered will equal or exceed the proved plus probable plus possible reserves estimates “ii    possible reserves may be assigned to areas of a reservoir adjacent to probable reserves where data control and interpretations of available data are progressively less certain frequently this will be in areas where geoscience and engineering data are unable to define clearly the area and vertical limits of commercial production from the reservoir by a defined project “iii    possible reserves also include incremental quantities associated with a greater percentage recovery of the hydrocarbons in place than the recovery quantities assumed for probable reserves “iv    the proved plus probable and proved plus probable plus possible reserves estimates must be based on reasonable alternative technical and commercial interpretations within the reservoir or subject project that are clearly documented including comparisons to results in successful similar projects                    appendix    cawley gillespie  associates inc      page             appendix methods employed in the estimation of reserves   “v    possible reserves may be assigned where geoscience and engineering data identify directly adjacent portions of a reservoir within the same accumulation that may be separated from proved areas by faults with displacement less than formation thickness or other geological discontinuities and that have not been penetrated by a wellbore and the registrant believes that such adjacent portions are in communication with the known proved reservoir possible reserves may be assigned to areas that are structurally higher or lower than the proved area if these areas are in communication with the proved reservoir “vi    pursuant to paragraph iii of this section above where direct observation has defined a highest known oil hko elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap proved oil reserves should be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir above the hko only if the higher contact can be established with reasonable certainty through reliable technology portions of the reservoir that do not meet this reasonable certainty criterion may be assigned as probable and possible oil or gas based on reservoir fluid properties and pressure gradient interpretations” instruction  of item b of securities and exchange commission regulation sk was revised january   to state that “a registrant engaged in oil and gas producing activities shall provide the information required by subpart  of regulation s–k” this is relevant in that instruction  to paragraph a states “the registrant is permitted  but not required  to disclose probable or possible reserves pursuant to paragraphs aiv through avii of this item” “     reserves  reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible as of a given date by application of development projects to known accumulations in addition there must exist or there must be a reasonable expectation that there will exist the legal right to produce or a revenue interest in the production installed means of delivering oil and gas or related substances to market and all permits and financing required to implement the project “ note to paragraph   reserves should not be assigned to adjacent reservoirs isolated by major potentially sealing faults until those reservoirs are penetrated and evaluated as economically producible reserves should not be assigned to areas that are clearly separated from a known accumulation by a nonproductive reservoir ie absence of reservoir structurally low reservoir or negative test results such areas may contain prospective resources ie potentially recoverable resources from undiscovered accumulations”

united states of america “gaap”  wildhorse resource development corporation notes to unaudited condensed consolidated and combined financial statements   use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources we evaluate the estimates and assumptions on a regular basis however actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements significant estimates with regard to these financial statements include  the estimate of proved oil natural gas and ngl reserves and related present

annual periods beginning after december   the company adopted this guidance as of january   and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements  we elected to account for

the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at a specified measurement date fair value estimates are based on either i actual market data or ii assumptions that other market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability including estimates of risk a threetier hierarchy has been established that classifies fair value amounts recognized or disclosed in the financial statements the hierarchy considers fair value amounts based on observable inputs levels  and  to be more reliable and predictable than those based primarily on unobservable inputs level  all of the derivative instruments reflected on the accompanying balance sheets were considered level  assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents restricted cash accounts receivables accounts payables including accrued liabilities and amounts outstanding under longterm debt agreements with variable rates included in the accompanying balance sheets approximated fair value at march   and december   the fair value estimates are based upon observable market data and are

derivatives    —            —         assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis certain assets and liabilities are reported at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as reflected on the balance sheets the following methods and assumptions are used to estimate the fair values   • the fair value of aros is based on discounted cash flow projections using numerous estimates assumptions and judgments regarding such factors as the existence of a legal obligation for an aro amounts and timing of settlements the creditadjusted riskfree rate and inflation rates see “note —asset retirement obligations” for a summary of changes in aros   • if sufficient market data is not available the determination of the fair values of proved and unproved properties acquired in transactions accounted for as business combinations are prepared by utilizing estimates of discounted cash flow projections the factors to determine fair value include but are not limited to estimates of i economic reserves ii future operating and development costs iii future commodity prices and iv a marketbased weighted average cost of capital to compensate for the inherent risk of estimating and valuing unproved properties the discounted future net revenues of probable and possible reserves are reduced by additional riskweighting factors the fair value of supporting equipment such as plant assets acquired in transactions accounted for as business combinations are commonly estimated using the depreciated replacement cost approach   • proved oil and natural gas properties are reviewed for impairment when events and circumstances indicate the carrying value of such properties may not be recoverable the factors used to determine fair value include but are not limited to estimates of proved reserves future commodity prices the timing of future production and capital expenditures and a discount rate commensurate with the risk reflective of the lives remaining for the respective oil and natural gas properties we did not record impairments during the three months ended march   and   wildhorse resource development corporation notes to unaudited condensed consolidated and combined financial statements     • unproved oil and natural gas properties are reviewed for impairment based on passage of time or geologic factors  information such as remaining lease terms drilling results reservoir performance seismic interpretation or future plans to develop acreage is also considered  when unproved properties are deemed to be impaired the expense is recorded as a component of exploration expenses  for the three months ended march   we recorded  million of impairments of unproved properties  we did not record any impairments for the three months ended march    note  risk management and derivative instruments we have entered into certain derivative arrangements with respect to portions of our oil and natural gas production to reduce our sensitivity to volatile commodity prices none of our derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedges we believe that these derivative arrangements although not free of risk allow us to achieve more predictable cash flows and to reduce exposure to commodity price fluctuations however derivative arrangements limit the benefit of increases in the prices of oil and natural gas sales moreover our derivative arrangements apply only to a portion of our production and provide only partial protection against declines in commodity prices such arrangements may expose us to risk of financial loss in certain circumstances we continuously reevaluate our risk management program in light of changes in production market conditions commodity price forecasts capital spending interest rate forecasts and debt service requirements commodity derivatives we have fixed price commodity swaps collars and deferred purchased puts to accomplish our hedging strategy collars consist of a sold call and a purchased put that establishes a ceiling and floor price for expected future oil and natural gas sales we recognize all derivative instruments at fair value however certain of our derivative instruments have a deferred premium the deferred premium is factored into the fair value measurement and where the company agrees to defer the premium paid or received until the time of settlement cash received on settled derivative positions during the three months ended march   is net of deferred premiums of  million derivative instruments are netted when the right to net exists under a master netting agreement future liabilities and assets correspond to the same commodity type and future cash flows have the same balance sheet current or noncurrent classification we have exposure to financial institutions in the form of derivative transactions these transactions are with counterparties in the financial services industry specifically only lenders under our revolving credit facility these transactions could expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparties we have master netting agreements for our derivative transactions with our counterparties and although we do not require collateral we believe our counterparty risk is low because of the credit worthiness of our counterparties see “note —fair value measurements of financial instruments” for further

acquire certain oil and natural gas producing and nonproducing properties from thirdparties in burleson county texas for an aggregate price of approximately  million subject to customary postclosing adjustments  one transaction closed in february  and the remaining transactions closed in april  sources of our revenues our revenues are derived from the sale of our oil and natural gas production the sale of ngls that are extracted from our natural gas during processing and the gathering charge paid by certain third parties for their share of volumes that run through our gathering system production revenues are derived entirely from the continental united states natural gas ngl and oil prices are inherently volatile and are influenced by many factors outside our control in order to reduce the impact of fluctuations in natural gas and oil prices on revenues or to protect the economics of property acquisitions we intend to periodically enter into derivative contracts with respect to a significant portion of estimated natural gas and oil production through various transactions that fix the future prices received our oil natural gas and ngl revenues do not include the effects of derivatives principal components of cost structure costs associated with producing oil natural gas and ngls are substantial some of these costs vary with commodity prices some trend with the type and volume of production and others are a function of the number of wells we own the sections below summarize the primary operating costs we typically incur   • lease operating expenses lease operating expenses “loe” are the costs incurred in the operation of producing properties and workover costs expenses for utilities direct labor water injection and disposal workover rigs and workover expenses materials and supplies comprise the most significant portion of our loe certain items such as direct labor and materials and supplies generally remain relatively fixed across broad production volume ranges but can fluctuate depending on activities performed during a specific period for instance repairs to our pumping equipment or surface facilities result in increased loe in periods during which they are performed certain of our operating cost components are variable and increase or decrease as the level of produced hydrocarbons and water increases or decreases for example we incur power costs in connection with various productionrelated activities such as pumping to recover oil and natural gas and separation and treatment of water produced in connection with our oil and natural gas production we monitor our operations to ensure that we are incurring loe at an acceptable level for example we monitor our loe per boe to determine if any wells or properties should be shut in recompleted or sold this unit rate also allows us to monitor these costs in certain fields and geographic areas to identify trends and to benchmark against other producers although we strive to reduce our loe these expenses can increase or decrease on a per unit basis as a result of various factors as we operate our properties or make acquisitions and dispositions of properties for example we may increase fieldlevel expenditures to optimize our operations incurring higher expenses in one quarter relative to another or we    may acquire or dispose of properties that have different loe per boe these initiatives would influence our overall operating cost and could cause fluctuations whe n comparing loe on a period to period basis   • gathering processing and transportation “gpt” these are costs incurred to deliver production of our natural gas ngls and oil to the market cost levels of these expenses can vary based on the volume of natural gas ngls and oil produced as well as the cost of commodity processing   • gathering system operating expense gathering system operating expenses include contract labor water disposal dehydration equipment rentals chemical and facilitiesrelated expenses and facility termination fees that are incurred in the operation of our north louisiana gathering system   • taxes other than income taxes production taxes are paid on produced oil and natural gas based on rates established by federal state or local taxing authorities in general the production taxes we pay correlate to the changes in oil natural gas and ngls revenues production taxes for our texas properties are based on the market value of our production at the wellhead  production taxes for our louisiana properties are based on our gross production at the wellhead we are also subject to ad valorem taxes in the counties and parishes where our production is located ad valorem taxes for our texas properties are based on the fair market value of our mineral interests for producing wells ad valorem taxes for our louisiana properties are assessed based on the cost of our oil and natural gas properties louisiana imposes a capital based franchise tax on corporations based on capital employed within the state   • depreciation depletion and amortization depreciation depletion and amortization “dda” is the systematic expensing of the capitalized costs incurred to acquire and develop oil and natural gas properties we use the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and natural gas activities and as such we capitalize all costs associated with our development and acquisition efforts and all successful exploration efforts which are then allocated to each unit of production using the unit of production method our dda rate can fluctuate as a result of impairments dispositions finding and development costs and proved reserve volumes which are all impacted by oil natural gas and ngl prices   • impairment expense we review our proved properties and unproved leasehold costs for impairment whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that a decline in the recoverability of their carrying value may have occurred impairment of unproved leasehold costs are recorded within exploration expense   • general and administrative expenses general and administrative “ga” expenses are costs incurred for overhead including payroll and benefits for our corporate staff costs of maintaining our headquarters costs of managing our production and development operations stockbased compensation public company expenses it expenses audit and other fees for professional services including legal compliance and acquisitionrelated expenses   • exploration expense exploration expense is geological and geophysical costs that include seismic surveying costs costs of unsuccessful exploratory dry holes lease abandonment and delay rentals exploration expense also includes rig standby and rig contract termination fees   • incentive unit compensation expense see “note —incentive units” of the notes to unaudited condensed consolidated and combined financial statements included under “item  financial statements” of this quarterly report for additional information   • interest expense we finance a portion of our working capital requirements and acquisitions with borrowings under our revolving credit facility and senior note issuances as a result we incur substantial interest expense that is affected by both fluctuations in interest rates and financing decisions we expect to continue to incur significant interest expense as we continue to grow  interest expense includes the amortization of debt issuance costs as well as the writeoff of unamortized debt issuance costs   • gain loss on derivative instruments net realized and unrealized gains on our derivatives are a function of fluctuations in the underlying commodity prices and the monthly settlement of the instruments given the volatility of commodity prices it is not possible to predict future reported unrealized marktomarket net gains or losses and the actual net gains or losses that will ultimately be realized upon settlement of the hedge positions in future years if commodity prices at settlement are lower than the prices of the hedge positions the hedges are expected to mitigate the otherwise negative effect on earnings of lower oil natural gas and ngl prices however if commodity prices at settlement are higher than the prices of the hedge positions the hedges are expected to dampen the otherwise positive effect on earnings of higher oil natural gas and ngl prices and will in this context be viewed as having resulted in an opportunity cost   • income tax expense we are a corporation subject to federal and certain state income taxes prior to our initial public offering we were primarily organized as passthrough entities for federal income tax purposes and were not subject to federal income taxes however one of our predecessor subsidiaries previously elected to be taxed as a corporation and was subject to federal and state income taxes    critical accounting policies and estimates preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources we evaluate the estimates and assumptions on a regular basis however actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements significant estimates with regard to these financial statements include  the estimate of proved oil natural gas and ngl reserves and related present value estimates of future net cash flows therefrom  depreciation depletion and amortization expense  valuation of accounts receivable  accrued capital expenditures and liabilities  asset retirement obligations  environmental remediation costs  valuation of derivative instruments  contingent liabilities and  impairment expense although management believes these estimates are reasonable changes in facts and circumstances or discovery of new information may result in revised estimates and such revisions could be material a discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates is included in our  form k there have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates results of operations the results of operations of our predecessor were retrospectively recast due to common control considerations because whr ii esquisto and acquisition co were under the common control of ngp the sale and contribution of the respective ownership interests were accounted for as a combination of entities under common control whereby the assets and liabilities sold and contributed were recorded based on historical cost as such the results of operations presented below for the three months ended march   have been derived from the combined results attributable to our predecessor and esquisto for periods after the completion of our initial public offering our consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our subsidiaries                           factors affecting the comparability of the combined historical financial results the comparability of the results of operations among the periods presented is impacted by the following   • the acquisition of approximately  net acres of oil and natural gas properties adjacent to our existing eagle ford acreage on december   in connection with our initial public offering the “burleson north acquisition” for a final purchase price of  million net of customary postclosing adjustments   • incremental ga expenses as a result of being a publicly traded company   including but not limited to exchange act reporting expenses expenses associated with sarbanes oxley compliance expenses associated with shares of our common stock being listed on a national securities exchange incremental independent auditor fees incremental legal fees investor relations expenses registrar and transfer agent fees incremental director and officer liability insurance costs and independent director compensation and   • the february  private placement of  million aggregate principal amount of  senior unsecured notes due  the “ senior notes” as a result of the factors

and the three months ended march   respectively unless otherwise indicated   • oil natural gas and ngl revenues were  million for  compared to  million for  an increase of  million approximately  production increased  mmboe approximately  primarily due to the december  burleson north acquisition and to drilling successful wells in the eagle ford the average realized sales price increased  per boe approximately  due to a higher percentage of oil in the production mix oil revenues increased  million and  million due to favorable pricing and production variances respectively natural gas revenues increased  million due to a favorable pricing variance offset by a  million decrease due to an unfavorable volume variance  ngl revenues increased  million and  million due to favorable price and volume variances respectively   • loe was  million and  million for  and  respectively   on a per boe basis total loe was  and  for  and  respectively  the increase in loe on a per unit basis is largely attributable to the burleson north acquisition which came with less efficient legacy production net production in  consisted of  oil compared to  oil in   generally the production of oil is more expensive than natural gas on a per boe basis     • gpt expenses were  million and  million for  and  respectively  the  decrease in gpt expenses was primarily attributable to lower fee gas purchasing and processing contracts associated with the burleson north properties  on a per boe basis gpt expenses were  and  for  and  respectively      • taxes other than income tax were  million and  million for  and  respectively an increase of  million approximately   on a per boe basis taxes other than income tax were  and  for  and  respectively  the  increase was primarily due to higher price realizations higher ad valorem taxes and louisiana franchise taxes incurred as a result of our corporate reorganization that occurred in conjunction with our initial public offering   • dda expense for  was  million compared to  million for  a  million increase approximately  primarily due to an increase in production volumes related to drilling activities  increased production volumes caused dda expense to increase by  million and the change in the dda rate between periods caused dda expense to increase by  million   • ga expenses were  million and  million an increase of approximately  for  and  respectively  the  million increase was primarily due to increased staffing for  compared to  and increased costs associated with being a public company  salaries and wages increased by  million primarily due to additional staffing  fees related to accounting and audit services increased  million between  and   during  we recorded  million in acquisition costs and

exploration expense was  million and  million for  and  respectively   the  million reduction approximately  in exploration expense was primarily due to an increase in undeveloped leasehold impairments of  million and an increase in seismic acquisitions of  million offset by  million in expenses associated with the early termination of a rig contract which was laid down in march  due to low commodity prices   • interest expense was  million and  million for  and  respectively  the  million increase approximately  was due to an increase in the average debt outstanding as a result of the february  issuance of the  senior notes interest is comprised of interest on our credit facilities interest on our senior notes and amortization of debt issue costs amortization of debt issue costs was  million for  compared to  million for   the amortization of debt issue costs included a write off of  million due to the automatic reduction of our borrowing base in conjunction with the issuance of the senior notes   • debt extinguishment costs were  million in  due to esquisto’s retirement and termination of its revolving credit facility and second lien in january  in connection with the merger of esquisto i and esquisto ii there were no debt extinguishment costs in    • net gains on commodity derivatives of  million were recognized during  of which  million was an unrealized gain and  million was a realized gain during  we recognized a  million gain on derivative instruments of which  million was a realized gain and a  million was an unrealized gain   • income tax expense of  million was recognized in  in comparison to income tax expense of a  million in  the periodtoperiod increase was primarily a result of being a corporation subject to federal and state income tax subsequent to our initial public offering the effective tax rate for  differed from the federal statutory income tax rate      primarily due to the impact of state income tax the effective tax rate for  differed from the federal statutory income tax rate primarily due the impact of passthrough entities and state income tax calculation of adjusted ebitdax adjusted ebitdax is a supplemental nongaap financial performance measure that is used by management and external users of our financial statements such as industry analysts investors lenders and rating agencies we include in this quarterly report the nongaap financial measure adjusted ebitdax and provide our calculation of adjusted ebitdax adjusted ebitdax is not a measure of net loss income as determined according to gaap we define adjusted ebitdax as net income loss plus   • interest expense   • income tax expense   • dda   • exploration expense   • impairment of proved oil and natural gas properties   • loss on derivative instruments   • cash settlements received on derivative instruments   • stockbased compensation   • incentivebased compensation expenses   • acquisition related costs   • debt extinguishment costs   • loss on sale of properties   • initial public offering costs and   • other noncash and nonroutine operating items that we deem appropriate less   • interest income   • income tax benefit   • gain on derivative instruments   • cash settlements paid on derivative instruments   • gain on sale of properties and   • other noncash and nonroutine operating items that we deem appropriate management believes adjusted ebitdax is a useful performance measure because it allows them to more effectively evaluate our operating performance without regard to our financing methods or capital structure we exclude the items listed above from net loss income in arriving at adjusted ebitdax because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired adjusted ebitdax should not be considered as an alternative to or more meaningful than net loss income as determined in accordance with gaap certain items excluded from adjusted ebitdax are significant components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial performance such as a company’s cost of capital and tax structure as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets none of which are components of adjusted ebitdax our presentation of adjusted ebitdax should not be construed as an inference that our results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items our computations of adjusted ebitdax may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies    reconciliation of net income to adjusted ebitdax the following table presents a reconciliation of adjusted ebitdax to net loss income our most directly comparable

liquidity and capital resources our development and acquisition activities require us to make significant operating and capital expenditures our primary use of capital has been the acquisition and development of oil natural gas and ngl properties and facilities as we pursue reserve and production growth we plan to monitor which capital resources including equity and debt financings are available to us to meet our future financial obligations planned capital expenditure activities and liquidity requirements  historically whr ii’s and esquisto’s primary sources of liquidity were capital contributions from their former owners borrowings under their respective revolving credit facilities and second lien loans and cash generated by their operations  our future success in growing proved reserves and production will be highly dependent on the capital resources available to us based on our current oil and natural gas price expectations we believe our cash flows provided by operating activities and availability under our revolving credit facility will provide us with the financial flexibility and wherewithal to meet our cash requirements including normal operating needs and pursue our currently planned  development drilling activities however future cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of our oil and natural gas production and the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production and significant additional capital expenditures will be required to more fully develop our properties and acquire additional properties we cannot assure you that operations and other needed capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all as of march   we had  million of cash and cash equivalents and  million of available borrowings under our revolving credit facility as of march   we had a working capital balance of  million as of march   the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility was  million and we had no outstanding borrowings the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility is subject to redetermination on at least a semiannual basis based on an engineering report with respect to our estimated oil and natural gas reserves which will take into account the prevailing oil and natural gas prices at such time as adjusted for the impact of our commodity derivative contracts unanimous approval by the lenders is required for any increase to the borrowing base on april   our revolving credit facility borrowing base was increased to  million in connection with the semiannual borrowing redetermination by the lenders however we currently anticipate the borrowing base to increase to  million upon the closing of the apckkr acquisition   the next scheduled borrowing base redetermination is set for october  a continuing decline in oil and natural gas prices could result in a reduction of our borrowing base under our revolving credit facility and could trigger mandatory principal repayments on april   standby letters of credit of  million were issued to the railroad commission of texas under our revolving credit facility           preferred stock we are authorized to issue up to  shares of preferred stock  please see “recent developments” for additional information capital expenditure budget we established a  million to  million  drilling and completion capital expenditure budget for the three months ended march   our drilling and completion expenditures were approximately  million primarily related to the development of our eagle ford properties debt agreements revolving credit facility in december  we as borrower and certain of our current and future subsidiaries as guarantors entered into a fiveyear  billion senior secured revolving credit facility  in april  our revolving credit facility borrowing base was increased from  million to  million in connection with the semiannual borrowing redetermination by our lenders  our revolving credit facility is reservebased and thus our borrowing base is primarily based on the estimated value of our oil ngl and natural gas properties and our commodity derivative contracts as determined by our lenders in their sole discretion consistent with their normal and customary oil and gas lending practices semiannually    in the future we may be unable to access sufficient capital under our revolving credit facility as a result of i a decrease in our borrowing base due to a borrowing base redetermination or ii an unwillingness or inability on the part of our lenders to meet their funding obligations we believe we were in compliance with all the financial interest coverage ratio and current ratio and other covenants associated with our revolving credit facility as of march   see “note —long term

financial statements” of this quarterly report item  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk including the effects of adverse changes in commodity prices and interest rates as described below the primary objective of the following information is to provide quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks the term “market risk” refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil natural gas and ngl prices and interest rates the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses all of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than speculative trading commodity price risk our major market risk exposure is in the pricing that we receive for our oil natural gas and ngls production pricing for oil natural gas and ngls has been volatile and unpredictable for several years and we expect this volatility to continue in the future for additional information regarding the volumes of our production covered by commodity derivative contracts and the average prices at which production is hedged as of march   see “note —risk management and derivative instruments” of the notes to unaudited condensed consolidated and combined financial statements included under “item

not currently have any derivative arrangements to protect against fluctuations in interest rates applicable to indebtedness we may incur but may enter into such derivative arrangements in the future to the extent we enter into any such interest rate derivative arrangement we would subject to risk for financial loss the fair value of  senior notes is sensitive to changes in interest rates we

thousands         march         carrying amount     estimated fair value    senior notes fixedrate due february                 counterparty and customer credit risk we are also subject to credit risk due to the concentration of our oil and natural gas receivables with several significant customers we do not require our customers to post collateral and the inability of our significant customers to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect our financial results joint operations receivables arise from billings to entities that own partial interests in the wells we operate these entities participate in our wells primarily based on their ownership in leases on which we intend to drill we have little ability to control whether these entities will participate in our wells in addition our derivative contracts expose us to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties while we do not require counterparties to our derivative contracts to post collateral we do evaluate the credit standing of such counterparties as we deem appropriate each of the counterparties to our derivative contracts currently in place has an
