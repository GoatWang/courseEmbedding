the death of mao zedong and the rehabilitation of deng xiaoping  and are thought to have contributed to chinas eightfold growth in gross national product over two decades the phrase beijing consensus was coined by joshua cooper ramo to pose chinas economic development model as an alternative—especially for developing countries—to the washington consensus of marketfriendly policies promoted by the imf world bank and us treasury in  ramo stated in an interview with the diplomat that the idea of the beijing consensus is less that every nation will follow china’s development model but that it legitimizes the notion of particularity as opposed to the universality of a washington model the term has been described variously as the pragmatic use of innovation and experimentation in the service of equitable peaceful highquality growth and defense of national borders and interests by ramo the use of stable if repressive politics and highspeed economic growth others maintain that it seems there is no consensus as to what it stands for other than being an alternative to the neoliberal washington consensus and that the term is applied to anything that happens in beijing regardless of

guidelines for economic development ramo was a former senior editor and foreign editor of time magazine and later a partner at kissinger associates the consulting firm of former us secretary of state henry kissinger the first guideline involves a commitment to innovation and constant experimentation one of the major criticisms of the washington consensus is its complacency ramo argues that there is no perfect solution and that the only true path to success is one that is dynamic as no one plan works for every situation the second guideline states that per capita income gdpcapita should not be the lone measure of progress rather ramo feels that the sustainability of the economic system and an even distribution of wealth along with gdp are important indicators of progress the third guideline urges a policy of selfdetermination where the lessdeveloped nations use leverage to keep the superpowers in check and assure their own financial sovereignty this includes not only financial selfdetermination but also a shift to the most effective military strategy which ramo suggests is more likely to be an asymmetric strategy rather than one that seeks direct confrontation unlike the

exploitation of chinas labor force by foreign countries was a major part of the chinese development ultimately though and despite other criticism dirlik concludes that the beijing consensus does serve an important goal the most important aspect of the beijing consensus may be an approach to global relationships that seeks in multinational relationships a new global order founded on economic

the developing world it is one that beijing eagerly exports as demonstrated by its support of other illiberal regimes such as those in sudan angola or zimbabwe by offering developing countries nostringsattached gifts and loans rather than promoting democracy through economic aid as does the west halper argues chinas dependence on natural resources will lock beijing into relationships with rogue states and that beijing will not feel increasing pressure democratize as it grows richer because it is wealth that gives the regime its legitimacy he sees this as establishing a trend away from

beijing consensus in this paper he laid out three broad guidelines for economic development ramo was a former senior editor and foreign editor of time magazine and later a partner at kissinger associates the consulting firm of former us secretary of state henry kissinger the first guideline involves a commitment to innovation and constant experimentation one of the major criticisms of the washington consensus is its complacency ramo argues that there is no perfect solution and that the only true path to success is one that is dynamic as no one plan works for every situation the second guideline states that per capita income gdpcapita should not be the lone measure of progress rather ramo feels that the sustainability of the economic system and an even distribution of wealth along with gdp are important indicators of progress the third guideline urges a policy of selfdetermination where the lessdeveloped nations use leverage to keep the superpowers in check and assure their own financial sovereignty this includes not only financial selfdetermination but also a shift to the most effective military strategy which ramo suggests is more likely to be an asymmetric strategy rather

valley model of development that ignores the fact that the exploitation of chinas labor force by foreign countries was a major part of the chinese development ultimately though and despite other

natural resources will lock beijing into relationships with rogue states and that beijing will not feel increasing pressure democratize as it grows richer because it is wealth that gives the regime

la forcemay  last night at the river club henry kissinger threw a book party for his protégé joshua cooper ramo handsome and fluent in chinese ramo speaks with the rapidity and grace of those who appear regularly on television he’s the youngest full partner of kissinger associates a geostrategic advisory firm naturally his book—which is already a best seller—is called “the age of the unthinkable”in a wallpapered room overlooking the east river among waiters passing canapés of foie gras and lobster i asked ramo about the genesis of his book “the summer before september th” he said “i had been doing volunteer work in an aids hospice in south africa and i realized our foreign policy was failing in a huge and dramatic way basically it was morally indecent then i came back and saw september th and saw that it was intellectually incoherent as well it was at that point where i really started saying to myself ‘okay something is deeply flawed in our system’” ramo says he wrote from four to eight every morningramo concludes that the models we use to think about the world and to solve our problems are wrong he thinks we should study terrorists hedgefund managers there’s a chapter called “the management secrets of hizb’allah” and other innovators who have learned to be resilient in a time of crisisbut what about his boss “dr kissinger’s summary” he said “after reading my book was ‘my understanding from reading this book is that you have complete contempt for me’ as an employee it’s kind of a conversationender but i’ve done my best to recover from that”kissinger who nonetheless was full of high praise for “young joshua” admitted as much “it has one basic theme that is a little difficult for me which is that my generation is sort of a bunch of dodos that we stagger through life with just one idea in our minds which on top of it is hugely wrong we don’t have the perception to look at the multiplicity of events that the modern generation experiences”nancy kissinger who was sitting next to me recommended the pigs in blankets i asked if she could explain geostrategic advising“i haven’t the vaguest idea” she said “your guess is as good as mine”most

is the difference between seo and sem which one is right for me search engine optimization seo is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results you cannot pay to improve your website ranking on bing or yahoo thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or organic search results clicks from seo are free but seo also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results you dont have to choose between seo and sem you can do both if my time is limited should i still try bing ads yes call a bing ads specialist at and we’ll set up your first
