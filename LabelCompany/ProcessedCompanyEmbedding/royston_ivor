ucsddate october  location san diego californiaroyston okay well thank you matt my names ivor royston does that sound is the level good or    shindell the level looks great royston okay so this is an interview with ivor royston its october   the interviewer is matthew shindell royston okay shindell dr royston if you could please tell us    royston how i got involved with    shindell how did you get involved in san diego biotech royston well it goes back to when i came down to san diego with howard birndorf since you mentioned his name so lets go back to – im doing my – i mean i dont know how far back you want me to go but well lets go back to the fact that in  i was a postdoctoral fellow at stanford medical center doing my oncology fellowship which was required to ultimately become a board certified oncologist  which was my goal shindell uhmhmm i had already completed internship and residency in internal medicine id done research at the nih and theres some great stories there too laugh i have and and then and then i finished up by doing my fellowship at stanford and when i was at stanford it was and i had experience as i mentioned doing medical research especially immunology and cell biology research shindell uhmhmm at nih in the years beforehand an article appeared in nature magazine which demonstrated the ability to make monoclonal antibodies it was written by george kohler and caesar milstein who ultimately years later won the nobel prize and in that article they talked about how you could make antibodies  in a cloned manner a large number of highlyspecific antibodies which had never been done before because in the old days if you wanted an antibody you would just bleed a goat or a sheep or shindell uhmhmm anyway and so you know if you wanted an antibody to lets say to a virus you would inject the virus into an animal the animal would make antibodies and you bled the animal and you took out the serum and you would have antibodies the only problem is it was a mixture of all kinds of different antibodies many many hundreds of types of different antibodies and it would never be an unlimited amount of any given antibody when kohlermilstein discovered that you could make unlimited amounts of a single antibody by using certain genetic engineering techniques that we call cell fusion it was analogous to the  the people who had cloned dna shindell uhmhmm and developed the recombinant dna revolution which is as you know the ability to make unlimited amounts of protein from a single dna this sparked the whole biotech revolution so here i saw the same potential and i realized boy if we can make unlimited amounts of a cloned antibody maybe we could develop antibodies as a new weapon for treating cancer shindell uhmhmm remember im studying to be a cancer doctor and my goal was to be on the faculty of a major cancer center and i realized at that point while i was at stanford that this was an area that i wanted to pursue when i read the technology about how you did this i said well i know how to do that i can do this and do this ive had that experience and i talked to howard about it who was working as a technician there shindell uhmhmm and i started writing grants in anticipation of doing that knowing that ultimately ill be winding up  at some place some university and so where i ended up was getting an offer from ucsd to come and join the new cancer center that was being developed at ucsd in  – by john mendelsohn this is the same john mendelsohn thats now head of md anderson who we just talked about shindell uhmhmm he was starting the cancer center at ucsd and was looking for several new faculty members to help him get started and i applied for that job and i was one of three that was chosen to head up the center shindell uhmhmm and to be the head of clinical immunology when john he interviewed me he said what do you want to work on i said well i want to make monoclonal antibodies to treat cancer and of course nobody knew what monoclonal antibodies were dr mendelson went on to become the inventor of erbitux which is one of the major antibodies today thats used to treat cancer shindell uhmhmm so i said to howard hey you know howard i got to know him and we did some stuff together at stanford i said why dont you come down with me to san diego i got the job why dont you come down to me  with me and well work on this new technology for making monoclonal antibodies so first thing we did we set up our lab and in  i took the job in july of  it was many years ago now right thats what were already in  so thats thirty years ago shindell uhmhmm were talking about it was back a long time so we set up the lab howard was my chief technician and i said okay why dont we work on leukemia lets take some leukemia cells and show that we can make a monoclonal antibody that reacts with leukemia but does not react with normal white cells to show that we can get a highly specific shindell uhmhmm antibody and so were using the kohlermilstein technology we went ahead and did this now i have to im going to diverge a little bit more than i would normally for you because clay movie producer is here shindell all right because there are some real great vignettes and anecdotes that hell be interested in them maybe more so than you but maybe im wrong  maybe anybody would so when you make these antibodies its like making bread you have to have yeast to shindell uhmhmm to make bread right to make these antibodies you need a cell line that you need to fuse with antibodycreating cells that you take out from the spleen of an animal in this case shindell uhmhmm mice and you fuse them together and that and you create what is called a hybridoma shindell uhmhmm a hybrid of both cells so the antibody cells from the spleen of the animal are programmed to make an antibody shindell uhmhmm but the cell line has the immortality factor n it can grow forever by fusing them together i created a cell line that could make a single antibody forever shindell uhmhmm thats the whole idea so the question people have often asked me when they talk about starting the industry down here is well where did the cell line come from this specific cell line well it this is a very interesting story because in those days in  there was no  such thing as an mta a material transfer agreement shindell uhmhmm today you cant send a biological cell line from one institution to another without signing an agreement that you wont commercialize it without the institution’s approval shindell uhmhmm  so heres what happened when i got the idea at stanford that i wanted to work on monoclonal antibodies for treating cancer i knew that i needed the cell line and shindell uhmhmm the only cell line i knew was the one that was developed in in england by kohler and milstein who later won the nobel prize i found out that one of the professors at stanford – shindell would you like me to pause it royston no thats all right so thirty years ago this professor was at the laboratory at kohler and milstein on a sabbatical when the discovery was made and while i was at stanford   when he heard about this discovery he actually brought the cell line back to stanford shindell uhmhmm and–then one of my colleagues in the oncology department at stanford got a hold of the cell line and started to do some experiments and then i also got a hold of the cell line from there people were just – and knowing that someday i was going to do this and i had my own liquid nitrogen tank shindell uhmhmm that i even though i did not have a faculty position i had my own liquid nitrogen tank that i brought from nih and parked in a professors laboratory and made him a deal i said look if you fill this up on a regular basis with liquid nitrogen to preserve it i will let you share some of the cells that are in my liquid nitrogen tank laugh because i what i did was when i was at nih before coming to stanford i had worked on a number of projects and i gathered a large number of what i cell lines which we kept in a frozen state in liquid nitrogen  and i felt that in my future career i might need those cells so what i did is i arranged to decommission the tank at the at nih thats the words that they use in the government to decommission means to get rid of it and so i was free to take the tank with me so i took this liquid nitrogen tank in a truck and took it cross country from bethesda maryland to stanford where i had my fellowship so i actually drove that tank laugh full of liquid nitrogen and cells personally to stanford as a young physician knowing that i might need it someday so when i got to stanford i had to have a place to put it so i went up to this doctor shindell uhmhmm i wont go into the names here and said somebody i got to know and befriended and i said look i have hundreds of different cell lines here that you may want to use ill let you use them just do me a favor keep this tank full with liquid nitrogen shindell uhmhmm he said fine so when i found out that this professor brought this cell line from – see this is stuff that no ones ever documented shindell uhmhmm before  when i found out that he had this cell line that he had just visited kohler and milstein where this nobel prize winning discovery was made that cell line was now at stanford so i got a hold of it because everybody i mean in these labs there were people starting to work with it shindell uhmhmm i just took some froze it down put it in my cell tank in my tank shindell uhmhmm that belonged to ivor royston so i now had the cell line in there thats a long story because when i moved to san diego the tank followed me laugh so when i moved i put the tank the ucsd paid for the moving expenses so i took my liquid nitrogen tank put it on the moving truck pages turning and it moved it south from from stanford to san diego so when i got to san diego i just pulled out the cells with howard shindell uhmhmm and ill bet you he didnt even tell you this story  so i pulled out the cells from the tank and we started saying okay  were going to start working on monoclonal antibodies i had a grant shindell uhmhmm from the nih were going to start working on making monoclonal antibodies for leukemia the issue is you have to have those cells shindell uhmhmm so okay i wasnt the only one that had those cells those cells  were actually distributed i mean if i had asked for them officially they probably would have sent it okay shindell uhmhmm i mean im just injecting a little humor about how i personally got the cells down but we get into a more serious issue about when i started the company hybritech shindell uhmhmm how the cells got from ucsd to the company thats a more serious issue because there were no rules and regulations then so at ucsd so we started out to make these antibodies to leukemia well we were very successful thats the nice thing about about something that really works shindell uhmhmm we started doing the experiments and they started working just you know on schedule and became very you know it worked really really well we took we injected these leukemia cells into mice we took the spleens out of the mice we fused it with our cell line that i had just grown up from the liquid nitrogen tank that we know had worked published in nature and we fused them and sure enough we had cells growing in culture that were making antibodies to leukemia cells and then the eureka moment was when we tested those antibodies we found out we could pick out antibody clones that reacted just with the  leukemia cells and not with normal white blood cells we were looking for that what we call that tumorspecific antibody shindell uhmhmm and i said howard weve got it this is fantastic we can now go ahead and treat cancer but how but how shindell uhmhmm how am i going to grow it up in large scale you know you need to grow out from there how am i going to make gram quantities of the stuff and how am i going to purify it how am i going to manufacture it how am i going to do whatever i was stuck but the idea was yeah but how do i get to the next step of implementation shindell uhmhmm so howard would say to me well lets well license it to a company well you know lets go talk to a pharmaceutical company so i go talk to eli lilly shindell uhmhmm or or smith kline or whatever the companies were in those days and and they didnt know what i was talking about and i said well im cloning these antibodies now were talking  the end of  the invention was only made in  at you know people were not really shindell uhmhmm i mean nobody it was really still very early and people didnt   you know couldnt relate to me what do you mean growing antibodies in a test tube you know there was nobody that really understood what i was talking about so i said to howard you know when we were at stanford you know when people had these great ideas they started companies like genentech shindell uhmhmm and my professor john daniels started a company called collagen maybe we just need to start our own company and he said okay lets do that so i said well you know were going to have to write a business plan or something and so i went to the library and got a book about how to write a business plan shindell uhmhmm but then i had just gotten married and i married a woman that i had met at stanford who came down from stanford and joined me so now i was married and she was a nurse at stanford and we had had a relationship going on and when i left to come  to san diego she still was at stanford and i said look why dont you move down to san diego so we can continue the relationship its hard for me to get up there shindell uhmhmm im on the faculty at ucsd and so she came down and we got married then one day i was talking to her about this whole thing i said i think we ought to start a company because these pharma companies dont know what im talking about shindell uhmhmm well just start our own company because we got to manufacture these antibodies got to get them into patients if we want to cure cancer i was only focused at that time as a young investigator you know i was here in san diego to figure out a way to cure cancer shindell uhmhmm thats what my whole life was from a as an eightyearold boy i was programmed to go into oncology to go to medical school to go into cure cancer shindell what drew you to oncology royston the curiosity the intellectual curiosity that no one knew anything about cancer i had nobody who died of cancer in my immediate family later on my mother passed away from cancer shindell uhmhmm when she was seventyfive but when i grew up there were no cancer deaths in my family except for a distant  cousin who had hodgkins disease and died but i didnt know him very well but it was more like when people talk about cancer well what is cancer you know when they talk about it its well cells are growing and killing no one knew what – it was a black box shindell uhmhmm and i was driven by the intellectual curiosity shindell uhmhmm and felt that thats the next frontier in medicine – i knew i wanted to be in go into medicine and that that i had chose cancer so and it was only when this discovery was made that i chose to focus on well lets use this new technology for developing the magic bullets for treating cancer shindell uhmhmm so im talking to my wife my wife said well you know i met this guy up in the bay area you know i dated him once and he called he said he was he called himself a venture capitalist and i had never heard the word venture i really didnt know what a venture capitalist was which is the irony right then because now laugh were venture capitalists he knows that because many thirty years later i am a venture capitalist laugh and but in those days i didnt know what a venture capitalist – i said well what do they do and she says well you know they start companies they invest in  companies thats how genentech got started and so i said well maybe i should talk to one of these guys and she says well okay i know this guy brook byers its now kleiner perkins caufield  byers shindell uhmhmm which is the number one venture capital firm i said why not give him a call so she calls him and she says you know my husbands got this idea and he said well just to be nice to her he says you know hes going to be in san francisco at a meeting can he stop by and talk to you or have lunch with you and he wants to be hes being nice to her because he had laugh known her once before or dated her once he said sure have your husband get in touch with me and shindell uhmhmm stop by so i had this pivotal lunch in san francisco and it would have been in the summer of  and the reason i know that because when ultimately when he finally got involved it was october well somewhere around well maybe late spring early summer of  but we had made our when we when i moved to san diego in july of  and set up my lab we had  those results about with the antibodies differentiating leukemia cells from normal white blood so we had that like in about six months shindell uhmhmm it was really we were very lucky very fortunate things really worked out well and howard was my chief technician then so i met with brook byers who was the junior partner had just joined the firm a little bit earlier he was trying to make a name for himself and i obviously said all the right things at the lunch because i said you know brook nice to meet you and all that you know i have this idea and i said you know just like you can clone genes to make insulin thats what they did at the time insulin and human growth hormone – thats what genentech had done in those days shindell uhmhmm – you know we can also clone antibodies now by using this new technology so that resonated with him cloning genes and cloning antibodies and i said cloning antibodies will be just as big as cloning genes shindell uhmhmm because there are so many different things you could do with antibodies so he got it so when i made the analogy between what i was doing and the and the success they had had with genentech because that was like a huge success at that time in   shindell uhmhmm it had already gone public as i recall in  and they had already been making insulin he said do me a favor write up this what you just told me today write it up and send me a a little outline or plan of what we just talked about here shindell uhmhmm and tell me how you think this would work and what kind of a business you could make out of it and let me think about it so i went home and talked to howard and actually that’s when we got the business plan book from the library i said we need write up this this  page document shindell uhmhmm that that document still exists and the original is at the chemical heritage society but copies have been used in business classes at stanford business school where its become the basis for entrepreneurial lectures so i have that document if you ever want to see it shindell well actually howard made me a copy of it royston okay shindell i think i have a copy and actually ted greene also royston yes told me about    royston its now    shindell told me about the case study there royston yeah yeah royston i ted and i did the case study  at stanford it became a case study up at stanford business school and this fivepage document that i wrote dear brook its a fivepage letter and i outlined the technology why it was important the competition – there wasnt any except for one small thing – and the funny thing is i said what would we do with these antibodies to make money and so i realized well the immediate thing was blood testing because when i thought whats the most important application for antibodies in  well shindell diagnostics the hepatitis blood test which every unit of blood was screened against was done with an antibody test shindell uhmhmm and they were using these impure antibodies that extracted from serum of rabbits or whatever and i said we could make a much better test if you had a monoclonal antibody to hepatitis and then obviously the opportunity to make antibodies to many other agents and because most many tests were antibodybased shindell uhmhmm so i wrote that up as you know we could make this diagnostics business and then maybe in the future you know we could work towards  making antibodies as therapeutics but that of course thats it takes a lot of a longer term shindell uhmhmm i sent that that letter to brook byers it is now well documented as i say it appears in a number of places as you know and he hired a due diligent expert another scientist in the antibody space to read it and i guess it came back positive and the bottom line is by september or so the whole team of kleiner perkins caufield  byers flew down to san diego to our lab and met with howard and me and shindell uhmhmm we spent the whole day with them we showed them how we made the antibodies how we made the cell lines we showed them the cells under the microscope and then we showed how we tested for the antibodies and that afternoon they asked me after driving them to the airport and i think i was alone thats right howard wasnt with me and were at the airport and tom perkins whos really famous today shindell uhmhmm i dont know if you know him you know he owns the maltese falcon the boat and he was married to danielle  steele so tom perkins says to me so ivor how much money do you need to show me that you can make these antibodies outside the university you know you open up a lab somewhere else so i said well you know we can do this for about i said a couple hundred thousand dollars give me a couple hundred thousand dollars and we can make some antibodies for you and then tom looks at me and says ill give you  and well take i think he said well take sixtyfive percent of the company well form a company ill take well take sixtyfive percent well give you  and you and howard and all the future employees of the company will split up the other thirtyfive percent laughter so i said fine you know that somebody was going to support us to start a company thats all we cared about we didnt know anything else the biggest question i get at stanford business school when i give the lecture is you know why would you sell so cheaply shindell uhmhmm well making money wasnt our primary objective we werent  there to make money  i was trying to figure out how to cure cancer in those days so they gave us  and howard will tell you stories about what he did with the check and how his car broke down laugh and all that kind of stuff neither of us had ever seen that much money i come from a lowermiddle class family  we had never seen a check for  before but you know they just wrote out a check and heres the money go put it in the bank shindell uhmhmm so howard was in charge well i had made arrangement at that point when they agreed to fund the company howard agreed to leave my lab at the university and help set up the company shindell right and build it because i i was still a faculty member he was a laboratory technician shindell uhmhmm so he agreed to be the first employee and then he went out and he did a great job because he then hired this really great scientist from scripps to come and join him shindell uhmhmm and and so the goal was to prove to us that you can make an antibody outside the university shindell uhmhmm and we had said well what antibody are we going to make so i said  lets make hepatitis antibodies shindell uhmhmm you know why not its the number one test being i mean thats being used for antibodies so thats what we did shindell uhmhmm so we got a hold of hepatitis antigen and we started injecting mice with it and and that was all done outside in a private laboratory but heres the interesting thing so the company hybritech shindell uhmhmm had formed they needed the cell line this is something that would never happen today i took the cells out of my lab at the university and gave them to howard and he took them over to the company and that was – because the company had to have the cell line to shindell uhmhmm have to start to make the antibodies shindell and it was    like yeast shindell it was that that simple just move them over royston that it was that simple it could not be done today laugh you cant move biological products that have commercial value shindell uhmhmm from one university or in one entity to another without all kinds of agreements shindell uhmhmm but in those days it was the wild frontier there were no there was no biotech  industry shindell uhmhmm and there were no agreements and no one even thought about implementing what we call an mta a material transfer agreement shindell uhmhmm which came later in the s after people saw what happened laugh so i took the cell line and no ones ever accused me of – we dont even know whose who owned those cell lines shindell uhmhmm i mean i got them from stanford and the guy from stanford got them from cambridge and the guys in cambridge never patented the technology shindell right and theyve been harshly criticized for that the mrc in the uk lost hundreds and millions of dollars because the technology was never patented shindell uhmhmm because scientists didnt think about patents here was one of the most important discoveries ever made in england and it was never patented shindell uhmhmm can you believe it the cohenboyer group in stanford and ucsf patented the genetic engineering technology and they got a tremendous amount of royalties from all the genetic engineering companies genentech amgen and so forth shindell uhmhmm cedes and every company that was doing genetic engineering but in the monoclonal antibody  space there were no patents shindell uhmhmm and thats why i was able to do what i did but the company got off the ground because the cells that i brought down in my tank from stanford laugh to san diego then made its way over to the company the company gave birth in the labs of the la jolla cancer research foundation that had some additional space they were willing to lease to us shindell uhmhmm and so howard was in charge hired the guys and brook byers became acting president he flew down here every week spent a couple days a few days i was acting chief scientist and i did that after hours and hybritech gave birth shindell uhmhmm and then within again i guess we had the magic touch in those days within three to four months we had antibody we had pure monoclonal antibodies to hepatitis shindell yeah all kinds of different subsets of hepatitis virus so we accomplished our goal the milestone kleiner perkins the firm was very pleased and they pumped in even more money into the company shindell uhmhmm  at that point the next stage was they put in maybe i cant remember if it’s the stage they put in  million maybe or a million or  million i mean in the millions but then it came time now that they saw this could really this is for real that we could reproduce what we did that it was time to get a permanent shindell uhmhmm ceo and thats where ted greene came shindell uhmhmm so when we heard brook and i that there was this guy named ted greene who was exbaxter executive who a year after us had decided well maybe there was a future in the monoclonal antibody arena and was going to put together a team to develop a monoclonal antibody company well brook and i said  lets go talk to him because we need a ceo shindell uhmhmm maybe all we have to do is convince him to be our ceo and then hell drop his plans of trying to create a company that would actually compete with us and thats exactly what we did shindell uhmhmm and i think both howard and i will remember the day when we  drove up to newport beach where ted greene lived and got together with him with brook byers and we suggested to him look were already up and running weve got weve already made hepatitis antibodies with this shindell uhmhmm you know weve got kleiner perkins the number one venture capital firm behind us that started genentech lets go – why dont you join us as the ceo shindell uhmhmm and after all the protracted going back and forth he did that he joined us as ceo shindell how did you all know that he was interested in monoclonals because according to him he was trying to keep that    royston have you already done the ted greene interview shindell yeah he was trying to keep that information sort of secret royston but it got out shindell it got out okay royston this is a small world right i mean people i dont know who heard about it first but shindell uhmhmm probably i think – no brook byers heard about it first shindell oh okay royston so ted joined us as ceo and you know what makes a successful company is not just the technology or what i did or its bringing in the right managers and im a firm believer that you cant have a successful company without the the best managers like ted greene shindell uhmhmm because what it you know  what ted did the first thing he did when he came in as ceo and this is very important is he when he saw what we had you know we had the technology up and running we could make antibodies and we had and we had hepatitis antibody so i you know i was pretty naïve im just an academician i said okay well we ought to compete with abbott that had the monopoly on hepatitis tests shindell uhmhmm lets compete with abbott and we can come up with a better hepatitis test you know shindell uhmhmm and ted greene looks at me and he said are you crazy you dont go you dont take your first product that youre going to bet the company on and go against abbott theyre going to destroy you abbott is not going to give up their testing that easily and theyll destroy you and he said we are not going to develop hepatitis testing you shindell uhmhmm he says he said to us and we now had a bunch of scientists there he said you guys have got to come up with another product that we can develop as a lead product here in the diagnostic space because the therapeutic area of treating  cancer thats thats years and years away shindell uhmhmm but the idea that ted and we all agreed with that ted came up with lets come up with a diagnostic strategy that can bring in nearterm revenues because you know you dont need fda approval for that you just – well you do to sell a diagnostic test you need to do some studies but its not like therapeutics shindell right lets come up with a shindell right diagnostic test that we can sell to them you know based on these monoclonal antibodies to bring in nearterm revenues while we build our therapeutic program and so were sitting around and im still acting chief scientist and i can remember the day we were sitting around with our little group around the tables what are we going to work on what are we going to work on if were not going to do hepatitis and one of the new people it was gary david and you can certainly interview him he was one of the first scientists there he said you know ive been reading about this  new antigen called psa shindell uhmhmm and it was discovered or developed discovered and characterized in roswell park and they claimed that it secreted in patients with prostate cancer and it might be a market for prostate cancer why dont we make an antibody to that and develop a test for prostate cancer shindell uhmhmm maybe we could develop and early blood early diagnostic test for men to pick up prostate cancer while its still early we all said hey thats a great idea lets get some more information and actually thats what happened the company said yeah this is a great opportunity shindell uhmhmm thats an untapped market there was some interesting evidence that maybe that measuring psa levels in the blood might tell you whether a man might have earlystage prostate cancer shindell uhmhmm so we decided thats something we ought to explore and so somebody in the company went ahead and made a deal with roswell park  to license in that antigen so we injected it into this psa antigen that was discovered injected it into mice made the antibodies developed tests and sure enough – im jumping years now several a couple years – we were able to demonstrate in that we could pick up prostate cancer shindell uhmhmm and the psa test ultimately became the most important new development in prostate cancer because all men over age fifty get the psa test today and i just got mine last week for prostate cancer picking up early a lot of men have been diagnosed with prostate cancer because of that blood test shindell uhmhmm and thats another long story about whether thats useful or not  but its a very very common test today and that was developed by hybritech by our team so of all the things that hybritech ultimately did contribute to society was the development of that test they did make other tests as well pregnancy tests cea test for colon cancer shindell uhmhmm but the most important  test for society was the psa test for prostate cancer interestingly abbott laboratories ultimately developed their own shindell uhmhmm because they were the number one diagnostics test maker in those days so heres a great example of how having somebody out of industry who understood strategically that you dont bet your first product and compete against a giant in the field but go after something new paid off shindell uhmhmm hybritech went public in  and by and then at  a share when there was a public market you see shindell uhmhmm for it and then by  did another public offering at  a share shindell uhmhmm and ultimately was acquired by eli lilly and that story relates to the fact that that even though we had this diagnostics business we knew that longterm the real value for the company lay in developing therapeutics  but we also realized that it would take a lot of money and i remember tom perkins coming in one day and he was on the board and said what if i could get you a pharmaceutical a pharmaceutical company to come in acquire the company but at least and leave you guys to be sort of semiindependent to continue the work but youd have all that money from the pharmaceutical and that led to the acquisition by eli lilly which took place in  or five shindell uhmhmm and thats what happened we were acquired by eli lilly okay so ive just described for you what i consider the you know the birth of the industry because hybritech was the first biotech company in san diego shindell uhmhmm now me personally i want you to understand that oh i even though initially i was the chief scientific officer by so once ted greene was there he wanted to hire a permanent chief scientist shindell uhmhmm to do it so he hired a guy named tom adams shindell uhmhmm he came out  after a year of negotiations so he probably came in about  or so or something like that and came on board and so my role now was really one of being a consultant to the company and being on the board of directors and i was focused you know i was still focused on my academic pursuits of of using antibodies for treating cancer and and but working with hybritech was helping me to some extent in that so so one just on a sidelight then you need one thing thats – its interesting youre doing this for ucsd shindell uhmhmm library but you ought to know that in those days the idea that one of the faculty members would be involved with a company shindell uhmhmm  was not not mainstream shindell right it was actually looked down upon to some extent people started asking questions about my involvement with hybritech they asked well how can he do that shindell uhmhmm how can he be a fulltime member of the ucsd faculty and at the same time start a company shindell uhmhmm well the fact of the matter and it all goes the answer to that is because of the twenty percent rule that all faculties have around the country and university is that youre allowed to use twenty percent of your time shindell uhmhmm to consult for other companies and there was no prohibition to getting stock or fees shindell now is was your perception that they were upset over the additional income or was it maybe this sort of  image of like isolated ivorytower science being maybe corrupted by working outside as well sort of breaking down that wall between royston right academia and industry royston this ivorytower concept was already breaking down because there was this class distinction between what we call basic scientists and clinical scientists shindell uhmhmm i was always considered not a basic scientist but a translational scientist so i always felt that the basic scientist the ivorytower basic scientist who do pure science always looked down upon me shindell uhmhmm and thats a whole other story because there was also at ucsd in those days you had the basic scientists on campus in la jolla and you had the clinical scientists downtown we were even separated shindell uhmhmm no it was much more wait a minute ivor started a company and hes got all this stuff how could he do that and still be on the faculty shindell uhmhmm how did he do that is that legal you know shindell yeah laugh well the answer is yes its legal yes its  there is the twentypercent rule that a faculty member could consult for other companies twenty up to twenty percent of his time shindell uhmhmm so on a legal basis what i was doing was i was consulting for hybritech up to twenty percent of my time so there were no problem there shindell uhmhmm and there were no rules that said that i couldnt have stock in the company shindell uhmhmm or even if i spent time over at hybritech i was allowed to do that up to twenty percent of my time shindell uhmhmm and any professor was allowed to consult for a pharmaceutical company or any professor could consult for any company and that was a way of course to allow academics who had modest salaries to boost their income by getting consulting fees shindell uhmhmm in my case it wasnt so much the cash fees it was the equity that i got in the shindell uhmhmm company that i was consulting for shindell uhmhmm but what happened is there were a lot of secret meetings taking place at ucsd amongst the faculty like what do we do with royston shindell really how can he do this there must be something  wrong and those were the days when people looked look down on commercial involvement and they were i mean yeah a little bit somewhat a ivorytower mentality but looking down on people who were spending the time outside and benefiting from it of course it wasnt really any different from any faculty member in any department who shindell uhmhmm who consulted for any company but this was different shindell well maybe the – is it because the life sciences sort of were you know they didnt really have a tradition of that royston thats right there was no – it was not like the engineering school shindell right there was no tradition in life science and youre absolutely right because all you have to do is look at where we are today shindell uhmhmm today youre the exception in medical school if youre not consulting with somebody or not a founder of a company things over the past thirty years have changed dramatically shindell uhmhmm i was there on the front line shindell uhmhmm in the beginning so as brook byers said the famous quote when i complained to him about this situation he said that that herb boyer  the founder of genentech went through the same thing to some extent shindell uhmhmm and he was a professor at ucsf brook byerss comment was well dont forget ivor pioneers always have arrows shot at them laugh and and thats the answer to this dilemma so he was saying look youre the pioneer down here in san diego youre the first youre going to have arrows shot at you and thats what happened i mean it did also lead to at one point anonymous letters being sent in to nih asking them to investigate me because they shindell uhmhmm just figured i was doing something wrong and they did do an investigation they didnt find anything wrong but i always tried to be absolutely scrupulous about things shindell uhmhmm but but i was investigated and these are the kinds of things that you had to put after  but now years later this is the norm now shindell yeah so i paved the way for all those that came later i had to take some hits shindell uhmhmm but they were just emotional ones people not wanting to talk to me in the hallway things like that shindell did you ever question what you were doing royston no at this time no royston i always felt that what  i was doing was right but remember my goal all the time was how do i get this stuff into patients shindell uhmhmm how do i treat patients i was not in it for the money i didnt start hybritech oh ive got this great technology i want to make a million dollars no it was weve got to start this company so i can make the antibodies so i can get them into patients so i can test them to see if these antibodies will be a new treatment for cancer thats what shindell uhmhmm it was all about so but now over the years developed having worked with people like brook byers and other business and venture capitalists and understanding their business more and developing a respect for what they did ultimately i think when you get older and maybe you realize that youre not going to be getting the nobel prize like roger tsien just got at ucsd someone like me would rather work as a venture capitalist helping other creative scientists be successful  i decided shindell uhmhmm to start i decided to move in that direction and to become a venture capitalist shindell uhmhmm which i started that process in  but it didn’t complete until about  when i came here fulltime and even though i started this company with stan fleming and i had voluntarily left ucsd to become the head of the sidney kimmel cancer center shindell uhmhmm which i did until  biogen idec was an outgrowth from hybritech once hybritech was sold to eli lilly and i was still on my quest to use antibodies for treating cancer i decided it was time to to focus on a company that was really focused on treating cancer with antibodies shindell uhmhmm and i was able to convince  kleiner perkins and venrock another firm to fund idec for the purpose of making monoclonal antibodies for treating lymphoma cancer of the lymph system and and that was successful and the first antibody for cancer was rituxan which was approved by the fda in  even though we formed idec in  about the time that lilly was acquired the same time that lilly acquired hybritech is when i formed idec shindell uhmhmm and and idec became a very successful company here in san diego shindell uhmhmm you worked with bill rastetter there is that right royston yeah so bill rastetter became the ceo shindell uhmhmm so again i teamed up with brook byers and then again for the second company and then we needed to hire a ceo so we it was brook again that had heard that there was this really topnotch guy at genentech named bill rastetter shindell uhmhmm that may maybe would be a good candidate to be ceo of the new company  so we interviewed bill and then he got the job yeah and he became the ceo of idec shindell this isnt exactly a historical question but you know if you could take the you of today and stand next to the you of you know the early days of hybritech you know do you think that your mentality now as a venture capitalist verses you know a scientific advisor or chief scientist has that mentality changed would you have different ideas now the person you are now versus who you were then is there a difference between a chief scientist royston well    and a venture capitalist royston well my chief scientist in a company or    shindell well    royston what i was back then was still an academic scientist shindell right royston i never was an employee in industry i was an academic scientist trying publishing papers trying to discover new things and particularly trying to develop new treatments for cancer using antibodies shindell uhmhmm so    that was my role at the university i was  a fulltime university shindell uhmhmm faculty member my goal was to cure cancer shindell so im wondering if    royston so if you say my you of back then me back then was focused on my science at ucsd the hybritech or the idec those were like sidelights for me shindell uhmhmm they were not my major goals but ultimately i as i said i developed an appreciation for that and over time i realized that the convergence of business and medicine was an a way to accelerate shindell uhmhmm discovery and to accelerate getting ideas into the clinic shindell uhmhmm and into the market place for the benefit of people but an overarching goal as a venture capitalist is to make a good financial return for our investors the two goals are really very different shindell i think thats what i was    royston as a university researcher i realized boy you know you write all these grants  to do your science you have to really love the science to do that shindell uhmhmm you know building doing small incremental studies to build on the science its a building block thing and and you write grants and you get you know   a year for your work and so forth but there was something about being able to take millions of investment dollars and focusing it on somebodys science shindell uhmhmm where there might be some great innovation and really creating something from nothing and moving and developing a whole new technology or product area like i had done with hybritech and idec shindell uhmhmm but at some and so as i grew older i realized that the skill set that i had developed might be useful for others shindell uhmhmm so that i could play a role with the next ivor royston you know down the line or the next person  who had a great idea and with my experience i thought once you realize that youre not going to get the nobel prize yourself that youre not going to that all youre going to do is – at one if you believe that youre not going to make that big discovery thats going to really change the world laugh then i felt that what i could do i could play a better a better role at doing or at making a major contribution shindell uhmhmm by combining business and medicine the combination the joining of business and medicine is a way to really accelerate discovery and move things along much faster and i could see that from my own personal experience and i decided that that that would be something that i would like to do shindell uhmhmm so i moved in that direction over time to where i am today which is what i do today here at forward ventures shindell uhmhmm i teamed up with stan fleming so when i was running the sidney kimmel cancer center i decided to leave the university because of all the bureaucracy and i wasnt  as concerned about longterm tenure and i had the successes in hybritech and idec and i decided that the opportunity to build my own cancer center with the help of other people and it turned out to be sidney kimmel i was able to get to know sidney kimmel quite well shindell uhmhmm whos was the owner of jones new york and made a major commitment to cancer research so we started the sidney kimmel cancer center in san diego and we built that up very nicely and and at the same time i dabbled with getting involved with venture capital with my own money and stan fleming joined me and he said lets build a real venture capital firm ill be the the business guy ill do the work and so we did build a firm to where it is today and then at and then back as both this cancer center and sidney and forward ventures were growing it became clear  to me that i had to choose shindell uhmhmm and then it also became clear to me that choosing forward ventures is how i wanted to finish up my career because i evolved at the sidney kimmel cancer center as more of an administrator adjudicating fights between shindell uhmhmm professors or its faculty members who wanted more space and more money and i really wasnt i didnt feel like i was really moving the ball very far in the nonprofit area i decided to pursue the venture capital model with stan and spend fulltime on venture capital which i did starting in  shindell uhmhmm so ive been fulltime here at forward venture since  so eight years but and parttime since  when stan joined me to start the institutional forward ventures while i was still running the cancer center shindell uhmhmm now i have a whole other set of questions thats royston right really more to do with the sort of the landscape  of san diego biotech and what youve witnessed you know as the landscape has changed or royston dramatically yeah as this situation of biotech startups has changed over the years but i know that you wanted to keep it under an hour so maybe we can leave that for a followup royston yeah interview if youd like royston sure shindell okay royston i do just to make a comment that the landscape has obviously changed in the quarter of a century shindell uhmhmm you know when i when i started hybritech there were no biotech companies here there were no service providers there was no nothing here everything came down from the bay area now you have one of the top regions in the world for biotech shindell uhmhmm so im really happy that i played some role in that you know i mean part of the first company but all those people – and you know its a fantastic community and now were in an environment where where most medical scientists and professors enjoy being involved with biotech companies shindell uhmhmm and pharmaceutical and its an active effort by all of the university  administrators and program leaders to develop ties with industry and the biotech community so everythings totally flipflopped over the years shindell uhmhmm so i feel like thats great and people understand the importance of the industry the other thing is we went through an era in in the s where nih money declined abruptly and people were scrambling for grants we actually are in one of those eras right now shindell uhmhmm and because and there were opportunities within the biotech industry companies that had started to to actually give out grants and so forth and people understood that there might be opportunities to get money for their research when theres more biotech activity so yeah things have changed dramatically and we can talk about that next time we meet shindell okay and thatll be good shindell all right great well thank you very much for royston okay putting aside this time royston yeah you can just schedule a time   end of interview uc san diego
