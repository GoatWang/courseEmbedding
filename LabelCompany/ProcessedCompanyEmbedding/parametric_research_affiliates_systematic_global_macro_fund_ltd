download key points ample highquality research has identified three key factors operating in the global macro context—carry momentum and value—that can be employed in systematic global investment strategies as a diversifying alternative source of investment returns  a portfolio of  individual strategies using stocks bonds currencies and commodities delivers a package of carry momentum and value that generates strong absolute returns at moderate levels of risk and leverage  global macro offers the average investor an opportunity—once enjoyed by only the most sophisticated hedge funds—to benefit from alternative sources of return a quartercentury before brexit came “black wednesday” on wednesday evening september   the british government announced its exit from the european exchange rate mechanism prompting a dramatic devaluation of the british pound renowned hedge fund manager george soros’ legendary bet against the pound in  and his  billion profit on black wednesday defines for many the swashbuckling style of a global macro trader global macro has since become a wellestablished discipline and for good reason handsome returns can be generated from strategies that profit from the predictable relationships between macroeconomics politics and monetary policy while forecasting market reactions to idiosyncratic macro events may seem a black art or a fool’s errand our study of capital markets reveals recognizable patterns and the possibility of consistently profitable trading strategies ample highquality research has identified three key factors operating within the global macro context carry momentum and value today we may choose from a growing category of strategies that employ these factors to deliver alternative return premiums these systematic global investment strategies may provide an attractive and diversifying alternative source of investment returns to the low yields and low returns offered by mainstream stocks and bonds  from asset classes to factors the investment industry has evolved since the early s when soros infamously battled central bankers global macro managers still rely on economic and political events to generate the conditions that present attractive trades across the capital markets—equities fixed income currencies and commodities—but in today’s world the strategies we use to spot attractive investment opportunities have become more systematic the rise of machines has improved our ability to process information and identify from large datasets the patterns that can turn opportunity into profit systematic strategies employ quantitative models to determine trading decisions models are specified upfront and ideally change infrequently indeed if managers frequently manipulate their model parameters to generate the trades indicated by their gut then the process remains qualitative beyond relying on objective evidence systematic approaches isolate trades from the psychological biases internal politics and other personal and organizational stresses that too often interfere with executing sound investment strategy as a result an increasing number of funds have migrated from discretionary human pattern recognition to systematic models these quantitative strategies using modern financial technology may allow investors access to profit from global macro opportunities with much greater transparency and lower cost than the typical global macro hedge fund at the core of systematic macro strategies lie few if any secret ingredients the strategies invest across markets by relying on signals that measure welldocumented return factors   factors exploit patterns in capital markets to generate return premiums from long–short positions which provide an alternative to the traditional returns offered by longonly positions in stock and bond markets an exhaustive examination of these patterns and their resulting trading strategies is beyond the scope of this article we will discuss however the most robust and wellunderstood factors that may produce alternative return premiums carry momentum and value these factors behave uniformly across assets and can be harvested in a consistent fashion using liquid exchangetraded instruments  readers interested in scholarly articles explaining the theory and evidence in support of the carry momentum and value factors can find what they seek on social science research network or google scholar we explain here in layman’s terms why each provides consistent profits and then review our results verifying and extending earlier research on systematic global macro investing the carry trade carry is the staple of many global macro strategies the carry trade refers to a long position in a relatively higheryielding security financed by a short position in a loweryielding security the spread between the yields is the carry on the position like all profitable investment strategies carry is not risk free the returns from the carry trade are however too large and consistent relative to traditional stock and bond market return premiums to be fully explained by their risk supply and demand imbalances created by structural rigidities likely explain the excess returns of carry trades mrs watanabe the proverbial japanese housewife is the world’s most famous carry trader for decades she has been astutely exploiting official policy in japan to boost the returns on her savings as she sells yen to buy higheryielding securities denominated in foreign currencies why is this persistently profitable carry trade available to mrs watanabe mrs watanabe understands that interest and exchange rates are not set by a free market for capital assets the japanese ministry of finance in cahoots with the bank of japan has for many decades regulated local financial markets to depress the cost of capital to benefit japan’s exporters by restricting local investment choices for japanese savers this intentionally depressed cost of capital has resulted in persistently low and even negative interest rates for local japanese savers the policy to manipulate prices to pursue policy goals creates the opportunity for mrs watanabe to sell persistently lowyielding yen to purchase securities denominated in other higheryielding currencies trend following “trend following” is the common term for investing using price momentum going long securities whose prices have been rising over recent months and going short securities whose prices have been falling has provided consistent profits this strategy is so popular that an entire investment style called “managed futures” is dedicated to nothing more than straightforward trend following  the persistent profits from long–short trend following may create a conundrum for believers in efficient markets but few actual participants in financial markets can fail to notice the reality of price trends new information immediately moves the price of a security or group of related securities while the direction of the move may be obvious the correct magnitude of price change consistent with the news is much less certain press attention to both the news and the following price reactions in the market creates feedback that reinforces the initial price moves thereby creating trends trends may begin with moving the prices of securities toward a changed perception of value resulting from fundamental news but often persist far beyond any reasonable estimate of fair value investors often seem to jump on a trend without much regard for the connection of prices to fundamentals history is replete with such selfreinforcing trends divorced from valuations the tulip craze in s holland the south sea bubble of  railway manias of the mids the roaring bull market of the s nifty fifty stocks in the s japan’s asset price bubble of the s and the late s tech bubble to name just a few momentum has proven to be robust across the financial markets including currencies commodities equities and fixed income  value investing the trouble with trend following is getting off the train before it changes direction often after a violent crash the mirror image of trend following is value investing the basic tenets of value investing have been known at least since graham and dodd wrote security analysis in the s to understand why value investing does not prevent trends from proceeding beyond fair value but remains a persistently profitable discipline we need only consider the profound discomfort required to hold the contrarian positions revealed by valuation information the recent tale of michael burry the eccentric physician and value investor portrayed by christian bale in the movie based on michael lewis’ book the big short provides a particularly poignant example spotting the housing bubble and mispricing of mortgagebacked securities was not sufficient to correct prices in the us housing market michael burry had to negotiate for the creation of credit default swaps on subprime mortgages battle disgruntled fund investors demanding the liquidation of his positions and the return of their capital and generally display conviction and strength of character few of us could match—all while waiting to see if his solvency could outlast the markets’ irrationality uncomfortable indeed the evidence to explore the potential for systematic global macro investing we empirically investigate the performance of carry momentum and value factors across equity bond currency and commodity markets we have examined many different definitions for the three factors in these markets our discussion of empirical results centers on the following factor definitions we choose these definitions for their robustness and implementation characteristics rather than following the tempting practice of cherrypicking the bestperforming factors over our sample period from january  to june  we begin our analysis in  the earliest date for which all required data are available across all asset classes our strategies invest in futures and forward contracts associated with eight developedmarket year government bonds  developedmarket currencies  developedmarket equity indices and  commodities  the carry and value portfolios use crosssectional strategies these portfolios take equally weighted long positions in the top third of derivatives contracts ranked by our signals and equally weighted short positions in the bottom third of contracts this crosssectional process hedges out the market exposure the momentum portfolios use a timeseries formation in which each contract is compared with its own history the strategy goes long contracts with positive momentum and shorts contracts with negative momentum the timeseries process can lead to net long or net short positions at any point in time although those exposures mostly average out over time  at  gross exposure to each strategy we compute the excess returns volatilities and sharpe ratios of the three factors the historical return opportunities have been quite compelling with sharpe ratios as high as  and an average sharpe ratio of  for comparison the sp  index achieved a  sharpe ratio over the same period the returns themselves an average of  suggest the need for higher degrees of portfolio leverage to reach satisfactory returns and the volatilities an average of  allow room for judicious use of leverage  of course evaluating these strategies on a standalone basis ignores the powerful benefits of diversification carry momentum and value have naturally low or negative correlation to one another we believe carry strategies provide a return primarily to compensate for exposure to risk investors earn the carry as their return if spot prices do not change and risk manifests through changing spot prices  momentum and value in contrast aim to take advantage of those changes in spot prices—momentum over the short run and value over longer horizons thus these three strategies complement each other well and value in particular helps insulate carry portfolios against crash risk  the average pairwise correlation of  as shown in the following correlation matrix confirms the strong diversification potential of combining these three strategies we see pockets of significant correlation for example the momentum portfolios exhibit positive correlation across asset classes suggesting that strategies focused on momentum alone a path followed by many managed futures funds forgo the opportunity to significantly improve results through allocating to complementary strategies value especially provides strong diversification exhibiting negative correlation to momentum and carry within asset classes while momentum and carry are positively correlated within asset classes the importance of even marginal return strategies such as value in commodities is clear although the sharpe ratio for the standalone strategy is not significantly different from zero the powerful diversification properties it brings to the portfolio greatly reduce drawdowns and improve the risk–return tradeoff for a combined commodities portfolio  putting the  individual strategies together in a single portfolio  delivers a package of carry momentum and value that provides the potential for strong absolute returns at moderate levels of risk and leverage the historical annual excess return over the ½year period of our analysis averages  at  volatility an impressive  sharpe ratio—double even the best sharpe ratio of the individual strategies additionally these impressive sharpe ratios come with low risk when measured by other means than standard deviation of returns in the last ½ years the portfolio was not subject to the extreme crash risk faced by many carry and momentum strategies the portfolio’s largest drawdown occurred in – peaking at − and fully recovering within  months in fact the portfolio exhibits positive skew rather than the negative skew associated with crash risk neither does the portfolio require dangerously high use of leverage we examine the gross leverage in the portfolio adding together the total long exposure across all strategies to the absolute value of total short exposure since january  the degree of portfolio leverage required peaked at  and averaged  given the high liquidity of the derivatives contracts and offsetting asset class positions in the portfolio this degree of leverage is associated with very conservative levels of posted collateral estimated at less than  and greatly reduces the potential danger of forced selling during times of stress due to insufficient collateral  not only do these combined systematic global macro absolute returns show excellent standalone characteristics they are also very useful diversifiers in portfolios because of their hedged construction the carry momentum and value factors have very little correlation with most exposures to asset classes and traditional risk factors the longonly benchmark indices—the sp  barclays aggregate long usd index and bloomberg commodities index—all show nearzero correlation to the systematic global macro sgm portfolio even the hfri global macro index a collection of selfreported global macro hedge funds shows a relatively low  correlation to the systematic global macro portfolio the carry momentum and value exposures appear to provide the potential for truly diversifying return streams that cannot be easily captured through traditional means  even a relatively small exposure to the uncorrelated returns can dramatically impact a portfolio we compare the return and highermoment characteristics for the traditional  sp  barclays aggregate portfolio to portfolios that allocate   or  to the systematic global macro strategy placing  of the portfolio in the systematic global macro strategy would have improved the sharpe ratio from  to  moving to a sizable  allocation would have improved the total portfolio sharpe ratio to  identical to the historical global macro sharpe ratio the advantage comes from both higher return and lower volatility—exactly what the “free lunch” of diversification promises  importantly tail risk—measured by negative skewness and excess kurtosis statistical representations of the “fat tail” events equity investors know experientially—also trends toward zero with larger allocations to the global macro portfolio standard allocations to bonds have traditionally helped to lower crash risk but incorporating the systematic global macro strategy would have gone even further for example when the sp  was down  in october  a  portfolio would have reduced total portfolio loss to  but a portfolio holding  in systematic global macro would have experienced only a  loss in that month uncorrelated returns can indeed offer strong protection in turbulent times future expectations while these historical results appear quite impressive we should be cautious when applying them to expectations of future performance backtested returns are rife with caveats for good reason we have been judicious to avoid errors that would lead to magnified upward biases between historical returns and future results  even so common sense dictates a sensible reduction for forwardlooking returns harvey and liu  discuss a general rule to haircut backtested sharpe ratios by  and recommend that weaker sharpe ratios receive more aggressive haircuts and higher sharpe ratios be cut by less in order to form realistic forwardlooking expectations factors impacting realworld returns include transaction costs signal banding to reduce turnover applying a fund management fee and adjusting for tail winds provided by secular decline in global interest rates taking these factors into account also argues for a significantly lower forwardlooking sharpe ratio  fortunately given the exceedingly strong historical data this systematic global macro strategy remains quite compelling even with aggressive discounting of expected returns run at a  volatility a  sharpe ratio generates excess returns of  annualized—far above our expectations for any traditional asset class or risk premia and given the excellent diversification provided by the uncorrelated returns this combination of carry momentum and value premia could be one of the most compelling investment opportunities available in today’s markets conclusion a fairminded consideration of today’s markets shows muted potential from investing in traditional assets low yields high valuations and anemic global growth have pushed down expected returns given these starting conditions the likelihood of achieving anything close to a  real return seems quite slim  creating a considerable need for alternative solutions we see the alternative factor premia of carry momentum and value as powerful additions to suitable investors’ portfolios these systematic global investment strategies provide an attractive and diversifying alternative source of investment returns they are empirically robust theoretically sound and we believe positioned to continue to drive strong absolute returns in today’s macro environment as we stated earlier global macro has become a wellestablished discipline for good reason offering the average investor an opportunity—once enjoyed by only the most sophisticated

articles death of the riskfree rate learn more about the authors shane shepherd phd director head of research profile chris brightman cfa chief investment officer profile follow endnotes  much research has documented the carry momentum and value factors in individual asset classes as well as across the global landscape the fact that these strategies are robust and that their returns have persisted even after discovery gives us confidence they should continue to provide positive return premiums going forward the literature also documents theoretically sound bases for their persistence including riskbased premia behavioral biases and persistent institutional frictions  asness moskowitz and pedersen  provides an overview  low or negative interest rates are typically associated with appreciating currencies these currencies on average however do not appreciate by enough to offset their yield disadvantage thus creating the forward premium puzzle reviewed by fama  this premium appears to be time varying and recent research such as by lustig roussanov and verdelhan  ties the returns to sources of macroeconomic risk  examining multiple definitions of each factor leads us to conclude these factors are robust drivers of returns by selecting factors based on implementation characteristics rather than historical returns we believe these definitions should mitigate although not eliminate the backtesting bias discussed by harvey liu and zhu  and mclean and pontiff forthcoming as well as result in portfolios with greater liquidity and lower trading costs leading to higher net returns flowing through to investors  a sizable body of literature discusses the risks associated with carry strategies and the failure of spot prices to converge such as the failure of uncovered interest rate parity in currency markets beginning with fama  and hodrick  the failure of the expectations hypothesis in bond markets fama and bliss  and the persistence of contango and backwardation in commodity markets as far back as keynes   many possible methods exist to formulate a combined portfolio overly complex methods are not necessary to achieve impressive results here we simply weight each strategy by the inverse of its inceptiontodate volatility  these returns are excess without collateral and do not include expenses or fees readers could reasonably deduct  for management fees via a systematic implementation rather than expensive hedge fund and another  for conservatively estimated transaction costs  for example we use our analysis of multiple signals to help establish robustness rather than search for “optimal” results we do not simply select the highest sharpe ratios from those signals but rather select based upon low costs of implementation and consistency we also focus on signals that hold up well to commonsense rules such as turnover banding  west and masturzo  encourage readers to take the  challenge references asness clifford s tobias j moskowitz and
