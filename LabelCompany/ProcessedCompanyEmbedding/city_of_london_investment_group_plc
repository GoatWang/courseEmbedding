outlook frontier markets semiannual outlook emerging markets quarterly outlook belated honeymoon for emerging markets brimming with optimism markets have risen to new record highs as the financial crisis recedes in memory cyclical indicators increasingly point to a gathering global recovery and the trump administration has proven unableunwilling to make good on its most disruptive campaign promises this has particularly benefitted emerging market em equities which enjoyed the additional boost of strengthening exchange rates as the dollar weakened during q similarly sovereign bond issuance by ems hit an alltime quarterly record in the first quarter while flows of portfolio capital into em stocks have also been strong whereas investors withdrew nearly bn from em stocks and bonds in november  the month of donald trump’s election victory outflows slowed to a mere  bn in december and reversed to the tune of an estimated  bn in january to be sure signs of improvement abound not only in the context of the dismal recent years true russia and brazil are merely exiting a painful recession and remain hostage to the vagaries of local politics and global commodity prices political flashpoints also exist from turkey to south africa to thailand but robust economic readings elsewhere be it in south korea or mexico suggest that the broader growth downtrend of the past years may be about to be broken some countries such as india and indonesia also enjoy large domestic economies and ambitious economic reform programs and finally while em inflation is ebbing away global trade is witnessing its fastest growth rate in seven years but what of the threat of rising us rates their impact is likely to be less damaging than in past episodes first the tightening cycle only responds to and in fact deliberately lags the recovery of the us economy second it is the most telegraphed series of rate increases in fed history and they are set to be both small and slow the fed continues to see the equilibrium real rate as near zero and has not changed its view of the terminal rate of  third at the same time china’s economy is stabilising and delivering a positive growth impulse to the global economy and finally as pointed out previously emerging markets possess much improved national balance sheets and more competitive exchange rates compared to previous episodes of rising us rates but is buying into risk at this stage in the market cycle picking up pennies in front of a steamroller potentially the shock value of last year’s two seminal events – the ‘brexit’ vote on june rd and donald trump’s election on november th – may have faded but the long term repercussions of these events have yet to make themselves felt at a minimum the increasing scepticism about trade financial integration and international cooperation amongst policymakers does not warrant market volatility levels near historic lows and stock markets near historic highs while low volatility can partly be explained by record low bond yields which support appetite for alternative assets the long term consequences of these political risks appear insufficiently discounted while the old adage holds that ‘in the long term we are all dead’ any upsurge in us trade protectionism in particular with respect to china has the potential to severely disrupt appetite for em assets market strategy against this backdrop our approach remains to acknowledge both the fundamental and cyclical improvements in emerging markets but to stay wary of current market exuberance which relies excessively on the notion of ‘trumpflation’ in other words while the msci em outperformed the msci world by a strong  in q we do not indiscriminately ramp up risk exposure in our allocation instead we add risk where we see value and make some other adjustments specifically we have upgraded mexico from underweight to neutral given both the proactive stance of banxico in stemming peso weakness and rising inflation expectations and the receding threat of a wholesale dismantling of nafta by the us we upgraded korea to overweight as the ouster of president park opened the door to a more certain and promising outlook while valuations remain attractive similarly we moved taiwan and malaysia from neutral to overweight the former on the basis of an uptick in external demand and the latter on the basis of a recovering domestic outlook by contrast after a spectacular but shortlived run we downgrade russia from overweight to neutral as there has yet been little fundamental improvement political tensions both domestic

overview city of london investment group plc city of london investment group plc is an established asset management group which has built its reputation with an institutional client focus by specialising in emerging market closedend fund investment in recent years the group has by way of diversification successfully added natural resource and developed market strategies to its product range city of london operates its business from offices in london philadelphia singapore dubai and seattle col diversification closedend funds  the original expertise a closedend fund or an investment trust or company is one with a fixed number of shares outstanding and one which does not redeem shares in the way an openended one such as a mutual fund or unit trust does the price of a share in a publicly traded closedend fund is determined entirely by supply and demand so shares can either trade below their net asset value at a discount or above it at a premium it is this characteristic that we seek to exploit buying those shares we consider cheap generally at what we believe to be an unjustifiable discount and selling those we consider expensive those at an unwarranted small discount or at a premium emerging markets  the first application of our expertise emerging markets as a description of young high growth economies first appeared in  when only six such markets hong kong malaysia mexico the philippines singapore and thailand could be accessed by foreign investors today there are almost  including the frontier markets that are at earlier stages of development with the largest being the socalled brics economies – those of brazil russia india and china city of london realised early on that institutional investors were struggling to access these markets in a professionally managed riskdiversified way and that a product focused on the closedend funds run by specialist managers could hold great appeal tactical income cef strategy  for us taxable investors the tactical income closedend fund strategy seeks to provide a highlevel of aftertax total return for us taxable investors our multisector tactical asset allocation approach results in a crossasset diversified income stream that is tax–advantaged we believe that a customizable multiasset class approach provides the greatest flexibility to exploit closedend fund opportunities we specialize in identifying and
