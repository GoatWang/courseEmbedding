animals in science  alternatives home animals in science  alternatives overview overview in the agony of death a dog has been known to caress his master and everyone has heard of the dog suffering under vivisection who licked the hand of the operator  this man unless the operation was fully justified by an increase of our knowledge or unless he had a heart of stone must have felt remorse to the last hour of his life  neavs initiatives crueltyfree cosmetics and household products neavs is committed to supporting companies that do not engage in animal testing during any stage of product development and instead use humane and more effective nonanimal testing our programs and priorities engage in coalition efforts as well as our own initiatives to replace animal testing with better and more humane science   fellowship grant for alternatives to animal research in womens health and sex differences the american fund for alternatives to animal research afaar and neavs offer a oneyear  postdoctoral fellowship grant to a woman committed to developing validating or using alternatives to animal methods in the investigation of womens health or sex differences   mandating alternatives to animal testing neavs is a founding member of the mandatory alternatives petition map coalition which works to encourage the us food and drug administration to develop better policy guidelines regarding the use of nonanimal in vitro testing methods to meet fda requirements for drug or device approval why alternatives  worldwide estimates on the number of vertebrate animals used in science—from mice to nonhuman primates—range from the tens of millions to more than  million annually in the us alone it is estimated that over  million animals are used each year in scientific research testing and education animals used include cats dogs rabbits ferrets fish pigs sheep monkeys chimpanzees and more in education animals are kept as “pets” in classrooms and used in biology and psychology classes graduate training courses and science fair projects cats fetal pigs and frogs are the most commonly dissected vertebrate species in science classes frogs who are typically wildcaught account for roughly half of the animals dissected in elementary and secondary schools in research scientists utilize animals for a number of different purposes including the development and testing of pharmaceuticals medical devices consumer products and military weapons the majority of animals used in research and testing are rats mice and birds because of their low cost high availability and ease of breeding the scientific debate about using animals in research and testing lies in the simple fact that animals are not predictive for human responses—be it for drugs or for understanding human disease two simple and familiar examples of products being deadly to animals are aspirin being poisonous to cats while providing pain relief in humans and chocolate being toxic to dogs but practically a staple for many people the national institutes of health nih has an annual budget of more than  billion and is the largest single funding agency in the us for animal research tragically the nih spends hundreds of millions of dollars every year funding a bottomless pit of duplicated animal research that accomplishes nothing more than funneling tax dollars into governmentsupported laboratories many research facilities receive well over  million yearly and some laboratories approach  million the institutional animal care and use committees iacuc who evaluate projects for approval are heavily staffed by animal researchers affiliated veterinarians and others with vested interests in animal research  sadly the current system provides funding approval for virtually any project and has led to a steady climb in animal research in  roughly  percent of the grants and contracts funded by the nih involved animal research in contrast to relevant in vitro epidemiological and clinical studies animal experiments have caused immense suffering and wasted billions of dollars and decades of time that could have been spent finding the preventions treatments and cures humans need traditional toxicity tests performed on animals have resulted in the deaths of millions of animals each year while mostly producing data that is inaccurate or irrelevant to humans to be valid science must be predictive and to be considered reliable it must be consistently so animal data is neither animals who are infected in the lab do not mimic human disease physiology differs among species and animal models are incapable of elucidating the complex nature of disease in humans for example animal experimentation has provided little if anything in the understanding and treatment of aids—a major cause of death in humans of the more than  hiv vaccines that have proven safe and efficacious in chimpanzees as well as other nonhuman primates all have failed to protect or prove safe in humans in nearly  human clinical trials with cancer research in one  study researchers from wake forest university school of medicine claimed that they cured many types and stages of cancer the second leading cause of death to cardiovascular disease in humans without side effects when tested in mice of course researchers are still hoping that what they have learned will someday be applied to human treatments as stated by dr richard klausner former director of the national cancer institute “we have cured cancer in mice for decades—and it simply didn’t work in humans” conclusion there is however hope for the future as federal agencies and scientists begin to more openly recognize and accept that solutions to cardiovascular disease cancer aids and other human health problems lie not in animalbased methods but in directly applicable humanbased studies—science without vivisection science neavs supports recognition of the inadequacy of animal toxicity testing has resulted in the development of better techniques that are able to produce comparable toxicity values of chemicals applicable to humans for example the environmental protection agency and the nih are currently evaluating new technologies in molecular cellular and computational sciences to supplement or replace more traditional methods of toxicity testing—new technologies that are producing safer more complete and more relevant data for humans news of alternatives to harmful animal use continues to flood our desks every day—renewing our faith in what science can and will do once it sets its priorities straight for instance a nonanimal lung tissue alternative has been created by scientists at the harvard medical school and the childrens hospital in boston the “lungonachip” mimics a human lung allowing scientists to observe both the basic functions of the lung and the effects that environmental toxins or drugs may have on living lung tissue—heralding for example the end of restraining beagles in forced inhalation experiments stated by dr donald ingber lead scientist of the harvard study at the wyss institute for biologically inspired engineering “we really cant understand how biology works unless we put it in the physical context of real living cells tissues and organs therefore organsonchips could replace many animal studies in the future” neavs and its programs will help hasten the inevitable and necessary transition away from animalbased experimentation testing and teaching toward science and science education governed by progressive scientific thought and compassionate ethics our accomplishments include funding worldrenowned scientists who have developed scientifically more predictive alternatives to such cruel toxicity tests as the ld in which researchers slowly poison animals to death we are a founding member of a coalition to bring consumers information on products not tested on animals we petition challenge and testify at hearings before federal agencies such as the nih the institute of medicine and the food and drug administration fda on a variety of issues including mandating that pharmaceutical companies medical device manufacturers and other entities regulated by the fda must use existing alternatives to replace cruel animal tests most importantly we expose the suffering of millions of animals every day in laboratories throughout the world—educating and inspiring the public to join us in our work the american public only reluctantly supports the use of animals in research and then only when they are led to believe that animals are necessary and they do not suffer neavs’ work shows that animals are in fact not necessary and they do indeed suffer and die humane science is su­perior science ethical

leading cancer research centers team up to launch biotech startup focused on cancer immunotherapy share news releases leading cancer research centers team up to launch biotech startup focused on cancer immunotherapy new york and seattle dec   – the fred hutchinson cancer research center fred hutch and memorial sloankettering cancer center mskcc along with pediatric partner seattle children’s research institute have joined forces to launch juno therapeutics inc a new biotechnology company focused on bringing forward novel immunotherapies for cancer juno is being launched with an initial investment of m making it one of the largest series a biotech startups in history initial investors include leading technology venture capital firm arch venture partners and the alaska permanent fund through a partnership managed by crestline investors chief executive officer hans bishop a longtime biotech industry veteran will lead the company commenting on the launch of juno larry corey md president and director of fred hutch said “the longtime research investment that centers like the fred hutchinson cancer research center and memorial sloankettering have had in tumor immunology has allowed us to progress to where we feel we can genetically engineer smart t cells to eradicate malignant cancer cells and provide meaningful clinical remissions joining together allows us to bring some of the world’s most accomplished immunotherapy researchers to catalyze this field” josé baselga md phd physicianinchief at mskcc said based on the significant antitumor activity seen with this tcell engineering technology we are pursuing an aggressive and comprehensive clinical development plan to accelerate achievement of regulatory requirements and make this therapy available to cancer patients in the shortest period of time possible robert nelsen arch cofounder and managing director and juno cofounder said “the initial data from the clinical trials conducted by the scientific founders to date points toward the strong potential for this team to bring forward a broad pipeline of immunotherapy products that will transform how we treat cancer” michael burns executive director of alaska permanent fund added “juno presents a compelling opportunity to partner with a sophisticated management team and group of worldclass research institutions who share our longterm perspective at a time when public financing for clinical development has largely dried up the privatesector model is critical to allowing ventures like juno to push the frontiers of research” juno’s approach focuses on harnessing the power of the immune system through the reprogramming of a type of immune cell called t lymphocytes “t cells” t cells are part of the body’s natural protective defense system against infection and juno’s technology reprograms t cells to recognize cancer cells for a precision immunologic attack using synthetic receptors andor augmented natural antigen receptors juno’s t cell reprogramming technologies enable the creation of a powerful antitumor immune response built from the patient’s own immune system this transformative approach has the potential to induce longterm remissions and reduce or eliminate the need for debilitating surgery radiation and chemotherapy the tumor regressions we are seeing across our phase i trials at memorial sloankettering fred hutch and seattle children’s research institute are unprecedented said michael jensen md director of the ben towne center for childhood cancer research at seattle children’s research institute and a scientific cofounder of juno i believe this is a transformative therapeutic platform for patients young and old that has the potential to save lives richard klausner md cofounder of juno and former director of the national cancer institute added “in more than  years of immunotherapy research this is the most exciting data i’ve seen—a complete molecular response in clinical trial patients” juno’s partner organizations and founding scientists are fred hutch phil greenberg md head of the immunology program and member clinical research division stanley riddell md member clinical research division memorial sloankettering cancer center renier j brentjens md phd medical oncologist and associate chair for cellular therapy trials isabelle rivière phd director of the cell therapy and cell engineering facility and michel sadelain md phd director of the center for cell engineering seattle children’s research institute michael jensen md director of the ben towne center for childhood cancer research juno’s cofounders are hans bishop ceo of juno and former executive vice president and chief operating officer of dendreon corporation larry corey md president and director of fred hutchinson cancer research center richard klausner md former director of the national cancer institute and robert nelsen cofounder and a managing director of arch venture partners juno ceo hans bishop noted “juno brings together renowned scientists and exceptional investment partners to launch and quickly scale an enterprise that will deliver cuttingedge cancer immunotherapy it is a completely unique opportunity that holds the potential to truly save lives while transforming how we treat cancer”  about juno juno is a clinical stage company that brings together three of the world’s leading cancer centers – fred hutchinson cancer research center memorial sloankettering cancer center and seattle children’s research institute – in unique partnership to advance a broad pipeline of potential curative immunotherapy treatments with one of the largest ever series a investments for a biotech startup juno will build on breakthroughs in the design of novel immunotherapies to develop two distinct and complementary platforms – chimeric antigen receptors cars and tcell receptors tcrs the car technology is designed to target cell surface antigens that are expressed on cancer cells in addition the highaffinity tcr technology can also detect alterations in intracellular proteins present in tumor cells these treatments reduce longerterm toxicities associated with current chemotherapeutics and provide the potential for curative therapy even for patients with widespread disease juno’s goal is to drive multiple product candidates in select hematologic and solid tumor cancers to fda licensure each candidate has the potential to treat a variety of highrisk cancers to learn more visit wwwjunotherapeuticscom about fred hutchinson cancer research center at fred

secrets to choosing sectional sofas about sofas a sofa is a large piece of furniture and anchoring element in even the most cavernous living room or family room so it’s always important to select just the right one for your needs and style luckily there are quite a few different sofa options and configurations from which to choose sectional sofas are modular couches that come in multiple sections these can often be modified as needed to offer a variety of different seating arrangements sectional sofas tend to be very large and can offer seating for up to eight or more people sofas and loveseats are the most common design among this type of furniture a fulllength sofa usually seats at least three people and is a comfortable and spacious option for most living rooms in contrast loveseats are a compact couch design that typically accommodates just two people these are frequently used in smaller spaces or as part of a larger seating group together couches and loveseats can provide plenty of comfortable seating to make for a functional living space sofa beds and futons are both multitaskers that can serve as either a sofa or a sleeping space while both are classified as sleeper sofas the primary difference between them is the way in which they convert into a bed a futon folds flat so that the whole piece becomes the bed while a sofa bed also sometimes called a hideabed has a foldout bed tucked inside the body of the couch whether you opt for a hideabed an expansive sectional or a modern futon you’re sure to find the ideal furniture pieces in our great
