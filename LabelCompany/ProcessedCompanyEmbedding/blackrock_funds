economy has settled into a steady growth rate slightly above the postcrisis trend in fact our blackrock gps suggests g growth over the coming year is set to comfortably exceed current consensus forecasts investors may want to embrace the implications of a durable economic expansion and favor risk assets like stocks over bonds three themes to consider sustained expansion we believe the current cycle won’t die of old age any time soon the economy still has slack for the recovery to chug on rethinking risk low volatility is no cause for alarm in and of itself placid markets are the norm when the economic backdrop is benign rethinking returns longterm bond yields are likely to remain low this suggests stock valuations may not snap back to historical averages  sustained expansion the current us economic cycle has been unusually long sparking fears that it may die of old age we have a different take looking at the quantity of recovery rather than the time it has taken reveals an economy with ample slack to power on its remaining lifespan may be clocked in years not quarters room to runcomparison of us economic cycles from peaks to troughs  sources blackrock investment

recent lows plumbed by volatility measures such as the vix for the sp  and move for us treasuries for some this calm is causing consternation surely markets must obey the principle of mean reversion and volatility should march back to more “normal” levels however this popular line of reasoning features a flaw markets are typically docile when the economic backdrop is benign low volatility  with a long taildistribution of realized monthly us equity volatility  sources blackrock investment institute with data from robert shiller june  notes realized volatility is calculated as the annualized standard deviation of monthly changes in us equities over a rolling month period bars show the number of months at each level of volatility each bar represents a bucket of two percentage points in realized volatility for example the bar marked – shows that volatility was between  and  for  months this isn’t to suggest complacency is warranted spikes in volatility happen with some frequency and present real risk for flightier investors however a sustained shift into a high volatility state may require a real growth scare or systemic financial threat as neither looks imminent at least as we parse the signals dialing down risk in portfolios today may leave investors tilting at windmills take action keep calm but hedge on pairing stocks and bonds remains a prudent risk management play more

make better financial decisions you solidify your relationships and demonstrate the value of the fees you charge blackrock has resources to guide you through these conversations and to assist you create a transparent documented process lay the foundation with our objectivesetting worksheets risks it’s important to contemplate portfolio risk in two dimensions how much risk should be taken and what types of risk are tolerable in the portfolio these two questions should be used dynamically when working with clients to regularly align their objectives with the amount of risk they are willing to take to achieve them discover how we see and analyze risk costs portfolio costs come in two categories fees transaction costs and management fees and taxes each of these eat into the returns a portfolio generates advisors that build a documented cost budget into their portfolio construction process can limit the impact of this erosion and ensure they are incurring costs only when justified learn how to capture the best value across investments view transcript you’ve heard it before … eat right … exercise … get regular checkups and you know that to be healthier you should do those things but what if there was a regulation that said you must do those things the department of labor fiduciary rule underscores the importance of understanding your client’s personal and financial retirement objectives and building a portfolio based on that shared understanding as erisa fiduciaries advisors will need to demonstrate the value of the services they offer for the fees they charge … and it starts with meaningful personal relationships and deep understanding of client circumstances because these circumstances are what drive their financial objectives when you look deeper spend the extra time with clients … when you help them make better saving spending and investing decisions … you solidify your client relationships make them clients for life and demonstrate the value of the fees you charge research from morningstar shows that investors who make intelligent financial planning decisions achieve better outcomes they call it portfolio “gamma” and as a fiduciary working to deeply understand client objectives … and regularly affirming those objectives  may be the most important thing you do with clients this is where you can add significant value … or gamma … to the client relationship consider a process where you start by understanding the future purpose of the client’s money why are they investing how much to they need in what timeframe then assess different actions a client may need to take over time in order to achieve their desired goals do they need to work longer spend less or modify how they’re investing you and your client need to know their current cash flow to help determine how much … or how much more … they can save and invest and if retirement is the primary goal understanding future cash flow can be more complicated part of complying with dol’s new regulation is having a documented process … that is transparent … to help address each client objective if your firm has a form for this please use it however if not blackrock has resources to guide you through your process – including several worksheets that you can access here – to help you demonstrate your value proposition add gamma to your client relationships and meet your obligations as a fiduciary understanding the dol rule the department of labors dol fiduciary rule also known as the “conflict of interest” rule extends fiduciary status and responsibilities under the employee retirement income security act of  erisa to a broader range of services relating to retirement assets including iras as a fiduciary under erisa it is important for advisors and their firms to be able to demonstrate that each recommendation they make is in the best interest of the client at its core the rule is intended to increase protections for individual investors by ensuring advisors are acting in their clients best interest and by addressing conflicts of interest many wealth management firms are providing advisors with specific resources regarding the dol rule regularly consult with your home office or legal counsel for guidance on the rule’s impact read the full rule and exemptions here when will the dol rule apply and what does that mean the fiduciary standard within the dol fiduciary rule goes into effect on june   full implementation of much of the detail of the rule has been delayed until january   the delay will allow the dol to receive further comments from the public and conduct additional analysis on the best way and the timeframe to implement this fiduciary standard furthermore the sec has recently sought public comment on the appropriate standard to be applied across all investment accounts which may impact the rule’s full implementation in the transition period between june  and january  advisors are required to adhere to an “impartial conduct standard” for retirement accounts which requires them to provide investment advice in the investors best interest receive no more than reasonable compensation and avoid misleading statements to investors about recommended transactions between now and january  the dol said it will not pursue claims against fiduciaries who are working in good faith to comply while it conducts an economic and legal analysis of the rule’s impact what does it mean to be an erisa fiduciary are there exceptions under the rule erisa fiduciaries must comply with erisa’s prohibited transaction rules or operate under specific exemptions where available in other words simply disclosing or receiving consent for the conflict will not make it permissible intermediaries who are fiduciaries are precluded from receiving compensation that varies depending on the investment product or program absent a specific exemption absent an exemption prohibited transactions under erisa include dealing with client assets for a fiduciary’s own interest or own account acting on both sides of a transaction receiving any consideration for a fiduciary’s own account in connection with a transaction involving client assets the fiduciary rule does contain key exemptions and one is particularly important the best interest contract bic exemption allows erisa fiduciaries to receive otherwise prohibited payments ie receive variable compensation provided that the advisor meets certain conditions and adheres to an “impartial conduct standard” to rely on the bic and provide advice relating to ira accounts an advisor and firm must act in the client’s best interest and charge reasonable compensation not use inappropriate incentives to favor certain products or services provide extensive disclosure of all payments received from providers not prohibit clients from engaging in classaction litigation to resolve claims  enter into a written contract which contains these terms and more the disclosure and contract requirements will not be enforced until january   more steps to take transition from brokerage to advisory transition from brokerage to advisory scale your fiduciary practice scale your fiduciary

options etn risks important information about the velocityshares etns is contained within the current prospectuses for more complete information regarding the velocityshares etns download a prospectus from this site call velocity or  or write to prospectus inquiry velocityshares  old kings highway s darien ct  to request a prospectus you should read the prospectus carefully before making an investment decision not all risks described below will apply to all products please refer to the applicable prospectus supplement for a detailed discussion of risks applicable to a particular etn an investment in the etns involves significant risks please read the more detailed explanation of risks relating to an investment in the etns in “risk factors” in the applicable pricing supplement the etns are intended to be daily trading tools for sophisticated investors to manage daily trading risks they are designed to achieve their stated investment objectives on a daily basis but their performance over different periods of time can differ significantly from their stated daily objectives the etns are riskier than securities that have intermediate or longterm investment objectives and may not be suitable for investors who plan to hold them for a period other than one day any decision to hold the etns for more than one day should be made with great care and only as the result of a series of daily or more frequent investment decisions to remain invested in the etns for the next oneday period accordingly the etns should be purchased only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of an investment linked to the underlying index and of seeking daily compounding leveraged long or leveraged inverse investment results as applicable investors should actively and frequently monitor their investments in the etns even intraday if an investor holds the etns for more than one day it is possible that the investor will suffer significant losses in the etns even if the performance of the underlying index over the time the investor holds them is positive in the case of the leveraged long etns or negative in the case of the leveraged inverse etns because the etns are linked to the daily performance of the applicable underlying index and may include either leveraged long or leveraged inverse exposure adverse changes in the market price of the futures included in the underlying index will have a magnified adverse effect on the etns and a greater likelihood of causing such etns to be worth zero than if such etns were not linked to the leveraged inverse or leveraged long return of the applicable underlying index the etns do not guarantee any return of principal at maturity acceleration or redemption and do not pay any interest during their term although the issuer intends to list or has listed the etns on nyse arca nasdaq or bats a trading market for your etns may not develop the issuer is not required to maintain any listing of the etns on an exchange the issuer of the etns may delist the etns from any exchange for any reason at any time the issuer is not obligated to issue any particular amount of the etns and may suspend further issuances at any time if the issuer suspends further issuances of the etns it is possible that the etns could begin to trade at a premium to the indicative value any premium that develops may be reduced or eliminated at any time including as a result of an announcement that the issuer will restart issuances or an announcement that the issuer will exercise its right to accelerate the etns for an amount based on the indicative value paying a premium purchase price over the indicative value of the etns could lead to significant losses in the event the investor sells the etns at a time when such premium is no longer present in the marketplace or the etns are accelerated at the issuer’s option the trading price of the etns may vary considerably before any valuation date as defined in each prospectus due among other factors to fluctuations in the price or the volatility of the underlying index and other events that are difficult to predict at higher levels of volatility and since the etns are not principal protected there is a significant chance of a complete loss of etn value even if the performance of the underlying index is flat the daily resetting of each etn’s leveraged exposure to the underlying index is likely to cause each etn to experience a “decay” effect which is likely to worsen over time and will be greater the more volatile the underlying index the “decay” effect refers to a likely tendency of the etns to lose value over time independent of the performance of the underlying index accordingly the etns are not suitable for intermediate or longterm investment as any intermediate or longterm investment is very likely to sustain significant losses even if the underlying index appreciates in the case of the leveraged long etns or depreciates in the case of the leveraged inverse etns over the relevant time period although the decay effect is more likely to manifest itself the longer the etns are held the decay effect can have a significant impact on etn performance even over a period as short as two days if the level of the underlying index decreases or does not increase sufficiently or if it increases or does not decrease sufficiently in the case of inverse etns to offset the effect of the daily investor fee and any other applicable fees over the term of the etns the investor will receive less than the amount invested upon sale early redemption acceleration or maturity of the etns prior to maturity you may subject to certain restrictions described in the pricing supplement offer the applicable minimum number of your etns to the issuer for redemption on an early redemption date as defined in the prospectus you must offer for redemption at least the applicable minimum number of etns typically ’ or ’ depending on the product as set forth in the pricing supplement or an integral multiple of such amount in excess thereof at one time in order to exercise your right to cause the issuer to redeem your etns on any early redemption date in addition the issuer may charge investors a redemption charge of a percentage of the closing indicative value of any etn that is redeemed at the investor’s option at a rate as indicated in the applicable pricing supplement please see the applicable pricing supplement for fees or charges relating to the etns any payment on the etns is subject to the ability of the issuer to satisfy its obligations as they become due the risks listed above are not exhaustive investors should review the prospectus for each etn including all risk factors set forth therein and

slightly above the postcrisis trend in fact our blackrock gps suggests g growth over the coming year is set to comfortably exceed current consensus forecasts investors may want to embrace the implications of a durable economic expansion and favor risk assets like stocks over bonds three themes to consider sustained expansion we believe the current cycle won’t die of old age any time soon the economy still has slack for the recovery to chug on rethinking risk low volatility is no cause for alarm in and of itself placid markets are the norm when the economic backdrop is benign rethinking returns longterm bond yields are likely to remain low this suggests stock valuations may not snap back to historical averages  sustained expansion the current us economic cycle has been unusually long sparking fears that it may die of old age we have a different take looking at the quantity of recovery rather than the time it has taken reveals an economy with ample slack to power on

vix for the sp  and move for us treasuries for some this calm is causing consternation surely markets must obey the principle of mean reversion and volatility should march back to more “normal” levels however this popular line of reasoning features a flaw markets are typically docile when the economic backdrop is benign low volatility  with a long taildistribution of realized monthly us equity volatility  sources blackrock investment institute with data from robert shiller june  notes realized volatility is calculated as the annualized standard deviation of monthly changes in us equities over a rolling month period bars show the number of months at each level of volatility each bar represents a bucket of two percentage points in realized volatility for example the bar marked – shows that volatility was between  and  for  months this isn’t to suggest complacency is warranted spikes in volatility happen with some frequency and present real risk for flightier investors however a sustained shift into a high volatility state may require a real growth scare or systemic financial threat as neither looks imminent at least as we parse the signals dialing down risk in portfolios

documented process lay the foundation with our objectivesetting worksheets risks it’s important to contemplate portfolio risk in two dimensions how much risk should be taken and what types of risk are

value across investments view transcript you’ve heard it before … eat right … exercise … get regular checkups and you know that to be healthier you should do those things but what if there was a regulation that said you must do those things the department of labor fiduciary rule underscores the importance of understanding your client’s personal and financial retirement objectives and building a portfolio based on that shared understanding as erisa fiduciaries advisors will need to demonstrate the value of the services they offer for the fees they charge … and it starts with meaningful personal relationships and deep understanding of client circumstances because these circumstances are what drive their financial objectives when you look deeper spend the extra time with clients … when you help them make better saving spending and investing decisions … you solidify your client relationships make them clients for life and demonstrate the value of the fees you charge research

understanding the dol rule the department of labors dol fiduciary rule also known as the “conflict of interest” rule extends fiduciary status and responsibilities under the employee retirement income security act of  erisa to a broader range of services relating to retirement assets including iras as a fiduciary under erisa it is important for advisors and their firms to be able to demonstrate that each recommendation they make is in the best interest of the client at its core the rule is intended to increase protections for individual investors by ensuring advisors are acting in their clients best interest and by addressing conflicts of interest many wealth management firms are providing advisors with specific resources regarding the dol rule regularly consult with your home office or legal counsel for guidance on the rule’s impact read the full rule and exemptions here when will the dol rule apply and what does that mean the fiduciary standard within the dol fiduciary rule goes into effect on june   full implementation of much of the detail of the rule has been delayed until january   the delay will allow the dol to receive further comments from the public and conduct additional analysis on the best way and the timeframe to implement this fiduciary standard furthermore the sec has recently sought public comment on the appropriate standard to be applied across all investment accounts which may impact the rule’s full implementation in the transition period between june  and january  advisors are required to adhere to an “impartial conduct standard” for retirement accounts which requires them to provide investment advice in the investors best interest receive no more than reasonable compensation and avoid misleading statements to investors about recommended transactions between now and january  the dol said it will not pursue claims against fiduciaries who are working in good faith to comply while it conducts an economic and legal analysis of the rule’s impact what does it mean to be an erisa fiduciary are there exceptions under the rule erisa fiduciaries must comply with erisa’s prohibited transaction rules or operate under specific exemptions where available in other words simply disclosing or receiving consent for the conflict will not make it permissible intermediaries who are fiduciaries are precluded from receiving compensation that varies depending on the investment product or program absent a specific exemption absent an exemption prohibited transactions under erisa include dealing with client assets for a fiduciary’s own interest or own account acting on both sides of a transaction receiving any consideration for a fiduciary’s own account in connection with a transaction involving client assets the fiduciary rule does contain key exemptions and one is particularly important the best interest contract bic exemption allows erisa fiduciaries to receive otherwise prohibited payments ie receive variable compensation provided that the advisor meets certain conditions and adheres to an “impartial conduct standard” to rely on the bic and provide advice relating to ira accounts an advisor and firm must act in the client’s best interest and charge reasonable compensation not use inappropriate incentives to favor certain products or services provide extensive disclosure of all payments received from providers not prohibit clients from engaging in classaction litigation to resolve claims  enter into a written contract which contains these terms and more the disclosure and contract requirements will not be enforced until january   more steps to take transition from brokerage to advisory transition from brokerage to advisory scale your fiduciary practice scale your fiduciary

tail risk black swan futures options etn risks important information about the velocityshares etns is contained within the current prospectuses for more complete information regarding the velocityshares etns download a prospectus from this site call velocity or  or write to prospectus inquiry velocityshares  old kings highway s darien ct  to request a prospectus you should read the prospectus carefully before making an investment decision not all risks described below will apply to all products please refer to the applicable prospectus supplement for a detailed discussion of risks applicable to a particular etn an investment in the etns involves significant risks please read the more detailed explanation of risks relating to an investment in the etns in “risk factors” in the applicable pricing supplement the etns are intended to be daily trading tools for sophisticated investors to manage daily trading risks they are designed to achieve their stated investment objectives on a daily basis but their performance over different periods of time can differ significantly from their stated daily objectives the etns are riskier than securities that have intermediate or longterm investment objectives and may not be suitable for investors who plan to hold them for a period other than one day any decision to hold the etns for more than one day should be made with great care and only as the result of a series of daily or more frequent investment decisions to remain invested in the etns for the next oneday period accordingly the etns should be purchased only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of an investment linked to the underlying index and of seeking daily compounding leveraged long or leveraged inverse investment results as applicable investors should actively and frequently monitor their investments in the etns even intraday if an investor holds the etns for more than one day it is possible that the investor will suffer significant losses in the etns even if the performance of the underlying index over the time the investor holds them is positive in the case of the leveraged long etns or negative in the case of the leveraged inverse etns because the etns are linked to the daily performance of the applicable underlying index and may include either leveraged long or leveraged inverse exposure adverse changes in the market price of the futures included in the underlying index will have a magnified adverse effect on the etns and a greater likelihood of causing such etns to be worth zero than if such etns were not linked to the leveraged inverse or leveraged long return of the applicable underlying index the etns do not guarantee any return of principal at maturity acceleration or redemption and do not pay any interest during their term although the issuer intends to list or has listed the etns on nyse arca nasdaq or bats a trading market for your etns may not develop the issuer is not required to maintain any listing of the etns on an exchange the issuer of the etns may delist the etns from any exchange for any reason at any time the issuer is not obligated to issue any particular amount of the etns and may suspend further issuances at any time if the issuer suspends further issuances of the etns it is possible that the etns could begin to trade at a premium to the indicative value any premium that develops may be reduced or eliminated at any time including as a result of an announcement that the issuer will restart issuances or an announcement that the issuer will exercise its right to accelerate the etns for an amount based on the indicative value paying a premium purchase price over the indicative value of the etns could lead to significant losses in the event the investor sells the etns at a time when such premium is no longer present in the marketplace or the etns are accelerated at the issuer’s option the trading price of the etns may vary considerably before any valuation date as defined in each prospectus due among other factors to fluctuations in the price or the volatility of the underlying index and other events that are difficult to predict at higher levels of volatility and since the etns are not principal protected there is a significant chance of a complete loss of etn value even if the performance of the underlying index is flat the daily resetting of each etn’s leveraged exposure to the underlying index is likely to cause each etn to experience a “decay” effect which is likely to worsen over time and will be greater the more volatile the underlying index the “decay” effect refers to a likely tendency of the etns to lose value over time independent of the performance of the underlying index accordingly the etns are not suitable for intermediate or longterm investment as any intermediate or longterm investment is very likely to sustain significant losses even if the underlying index appreciates in the case of the leveraged long etns or depreciates in the case of the leveraged inverse etns over the relevant time period although the decay effect is more likely to manifest itself the longer the etns are held the decay effect can have a significant impact on etn performance even over a period as short as two days if the level of the underlying index decreases or does not increase sufficiently or if it increases or does not decrease sufficiently in the case of inverse etns to offset the effect of the daily investor fee and any other applicable fees over the term of the etns the investor will receive less than the amount invested upon sale early redemption acceleration or maturity of the etns prior to maturity you may subject to certain restrictions described in the pricing supplement offer the applicable minimum number of your etns to the issuer for redemption on an early redemption date as defined in the prospectus you must offer for redemption at least the applicable minimum number of etns typically ’ or ’ depending on the product as set forth in the pricing supplement or an integral multiple of such amount in excess thereof at one time in order to exercise your right to cause the issuer to redeem your etns on any early redemption date in addition the issuer may charge investors a redemption charge of a percentage of the closing indicative value of any etn that is redeemed at the investor’s option at a rate as indicated in the applicable pricing supplement please see the applicable pricing supplement for fees or charges relating to the etns any payment on the etns is subject to the ability of the issuer to satisfy its obligations as they become due the risks listed above are not exhaustive investors should review the prospectus for each etn including all risk
