test  nondairy products ranked vegans hear it all the time “i could never go vegan because i could never give up cheese” but even though vegans have given up cheese that doesn’t mean some of them don’t miss it when i switched to a primarily vegan diet two years ago my friends and family were shocked mostly because i was notoriously obsessed with cheese back in the day my sister always said she would marry cheese when she grew up and for some reason my personal motto was “i like cheeeeeeeese” so giving it up was a daunting prospect so maybe it’s because of my love for the taste of dairy cheese — and my dissatisfaction with its nutritional profile and the farming techniques that are used to procure it — that have helped me be more openminded about vegan cheese yeah vegan cheese and while some vegan cheeses are made with mysterious combinations of tapioca starch artificial flavors and colors others are made from cultured nuts and nut milks using techniques very similar to traditional artisanal dairy cheeses but how do they stack up to find out i bought eight different brands of vegan cheese and hosted a tasting for two of my omnivorous friends and one other vegan while there were definitely some misses there were a few options that wowed us all  leaf cuisine peppery jack probiotic cashew spread similar to boursindip this cheese came out of nowhere and totally won the tasting i was the most skeptical of this product i mean it’s called “probiotic cashew spread” right on the label — i assumed it was going to taste like the worst stereotype of vegan hippie food but i was so so wrong this supercreamy spread was richly flavored with herbs and spices it didn’t taste like pepper jack as the name implied but more like boursin one taster even likened it to french onion dip once we were done with the tasting i had to get the rest of this one out of the fridge so we could keep snacking i will definitely purchase this product again and i’m excited to bring it to parties with crackers or potato chips and to watch my omnivore and vegan friends eat it up and i’m thrilled to know that tasty vegan cheese is now a reality klean slate review my favorites of expo
