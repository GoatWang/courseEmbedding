and exchangetraded funds have similarities they have differences that may make one option preferable for any particular investor  this brochure explains the basics of mutual fund and etf investing how

factors to consider before investing in mutual funds or etfs different types of mutual funds and etfs different types of investment strategies how mutual funds and etfs can provide returns to investors things that could reduce mutual funds’ and etfs’ returns fees and expenses classes of mutual funds tax consequences sources of information avoiding common pitfalls past performance looking beyond a mutual fund or etf name bank products versus mutual funds if you have a question or complaint glossary of key mutual fund and etf terms key points to remember mutual funds and etfs are not guaranteed or insured by the fdic or any other government agency—even if you buy through a bank and the fund carries the bank’s name  you can lose money investing in mutual funds or etfs past performance is not a reliable indicator of future performance so don’t be dazzled by last year’s high returns  but past performance can help you assess a fund’s volatility over time all mutual funds and etfs have costs that lower your investment returns  shop around and compare fees how mutual funds and etfs work how mutual funds work a mutual fund is an secregistered openend investment company that pools money from many investors and invests the money in stocks bonds shortterm moneymarket instruments other securities or assets or some combination of these investments  the combined securities and assets the mutual fund owns are known as its portfolio which is managed by an secregistered investment adviser  each mutual fund share represents an investor’s proportionate ownership of the mutual fund’s portfolio and the income the portfolio generates  investors in mutual funds buy their shares from and sellredeem their shares to the mutual funds themselves  mutual fund shares are typically purchased from the fund directly or through investment professionals like brokers  mutual funds are required by law to price their shares each business day and they typically do so after the major us exchanges close  this price—the pershare value of the mutual fund’s assets minus its liabilities—is called the nav or net asset value  mutual funds must sell and redeem their shares at the nav that is calculated after the investor places a purchase or redemption order  this means that when an investor places a purchase order for mutual fund shares during the day the investor won’t know what the purchase price is until the next nav is calculated types of investment companies there are three basic types of investment companies openend investment companies or openend funds—which sell shares on a continuous basis purchased from and redeemed by the fund or through a broker for the fund closedend investment companies or closedend funds—which sell a fixed number of shares at one time in an initial public offering that later trade on a secondary market and unit investment trusts uits—which make a onetime public offering of only a specific fixed number of redeemable securities called units and which will terminate and dissolve on a date that is specified at the time the uit is created mutual funds are openend funds  etfs are generally structured as openend funds but can also be structured as uits  etfs operate pursuant to sec exemptive orders  how etfs work like mutual funds etfs are secregistered investment companies that offer investors a way to pool their money in a fund that makes investments in stocks bonds other assets or some combination of these investments and in return to receive an interest in that investment pool unlike mutual funds however etfs do not sell individual shares directly to or redeem their individual shares directly from retail investors  instead etf shares are traded throughout the day on national stock exchanges and at market prices that may or may not be the same as the nav of the shares   etf sponsors enter into contractual relationships with one or more authorized participants —financial institutions which are typically large brokerdealers  typically only authorized participants purchase and redeem shares directly from the etf  in addition they can do so only in large blocks eg  etf shares commonly called creation units and they typically “pay” for the creation units in an inkind exchange with a group or basket of securities and other assets that generally mirrors the etf’s portfolio  once an authorized participant receives the block of etf shares the authorized participant may sell the etf shares in the secondary market to investors  an etf share is trading at a premium when its market price is higher than the value of its underlying holdings  an etf share is trading at a discount when its market price is lower than the value of its underlying holdings  a history of the endofday premiums and discounts that an etf experiences—ie its nav per share compared to its closing market price per share —can usually be found on the website of the etf or its sponsor  like a mutual fund an etf must calculate its nav at least once every day  a word about exchangetraded products etps etfs are just one type of investment within a broader category of financial products called exchangetraded products etps  etps constitute a diverse class of financial products that seek to provide investors with exposure to financial instruments financial benchmarks or investment strategies across a wide range of asset classes  etp trading occurs on national securities exchanges and other secondary markets making etps widely available to market participants including individual investors other types of etps include exchangetraded commodity funds and exchangetraded notes etns  exchangetraded commodity funds are structured as trusts or partnerships that physically hold a precious metal or that hold a portfolio of futures or other derivatives contracts on certain commodities or currencies  etns are secured debt obligations of financial institutions that trade on a securities exchange  etn payment terms are linked to the performance of a reference index or benchmark representing the etn’s investment objective  etns are complex involve many risks for interested investors and can result in the loss of the entire investment this brochure discusses only etfs that are registered as openend investment companies or unit investment trusts under the investment company act of   it does not address other types of etps such as exchangetraded commodity funds or etns common features of mutual funds and etfs some common features of mutual funds and etfs are described below  whether any particular feature is an advantage or disadvantage for you will depend on your unique circumstances—always be sure that the investment you are considering has the features that are important to you professional management  most funds and etfs are managed by investment advisers who are registered with the sec diversification  spreading investments across a wide range of companies or industry sectors can help lower risk if a company or sector fails  many investors find it less expensive to achieve such diversification through ownership of certain mutual funds or certain etfs than through ownership of individual stocks or bonds low minimum investment  some mutual funds accommodate investors who don’t have a lot of money to invest by setting relatively low dollar amounts for the initial purchase subsequent monthly purchases or both  similarly etf shares can often be purchased on the market for relatively low dollar amounts  liquidity and trading convenience  mutual fund investors can readily redeem their shares at the next calculated nav—minus any fees and charges assessed on redemption—on any business day  mutual funds must send investors payment for the shares within seven days but many funds provide payment sooner  etf investors can trade their shares on the market at any time the market is open at the market price—minus any fees and charges incurred at the time of sale  etf and mutual fund shares traded through a broker are required to settle in three business days costs despite negative returns  investors in mutual funds must pay sales charges annual fees management fees and other expenses regardless of how the mutual fund performs  investors may also have to pay taxes on any capital gains distribution they receive  investors in etfs must pay brokerage commissions annual fees management fees and other expenses regardless of how the etf performs  etf investors may also have to pay taxes on any capital gains distributions however because of the structure of certain etfs that redeem proceeds in kind taxes on etf investments have historically been lower than those for mutual fund investments   it is important to note that the tax efficiency of etfs is not relevant if an investor holds the mutual fund or etf investment in a taxadvantaged account such as an ira or a k lack of control  investors in both mutual funds and etfs cannot directly influence which securities are included in the funds’ portfolios potential price uncertainty  with an individual stock or an etf an investor can obtain realtime or close to realtime pricing information with relative ease by checking financial websites or by calling a broker  by contrast with a mutual fund the price at which an investor purchases or redeems shares will depend on the fund’s nav which the fund might not calculate until many hours after an order has been placed  factors to consider before investing in mutual funds or etfs determine your financial goals and risk tolerance  when it comes to investing in mutual funds and etfs investors have thousands of choices  before you invest in any mutual fund or etf you must decide whether the investment strategy and risks are a good fit for you  you should also consider more generally whether the unique style of investing of the mutual fund’s or etf’s sponsor is a good fit for you  the first step to successful investing is to figure out your current financial goals and risk tolerance—either on your own or with the help of an investment professional  beware of risk  all investments carry some level of risk  an investor can lose some or all of the money he or she invests—the principal—because securities held by a fund go up and down in value  dividend payments may also fluctuate as market conditions change  mutual funds and etfs have different risks and rewards  generally the higher the potential return the higher the risk of loss  consider the sponsor’s investing style  before you invest you may want to research the sponsor of the mutual fund or etf you are considering  the sponsor’s website is often a good place to begin and it is helpful to spend some time browsing through the website to get a better understanding of the sponsor’s underlying philosophy on investing  each sponsor has its own style of investing that will affect how it manages its mutual funds and etfs  it is helpful to understand each sponsor’s style of investing so you can better choose the right investment for you ask and check  before you engage an investment professional or purchase shares of a mutual fund or etf make sure you research and verify relevant information to determine which option is best suited for you  investment professionals  details on an investment professional’s background and qualifications are available on the sec’s investment adviser public disclosure iapd website or on the sec’s website for individual investors investorgov  if you have any questions about checking the background of an investment professional you can call the sec’s tollfree investor assistance line at   for help mutual funds and etfs you can research a mutual fund or etf by reading its prospectus carefully to learn about its investment strategy and the potential risks  you can find the prospectus on the mutual fund’s or etf’s website or on the sec’s edgar database and download the documents for free a word about derivatives derivatives are financial instruments whose performance is derived at least in part from the performance of an underlying asset security or index  even small market movements can dramatically affect their value sometimes in unpredictable ways there are many types of derivatives with many different uses  a mutual fund’s or etf’s prospectus will disclose whether and how it may use derivatives  an investor may also want to call a fund and ask how it uses these instruments different types of mutual funds and etfs mutual funds and etfs fall into several main categories  some are bond funds also called fixed income funds and some are stock funds also called equity funds  there are also funds that invest in a combination of these categories such as balanced funds and target date funds and newer types of funds such as alternative funds smartbeta funds and esoteric etfs  in addition there are money market funds which are a specific type of mutual fund  bond funds bond funds invest primarily in bonds or other types of debt securities they generally have higher risks than money market funds largely because they typically pursue strategies aimed at producing higher yields  unlike money market funds the sec’s rules do not restrict bond funds to highquality or shortterm investments  because there are many different types of bonds bond funds can vary dramatically in their risks and rewards  some of the risks associated with bond funds include credit risk—the possibility that companies or other issuers whose bonds are owned by the fund may fail to pay their debts including the debt owed to holders of their bonds  credit risk is less of a factor for bond funds that invest in insured bonds or us treasury bonds  by contrast those that invest in the bonds of companies with poor credit ratings generally will be subject to higher risk interest rate risk—the risk that the market value of the bonds will go down when interest rates go up  because of this an investor can lose money in any bond fund including those that invest only in insured bonds or us treasury bonds  funds that invest in longerterm bonds tend to have higher interest rate risk and prepayment risk—the chance that a bond will be paid off early  for example if interest rates fall a bond issuer may decide to pay off or retire its debt and issue new bonds that pay a lower rate  when this happens the fund may not be able to reinvest the proceeds in an investment with as high a return or yield stock funds stock funds invest primarily in stocks which are also known as equities  although a stock fund’s value can rise and fall quickly and dramatically over the short term historically stocks have performed better over the long term than other types of investments—including corporate bonds government bonds and treasury securities  stock funds can be subject to various investment risks including market risk which poses the greatest potential danger for investors in stock funds  stock prices can fluctuate for a broad range of reasons—such as the overall strength of the economy or demand for particular products or services balanced funds balanced funds invest in stocks and bonds and sometimes money market instruments in an attempt to reduce risk but still provide capital appreciation and income  they are also known as asset allocation funds and typically hold a relatively fixed allocation of the categories of portfolio instruments  but the allocation will differ from balanced fund to balanced fund  these funds are designed to reduce risk by diversifying among investment categories but they still share the same risks that are associated with the underlying types of instruments target date funds also called target date retirement funds or lifecycle funds these funds also invest in stocks bonds and other investments  target date funds are designed to be longterm investments for individuals with particular retirement dates in mind  the name of the fund often refers to its target retirement date or target date  for example there are funds with names such as “portfolio ” “retirement fund ” or “target ” that are designed for individuals who intend to retire in or near the year   most target date funds are designed so that the fund’s allocation of investments will automatically change over time in a way that is intended to become more conservative as the target date approaches  that means that funds typically shift over time from a mix with a lot of stock investments in the beginning to a mix weighted more toward bonds   even if they share the same target date target date funds may have very different investment strategies and risks and the timing of their allocation changes may be different  they also may have different investment results and may charge different fees  often a target date fund invests in other funds and fees may be charged by both the target date fund and the other funds  in addition target date funds do not guarantee that an investor will have sufficient retirement income at the target date and investors can lose money  target date funds are generally associated with the same risks as the underlying investments alternative funds alternative funds are funds that invest in alternative investments such as nontraditional asset classes eg global real estate or currencies and illiquid assets eg private debt andor employ nontraditional trading strategies eg selling short  they are sometimes called “hedge funds for the masses” because they are a way to get hedge fundlike exposure in a registered fund  these funds generally seek to produce positive returns that are not closely correlated to traditional investments or benchmarks  many investors may see alternative funds as a way to diversify their portfolios while retaining liquidity  the risks associated with these investments vary depending on the assets and trading strategies employed  these funds can employ complicated investment strategies and their fees and expenses are commonly higher than traditionally managed funds  in addition these types of funds generally have limited performance histories and it is unclear how they will perform in periods of market stress   smartbeta funds these funds are index funds with a twist they compose their index by ranking stock using preset factors relating to risk and return such as growth or value and not simply by market capitalization as most traditional index funds do  they aim to achieve better returns than traditional index funds but at a lower cost than active funds  these funds can be more complicated and have higher expenses than traditional index funds and the factors are sometimes based on hypothetical backwardlooking returns  in addition these types of funds generally have limited performance histories and it is unclear how they will perform in periods of market stress   esoteric etfs esoteric or exotic funds are etfs that focus on niche investments or narrowly focused strategies  they may be complicated investments and may have higher expenses  in addition these etfs are often thinly traded which means they can be harder to sell and may have larger bidask spreads than etfs that aren’t as thinly traded  a word about hedge funds hedge fund is a general nonlegal term used to describe private unregistered investment pools that traditionally have been limited to sophisticated wealthy investors hedge funds are not mutual funds and as such are not subject to the numerous regulations that apply to mutual funds for the protection of investors — including regulations requiring that mutual fund shares be redeemable at any time regulations protecting against conflicts of interest regulations to assure fairness in the pricing of fund shares disclosure regulations regulations limiting the use of leverage and more money market funds money market funds are a type of mutual fund that has relatively low risks compared to other mutual funds and etfs and most other investments  by law they can invest in only certain highquality shortterm investments issued by the us government us corporations and state and local governments  government and retail money market funds try to keep their nav at a stable  per share but the nav may fall below  if the fund’s investments perform poorly  investor losses have been rare but they are possible  a government money market fund is a money market fund that invests  or more of its total assets in cash government securities andor repurchase agreements that are collateralized solely by government securities or cash a retail money market fund is a money market fund that has policies and procedures reasonably designed to limit all beneficial owners of the money market fund to natural persons  other money market funds however have a floating nav like other mutual funds that fluctuates along with changes in the marketbased value of their portfolio securities  all money market funds pay dividends that generally reflect shortterm interest rates and historically the returns for money market funds have been lower than for either bond or stock funds  a risk commonly associated with money market funds is inflation risk which is the risk that inflation will outpace and erode investment returns over time different types of investment strategies indexbased funds indexbased mutual funds and etfs seek to track an underlying securities index and achieve returns that closely correspond to the returns of that index with low fees  they generally invest primarily in the component securities of the index and typically have lower management fees than actively managed funds  some index funds may also use derivatives such as options or futures to help achieve their investment objective  indexbased funds with seemingly similar benchmarks can actually be quite different and can deliver very different returns  for example some index funds invest in all of the companies included in an index other index funds invest in a representative sample of the companies included in an index  because an index fund tracks the securities on a particular index it may have less flexibility than a nonindex fund to react to price declines in the securities contained in the index  also because market indexes themselves have no expenses even a passively managed index fund can underperform its index due to fees and taxes actively managed funds the adviser of an actively managed mutual fund or etf may buy or sell components in the portfolio on a daily basis without regard to conformity with an index provided that the trades are consistent with the overall investment objective of the fund  unlike similar mutual funds actively managed etfs are required to publish their holdings daily  because there is no underlying index that can serve as a point of reference for investors and other market participants as to the etf’s holdings disclosing the specific fund holdings ensures that market participants have sufficient information to engage in activity called arbitrage that works to keep the market price of etf shares closely linked to the etf’s underlying value    a word on active and passive investing an active investment strategy relies on the skill of an investment manager to construct and manage the portfolio of a fund in an effort to provide exposure to certain types of investments or outperform an investment benchmark or index  an actively managed fund has the potential to outperform the market but its performance is dependent on the skill of the manager  also actively managed funds historically have had higher management fees which can significantly lower investment returns  the shareholder is paying for more active management of portfolio assets which often leads to higher turnover costs in the portfolio and potentially negative federal income tax consequences   passive investing is an investment strategy that is designed to achieve approximately the same return as a particular market index before fees  the strategy can be implemented by replication—purchasing  of the securities in the same proportion as in the index or benchmark—or by a representative sampling of stocks in the index  passive investing also typically comes with lower management fees  as discussed above passively managed mutual funds are typically called index funds  most etfs are also passively managed although there are some actively managed etfs on the market  passively managed etfs typically have lower costs for the same reasons index mutual funds do  in addition indexbased etfs’ costs and taxes can be even lower than index mutual funds’ because of the manner in which etfs operate leveraged inverse and inverse leveraged etfs leveraged inverse and inverse leveraged etfs seek to achieve a daily return that is a multiple inverse or inverse multiple of the daily return of a securities index  these etfs are a subset of indexbased etfs because they track a securities index  they seek to achieve their stated objectives on a daily basis  investors should be aware that the performance of these etfs over a period longer than one day will probably differ significantly from their stated daily performance objectives  these etfs often employ techniques such as engaging in short sales and using swaps futures contracts and other derivatives that can expose the etf and by extension the etf investors to a host of risks  as such these are specialized products that typically are not suitable for buyandhold investors a word about exchangetraded managed funds etmf an exchangetraded managed fund etmf is a new kind of registered investment company that is a hybrid between traditional mutual funds and exchangetraded funds  like etfs etmfs list and trade on a national exchange directly issue and redeem shares only in creation units and primarily use inkind transfers of the basket of portfolio securities in issuing and redeeming creation units  like mutual funds etmfs are bought and sold at prices linked to nav and disclose their portfolio holdings quarterly with a day delay  this structure may allow the product to provide certain cost and tax efficiencies of etfs while maintaining the confidentiality of the current holdings similar to mutual funds  by not having to disclose their holdings on a daily basis as etfs do etmfs may have an advantage in trying to outperform their benchmarks over time because they are less susceptible to front running by other investors who would be able to trade on the holdings’ disclosures how mutual funds and etfs can provide returns to investors investors can make money from their investments in three ways   dividend payments—depending on the underlying securities a mutual fund or etf may earn income in the form of dividends on the securities in its portfolio  the mutual fund or etf then pays its shareholders nearly all of the income minus disclosed expenses it has earned   capital gains distributions—the price of the securities a mutual fund or etf owns may increase  when a mutual fund or etf sells a security that has increased in price the mutual fund or etf has a capital gain  at the end of the year most mutual funds and etfs distribute these capital gains minus any capital losses to shareholders  etfs seek to minimize these capital gains by making inkind exchanges to redeeming authorized participants instead of selling portfolio securities   increased navincreased market price—if the market value of a mutual fund’s portfolio increases after deduction of expenses and liabilities then the net asset value of the mutual fund and its shares increases  if the market value of an etf’s portfolio increases after deduction of expenses and liabilities then the net asset value of the etf increases and the market price of its shares may also increase with respect to dividend payments and capital gains distributions mutual funds usually will give investors a choice the mutual fund can send the investor a check or other form of payment or the investor can have the dividends or distributions reinvested in the mutual fund to buy more shares often without paying an additional sales load if an etf investor wants to reinvest a dividend payment or capital gains distribution the process can be more complicated and the investor may have to pay additional brokerage commissions  investors should check with their etf or investment professional things that could reduce mutual funds’ and etfs’ returns investors should consider the effect that fees expenses and taxes will have on their returns over time  they can significantly reduce the returns on mutual funds and etfs  fees and expenses as with any business running a mutual fund or etf involves costs  funds pass along these costs to investors by imposing fees and expenses shareholder fees are fees charged directly to mutual fund investors in connection with transactions such as buying selling or exchanging shares or on a periodic basis with respect to account fees  an investor can find these fees and charges listed in the “fee table” section of a mutual fund’s prospectus or summary prospectus under the heading “shareholder fees”  etfs don’t charge these fees directly to investors but they may have several types of transaction fees and costs which are described below operating expenses are ongoing mutual fund and etf costs such as investment advisory fees for managing the fund’s holdings marketing and distribution expenses as well as custodial transfer agency legal and accountant’s fees  operating expenses are regular and recurring fundwide expenses that are typically paid out of fund assets which means that investors indirectly pay these costs  these expenses are identified in the “fee table” section of a mutual fund’s or etf’s prospectus or summary prospectus under the heading “annual fund operating expenses”  although these fees and expenses may not be listed individually as specific line items on an account statement they can have a substantial impact on an investment over time  fees and expenses vary from fund to fund  if the funds are otherwise the same a fund with lower fees will outperform a fund with higher fees  remember the more investors pay in fees and expenses the less money they will have in their investment portfolio  as noted above index funds typically have lower fees than actively managed funds prospectus fee table the following discussion details the disclosure required in the fee table in a mutual fund or etf prospectus  etfs don’t charge shareholder fees that are required to be included in the fee table directly to investors  but they may have several types of transaction fees and costs which are also described below fee table  shareholder fees for mutual funds fees paid directly from an investment sales charge load on purchases—a fee some mutual funds charge investors when they buy shares also known as a frontend load   this fee is typically paid to the broker that sells the mutual fund’s shares  in this respect a sales load is like a commission investors pay when they purchase any type of security like a stock or an etf from a broker  frontend loads reduce the amount of an investment  for example let’s say an investor has  and wants to invest it in a mutual fund with a  frontend load  the  sales load the investor must pay comes off the top of the investment leaving the remaining  to be invested in the mutual fund   purchase fee—a fee some mutual funds charge investors when they buy shares  unlike a frontend sales load a purchase fee is paid into fund assets not to a broker and is typically imposed to defray some of the mutual fund’s costs associated with the purchase  this fee is often imposed by a mutual fund that has high transaction costs for example because of its investment strategy  the fee is designed so that the other investors’ investments in the mutual fund are not diminished by the transaction costs of the purchase  like frontend sales loads purchase fees reduce the amount of the investment deferred sales charge load—a fee some mutual funds charge investors when they sell or redeem their shares also known as a backend load  this fee is typically paid to the broker that sells the mutual fund’s shares the most common type of backend sales load is the contingent deferred sales load also known as the cdsc or cdsl  the amount of this type of sales load will depend on how long the investor holds his or her shares  it typically decreases to zero if the investor holds his or her shares for a specified time period  when an investor purchases shares that are subject to a backend sales load rather than a frontend sales load no sales load is deducted at purchase and all of the investors’ money is immediately used to purchase fund shares assuming that no other fees or charges apply at the time of purchase  however a backend sales load will reduce an investor’s return on the investment  typically a fund calculates the amount of a backend sales load based on the lesser of the value of the investor’s initial investment or the value of the investment at redemption   redemption fee—a fee some mutual funds charge investors when they sell or redeem their shares within a certain time frame of purchasing the shares unlike a deferred sales load a redemption fee is paid into fund assets not to the broker and is typically used to defray fund costs associated with an investor’s redemption  the sec limits redemption fees to   exchange fee—a fee some mutual funds charge investors when they exchange transfer their investment to another fund within the same fund group or family of funds  account fee—a fee some mutual funds charge investors in connection with the maintenance of their accounts  for example some funds impose an account maintenance fee on accounts whose value is less than a certain dollar amount transaction fees and costs for etfs not reflected in the fee table brokerage commissions—etf investors typically pay their brokers sales commissions with each purchase or sale of etf shares although some etfs may be available commissionfree  in this respect a commission is like a sales load investors pay when purchasing or redeeming a mutual fund  like frontend sales loads brokerage commissions on a purchase reduce the amount of the investment  like backend sales loads brokerage commissions on a sale reduce an investor’s return on the investment  a brokerage commission may be structured as a flat fee charged every time an investor trades  with a flat fee the smaller the amount traded the larger the percentage cost per trade is  investors should consider the fee structure of a commission when purchasing or selling etf shares  check with your broker regarding these fees  brokers should provide written notice to customers of these charges when accounts are opened and when any of the charges change bidask spread—etfs and other securities that trade on a securities market actually have two market prices—the bid price and the ask price  the term bid refers to the highest price a buyer will pay to buy a specified number of etf shares at any given time  the term ask refers to the lowest price at which a seller will sell the etf shares  the bid price will be lower than the ask price and the difference between two prices is called the spread  an example is an etf share that is trading for   the bid price is  the ask price is  and the spread is  cents  if an investor buys  etf shares at the ask price of  and sells them immediately at the bid price of  the investor would incur a loss of   this example demonstrates the impact of the spread on an etf investment  etfs that are more liquid and have higher trading volume have tighter or smaller spreads  the spread can be thought of as a hidden cost to investors since spreads reduce potential returns changes in discounts and premiums to nav—for a variety of reasons an etf’s market price may reflect a premium or a discount to the etf’s underlying value or nav this is a potential cost but also a potential gain  an etf share is trading at a premium when its market price is higher than the nav or the value of its underlying holdings  an etf share is trading at a discount when its market price is lower than the nav or value of its underlying holdings  an investor may therefore pay more or less than the nav when buying shares or receive more or less than nav when selling shares a word about exchanging shares a family of funds is a group of mutual funds that share administrative and distribution systems each fund in a family may have different investment objectives and follow different strategies some funds offer exchange privileges within a family of funds allowing shareholders to directly transfer their holdings from one fund to another as their investment goals or tolerance for risk change while some funds impose fees for exchanges most funds typically do not to learn more about a fund’s exchange policies call the fund’s tollfree number visit its website or read the “shareholder information” section of the prospectus bear in mind that exchanges have tax consequences even if the fund doesn’t charge for the transfer the investor will be liable for any capital gain on the sale of the old shares or depending on the circumstances eligible to take a capital loss fee table  annual fund operating expenses annual expenses paid as a percentage of the value of an investment management fees—fees paid out of mutual fund or etf assets to the fund’s investment adviser for investment portfolio management  they can also include any other management fees payable to the fund’s investment adviser or its affiliates and administrative fees payable to the investment adviser that are not included in the other expenses category distribution andor service b fees—fees paid out of mutual fund or etf assets to cover the costs of distribution eg marketing and selling fund shares and sometimes to cover the costs of providing shareholder services  distribution fees include fees to compensate brokers and others who sell fund shares and to pay for advertising the printing and mailing of prospectuses to new investors and the printing and mailing of sales literature  shareholder service fees are fees paid to persons to respond to investor inquiries and provide investors with information about their investments  shareholder service fees can be paid outside of b fees and if they are they are included in the other expenses category  other expenses—fees paid out of mutual fund  or etf assets that are not already included under management fees or distribution or service b fees such as any shareholder service expenses that are not already included in the b fees custodial expenses legal and account expenses transfer agent expenses and other administrative expenses total annual fund operating expenses expense ratio—the line of the fee table that represents the total of a mutual fund’s or etf’s annual fund operating expenses expressed as a percentage of the fund’s average net assets  looking at the expense ratio can help investors make comparisons among various mutual funds and etfs investors should be sure to review carefully the fee tables of any mutual funds or etfs they’re considering including noload mutual funds  even small differences in fees can translate into large differences in returns over time  for example if an investor invested  in a fund that produced a  annual return before expenses and had annual operating expenses of  then after  years the investor could have roughly   but if the fund had expenses of only  then the investor would end up with —a  difference a word about noload mutual funds some mutual funds call themselves noload  as the name implies this means that the mutual fund does not charge any type of sales load  but as discussed above not every type of shareholder fee is a sales load  a noload fund may charge direct fees that are not sales loads such as purchase fees redemption fees exchange fees and account fees  noload funds also will have annual fund operating expenses that investors pay for indirectly through fund assets  classes of mutual funds although etfs offer only one class of shares many mutual funds offer more than one class of shares  each class will invest in the same portfolio of securities and will have the same investment objectives and policies  but each class will have different shareholder services andor distribution arrangements with different fees and expenses  because of the different fees and expenses each class will likely have different performance results  a multiclass structure offers investors the ability to select a fee and expense structure that is most appropriate for their investment goals including the time that they expect to remain invested in the fund  here are some key characteristics of the most common mutual fund share classes offered to individual investors class a shares—class a shares typically charge a frontend sales load but they tend to have a lower b fee and lower annual expenses than other mutual fund share classes some mutual funds reduce the frontend load as the size of the investment increases  these discounts are called breakpoints class b shares—class b shares typically do not have a frontend sales load  instead they may charge a contingent deferred sales load and a b fee along with other annual expenses  typically the amount of the contingent deferred sales load decreases the longer an investor holds the shares  class b shares also might convert automatically to a class with a lower b fee and no contingent deferred sales load if the investor holds the shares long enough class c shares—class c shares might have a b fee other annual expenses and either a frontend or backend sales load but the frontend or backend load for class c shares tends to be lower than for class a or class b shares respectively  unlike class b shares class c shares generally do not convert to another class as a result the backend load will not decrease over time  class c shares tend to have higher annual expenses than either class a or class b shares other classes— other classes may also exist for some funds a word about breakpoints some mutual funds that charge frontend sales loads will charge lower sales loads for larger investments  in the prospectus fee table they are referred to as sales charge discounts but the investment levels required to obtain a reduced sales load are more commonly referred to as breakpoints the sec does not require a mutual fund to offer breakpoints in its sales load  but if the mutual fund offers breakpoints the mutual fund must disclose them and brokers must apply them in addition a brokerage firm is not allowed to sell shares of a mutual fund in an amount that is just below the mutual fund’s breakpoint simply to earn a higher commission each fund company establishes its own formula for how it will calculate whether an investor is entitled to receive a breakpoint  for that reason it is important for investors to seek out breakpoint information from their financial advisors or the mutual fund itself  an investor will need to ask how a particular mutual fund establishes eligibility for breakpoint discounts as well as what the mutual fund’s breakpoint amounts are  some of this information is also included in the “fee table” section of the mutual fund’s prospectus or summary prospectus tax consequences when an investor buys and holds an individual stock or bond the investor must pay income tax each year on the dividends or interest received but the investor won’t have to pay any capital gains tax until he or she actually sells and unless he or she makes a profit  mutual funds and etfs are somewhat different as with an individual stock when an investor buys and holds mutual fund or etf shares the investor will owe income tax each year on any dividends received  in addition the investor will also owe taxes on any personal capital gains in years when an investor sells shares  however unlike with an individual stock an investor may also have to pay taxes each year on the mutual fund’s or etf’s capital gains even if the mutual fund or etf has had a negative return and the investor hasn’t sold any shares that’s because the law requires mutual funds and etfs to distribute any net capital gains on the sale of portfolio securities to shareholders  etfs are typically more tax efficient in this regard than mutual funds because etf shares are frequently redeemed inkind by the authorized participants  this means that an etf may deliver specified portfolio securities to authorized participants who are redeeming creation units instead of selling portfolio securities to meet redemption demands  the selling of portfolio securities could otherwise result in taxable capital gains to the etf that would typically be passed through to the retail investor  nevertheless the tax efficiency of etfs is not relevant if an investor holds the mutual fund or etf investment in a taxadvantaged account such as an ira or a k sec rules require mutual funds and etfs to disclose in their prospectuses aftertax returns  in calculating aftertax returns mutual funds and etfs must use standardized formulas similar to the ones used to calculate beforetax average annual total returns  a fund’s aftertax returns are discussed in the “investments risks and performance” section of the prospectus  when comparing mutual funds andor etfs be sure to take taxes into account a word about tax exempt funds if an investor invests in a taxexempt fund—such as a municipal bond fund—some or all of the dividends will be exempt from federal and sometimes state and local income tax the investor will however owe taxes on any capital gains sources of information prospectus and summary prospectus mutual funds must provide a copy of the fund’s prospectus to shareholders after they purchase shares but investors can— and should—request and read the mutual fund’s prospectus before making an investment decision  there are two kinds of prospectuses  the statutory prospectus and  the summary prospectus  the statutory prospectus is the traditional longform prospectus with which most mutual fund investors are familiar  the summary prospectus which is used by many mutual funds is just a few pages long and contains key information about a mutual fund  the sec specifies the kinds of information that must be included in mutual fund prospectuses and requires mutual funds to present the information in a standard format so that investors can readily compare different mutual funds the same key information required in the summary prospectus is required to be in the beginning of the statutory prospectus  it appears in the following standardized order   investment objectivesgoals  fee table  investments risks and performance  management—investment advisers and portfolio managers  purchase and sale of fund shares  tax information and  financial intermediary compensation  investors can also find more detailed information in the statutory prospectus including financial highlights information an etf will also have a prospectus and some etfs may have a summary prospectus both of which are subject to the same legal requirements as mutual fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses  all investors who purchase creation units ie authorized participants receive a prospectus  some brokerdealers also deliver a prospectus to secondary market purchasers  all etfs are required to deliver a prospectus upon request and without charge and the prospectus will usually be available on the etf’s website while they may seem daunting at first mutual fund and etf prospectuses contain valuable information  here’s some of what is included in mutual fund and etf prospectuses investment objective — the prospectus will describe the mutual fund’s or etf’s investment objectives or goals  a fund may also identify its type or category eg that it is a money market fund or balanced fund fee table — this table describes the mutual fund’s or etf’s fees and expenses which include the shareholder fees and annual fund operating expenses the fee table includes an example that will help investors compare costs among different mutual funds or etfs by showing them the costs associated with investing a hypothetical  over a    and year period key risks — the prospectus will discuss the mutual fund’s or etf’s principal investment risks financial highlights information — this section which generally appears towards the back of the prospectus contains audited data concerning the mutual fund’s or etf’s financial performance for each of the past  years here an investor will find net asset values for both the beginning and end of each period total returns and various ratios including the ratio of expenses to average net assets the ratio of net income to average net assets and the portfolio turnover rate statement of additional information sai the sai explains a mutual fund’s or etf’s operations in greater detail than the prospectus – including the mutual fund’s or etf’s financial statements and details about the history of the mutual fund or etf its policies on borrowing and concentration the identity of officers directors and persons who control the mutual fund or etf investment advisory and other services brokerage commissions paid on portfolio securities transactions tax matters and performance such as yield and average annual total return information  if an investor asks the mutual fund or etf must send an sai  the back cover of the mutual fund’s or etf’s prospectus should contain information on how to obtain the sai shareholder reports a mutual fund also must provide shareholders with annual and semiannual reports within  days after the end of the fund’s fiscal year and  days after the fund’s fiscal midyear  these reports contain updated financial information a list of the fund’s portfolio securities and other information  the information in the shareholder reports will be current as of the date of the report that is the last day of the fund’s fiscal year for the annual report and the last day of the fund’s fiscal midyear for the semiannual report  investors can obtain all of these documents by visiting the mutual fund’s or etf’s website calling or writing to the mutual fund or etf all mutual funds and etfs have tollfree telephone numbers contacting a broker that sells the mutual fund’s or etf’s shares searching the sec’s edgar database and downloading the documents for free or contacting the sec’s office of investor education and advocacy by telephone    avoiding common pitfalls past performance a mutual fund’s or etf’s past performance is not as important as one might think  advertisements rankings and ratings often emphasize how well a mutual fund or etf has performed in the past  but studies show that the future is often different  this year’s number one mutual fund or etf can easily become next year’s below average mutual fund or etf for mutual funds and etfs be sure to find out how long the fund has been in existence  newly created or small mutual funds or etfs sometimes have excellent shortterm performance records  because newly created mutual funds and etfs may invest in only a small number of stocks a few successful stocks can have a large impact on their performance  but as these mutual funds and etfs grow larger and increase the number of stocks they own each stock has less impact on performance  this may make it more difficult to sustain initial results while past performance does not necessarily predict future returns it can tell an investor how volatile or stable a mutual fund or etf has been over a period of time  generally the more volatile a fund the higher the investment risk  if you will need your money to meet a financial goal in the nearterm you probably can’t afford the risk of investing in a fund with a volatile history because you will not have enough time to ride out any declines in the stock market for index mutual funds and index etfs remember that these funds are designed to track a particular market index and their past performance is related to how well that market index did  looking beyond a mutual fund or etf name don’t assume that a mutual fund called the “zyx stock fund” invests only in stocks or that the “martian highyield fund” invests only in the securities of companies headquartered on the planet mars  the sec generally requires that any mutual fund or etf with a name suggesting that it focuses on a particular type of investment must invest at least  of its assets in the type of investment suggested by its name  but mutual funds and etfs can still invest up to onefifth of their holdings in other types of securities—including securities that a particular investor might consider too risky or perhaps not aggressive enough bank products versus mutual funds many banks now sell mutual funds some of which carry the bank’s name  but mutual funds sold in banks including money market funds are not bank deposits  as a result they are not federally insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic money market matters don’t confuse a money market fund with a money market deposit account  the names are similar but they are completely different a money market fund is a type of mutual fund  it is not guaranteed or fdicinsured  when an investor buys shares in a money market fund he or she should receive a prospectus  a money market deposit account is a bank deposit  it is guaranteed and fdicinsured  when a saver deposits money in a money market deposit account he or she should receive a truth in savings form if you have a question or complaint if you have a question or complaint about your mutual fund or etf

twitter email print share money stuff volatility trades and explosive shorts also antimoneylaundering compliance uber snap shorttermism and collateral by matt levine mattlevine more stories by matt levine february    am est catalysta basic rule of volatility trading is that if you bet against volatility you will increase volatility so a classic way to bet against volatility would be to sell call options and hedge them by buying the underlying stock you might for instance sell an atthemoney call option on  shares of stock and buy  shares of stock to hedge if the stock price goes up the price of the calls will also go up youll make money on the stock but lose on the calls if the stock price goes down the price of the calls will also go down and again it will balance outbut if the stock price goes up your hedge will also be less of a hedge after all if the options end up in the money you will need to deliver  shares to the buyer not  if they end up out of the money the proper hedge will be zero shares so if the stock price moves you will need to adjust your hedge if the stock goes up youll need to buy more shares to hedge the increasing risk that the options will end in the money if it goes down youll need to sell some of your shares this is called dynamic hedging and the blackscholes math that tells you how many shares to buy or sell is pretty well understood that math also uses greek letters the hedge is called delta and the change in the hedge as the stock price moves is called gamma the two things to notice here are youre buying when the stock goes up and selling when it goes down this is bad normally you want to buy low and sell high but you have to do it to keep your position hedged and the more the stock moves the more you have to rebalance your hedge  buying high and selling low  and the more money you lose if the stock stays flat you dont lose any money and get to keep the premium that you received for selling the options in the first place this is why selling call options is a bet against volatilityif you buy stock when the price goes up youll push the price up more if you sell when the price goes down youll push the price down more your own hedge rebalancing is increasing volatility your bet against volatility has caused volatility to go up you are not just a passive observer of volatility you are also helping to create it anyway people seem to be pretty excited about the catalyst hedged futures strategy fundit is the buzz of wall street a fiveday  plunge in a us mutual fund whose bearish bets were undone by the sp ’s latest run to fresh recordsthe catalyst fund heres a factsheet was betting against volatility heres one explanationthe catalyst fund’s strategy uses options on the sp  index contracts that allow investors to buy or sell at set prices over fixed time frames in this case the fund employed a “butterfly spread” that benefits the fund if the market remains stable rises slightly or declines in any magnitudebut we can ignore the options bestiary and just assume that it was short call options more technically it was short gamma meaning that it was in the position of our call seller above who has to buy stock  here sp  futures  when the stock goes up and sell when it goes down catalyst had also bought options but its net position at the relevant times and prices seems to have been short gamma those options were set to expire friday meaning there was little time for the market to reverse and return the bet to profitability more importantly it means they had a lot of gamma if its wednesday and you are short an atthemoney option on  shares that expires on friday then you are going to have to come up with either  shares or zero shares by friday if the stock ticks up just a little bit youll have to buy a lot if it ticks down just a little bit youll have to sell a lot you can see catalysts problem as the sp crept up on tuesday and wednesday but catalysts big bet against volatility also may have added to the volatilitytheories abounded wednesday and thursday that forced covering by catalyst was doing everything from boosting stocks to pushing up the chicago board options exchange volatility index also known as the vix some of the speculation focused on unusual market happenings like when the vix jumped as stocks rallied yesterday a relatively rare concerted move“there may have been some market impact from our trading earlier this week but it’s certainly not the majority of the market impact by any stretch” said szilagyipeople seem to want absolutes in this story did catalyst cause the market moves its right there in the name surely it was a catalyst our exposure was greatly exaggerated and our impact on the market was greatly exaggerated said catalyst capital advisors llc chief executive officer jerry szilagyi i’m hard pressed to imagine that a  billion fund is moving the entire market said edward walczak the funds manager on one level im sure thats right on another level buying is what makes prices go up it is the nature of volatility trading that they probably had some impact  or was catalyst forced to cover its positions szilagyi said comments that we were forced to short cover are not correct we haven’t been forced to do anything but if you are short gamma going into an expiry and the stock is going up the blackscholes formula will force you to buy stock or get rid of some of your positions instead not literally you can ignore it but if you are a hedged volatility trader the blackscholes math is going to feel like at least a pretty strong suggestioni dont have any reason to think that anything weird was going on at catalyst any forced trading that would move the market but probably something normal was going on at catalyst it was a hedged option seller had to adjust its hedge and in doing so probably had an effect on the marketdont do thisumm soaccording to the affidavit supporting the criminal complaint barnett offered a confidential source cs  to place improvised explosive bombs in target retail stores along the east coast of the united states barnett created at least  of the explosive devices disguised in fooditem packaging which barnett delivered to the cs on february   barnett then asked the cs to place the explosive devices on store shelves from new york to florida he also provided the cs with a bag of gloves a mask and a license plate cover to disguise the cs’s identity from law enforcementbarnett theorized that the company’s stock value would plunge after the explosions allowing him to cheaply acquire shares of target stock before an eventual rebound in pricesi feel like someone needs to go to his jail cell and explain short selling to him i mean also lots of other things but the way to profit from stock prices going down is by shorting the stock and then covering when the prices go down thats the trade here but his alleged plan  not shorting but waiting until after the explosions and then buying  makes no sense what if he blows up some targets and the price drops and he buys stock and then some other idiot blows up some more targets and the price keeps dropping the future is always uncertain if you are going to insider trade or whatever this is you want your trade to exactly reflect the thing you have the most control over where you actually have information that no one else has here sure blowing up some targets will probably push the stock down so you want to be short the stock heading into the bombingsit goes without saying that none of this is any sort of advicewe talk sometimes around here about the first two laws of insider trading which are  dont insider trade and  certainly dont insider trade by buying shortdated outofthemoney call options on merger targets i have never thought it necessary to formulate a law like dont insider trade by planting bombs in a store so you can short the companys stock but definitely dont do that that is every kind of advice we also sometimes talk around here about how all law is securities law how securities regulators expand their jurisdiction to regulate sexual harassment and global warming and whatever other issues they care about but securities law is in the grand scheme of things not that big a deal you dont want to get caught insider trading but you really really really dont want to get caught planting bombs in targets come onamlthe us federal bureau of investigation various intelligence agencies and various congressional committees are investigating whether there are any suspicious connections between donald trump and russia but so apparently is someone else deutsche bank agthe scandalhit bank that loaned hundreds of millions of dollars to donald trump has conducted a close internal examination of the us president’s personal account to gauge whether there are any suspicious connections to russia the guardian has learnedwouldnt it be funny if deutsche bank found things that the fbi the cia the nsa and congress didnt and why not the thing to keep in mind here is that if you are a large international bank your most important business is us antimoneylaundering compliance i doubt that bnp paribas has done too many trades that are bigger than its  billion fine for violating us sanctions hsbc paid  billion commerzbank paid  billion there are lots more suspiciously concentrated among nonus banks deutsche bank itself paid  million for sanctions violations in  and then paid  million just last month for  facilitating suspicious trades in russiadeutsche bank has all the right incentives to catch suspicious trades in russia if deutsche bank is smart it is hiring the very best people in the world at ferreting out suspicious russian transactions and paying them millions of dollars with performance bonuses for catching anything untoward how can the fbi or the cia compete with that in a sense the last few years of us antimoneylaundering enforcement have effectively privatized the business of catching foreign financial corruption if youre an expert at finding corrupt transactions why would you work at the fbi the place to ply your trade is clearly at a big bank oh by the way that might all go awayamericas largest banks are to propose a complete overhaul of how financial institutions investigate and report potential criminal activity arguing that rules imposed in the years after the sept   attacks and strengthened during the obama administration are onerous and ineffective sources saidpeople are worried about unicornsim a little worried about one unicorny point in yesterdays money stuff that needs to be expanded a bit we  talked about uber technologies inc which is buying stock from employees at prices well below where it sells stock to investors uber is as it were getting paid the bidask spread i said and i think that is a true and useful explanation of whats going on but several readers pointed out uber is also buying and selling different things its buying common stock from employees but its selling preferred stock  with liquidation preferences and more rights  to outside investors the investors should pay more the difference is not entirely an arbitrageelsewhere in unicorns snap inc cofounder evan spiegel is set to receive about  million restricted shares in the company at the close of its initial public offering equal to about  percent of its outstanding stock thats a lot of stock  million worth at the high end of the ipo pricing range i dont entirely understand the point of giving a founder restricted equity awards like he already owns a ton of stock more than  billion worth he effectively controls half the company the award was granted in july  to motivate spiegel to continue growing our business and improving financial results was he not motivated before there is an arcane theological feel to many executive compensation discussions which only make sense if you already have faith maybe if i owned  billion worth of stock in a company that i had founded my attention might wander and i might stop caring about growing the business but then the promise of another halfbillion dollars of stock might bring back my focus it is not impossible i have no relevant experience by which to evaluate that claim it does seem oddalso this is a little weirdsnap is reserving  million shares or  of its offering for friends and family of its executives the company says those may include existing investors but won’t include employees the friendsandfamily allotment could give the impression that buddies of snap’s yearold chief executive evan spiegel will be laying claim to a sizable portion of the available shares they could be longterm investors or they could be getting the generous gift of the ipo popelsewhere theranos had  million in cash left at yearend would you have guessed higher or lowerpeople are worried about stock buybackshere is larry summers on shorttermismsome companies have great ideas great management teams and compelling strategies they invest heavily seek to grow revenue ignore the management of earnings and do limited stock buybacks these are the criteria mckinsey uses to measure longtermism other companies lack vision and have mediocre management they invest less cut costs more manage earnings and buy back their stock mckinsey deems them short term–focusedno surprise the longterm companies outperform the shortterm companies but this may be due to their vision and execution capacity not their longterm focus that is shorttermism spending money on buybacks rather than growth may be a perfectly appropriate response to a lack of opportunities or a lack of ability to execute on them companies with mediocre managers and not too many opportunities that invested their money in growth would just waste the money and enrich the managers good governance properly demands that those companies give the money back to shareholders who can put it somewhere useful the shorttermism is  arguably  a symptom not a causeelsewhere the roosevelt institute is worried that a corporate tax cut will just be wasted on stock buybacksamerican businesses already enjoy a historically low cost of capital and they have more than enough cash on hand to invest raise wages and create jobs corporations are choosing to make dividend payments and stock buybacks instead of investing because they face a lack of competitive pressure—itself the result of power and wealth shifting toward rich shareholders another tax cut for the rich will only make the problem worsepeople are worried about bond market liquidityill count worries about collateral as a subset of bond market liquidity worriesthe world is running out of safe financial assets one reason may be regulators’ push to make trading safera scarcity of safe collateral can create bouts of volatility in the markets where investors fund their purchasesthe problem is that clearinghouses have to collect margin and invest it somewhere safe and as more derivatives trading moves to clearinghouses therell be more collateral demand from them this seems like  less a new problem and more just a problem that moved from somewhere else after all when derivatives traded bilaterally the banks collected margin and had to keep it somewhere safe broadly though they collected less margin and kept it somewhere less safe the question as so often is were the banks economic decisions about margining and collateral better or worse than regulators decisionsthings happen a daily take on wall street finance companies and

mcmillan published apr    am et share commentary everyone is looking for a piece of the volatility pie by lawrenceg mcmillan morristown nj marketwatch — several new volatility products have recently entered the market or will soon be listed for trading the most promising of these is the new set of contracts to be listed on the chicago board options exchange trading began on march  in gold volatility index futures on the cboe options on them will be listed on april  many other new products will follow in due course cboe’s new volatility products the cboe is going to start trading options on a whole new set of stocks and exchangetraded funds plus create more volatility indexes this is welcome news to anyone who views volatility as a “friend” personally i feel that a long position in anything stocks futures etfs etc can be better hedged by owning volatility in the form of volatility calls than it can be by buying puts or selling covered calls trading strategies march trouble ahead japans crisis turmoil in europe and unrest in the middle east have investors worried that we’ll all be thrown back into the throes of global recession • hulbert seasonal trading patterns

• lowell safer havens amid global calamity • • •   the volatility or vix calculation is merely a formula that can be applied to the set of options on anything — as long as there are continuous markets being made in the options the traditional vix vix  is based on the standard  poor’s  index spx  options and will probably eventually come to be known as the “spx vix” you may already know that the cboe has been publishing a vix calculation on several stocks and commodities for some time for example there is an “oil vix” ovx  “gold vix” gvz  and “euro fx vix” evz  these are based on the options on the united state oil fund uso  spdr gold trust gld  and euro shares fxe   etfs respectively also there are new vixlike calculations on the stocks apple inc aapl   aapl amazoncom inc amzn    goldman sachs groups inc gs  google inc goog  and ibm ibm  the respective symbols for the volatility calculations on these six products are vxapl xvazn vxgs vxgog vxibm and vxovx the cboe has applied to trade options on all of these vixlike calculations and — if approved — there will be volatility futures on them as well in addition the cboe is going to start disseminating vix computations for the ishares msci emerging markets index etf eem   “vix” symbol vxeem ishares ftsexinhua china  fxi   vxfxi ishares msci brazil ewz   vxewz market vectors gold miners gdx   vxgdx ishares silver trust slv  vxslv and energy select sector spdr xle   vxxle obviously the cboe will look to list options and futures on these at some time in the future i have long predicted that somewhere in the future when a new stock or etf has options listed there will be put options call options and volatility options and futures this is the beginning of that statement coming true cme volatility futures and options everyone is trying to get a piece of the “volatility pie” it seems of course the leader in volatility trading is still the cboe and its futures exchange the cfe – where the vix futures and options trade as we’ve detailed these various products over the years and months we also know that ipath sp  vix shortterm futures vxx   and ipath sp  vix midterm futures vxz  barclay’s exchangetraded notes or etns are popular as well and have active listed options other exchanges have yet to figure out a way to provide liquidity for their various products there was a lot of fanfare for the cmelisted volatility futures on gold and crude oil trading though has been woeful in these contracts even after being listed for two months there is a total open interest of zero in gold and no open interest at all in the crude oil volatility futures either moreover i know for a fact that traders have tried to get markets out of the pit and basically the contracts are untradable why even bother volx and realized euro futures now there are realized volatility contracts listed on the cme in the euro these contracts were designed by an independent company the volatility exchange or volx which publishes realized volatility indexes on  different markets two currencies three equity indexes three commodities and three interest rates these  volx indexes cannot be traded except for the euro listing the symbol for the realized euro volatility contracts on the cme is e there are currently march april and may futures expiring this year e h e j and e k trading volume and open interest is low but they are at least trying to get some activity going i wish them success but one wonders why the lessons that the cboe has learned are not being taken to heart by these futures exchanges cboe variance contracts have been woeful although way more active than anything the cme has listed so far all of the public demand is in implied volatility so why list a realized volatility contract cboe volatility skew index the cboe is now publishing a skew index this is similar to vix except that it only measures the deeply out of the money contracts – at the tail end of the distribution most of the time skew trades at a higher price than vix but it didn’t in the “crash” of  somewhat strange the index is being calculated and published only once per day at the close there are no actual products that trade

appreciate the disconnect that can emerge between the price of risk in the market and the actual risks by dean curnutt more stories by dean curnutt may    am edt financial market insurance is not like hurricane insurance amid an improbable level of calm in markets it’s worth remembering what victor haghani a partner at longterm capital management said in early  about the fund’s implosion especially given that quiet markets are compelling trading strategies that capitalize on low levels of volatilitythe hurricane is not more or less likely to hit because more hurricane insurance has been written in the financial markets this is not true the more people write financial insurance the more likely it is that a disaster will happen because the people who know you have sold the insurance can make it happen so you have to monitor what other people are doingwhile haghani’s statements were focused on the manner in which ltcmspecific trades were seemingly attacked by the market they remain highly relevant today because the notion that financial market insurance is not like hurricane insurance is broadly applicable when trades are especially crowded their unwinding can amplify market moves as investors seek to derisk in unison stable markets not only invite trades that bet on the continuation of stability they almost force investors to pursue them in an investment climate so deprived of nominal returnover the most recent sixmonth period the realized volatility of the sp  has been lower than at any time since before the financial crisis importantly this period of market tranquility has generated huge profits for trading strategies that capitalize on stability by selling options while there is an almost limitless supply of industry analysis on the current low level of the cboe volatility index or vix the real story has been the consistency with which the  index has overstated the actual movement in the market how low has volatility been over the last six months more than half of the days have had a less than  basispoint return these are “home run” results for option sellers even as markets appear stable we should appreciate the risks while mother nature dictates the timing and severity of the next hurricane the financial market equivalent may arise endogenously propelled by the forceful unwind of trades that enjoyed too much success for too long winning trades attract money and as capital flows in to them they become increasingly crowded in markets positioning matters the nomura equity volatility risk premium fund which systematically sells equity index variance swaps has enjoyed quite a run since the us election it has lost money on just  percent of trading days the average loss on such days has been a mere  basis points the six month sharpe ratio of the strategy is north of  strategies that make money nearly all the time and only lose fractionally on the days they don’t are beyond appealing to investorsthe standard disclaimer “past performance is no guarantee of future results” tends to be ignored when strategies generate consistent profits with seemingly low risk this is especially the case in a world bereft of interest income and as the expected future return prospects for the traditional  stockbond portfolio appear unconvincing with both stock and bond valuations at stretched levels investors are being forced into “alternative risk premia” like the one offered by the nomura fund while the unprecedented market swings during the financial crisis imposed massive drawdowns on short volatility strategies handsome profits have since been generated betting against a repeat of that market chaos over long periods of time there are few trades that hold up  as well as selling equity volatility faced with the daunting task of achieving  percent return targets many pension funds have “bought the backtest” and are actively generating returns through short option strategiesten years after the early onset of the financial crisis investors must appreciate the disconnect that can emerge between the price of risk in the market and the actual risks that may be in the process of materializing in early  the vix dipped below  pulled down then  like now  by  percent realized volatility then even as short volatility strategies profited from the very muted daily fluctuations in the sp  index a tidal wave of systemic risk was already in motion over the first quarter of  the mortgage industry began its collapse with a series of bankruptcies by subprime lenders the severity of what would unfold over the next two years resulted from

within the current prospectuses for more complete information regarding the velocityshares etns download a prospectus from this site call velocity or  or write to prospectus inquiry velocityshares  old kings highway s darien ct  to request a prospectus you should read the prospectus carefully before making an investment decision not all risks described below will apply to all products please refer to the applicable prospectus supplement for a detailed discussion of risks applicable to a particular etn an investment in the etns involves significant risks please read the more detailed explanation of risks relating to an investment in the etns in “risk factors” in the applicable pricing supplement the etns are intended to be daily trading tools for sophisticated investors to manage daily trading risks they are designed to achieve their stated investment objectives on a daily basis but their performance over different periods of time can differ significantly from their stated daily objectives the etns are riskier than securities that have intermediate or longterm investment objectives and may not be suitable for investors who plan to hold them for a period other than one day any decision to hold the etns for more than one day should be made with great care and only as the result of a series of daily or more frequent investment decisions to remain invested in the etns for the next oneday period accordingly the etns should be purchased only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of an investment linked to the underlying index and of seeking daily compounding leveraged long or leveraged inverse investment results as applicable investors should actively and frequently monitor their investments in the etns even intraday if an investor holds the etns for more than one day it is possible that the investor will suffer significant losses in the etns even if the performance of the underlying index over the time the investor holds them is positive in the case of the leveraged long etns or negative in the case of the leveraged inverse etns because the etns are linked to the daily performance of the applicable underlying index and may include either leveraged long or leveraged inverse exposure adverse changes in the market price of the futures included in the underlying index will have a magnified adverse effect on the etns and a greater likelihood of causing such etns to be worth zero than if such etns were not linked to the leveraged inverse or leveraged long return of the applicable underlying index the etns do not guarantee any return of principal at maturity acceleration or redemption and do not pay any interest during their term although the issuer intends to list or has listed the etns on nyse arca nasdaq or bats a trading market for your etns may not develop the issuer is not required to maintain any listing of the etns on an exchange the issuer of the etns may delist the etns from any exchange for any reason at any time the issuer is not obligated to issue any particular amount of the etns and may suspend further issuances at any time if the issuer suspends further issuances of the etns it is possible that the etns could begin to trade at a premium to the indicative value any premium that develops may be reduced or eliminated at any time including as a result of an announcement that the issuer will restart issuances or an announcement that the issuer will exercise its right to accelerate the etns for an amount based on the indicative value paying a premium purchase price over the indicative value of the etns could lead to significant losses in the event the investor sells the etns at a time when such premium is no longer present in the marketplace or the etns are accelerated at the issuer’s option the trading price of the etns may vary considerably before any valuation date as defined in each prospectus due among other factors to fluctuations in the price or the volatility of the underlying index and other events that are difficult to predict at higher levels of volatility and since the etns are not principal protected there is a significant chance of a complete loss of etn value even if the performance of the underlying index is flat the daily resetting of each etn’s leveraged exposure to the underlying index is likely to cause each etn to experience a “decay” effect which is likely to worsen over time and will be greater the more volatile the underlying index the “decay” effect refers to a likely tendency of the etns to lose value over time independent of the performance of the underlying index accordingly the etns are not suitable for intermediate or longterm investment as any intermediate or longterm investment is very likely to sustain significant losses even if the underlying index appreciates in the case of the leveraged long etns or depreciates in the case of the leveraged inverse etns over the relevant time period although the decay effect is more likely to manifest itself the longer the etns are held the decay effect can have a significant impact on etn performance even over a period as short as two days if the level of the underlying index decreases or does not increase sufficiently or if it increases or does not decrease sufficiently in the case of inverse etns to offset the effect of the daily investor fee and any other applicable fees over the term of the etns the investor will receive less than the amount invested upon sale early redemption acceleration or maturity of the etns prior to maturity you may subject to certain restrictions described in the pricing supplement offer the applicable minimum number of your etns to the issuer for redemption on an early redemption date as defined in the prospectus you must offer for redemption at least the applicable minimum number of etns typically ’ or ’ depending on the product as set forth in the pricing supplement or an integral multiple of such amount in excess thereof at one time in order to exercise your right to cause the issuer to redeem your etns on any early redemption date in addition the issuer may charge investors a redemption charge of a percentage of the closing indicative value of any etn that is redeemed at the investor’s option at a rate as indicated in the applicable pricing supplement please see the applicable pricing supplement for fees or charges relating to the etns any payment on the etns is subject to the ability of the issuer to satisfy its obligations as they become due the risks listed above are not exhaustive investors should review the prospectus for each etn including all risk factors set forth therein and consult their independent tax accounting legal and financial advisors
