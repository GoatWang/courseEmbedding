dividend growth inv rrfdx t rowe price equity income r vdaix vanguard dividend appreciation index inv vhdyx vanguard high dividend yield index inv related links buy the unloved   fund picks for  and beyond download a free issue of fundinvestor christine benz hi im christine benz for morningstarcom ever since the financial crisis investors have been in love with dividends joining me to discuss some of his favorite dividendfocused funds is russ kinnel he is director of manager research for morningstar russ thank you so much of being here russ kinnel good to be here benz russ before we get into these specific fund picks lets talk about the general case for dividend payerswhy you might want to make room for them in your portfolio kinnel i think dividendpaying stocks offer a couple of advantages the obvious one being income in a world where there isnt much income to be had but also there are some nice defensive characteristics they tend to be kind of dull stocks that are just steadyobviously things like utilities and others and generallynot always but generallyhigheryielding stocks tend to hold up well in a down market in the  bear market we saw them hold up beautifully in the  bear market it was a much more mixed picture because some of those yield payers were financials which obviously got hit very hard in that market benz right lets discuss the role of costs in any sort of dividendfocused fund that you might buy how are the two interconnected because i noticed that all of the fund picks that youre going to recommend really do have quite low costs relative to their peer groups kinnel a fund pays out income after expenses so those expenses actually come from its yield if it has sufficient yield to cover expenses comparing two similar portfoliosone has a  expense ratio the other has a basispoint expense ratiothe cheaper one is going to have a yield of  basis points more so there is a very direct link there read full transcript benz its not surprising that youve got a lot of vanguard funds on your list of favorite dividendfocused funds lets start with vanguard dividend growth vdigxthe case for this fund and how its dividendgrowth strategy is not all that incomecentric because i think sometimes people think dividend means it will have a high payout but thats not necessarily the case with this particular fund or any dividendgrowthfocused fund kinnel right the basic idea for dividend growth is that you are looking for companies that have a dividend and have the potential to grow that dividend in order to grow the dividend it means you have to have a good balance sheet and some growing revenues so it takes you away from utilities and into more highquality companies with good balance sheets so it gives you a little different mix of companies as you say the yield isnt as great but on the other hand the appreciation potential is greater and we saw in  that these funds actually did better than the equityincometype funds because the balance sheets were so important in  these companies held up better in that downturn benz lets discuss this particular fund it is managed by wellington management for vanguard lets talk about the management team and the general strategy in play here kinnel so don kilbride of wellington runs this fund they have done just a great job of looking for companies with that dividendappreciation potential and you can see the record it looks great against largeblend funds and against most index funds including index funds focused on dividend appreciation so its really worked well and what i love about vanguard is that their active funds are almost as cheap as their index funds so again you are getting what dividends there are in this strategy to flow through because expenses are about  basis points which is incredibly cheap so it is a really good value benz vanguard also has though an index fund that uses kind of a similar strategy lets talk about that onethats vanguard dividend appreciation vdaix people can buy the traditional mutual fund they can also buy an exchangetraded fund version lets talk about that general approach with the fund kinnel thats right so you are going to save some money versus the actively managed fund you will save about  or  basis points its not a huge amount but its still cheaper it gives you a little better potential yield so the new class of index funds that i really am drawn to are ones like this where there is a logic behind it its not too nichey its still a broadmarket focus but its focused on companies with dividendappreciation potentialand again a lot of those are things you can divine from the financial statements so it can be a basic rulesbased index fund and again you have low costs and it really raises the bar i think on all dividendgrowth funds both active and passive benz another fund that you likebefore we leave the dividendgrowth strategiesis t rowe price dividend growth fund prdgx lets talk about it i assume it has a pretty similar strategy to the ones that weve just talked about kinnel thats right its maybe even a little less incomefocused than the two vanguard funds but its still looking for income and appreciation so in a way its almost like the oldschool growthandincome funds but again it has done a really nice job tom huber has been the manager since  so you have a very experienced manager looking for dividends and appreciation potential very much a nice core holding benz in the past i know one of our favorite equityincome dividendfocused funds was t rowe price equity income fund rrfdx why isnt that at the top of your list here kinnel brian rogers is stepping down from that fund and so it loses a bit of its appeal also its performance wasnt quite as good as the other funds that we are going to mention in the equityincome space its still a very good funda nice predictable dependable fund benz lets segue away from the dividendgrowth strategies into funds that do specifically look to deliver a reasonable payoutthats part of the thesis and play so a starting point would be just a good index product like vanguard high dividend yield index vhdyx lets talk about that kinnel thats right this is a fund where the index is skewed toward higheryielding companies obviously you dont want to skew too heavily because the highest yielders tend to have some big risks involved but again this is a really nice waywith very low coststo tap into yieldpaying stocks i think its a nice way to get in there and obviously its very predictable and dependable because you know what its going to buy benz then another fund that has also been pretty predictable uses a similarly incomefocused strategy thats vanguard equityincome veipx lets talk about whats going on there kinnel thats right this fund is almost as cheap as its index equivalent from vanguard youre only paying a couple of basis points more so theres tremendous value coming from this fund two thirds of it is run by wellingtons michael reckmeyer and then one third by vanguards quant group vanguards quant group has actually been steadily quietly improving the performance they deliver for shareholders so the combination is a really nice one again its not designed to be thrilling this is a fairly diffuse portfolio thats going to deliver steady income with a moderate amount of risk but it has actually beaten its indexfund counterpart and youre only paying  basis points more for it so certainly there is potential that it will continue to outperform benz so whats the idea with having the quant group run a component of this portfolio is the goal to bring down the overall costs of the fund or to improve returns what are the main objectives kinnel right so it does bring down the costs second they tend to use the quant group to diversify the portfolio a little more so it will reduce some of the individualstock risk some of the sector risk probably too so it does that and then third it also gives them a little more flexibility on capacity so if a lot of money comes in maybe they can give a little more of that to the quant group so there are a few factors involved in using them and as i said i think over time they have gradually improved the quality of their efforts benz russ theres such an appetite for dividendpaying stocks thanks for being here to share these really evergreen core ideas kinnel youre

best dividend stocks in beauty products these beautiful stocks could boost your annual income but beware the beastly valuations leo sun tmfsunlion may   at am investors often overlook beauty product companies since theyre usually lumped together with bigger and more diversified personal care companies however beauty product makers can offer more focused growth than those bigger companies and their product lines are generally easier to follow beauty product stocks usually dont pay out hefty dividends comparable to personal care stalwart procter  gambles nysepg  forward yield yet there are still a few beauty companies that pay decent yields lets check out three of those potential income plays  coty nysecoty inter parfums nasdaqipar and estee lauder nyseel image source getty images coty coty sells a portfolio of more than  cosmetics fragrances and body care brands in over  countries it produces licensed brands for designers and celebrities and its top brands include chloe sally hansen opi marc jacobs and calvin klein it expanded significantly last year when it acquired  of pgs beauty brands for  billion which added major brands like covergirl max factor wella and clairol to its portfolio coty is currently the largest maker of fragrances in the world the second largest salon hair products maker and the third largest maker of color cosmetics wall street expects the pg acquisition to boost cotys revenue by  this year but acquisition costs could cause its earnings to fall  but after clearing those expenses analysts expect cotys revenue and earnings to respectively rise  and  next year coty pays a forward dividend yield of  its only raised that payout for three straight years but it recently doubled its dividend to  per year and shifted from semiannual to quarterly payments cotys earningsbased payout ratio temporarily exceeds  due to the pg deal but it only spent  of its free cash flow on dividends over the past  months  so it should have plenty of room for future hikes inter parfums inter parfums produces licensed fragrances for companies like abercrombie  fitch coach anna sui dunhill jimmy choo lanvin and montblanc its products are sold in over  countries worldwide it runs its business in two divisions  one in the united states and the other in the european union image source getty images inter parfums business may sound like a slow growth one but its growth has been fairly solid analysts expect its sales and earnings to respectively rise  and  this year fueled by ongoing growth in its core markets western europe and north america and fresh growth from smaller markets like china and russia where the company has invested heavily in new market campaigns and promotions inter parfums pays a forward dividend yield of  which is supported by a low earningsbased payout ratio of  the company spent  of its free cash flow on dividends over the past  months and its raised its quarterly dividend annually for four straight years estee lauder estee lauders cosmetics portfolio includes its namesake brand and wellknown brands like aveda donna karan mac bobbi brown la mer and clinique estee lauder also develops licensed fragrances for companies like michael kors and tommy hilfiger after a rare annual dip in revenue and earnings in fiscal  estee lauders top and bottom line growth have remained slow but steady analysts expect its revenue and earnings to respectively grow  and  this year fueled by growth in china the travel retail channel and wellperforming new brands like too faced and becca the company expects those tailwinds to offset tough headwinds like weak foot traffic in us stores macro challenges in the middle east turkey and latin america and worldwide currency fluctuations estee lauder has raised its quarterly dividend annually for four straight years and it currently pays a forward yield of  that yield might seem low but the company only spent  of its earnings and  of its free cash flow on dividends over the past  months  so it still has room to raise its payout but mind the valuations coty inter parfums and estee lauder all look like solid slowgrowth income plays but investors should be wary of their current valuations cotys pe is currently negative due to the pg deal but its forward pe merely matches the industry average of  meanwhile inter parfums and estee lauder respectively trade at  and  times earnings  making them pricey plays for a frothy market therefore investors should probably wait for a pullback before buying any of these income generating beauty plays for now they should probably focus on cheaper dividend plays with less downside potential leo sun has no position in any stocks mentioned the motley fool owns shares of and recommends coach the motley fool
