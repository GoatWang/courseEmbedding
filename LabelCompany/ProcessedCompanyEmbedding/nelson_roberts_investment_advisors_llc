designations attained by an advisor do not guarantee a profit or protect against loss in periods of declining values do you offer the services i need investment advisory practices vary widely in the services they provide in general they fall into one or a combination of the categories listed below money managers if you need someone to manage your portfolio and do your investing consider money managers they design investment portfolios generally consisting of stocks bonds and other individual securities often manage the portfolio on a discretionary basis meaning that you authorize the advisor to trade on your behalf without the need for advance approval from you may not offer general financial planning services financial planners if you need someone to review your situation and help with bigpicture planning consider financial planners they help you look to the future and do longterm financial planning in the areas of retirement college funding wealth transfer tax planning

provide highly personalized comprehensive financial planning as well as investment and portfolio management for highnetworth clients coordinate with other professional advisors such as attorneys and accountants to serve more complex financial needs which may include tax minimization trust management wealth transfers real estate management and portfolio performance analytics how are you compensated knowing how your advisor is compensated may help you evaluate the relative objectivity of the recommendations you receive independent advisors generally work on a feeonly or feepluscommissions basis types of compensation and what they mean to you fee only assetbased hourly or flat fees many independent advisors charge a percentage of the assets they manage for you typically – this compensation method gives your advisor an incentive to help grow your assets hourly or flat fees are often associated with a specific onetime service eg developing a financial plan the fee may vary by account size and service in addition to these fees you may pay commissions andor other fees for execution of the trades your advisor makes and for custody of your assets fee plus commissions along with an advisory or financial planning fee some advisors may receive a portion of the commissions you pay when you buy or sell certain financial products the advisor recommends such as insurance policies or annuities commissions only advisors sometimes receive compensation only from sales commissions on the investments they buy and sell for you wrap fees sometimes advisors charge a wrap fee which is typically a single assetbased fee for the advice they provide and the execution of the trades they make how will we work together good communication between you and your advisor is essential asking the questions below can help you judge the amount of attention and regular communication you can expect what to ask with whom will i work in some cases the firm’s principal may conduct your initial meeting and then turn your portfolio over to an associate or a team that actually manages it if personal rapport is important to you ask to meet with the people you’ll be working with how often will we communicate regular contact helps ensure that you and your advisor are clear about your financial goals risk tolerance and investment strategy typically your advisor meets you in person at least annually – and stays in touch more frequently by phone and email how will you report performance at a minimum you should expect to receive account statements from the advisor or custodianbrokerage firm where your assets are held quarterly summaries of yeartodate investment performance a comprehensive annual performance report from your advisor what is the size of your firm a firm’s size – including the number of employees the assets under management and the average portfolio size – can have a bearing on the quality of service you receive large firms may have more resources – an important consideration if your needs call for specialized services small firms may offer more personalized attention the average portfolio size of the advisor’s other clients helps you understand your potential fit with the firm how do you approach investing for people like me things to consider performance ask to see portfolio performance numbers for up and down markets ask the advisor to compare the performance with relevant benchmarks such as the sp ® index during the same time period an advisor should at least meet – and preferably beat – the benchmark investment style advisors may specialize in certain types of investments such as mutual funds stocks or bonds and styles such as growth or value you can assess whether the advisors methodology or style aligns with your objectives asking about an advisors investment style is a good way to make sure that the advisor can explain his or her approach clearly and in a way that you understand decisionmaking advisors who have a disciplined approach to decisionmaking may be more likely to stay focused on your longterm goals many advisors use an asset allocation strategy that has a history of success over time your strategy should be based on your goals time horizon and comfort with risk knowing how often an advisor adjusts portfolios can indicate whether the advisor uses a strategic longterm approach or invests in shortterm trends past performance does not guarantee future results the sp ® index is an index of widely traded stocks indexes are unmanaged do not incur fees or expenses and cannot be invested in directly where will my assets be held independent financial advisors typically use independent custodians – generally brokerage firms or banks – to hold and safeguard their clients’ stocks mutual funds and other assets why should you ask this question you want to be confident that your advisor has chosen a custodian that meets or exceeds the security measures required by industry regulators to help protect your assets look for a custodian with important services such as trade execution and preparation of monthly brokerage statements which allow your advisor to concentrate on managing your portfolio ask about the custodian’s policies to help protect personal and financial information from unauthorized activity preliminary screening you can review pertinent information about an advisor

funding in place means they have more options like being able to select the college that best fits their interests and goals as opposed to the college that offers the most aid and graduating with less student debt means having the ability to pursue the next chapter of their lives with more financial freedom named after section  of the internal revenue code a  plan is a taxadvantaged savings vehicle

management when little geniuses have big dreams wealth management how to break the ice around family finances a flexible way to save and invest for college the appeal of  plans may derive from their

establishing an account and high contribution limits virtually anyone can be named a beneficiary—a child grandchild niece nephew spouse even a friend according to chris stack a managing consultant at

account or other strategy “with s grandparents or extended family give themselves an option but not an obligation to apply their funds to help pay college costs he says  another significant benefit of  plans is taxfree compounding “earning on an account’s growth rather than paying taxes on the earnings provides more funding available in future years when the college costs become a family reality stack says “having the ability to withdraw the principal and taxdeferred earnings without any federal or state income tax liability is a very significant benefit especially when compared to alternative strategies such as using a life insurance policy or a taxable account stack recommends that families start preparing for college costs as early as possible while as soon as the child is born is ideal he said some even “begin with an account in their own name years before their first child is born knowing the designated beneficiary can be changed in the future says dextraze “at the

management fixed income november  0 premium bonds many bond investors are used to the idea of buying a bond at par value price   and receiving par value back at maturity the idea of paying a premium or paying more for a bond than it is worth at maturity may seem like a bad idea in fact premium bonds can be better investments than nonpremium bonds in a raising interest rate environment premium bonds return higher cash flow to the buyer which shortens the bonds’ duration and makes them less sensitive to interest rate changes what is a premium bond a premium bond is a bond trading above its par value eg price is more than  a bond will trade above its par value when its coupon is higher than current interest rates if prevailing interest rates are near  and a bond has a  coupon then buyers will pay a higher price to receive the larger coupon rate the coupon rate is the amount of interest paid per year to a bondholder while the coupon on most bonds is fixed the market price of a security changes based on market conditions the value of a bond depends on market interest rates credit quality coupon rate and maturity date of the bond while economic and marketdriven events impact a bond’s value the expectation of change in interest rates typically has the strongest influence on bond prices when interest rates fall bond prices rise and when interest rates rise bond prices fall which is the preferred bond to own in a raising interest rate environment at first glance the answer may seem simple — buy the discount bond at  and benefit as the price rises to  at maturity alternatively paying 0 for a bond that is going to mature at  seems to make no sense but the difference in price is made up for by the higher coupon in the case of the premium bond and the lower coupon in the case of the discount bond in other words the bond trading at a premium will offer higher income payments than the bond trading at a discount which makes up for the difference in price advantages of buying bonds at a premium • premium bonds have a higher coupon and therefore return more income to the investor • premium bonds are typically less sensitive to fluctuations in prevailing interest rates than similar discount bonds disadvantage of buying bonds at a premium • premium bonds require a larger capital commitment up front a bond’s investment return cannot be judged on price alone premium bonds offer a fairly straightforward tradeoff you pay more up front in exchange for larger interest payments the higher cash flows of the premium bond accelerate the return on your investment if interest rates are rising the accelerated return of investment allows for cash to be reinvested at higher rates individual investment positions detailed in this post should not be construed as a recommendation

option taxation read more what is a fiduciary read more what is a fiduciary  nelson roberts nelson roberts nelson roberts what is a fiduciary   february  0 what is a fiduciary recently president trump announced plans to undo the department of labor’s fiduciary rule this was a rule intended to protect investors’ retirement funds by holding advisors to a “fiduciary standard” meaning that the advisor’s actions must be in the best interest of the client currently advisors not registered with the sec may dispense financial advice that is only held to a “suitability” standard often these advisors are compensated for the advice they provide by earning commissions on the assets they sell to their clients this is currently allowed as long as they can deem the products “suitable” in some way even if the investments are not exclusively in the clients’ best interest imagine a car salesman selling an expensive seat sports car to a family of  the salesman motivated by the high commission justifies the sports car as “suitable” because it is technically a mode of transportation a more optimal solution for the family might be a lowerpriced minivan but this would earn the salesman a lower commission acting only on a “suitability” standard the salesman can sell the family the sports car because he does not need to act in the best interest of the family opponents of the fiduciary rule argue it would limit investor’s choice of advisor we think it would be crazy to choose an investor that does not act in their best too often we see prospective clients’ portfolios jampacked with “suitable” yet inappropriate investment products that command high commissions for the selling broker while the fate of the fiduciary rule is unclear we believe that it would be a positive development

feepluscommissions basis types of compensation and what they mean to you fee only assetbased hourly or flat fees many independent advisors charge a percentage of the assets they manage for you typically – this compensation method gives your advisor an incentive to help grow your assets hourly or flat fees are often associated with a specific onetime service eg developing a financial plan the fee may vary by account size and service in addition to these fees you may pay commissions andor other fees for execution of the trades your advisor makes and for custody of your assets fee plus

a wrap fee which is typically a single assetbased fee for the advice they provide and the execution of the trades they make how will we work together good communication between you and your advisor is essential asking the questions below can help you judge the amount of attention and regular communication you can expect what to ask with whom will i work in some cases the firm’s principal may conduct your initial meeting and then turn your portfolio over to an associate or a team that actually manages it if personal rapport is important to you ask to meet with the people you’ll be working with how often will we communicate regular contact helps ensure that you and your advisor are clear about your financial goals risk tolerance and investment strategy typically your advisor meets you in person at least annually – and stays in touch more frequently by phone and email how will you report performance at a minimum you should expect to receive account statements from the advisor or custodianbrokerage firm where your assets are held quarterly summaries of yeartodate investment performance a comprehensive annual performance report from your advisor what is the size of your firm a firm’s size – including the number of employees the assets under management and the average portfolio size – can have a bearing on the quality of service you receive large firms may have more resources – an important consideration if your needs call for specialized services small firms may offer more personalized attention the average portfolio size of the advisor’s other clients helps you understand your potential fit with the firm how do you approach investing for people like me things to consider performance ask to see portfolio performance numbers for up and down markets ask the advisor to compare the performance with relevant benchmarks such as the sp ® index during the same time period an advisor should at least meet – and preferably beat – the benchmark investment style

your objectives asking about an advisors investment style is a good way to make sure that the advisor can explain his or her approach clearly and in a way that you understand decisionmaking advisors who have a disciplined approach to decisionmaking may be more likely to stay focused on your longterm goals many advisors use an asset allocation strategy that has a history of success over time your strategy should be based on your goals time horizon and comfort with risk knowing how often an advisor adjusts portfolios can indicate whether the advisor uses a strategic longterm approach or invests in shortterm trends past performance does not guarantee future results the sp ® index is an index of widely traded stocks indexes are unmanaged do not incur fees or expenses and cannot be invested in

on the number of accounts the same person or entity can own generally no maximum age limits for establishing an account and high contribution limits virtually anyone can be named a beneficiary—a child grandchild niece nephew spouse even a friend according to chris stack a managing consultant at savingforcollegecom one of the most overlooked benefits is the daily access and liquidity of the  account as opposed to a utma uniform transfers to minors act or ugma uniform gifts to minors act account or other strategy “with s grandparents or extended family give themselves an option but not an obligation to apply their funds to help pay college costs he says  another significant benefit of  plans is taxfree compounding “earning on an account’s growth rather than paying taxes on the earnings provides more funding available in future years when the college costs become a family reality stack says “having the ability to withdraw the principal and taxdeferred earnings without any federal or state income tax liability is a very significant benefit especially when compared to alternative strategies such as using a life insurance policy or a taxable account stack recommends that families start preparing for college costs as early as possible while as soon as the child is born is ideal he said some even “begin with an account in their own name years before their first child is born
