change the material from aluminum to steel how much savings can we get if we make  vs  if i use a die casting process instead of a sand casting process will this reduce my cost what will happen to the cost if we move the manufacturing of our product from mexico to china until now most software applications that attempted to provide the cost of a manufactured part required large amounts of data input each time a new quote was required furthermore these products could only be used by a handful of specialists that required extensive training to be productive with the application apriori is an

overview cost down workshop developing your pcm strategy education services blog community support resources contact login germany japan apriori solutions overview product cost solutions across the lifecycle for manufacturers struggling to deliver profits in the face of rising product costs and global competition understanding product costs early and throughout the product lifecycle is crucial   apriori’s revolutionary cost management capabilities empower organizations to identify quantifiable savings in material tooling labor and overhead when evaluating alternative designs manufacturing processes and sources with access to realtime cost assessments throughout the product development process employees in sourcing engineering and manufacturing will make wellinformed decisions that drive significant costs out of products pre and postproduction through an innovative patented understanding of how product design materials and manufacturing processes translate into product costs apriori replaces traditional inefficient costestimation techniques such as activitybased costing contract quoting or statistical analysis with precise cost assessments that update in realtime as parameters change apriori provides true cost visibility to everyone in the organization that impacts cost – designers manufacturing engineers and planners purchasing and sourcing professionals cost managers program management and executives meeting unique industry challenges apriori is used to help product teams address cost challenges across cost a wide range of industry verticals and products from tractors to forklifts hvac equipment snowmobiles engines trucks atms mail machines and more specific areas of expertise include agricultural equipment  heavy equipment  industrial equipment meeting target costs at product launch traditionally has been a challenge for companies in the agricultural  heavy  industrial equipment industries as they lack access to accurate cost data early in the development process apriori’s realtime “should cost” assessments make cost data available sooner making cost targets more achievable with the increase in parts outsourced to suppliers sourcing professionals can use apriori’s “should cost” details to make sure they never overpay suppliers for their parts  examples of apriori customers in this space include agco corporation cnh nmhg jungheinrich fmc technologies thyssenkrupp elevator and dematic automotive  transportation  recreational vehicles apriori’s ability to cost metal and plastic parts welded assemblies and more helps oems and suppliers get better control over their part and product costs with cost of goods sold usually between  and  percent of revenue companies in these markets are extremely cost sensitive using apriori to reduce product costs even by a small percentage yields exponential results to profit margin examples of apriori customers in this space include  ford motor company alstom transport american axle  manufacturing aam blue bird corporation and commercial vehicle group electronics  high technology eht with medium to high production volumes the mechanical spend for high tech devices eg computers printers scanners labratory equipment medical devices etc can be significant by supporting stage tooling progressive die and injection molding plastic processes apriori can help costreduce new and existing parts for companies that produce computer equipment audio  video equipment communications equipment instruments and control equipment laboratory equipment and other high tech products  examples of apriori customers in this space include wincor nixdorf diebold zebra technologies and several of the largest manufacturers of computer equipment and peripherals in the world aerospace  defense products designed and manufactured in the commercial aerospace or defense markets are often extremely complex and have very long life cycles  for commercial aerospace companies managing cost across a complex supply chain is becoming more complicated by the day  with national defense departments increasingly moving away from “costplus” type contracts system integrators and their subcontractors are being asked to submit fixed price bids  multitier global supply chains and fixed price targets put significant stress on manufacturers to quote accurately design to cost and avoid overpaying for outsourced components  apriori was designed to help address all of these challenges through an enterprise platform approach that provides early visibility to cost and enables frequent evaluation of cost each and every time an important tradeoff decision is made  examples of apriori customers in this space include  boeing and honeywell durable goodsappliances companies that make products with a high concentration of metal and plastic parts – including refrigerators ovens air conditioners motors generators and other large and small appliances and durable goods – can take advantage of apriori’s realtime cost information to keep prices low in highly competitive markets  examples of apriori customers in this space include  bissell and one of the largest manufacturers of

a more cost conscious culture where where everyone is considering profitability with each decision they makewatch video apriori is a software company located in concord massachusetts that develops and markets product cost management software the company was founded in  since then we have invested hundreds of manyears into the development of our product and acquired numerous world class manufacturing corporations as customers fundamentally apriori software and services generate harddollar product cost savings for discrete manufacturing organizations using apriori’s realtime product cost assessments employees in sourcing manufacturing and design engineering make moreinformed decisions that drive costs out of products pre and postproduction with apriori manufacturers launch products at cost targets maximize savings in rework projects and never overpay for sourced parts as a result apriori customers significantly reduce product costs and measurably improve overall financial performance all while delivering highvalue products to their customers  launch new products at or below target cost even bestinclass manufacturing companies can miss their cost targets when launching new products with apriori engineers can explore more design alternatives earlier in the development process without sacrificing schedules within seconds of making a design change apriori provides a realtime assessment of how the change has affected the cost of the part or product with ongoing access to product cost information engineers make better decisions that prevent costs from being designed into new products while reducing the need for changes later in development – when making changes is incrementally more expensive avoid overpaying for outsourced parts apriori makes it possible for companies to ensure consistently optimal pricing for their outsourced parts and products with apriori’s realtime product cost information sourcing professionals always know precisely how much a part or product “should cost” to produce access to precise “should cost” information enables sourcing experts to easily identify where they are overpaying for outsourced parts and to always negotiate the best deals with suppliers the result is significant product cost savings en route to meeting or surpassing cost reduction goals maximize cost savings on redesign work for redesign projects apriori provides design engineers with instant cost feedback as they attempt to costreduce and improve production parts designers can simply load parts to see what they cost today and then evaluate costsaving alternative designs using apriori’s precise product cost information cost assessments are delivered in realtime as designs are modified providing engineers with visibility into how the most recent change will impact overall cost with apriori designers always know what it “should cost” to produce a design without having to wait for a formal cost estimate or supplier quote as a result engineers can evaluate more alternatives and make better decisions that ultimately result in lower product costs increase the accuracy and speed of rfq responses oems are looking to outsource business to suppliers but demand accurate and detailed quotations from the supplier’s perspective it’s challenging to keep up with the number of business opportunities because generating accurate and detailed quotations is a manual resourceintensive process with apriori the time required to generate a detailed cost estimate can be reduced from days to minutes videos and demoshoneywell aerospace –

feasible manufacturing methods and product costs while generating detailed manufacturing analysis and cost estimates that quantify the impact of changes to product design materials manufacturing processes volumes and location in real time apriori will also provide the rafael procurement and sourcing teams with regional cost benchmarks based on the companys specific product requirements enabling it to collaborate more effectively with its suppliers apriori expands into costing of electronic products jan   apriori announced an important addition to the company’s product portfolio – a new software module that automates the cost calculation of printed circuit board assembly pcba with automated pcba costing software users will be able to quickly generate a detailed cost estimate by importing a bill of materials with basic attribute information about the components the pcba costing module will assign a cost to the board components using a library of component costs and estimate the assembly costs of attaching the components to the board users can also specify test and verification processes required whereby the system will automatically assess the cost of each process and roll it into the overall pcba cost the apriori pcba costing module comes with more than fortyfive outofthebox assembly and test manufacturing cost models and is built on apriori’s extensible platform supporting the addition of more processes key benefits that customers will realize with apriori’s new pcba cost module include providing engineers with early visibility into the cost impact of design decisions and supporting exploration of options like single vs double sided or the assembly cost impact of using different size boards enable sourcing to negotiate more effectively with suppliers by providing detail on component costs manufacturing costs  commercial costs quantify cost impact of vave explorations ability to aggregate and analyze data across product lines and business units and centrally located cost models will drive consistency of costing across a team printed circuit boards pcb are used in all but the simplest electronic devices and are used to route signals and power through electronic devices they appear in almost all discrete manufactured products to some degree they can also represent a significant portion the cost for a product especially in industry verticals such as aerospace  defense high tech electronics computer and communications equipment and other consumer electronic products healthcare oil  gas and increasingly in automotive and transportation products while it is a significant portion of a company’s spend the divisions responsible for pcb design are typically smaller than those responsible for mechanical designs this has the potential to create a timetomarket bottleneck that can be easily overcome by automating the product costing process key capabilities of the new pcba costing module will include component costing  automatically calculated for an entire bom based on part lookup in centralized component library cost information will be stored within component library volume discounting and company negotiated costs barco selects apriori for product cost management sep   apriori has been selected by barco the company will implement apriori’s software as part of a companywide value and cost engineering initiative
