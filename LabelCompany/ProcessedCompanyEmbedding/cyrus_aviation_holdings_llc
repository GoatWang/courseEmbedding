barclays and deutsche bank valuing the company at about  million last friday march  the company’s shares closed at  with a total market capitalization of  billion several major global private equity firms are likely to bid for the airline “private equity investors are familiar with different leverage options making them natural investors in the aircraft leasing space” noted world finance magazine “given the prevalence of operating leasing the benefits over aircraft ownership have been clearly recognized by airlines” according to wf “since the early s there has been an increasing trend for airlines around the world to rely on operating leasing as an alternate means to managing their financing and fleet requirements for commercial aircraft” moreover according to research by the airline monitor air traffic has historically doubled every  years and is projected to have an average annual growth rate of  percent for the next  years thereby doubling traffic again over the next  years air traffic has exceeded gdp growth by approximately  times over the past  years and the sector has been very resilient to external shocks “private equity’s first meaningful airline foray was the leveraged buyout of northwest airlines in  by wings holdings an investment group organized by al checchi and gary wilson” commented rick schifter a senior adviser and former partner at private equity firm tpg and board member of american airlines group in an editorial opinion for the wall street journal “northwest airlines thereafter focused on controlling costs and improving customer service—steps which led to record profits in the late s still  had a devastating impact on the industry the terrorist attacks and the subsequent growth of lowcost carriers forced northwest into chapter  in  it emerged as an independent company and subsequently merged with delta in  the ceo of delta at the time was richard anderson—a former ceo of northwest in the wings holdings years” “the second major privateequity investment in the airline industry was by air partners this group formed by david bonderman jim coulter and bill price took a controlling stake in continental airlines in april  eighteen months after that transaction closed the airline was teetering on the edge of a third chapter  filing” said schifter “continental merged with united airlines in  and although continental was the smaller company its ceo jeff smisek headed the merged company bonderman coulter and price went on to establish the privateequity firm texas pacific group now tpg” he added “it is no coincidence that the ceos of the three largest airlines today rose to prominence while their companies were controlled by privateequity firms” “private equity investors have long been attracted to the investment rationales of operating lessors” says franklin l pray president and ceo of intrepid aviation “for example cerberus capital management a us based private equity firm invested in

fortress investment group in  and taken public in ” pray added “in  terra firma a uk based private equity firm acquired awas for bn in cash plus the assumption of liabilities from morgan stanley” he commented further “in  terra firma then further agreed to purchase pegasus aviation from the us private equity firm oaktree capital management and combined awas and pegasus to create the new awas then the world’s thirdlargest aircraft leasing business” “more recently avolon aerospace leasing a lessor founded in  backed by private equity firms cinven cvc capital partners and oak hill capital partners successfully took the business public in december ” said pray “private equity has provided capital to the industry when the public markets were not prepared to do so whether to help carriers
