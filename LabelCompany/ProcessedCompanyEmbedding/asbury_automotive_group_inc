this was my car after the weston fire department put it out total loss the car had been off for an hour and parked this is after i had mercedes benz of tampa sell me and install a stage  turbo they did all the work at mercedes of tampa and the car is now gone they are holding to not being responsible for the vehicle i worked for a company that helps dealerships improve and these guys need it when it comes to customer service i called their corporate office to invite one of their employees to a conference their receptionist was absolutely nasty to me she had a bad attitude when i asked to be transferred to someone else in the company he didnt work in that particular office and i had no idea where he would be as the company is rather expansive she asked what it was about and i was going to invite him to that conference which applied to his line of work she told me he would not be interested and hung up on me thats not for her to say i tried again the following day the receptionist still refused my offer until i asked her to give me the number for the dealership in the company this guy might be at she snapped that if i know the guy i should have his number especially if i had business with him at this point i had lost my cherublike disposition she begrudgingly gave me the phone number and i thanked her but she hung up on me without a word the number was incorrect highly inappropriate is this how asbury automotives regular customers are treated press  to be treated like the scum of the earth if you have an issue with one of their dealerships dont bother calling asbury

an hour and parked this is after i had mercedes benz of tampa sell me and install a stage  turbo they did all the work at mercedes of tampa and the car is now gone they are holding to not being responsible for the vehicle i worked for a company that helps dealerships improve and these guys need it when it comes to customer service i called their corporate office to invite one of their employees to a conference their receptionist was absolutely nasty to me she had a bad attitude when i asked to be transferred to someone else in the company he didnt work in that particular office and i had no idea where he would be as the company is rather expansive she asked what it was about and i was going to invite him to that conference which applied to his line of work she told me he would not be interested and hung up on me thats not for her to say i tried again the following day the receptionist still refused my offer until i asked her to give me the number for the dealership in the company this guy might be at she snapped that if i know the guy i should have his number especially if i had business with him at this point i had lost my cherublike disposition she begrudgingly gave me the phone number and i thanked her but she hung up on me without a word the number was incorrect highly inappropriate is this how asbury automotives regular customers are treated press  to be treated like the scum of the earth if you have an issue with one of their dealerships dont bother calling asbury who is their corporate office for help i spoke to this lady in their customer compliant office and all she could do is stick up for the dealership she was not absorbing one word of my situation and kept telling me that she would have a district guy tam call me and he did not call me because he was in on the deal he made with my mother and i i went to coggin deland hyundai in deland fl and at first treated so well and then the lies back fired on me they made a deal with my mom that if i cosigned that they could get me into a car as well we both left the dealership with cars they picked out for us and signed contracts well two weeks later they tell me and my mom that moms car need new paperwork but say nothing that they were still looking for financing for my car will joseph ramon and tam all lied to us and made us think that financing was not going to be an issue for me it was not until  days goes by and i bring to their attention my old car was not paid off that they would not answer my calls and when they figured out my days was coming up they called me to tell me that i needed to sign new paperwork they did not mention anything else i show up on the th day for them to tell me i wasnt approved for the car i fell in love with but could get me a new car just like my mothers for  more a month i could not afford that so they brought my old car around and gave it back to me my friend also bought a car a few days after me and they waited until  days also and told her that they could finance her for  dollars more a month they already knew our budgets and went over them to begin with so to do a bate and switch on me was not right they knew the physical pain my old car was giving me and also knew i was planning on getting a new car in feb that i was working on my credit and saving money to put down because i knew i was in bad shape and was upside down no problem they told my mom and i said they could get me into a car if i cosigned for my mother anyways dont bother emailing or calling asbury because they dont care about their customers never got any response or phone call from any of them i was promised  dollar referral fee and my late fee for my car payment and still have not seen a dime just be careful when dealing with any dealership
