and water markets today announced it has received an order for delivery of its first nanoclear product targeted to be used in for the growing market for the estimated  million cubic meterday desalination market of water nanoclear is a revolutionary water cleaning architecture enabled by the features in daiss nanomaterial  aqualyte according to wwwgwicom  is was the third consecutive year that the international desalination market has seen yearonyear growth the desalination project is one of three projects that aquabaero is undertaking with nanoclear systems the other two systems will be used in projects that focus on nanoclears proven ability to clean industrial wastewater daiss entrance into the desalination market is the result of  years of research into how to optimize our nanoclear system for the desalination process says tim tangredi ceo and president of dais we believe nanoclears ability to use waste heat to generate potable water that is a  times cleaner than global standards require and our ability to handle wastewater concentrated up to x  times the normal limit of a reverse osmosis system uniquely positions the company to establish higher performance standards for desalination projects continued tangredi the market for desalination is diverse and there are specific applications where nanoclear is particularly suited said brian johnson chief technology officer for dais membrane used in nanoclear can handle higher levels of salinity than conventional reverse osmosis systems and the surface of our membrane inherently resists bacterial and fungal growth this makes nanoclear the right choice for specific market segments the desalination project is one of three projects that aquabaero is undertaking with nanoclear systems the other two systems will be used in projects that focus on nanoclears proven ability to clean industrial wastewater nanoclears benefits compared to standard reverse osmosis systems include simpler plant engineering lower
