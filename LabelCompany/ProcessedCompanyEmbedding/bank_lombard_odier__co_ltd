duty to report to the internal revenue service irs and pay taxes on all of their income including income earned in accounts that these us taxpayers maintained at lombard odier  lombard odier nonetheless opened maintained and serviced accounts for us persons that it knew or had reason to know were likely not declared to the irs or the treasury department as required by us law lombard odier offered traditional swiss banking services such as numbered accounts and holding clients’ mail that assisted us clients in the concealment of assets and income from the irs  lombard odier also assisted us clients in concealing their assets and income by opening and maintaining accounts in the names of nonus corporations foundations trusts or other entities that it knew were beneficially owned by us persons  lombard odier maintained at least  entity accounts that were operated without compliance with the requisite corporate formalities  the nonus jurisdictions in which the entities were incorporated or formed included the british virgin islands liechtenstein and panama  in some instances lombard odier referred clients to its swissbased affiliate favona sa which is also part of the lombard odier group to set up entity structures  in addition favona provided administrative services including accounting services and supplying corporate directors a zurichbased law firm the zurich firm and a zurichbased lawyer the zurich lawyer referred usrelated accounts to lombard odier with aggregate assets under management of over  million  the zurich lawyer was the accountholder and had signature authority andor power of attorney over all of the usrelated accounts that he referred and was also a director of the panama corporation that was the accountholder of one of those accounts  in some instances the zurich firm and zurich lawyer operated in cooperation with a us lawyer in new york new york  the zurich firm and zurich lawyer referred  accounts to lombard odier that the us lawyer – or that person’s friends or family members – beneficially owned effective in or about january  lombard odier entered into a qualified intermediary qi agreement with the irs  the qi agreement was designed to help ensure that nonus persons were subject to the proper us withholding tax rates and that us persons were properly paying us tax with respect to us securities held in an account with lombard odier  as a consequence of lombard odier entering into a qi agreement with the irs certain relationship managers and supervisory relationship managers opened accounts for us clients in the names of sham offshore entities  in connection with these accounts lombard odier employees knowingly accepted and included in its account records irs forms wben or lombard odier’s substitute forms provided by the directors of the offshore companies that falsely represented under penalty of perjury that such companies were the beneficial owners of the assets in the accounts for us federal income tax purposes  certain relationship managers supervisory relationship managers and others caused lombard odier to certify compliance with the qi agreement even though the true beneficial owners were not reflected in the forms wben in the account files  since aug   lombard odier maintained accounts with an aggregate value of more than  million that were owned by insurance companies and which held assets relating to insurance products that were issued to us taxpayer clients of the respective insurance companies  such accounts commonly known as “insurance wrappers” were titled in the names of insurance companies but were funded with assets that were transferred to the accounts for the beneficial owners of the insurance products lombard odier’s senior management decided in june  to prohibit new us taxpayer clients coming from ubs and to refrain from hiring ubs relationship managers with us taxpayer clients  shortly thereafter lombard odier implemented a regularize or leave action plan the tenets of which were described in a written policy dated oct   to be communicated verbally to the group heads of lombard odier’s private banking business unit  pursuant to the plan lombard odier’s management required that relationship managers instruct each of their us clients to sign a form w voluntarily disclose their accounts to the irs or close their accounts  according to the written policy relationship managers were to propose that us clients who wished to close their accounts do so via withdrawal of cash checks or gold transfers to another bank or donations to nonus relatives or charitable institutions  in connection with the plan lombard odier closed  usrelated accounts with cash withdrawals exceeding  million  lombard odier also closed at least  usrelated accounts via fictitious donations where the clients transferred the funds in their accounts to other accounts at lombard odier or to external accounts that were controlled by the us clients but held by their nonus relatives or associates since aug   lombard odier had  usrelated accounts comprising maximum assets under management of approximately  billion including assets of declared accounts  lombard odier will pay a penalty of  million dz privatbank was founded in  as beg bank europäischer genossenschaftsbanken a public limited liability company under swiss law  in early  following several internal reorganizations and name changes its name was changed to dz privatbank schweiz ag  dz privatbank’s sole office is in zurich switzerland  dz privatbank’s ultimate owners are regionallybased german cooperative banks whose customers are primarily individuals and small to mediumsized companies  dz privatbank’s primary business focus has always been to provide private banking services in switzerland for customers of the german cooperative banks and it has always defined and marketed itself as the “germany specialist in switzerland” through its managers employees andor others dz privatbank knew or had reason to know that some us taxpayers who had opened and maintained accounts at dz privatbank were not complying with their us income tax and reporting obligations  during much of the time after aug   dz privatbank conducted a us crossborder banking business that aided and assisted certain of its us clients in opening and maintaining undeclared accounts in switzerland and concealing the assets and income they held in these accounts from the us government  dz privatbank offered a variety of traditional swiss banking services that it knew could assist and did in fact assist us clients in the concealment of assets and income from the irs  these services included numbered accounts the ability for customers to have their mail held at dz privatbank and the use of a post office box held in the name of a dz privatbank employee in  dz privatbank decided to expand its international business operations  dz privatbank’s international expansion plan focused on customers domiciled in various countries including great britain hungary poland russia turkey and the united states  dz privatbank opened  new usrelated accounts with maximum aggregate assets under management of approximately  million between jan  and oct    prior to that period dz privatbank had approximately  usrelated accounts with maximum aggregate assets under management of  million in may  dz privatbank began accepting customers from credit suisse who had either terminated their relationship with credit suisse or whom credit suisse had terminated  in addition to credit suisse since aug   dz privatbank accepted the transfer of more than two dozen usrelated accounts from other swiss banks under investigation by the department  dz privatbank knew or should have known that some clients who transferred assets from these banks during this period were undeclared to the irs  by opening these usrelated accounts dz privatbank aided and abetted those us clients in concealing income and assets from the irs dz privatbank employees corresponded and met with credit suisse personnel in connection with the transfer of accounts to dz privatbank  in an email dated dec   one credit suisse relationship manager notified a client that the account had to be closed before the end of december  but indicated “dz privatbank    will probably be an option for you”  this email was forwarded to dz privatbank’s general email address by credit suisse  in another email dated may   the head relationship manager for us accounts at credit suisse contacted an employee of dz privatbank regarding the transfer of an account to dz privatbank “i’m away during his stay  i have now ordered the gold so he can take it physically and can carry it ‘over the road’  after i give him some cash we will then close the relationship  a third credit suisse relationship manager has reviewed the documents and will supervise the case” credit suisse personnel also provided advice to dz privatbank personnel related to clients’ potential participation in the irs’s offshore voluntary disclosure programs ovdp to dz privatbank personnel  for example in or about april  a dz privatbank relationship manager who had learned that some legal advisors were recommending a “quiet ovdp” filing sought the views of a credit suisse relationship manager on that topic and was informed it was “really dangerous” tantamount to “giving the customer the rope to hang themselves” and should never be recommended as a result of the inflow of customers from credit suisse a preliminary interim protocol for us customers was developed by several dz privatbank employees that in part incorporated the recommendations of the head relationship manager for us accounts at credit suisse mentioned above  this was effective beginning in or about november  and remained effective until february  when portions of it were incorporated in a crossborder handbook which noted “the bank has the following aims” listing first “the bank wants – in the meaning of a sidebusiness nebensegment – to start business relations with uscustomers”  the handbook continued that “us clients need to be treated due to several regulatory requirements with extreme caution and reluctance” in or about july  dz privatbank accepted a usrelated account from credit suisse where the customer may have been concealing the existence of the account from us authorities and was likely actively attempting to conceal his account from the irs  this customer and a former dz privatbank relationship manager engaged in discussions related to various ways in which the customer could withdraw money from his account at dz privatbank with the stated intention of not “attracting attention”  it was ultimately agreed that checks would be sent monthly to the customer in an amount set by him  the customer failed to provide forms required by dz privatbank when it began its program to implement the foreign account tax compliance act fatca and as a result the account was blocked and ultimately closed for noncompliance  nevertheless dz privatbank unblocked the account several times through november  against dz privatbank’s internal guidelines so that the customer could continue to receive monthly checks since aug   dz privatbank had a total of  usrelated accounts with aggregated assets under management of approximately  million  dz privatbank will pay a penalty of  million in accordance with the terms of the swiss bank program each bank mitigated its penalty by encouraging us accountholders to come into compliance with their us tax and disclosure obligations  while us accountholders at these banks who have not yet declared their accounts to the irs may still be eligible to participate in the irs offshore voluntary disclosure program the price of such disclosure has increased most us taxpayers who enter the irs offshore voluntary disclosure program to resolve undeclared offshore accounts will pay a penalty equal to  percent of the high value of the accounts  on aug   the irs increased the penalty to  percent if at the time the taxpayer initiated their disclosure either a foreign financial institution at which the taxpayer had an account or a facilitator who helped the taxpayer establish or maintain an offshore arrangement had been publicly identified as being under investigation the recipient of a john doe summons or cooperating with a government investigation including the execution of a deferred prosecution agreement or nonprosecution agreement  with today’s announcement of these nonprosecution agreements noncompliant us accountholders at these banks must now pay that  percent penalty to the irs if they wish to enter the irs offshore voluntary disclosure program acting assistant attorney general caroline d ciraolo of the justice department’s tax division thanked the irs and in particular irscriminal investigation and the irs large business
