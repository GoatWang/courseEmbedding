a real product was introduced in january  using factor combining it was probably the first desktop calculator capable of computing logarithms quite an achievement for a machine without any integrated circuits the electronics included  discrete transistors it actually performed multiplication by adding logarithms and roundoff in the display conversion was noticeable  times  yielded  from  to about  wang was a wellregarded calculator company wang calculators cost in the midfourfigures used nixie tube readouts performed transcendental functions had varying degrees of programmability and exploited magnetic core memory the  and  calculator models were available as timeshared simultaneous se packages that had a central processing unit the size of a small suitcase connected by cables leading to four individual desktop displaykeyboard units competition included hp which introduced the hp a in  and oldline calculator companies such as monroe and marchant wang calculators were at first sold to scientists and engineers but the company later won a solid niche in financialservices industries which had previously relied on complicated printed tables for mortgages and annuities one perhaps apocryphal story tells of a banker who spotchecked a wang calculator against a mortgage table and found a discrepancy the calculator was right the printed tables were wrong and the companys reputation was made in the early seventies wang believed that calculators would become unprofitable lowmargin commodities and decided to exit the calculator business word processorsedit the wang edit wangs first attempt at a word processor was the wang  announced in late  but not available until  the design consisted of the logic of a wang  calculator hooked up to an oemmanufactured ibm selectric typewriter for keying and printing and dual cassette decks for storage harold koplow who had written the microcode for the wang  and its derivative the wang  rewrote the microcode to perform word processing functions instead of number crunching the operator of a wang  typed text on a conventional ibm selectric keyboard when the return key was pressed the line of text was stored on a cassette tape one cassette held roughly  pages of text and could be played back eg the text retrieved by printing the contents on continuousform paper in the  typewriters print mode the stored text could also be edited using keys on a simple sixkey array basic editing functions included insert delete skip character line and so on the labor and cost savings of this device were immediate and remarkable pages of text no longer had to be retyped to correct simple errors and projects could be worked on stored and then retrieved for use later on the rudimentary wang  machine was the precursor of the wang office information system ois which revolutionized the way typing projects were performed in the american workplace wang oisedit following the wang  harold koplow and david moros made another attempt at designing a word processor they started by first writing the users manual for the product a  boston globe article refers to koplow as a wisecracking rebel who was waiting for dismissal when in  he developed the product that made computers popularly accessible in koplows words dr wang kicked me out of marketing i along with dave moros was relegated to long range planning — lrped this  was tantamount to being fired here is a temporary job until you find another one in some other company although he and moros were told to design a word processing machine they were given no resourcescitation needed they perceived the assignment as busywork they went ahead anyway wrote the manual and convinced an wang to turn it into a real project the word processing machine – the wang  wps – was introduced in june  and was an instant success as was its successor the  wang ois office information system these products were technological breakthroughs they were multiuser systems each workstation looked like a typical terminal but contained its own intel  microprocessor later versions used a z and  kb of ram comparable but lower in power than the original ibm pc which came out in  disk storage was centralized in a master unit and shared by the workstations and connection was via highspeed dual coaxial cable  link multiple ois masters could be networked to each other allowing file sharing among hundreds of users the systems were userfriendly and fairly easy to administer with the latter task often performed by office personnel in an era when most machines required trained administrators early computer modelsedit wang edit on its journey from calculators and word processing to serious data processing wang developed and marketed several lines of small computer system some of which were wordprocessingbased and some of which were dataprocessingbased instead of a clear linear progression the product lines overlapped and in some cases borrowed technology from each other the most identifiable wang minicomputer performing recognizable data processing was the wang  which appeared in may  unlike some other desktop computers such as the hp  it had a crt in a cabinet that also included an integrated computer controlled cassette tape storage unit and keyboard microcoded to run interpretive basic about  systems were shipped in its lifetime and it found wide use in small and mediumsize businesses worldwide the original  was a single user system the improved vp model increased performance more than tenfold and enhanced the language renamed basic the  vp evolved into a desktop computer and larger mvp system to support up to  workstations and utilized commercial disk technologies that appeared in the late s and early s the disk subsystems could be attached to up to  computers giving a theoretical upper limit of  workstations in a single cluster unlike the other product lines such as the vs and ois both described below wang aggressively used value added resellers vars to customize and market  systems one such creative solution deployed dozens of  systems and was developed in conjunction with hawaii and hong kongbased firm algorithms inc it provided paging beeper services for much of the hong kong market in the early s overshadowed by the wang vs the  languished as a costeffective but forgotten solution in the hands of the customers who had it in the late s wang revisited the  series one last time offering  customers a new  cs with bundled maintenance for less than customers were then paying just for maintenance of their aging s the  cs was accompanied by an intel  processor updated disk units and other peripherals most  customers upgraded to the  cs after which wang never again developed or marketed any new  products in  wang reported having about two hundred  systems still under maintenance around the world throughout wang had always offered maintenance services for the  the  basic language was ported to be compiled and run on nonwang hardware and operating systems by at least two companies niakwa inc created a product named npl originally named basicc kerridge computer now a part of adp created a product named kcml both products support dos windows and various unix systems the basic language has been substantially enhanced and extended by both companies to meet modern needs compared to the  wang hardware the compiled solutions improve all factors speed disk space memory user limits by tens to hundreds of times so while wang support for the  is gone many software applications continue to function during the s about  wang t computers were shipped to the ussr due to the afghan war in the s us and cocom export restrictions ended the shipment of wang computers the soviets were in great need of computers in  russian engineers at minpribors schetmash factory in kursk reverse engineered the wang t and created a computer they named the iskra  the cocom restrictions theory though while popular in the west is challenged by some russian computer historians on the basis of the fact that development for the iskra started in  two years before the afghan war one possible reason for this might be a soviet fear of the backdoors in the western hardware it is also significantly different from the wang  in its internals being more inspired by it rather than a direct clone it used the same basic language named tbasic with a few enhancements many research papers reference calculations done on the iskra  the computer won a  state prize later a somewhat scaleddown unix implementation was created for iskra which was widely used in the soviet union but is virtually unknown in the west wang oisedit the wang ois office information system was heavily wp oriented and featured wangs glossary function a glossary was a word processing document that was attached to a workstation which contained shortcuts to frequently typed phrases for example an operator in a law firm could insert the phrase united states constitution into a glossary document and then recall the phrase into a word processing document by pressing the gl key and the letter u thus saving numerous repetitive keystrokes a superset of glossary called decision processing was a system of programming that fitted into the wp model and was designed to be easy to master a simple ifthen program with subroutines could be constructed to perform tedious editing routines and then run on a word processing document while the operator performed other tasks the design goal of glossary and decision processing was that secretaries would be able to use them to extend the functionality of the document management and manipulation provided by the oiscitation needed like the wang  the ois was characterized by evolution into a user system the ois and the vs overlapped features such as dualcoax connections to workstations and printers were common to both system families buried deep in the vs microcode are entire pieces of ois code probably because wp did not figure into the original design of the vs but was added latercitation needed wang also had a line called alliance which was based on the high end ois  hardware architecture it had more powerful software compared to the ois word processing and list processing packages the system was tempest certified leading to global deployment in american embassies after the iran hostage crisis the most significant enhancementcitation needed was in the indexing capabilities of the alliance system documents could be indexed by every word contained in them the database product visual memory permitted every word in each field to be indexed in addition to the advanced indexing features the alliance word processor was also substantially enhancedcitation needed even though the z platform on which it ran forced it to remain as an bit application in a  kb workstation the wang vs computer lineedit the first wang vs computer was introduced in  about the same time as digital equipment corporations vax and continues to be in use  years later its instruction set was compatible with the ibm  series but it did not run any ibm  system software the vs operating system and all system software were built from the ground up to support interactive users as well as batch operations the vs was aimed directly at the business data processing market in general and ibm in particular while many programming languages were available the vs was typically programmed in cobol other languages supported in the vs integrated development environment included assembler cobol  cobol  basic ada rpg ii c pli fortran glossary mabasic speed ii and procedure a scripting language pascal was also supported for io coprocessor development the wang pace professional application creation environment gl and database was used from the mids onward by customers and third party developers to build complex applications sometimes involving many thousands of screens hundreds of distinct application modules and serving many hundreds of users substantial vertical applications were developed for the wang vs by third party software houses throughout the s in cobol pace basic pli and rpg ii the wang office family of applications and wang wp were both popular applications on the vs word processing ran on the vs through services that emulated the ois environment and downloaded the wp software as microcode in wang terminology to vs workstations the press and the industry referred to the class of machines made by wang including the vs as minicomputers and kenneys  book refers to the vs line as minicomputers throughout although some argue that the highend vses and their successors should qualify as mainframes wang avoided this term in his autobiography an wang rather than calling the vs  a mainframe said that it verges on mainframe performance he went on to draw distinction between the mainframes at the high end of ibms line just as detroit would rather sell large cars  so ibm would rather sell mainframes—in which ibm had a virtual monopoly—with the midsized systems in which ibm had not achieved dominance the minicomputer market is still healthy this is good for the customer and good for minicomputer makers wang laboratories positioned the vs line as minicomputers and reflected this in its marketing collateral and press releasescitation needed later models the small vs series launched in approximately  were userinstallable the smallest being physically similar in size to pcs of the era the largest supported an increasingly substantial number of users going after ibmedit an wang felt a personal sense of rivalry with ibm partly as a result of heavyhanded treatment by ibm in  over the rights to his magneticcore patents this encounter formed the subject of a long chapter in wangs own book lessons according to charles c kenney jack connors remembers being in wangs office one day when the doctor pulled out a chart on which he had plotted wangs growth and projected that wang laboratories would overtake ibm sometime in the middle of the s he had kept it a long time says connors and he believed it wang was one of the first computer companies to advertise on television and the first to run an ad during the super bowl in  their first ad literally cast wang laboratories as david and ibm as goliath several years before the famous  apple computer ad a later ad depicted wang laboratories as a helicopter gunship taking aim at ibm wang wanted to compete against ibm as a computer company selling directly to management information system departments before the vs however wang laboratories was not taken seriously as a computer company the calculators word processing systems and ois were sold into individual departments bypassing the corporate dataprocessing decisionmakers the chapter in wangs book dealing with them shows that he saw them only as a beachhead in the fortune  the wang vs was wangs entrée into it departments in his book an wang notes that to sell the vs we aggressively recruited salesmen with strong backgrounds in data processing  who had experience dealing with mis executives and who knew their way around fortune  companies as the vs took hold the word processor and ois lines were phased out the word processing software continued in the form of a loadablemicrocode environment that allowed vs workstations to take on the behavior of traditional wang wp terminals to operate with the vs and use it as a document server wang made inroads into ibm and dec markets in the s but did not have a serious impact on ibms mainframe market due to selflimiting factors even though an wang wanted to compete with ibm too many wang salespeople were incompletely trained on the significant dp capabilities of the vs in many instances the vs ran smaller enterprises up to about  millionyear and in larger organizations found use as a gateway to larger corporate mainframes handling workstation passthrough and massive print services at exxon corporation for instance  topoftheline vss at the houston headquarters were used in the s and into the s to receive mainframe reports and make them viewable online by executives at mellon mortgage  vs systems from the smallest to the largest were used as the enterprise mortgage origination servicing finance documentation and hedge system and also for mainframe gateway services for logon and printing between mellon mortgage and parent mellon bank their network contained  vs systems and the bank portion of the network supported about  wang office users for email report distribution and scheduling at kent and ktec electronics two related houston companies separate vs clusters were the enterprise systems handling distribution manufacturing and accounting with significant edi capability for receiving customer forecasts sending invoices and sending purchase orders and receiving shipping notifications both systems ran the geisco edi package kent which grew to  millionyear ran the arcus distribution software in cobol and ktec which grew to  millionyear ran the caelus mrp system for manufacturing in basic the highwater mark of the vs in the marketplace was probably about  systems operating worldwide at one time in the midtolate s serving at least several million desktop userscitation needed aggressive marketingedit in the late s a british television documentary accused the company of targeting a competitor canadian company aes wordplex in an attempt to take it out of the market however the documentary came to no conclusion regarding this wangs approach was called internally the gas cooker program named after similar programs to give discounts on new gas stoves by trading in an old one wang was accused of targeting wordplex by offering a large discount on wang ois systems with a tradein of wordplex machines regardless of the age or condition of the tradein machine based on its good reputation with users and its program of aggressive discounts wang gained an increasing share of a shrinking market wordplex was subsequently taken over by norsk data word processing market collapseedit the market for standalone word processing systems collapsed with the introduction of the personal computer multimate on the ibm pc replicated the interface and functions of the wang word processor and several other wysiwyg word processing programs also became popular wang did make one last play in this arena producing a dedicated intelbased word processor called the wang office assistant but by the time it appeared the pc with its flexibility of combining word processors with other programs such as spreadsheets had rendered such a specific task machine largely unsellable the digital voice exchangeedit the wang dvx was one of the first integrated switchboard and voicemail systems in the united kingdom it was selected for the dti office automation pilot schemes at the national coal board in about  lawrence e bergeron was instrumental in managing the voice engineering department at wang labscitation needed he promoted the purchase of a vax for realtime signal processing research and created the peripheral signal processor board psp the psp was placed into  racks to handle  phone lines for the dvx digital voice exchange voice prompts were created by a hired voice specialist to give a melodic presentation for the dvx to avoid false triggering of touchtones by the prompts due to inputoutput cross talk notch filters were created to remove the touch tone frequencies from the prompts some of the prompt languages supported were german spanish french british english american english and portuguese internal research on speech recognition was carried out and implemented for discrete word recognition but was never released to the field at one point there were  members of the voice engineering department this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it may  pcs and pc based productsedit despite the release of the  pcs personal computer system and  pcsii models as early as  the history of computing regards the earliest pc as one which contained a microprocessor which the  pcs did not however the selfcontained pcsii incorporated many of the innovations that would later be seen in pcs including the first  inch floppy drives that were especially designed for the pcsii by shugart associates the original wang pcedit an wang had initially refused to develop an ibmcompatible pc due to his personal dislike of ibm even though his son fred had pitched the idea the original wang pc was released april  to counter the ibm pc which had been released the previous august and which had gained wide acceptance in the market for which wang traditionally positioned the ois system it was based on the intel  microprocessor a slightly faster cpu than the ibm pcs  a hardwaresoftware package that permitted the wang pc to act as a terminal to the ois and vs products was available the hardware component the first version was made of two large addin boards called the wloc wang local office connection contained a z processor and  kb of memory one of the distinguishing features of the wang pc was the system software similar to the wang vs minicomputer the command line was not immediately evident everything could be run from menus including formatting a disk furthermore each item on a menu could be explained by hitting a dedicated help key on the keyboard this software was later sold in msdos compatible form for non wang hardware the wang word processing software was also very graphical the keyboard had  functionkeys and unlike wordstar the popular word processor of the day control key combinations were not required to navigate the system the fkeys had the word processing functions labeled on them however the biggest stumbling block was that – despite being a fully compliant msdos system – it was not compatible with the ibm pc at the hardware level this was a problem because msdos was rarely used as anything more than a simple program loader complex software spreadsheets flight simulator etc could only obtain acceptable performance by direct manipulation of the hardware wang used a bit data bus instead of the bit data bus used by ibm arguing that applications would run much faster since most operations required io disk screen keyboard printer with this bit design wang used peripheral hardware devices such as the wang pc display adapter that were not compatible with their counterparts in the ibm pc line this meant that the vast library of software available for the ibm pc could not be directly run on the wang pc only those programs that were either written specifically for the wang pc or ported from the ibm pc were available a basic word processing package developed by wang and microsofts multiplan spreadsheet were the two commonly marketed software products lotus  and dbase ii were also available this dearth of application software led to the early demise of the original wang pc and it was replaced by an intel  based product that was fully plug compatible with the ibm pc the unique system software was available at extra cost most wang pcs were released with a monochrome graphics adapter that supported a single video mode with text and graphics planes that could be scrolled independently unlike ibmcompatible pcs of the time which required selecting a specific video mode to allow graphics a color graphics adapter and wangbranded color monitor were also available an ergonomic feature of the wang pc was the monitor arm that clamped to the desk and held the monitor above and a system clamp that attached to the side of the desk and held the rather large computer box by using these there was nothing on the desktop

and removed july  learn how and when to remove this template message after it became clear that it had been a mistake to ignore the issue of pc compatibility wang belatedly released an emulation board for wang pc that enabled operation of many pc compatible software packages the board accomplished this by monitoring all io and memory transactions visible in those days before northsouth bridge chips to any board plugged into a slot on the expansion bus and generating a nonmaskable interrupt nmi whenever an operation was deemed to involve an incompatible device requiring emulation for example the floppy controller circuitry on the wang pc was similar to that of the ibm pc but involved enough design differences that pc compatible software attempting to manipulate it directly would fail wangs pc emulation hardware would detect io and memory operations involving the addresses associated with the floppy controller in the ibm pc and generate an nmi the nmi handler would immediately be activated the exception vector having been appropriated during system init to point to rom routines on the emulation board instead of the nmi routine in the pc bios and would then update an internal representation of the ibm pc floppy controller and manipulate the real controller to reflect its state reads were satisfied in a similar way by forcing an nmi decoding the machine code indicated by the instruction pointer at the time of the fault and then obtaining the desired info and updating the cpu registers accordingly before resuming the executing program the pc emulation board thus enabled execution of an impressive number of applications by presenting virtualized pc compatible hardware devices to them a monochrome textonly video controller a floppy controller uarts dma controller parallel port keyboard controller etc ibmpc emulation on the based wang pc was working fairly reliably when ibm released their based pcat wangs answer was the based wang apc advanced professional computer which not only perpetuated the pc incompatibility at the hardware level but revealed an unexpected wrinkle in the hitherto successful pc emulation strategy the  decoded and executed instructions onthefly and was therefore able to respond to nmi on every instruction boundary but the  decoded and queued instructions in a pipeline whose depth varied with each cpumask stepping but which always prevented timely nmi execution wangs engineers came up with and later patented a rather devious instructionprefetch monitor that managed to cope with that challenge at the expense of a modest performance penalty further iterations of the pc line were released commencing with the model number pc these later models booted directly into msdos or another compatible operating system and supported isastandard expansion cards this pc still wasnt entirely ibm pc standard as the keyboard although being a standard pcat device allowed for vs compatibility with  function keys rather than the normal  and a number of wang vs specific keys there was also a slight difference in cpu interrupts from ibm standard so some software had compatibility issues vs connectivity was via an isa based vsterminal card or via lightspeed the networked vs terminal emulator over an ipxbased ethernet connection originally the pc came with a wang specific hercules graphics card and compatible screen which also acted as a keyboard extension meaning the base unit could be kept some distance from the screen this was later replaced with an ega card and screen around  wang released the pc and pc which were intel  based clocked at  mhz and  mhz respectively they used the same vs compatible keyboard as the pc they had a maximum of  megabytes of ram and came with vga screens as standard they were generally supplied with msdos and windows  the  had an interestingaccording to whom bug where occasionally the machine would just freeze entirely and not even boot up if turned off and on at the mains although it would power on the bios just didnt start the solution was to turn on the machine at the mains and hold down the power button for  seconds at which point it would normally start it was suggestedby whom that this was due to an undervalued capacitor in the power circuit this problem appeared to be resolved in the  which had a different psu in  wang marketed a pccompatible based on the intel sx processor which they called the alliance cd it was clocked at  mhz and had a socket for an  math coprocessor it came with  megabytes of installed ram and was expandable to  megabytes using simm memory cards a wang invention that became an industry standard it had a  megabyte floppy disk drive an internal  megabyte hard disk and a cdrom drive five expansion slots were builtin it came with msdos and windows  operating systems in  wang released the slimline alliance cd  based pc in the united kingdom these machines used standard pcat keyboards and were entirely ibm compatible shipping with msdos  and windows  as standard the only unusual feature was that system bios settings and the realtime clock were maintained by four standard aa batteries as opposed to a more typical solution – such as a specialty battery pack or lithium battery while originally offered with a  mhz dx the cd could be upgraded to later socket  processors such as the dx through the use of third party cpu upgrade adapters or interposers this allowed upgrading to speeds beyond  mhz without overclocking or alternatively the potential for speeds in excess of  mhz with overclocking dependent on the processor used wang freestyleedit wang freestyle was a  product consisting of a tablet and stylus for written annotation of any file that could be displayed on the pc a phone handset for voice annotation but not voice communication demonstrated strongly in conjunction with the tablet for explaining the text annotations email via wang office of the resulting document set the product was not a success in anything except marketing terms a description of the system at the university of southern california usc shows the symptoms of the failure the  million usc system includes a vs  midrange computer  image workstations  with freestyle capabilities a laser printer five endorsers and five document scanners initial storage for document images is eight gigabytes of magnetic disk storage only  of the stations were freestyle stations the system was so costly even in the context of a wang integrated imaging system that freestyle was only affordable for highly specialized or very senior staff apart from usc unusual in that it was deployed at clerical level it was sold as a clevel tool for c grades to communicate with other c grades this reduced the marketplace immediately from the mass market where the system would have been effective decline and falledit former wang headquarters in lowell massachusetts the building is now called cross point and is anchored by motorola the horizontal windows at the top of the middle tower housed the executive offices including an wangs wang labs would be only one of a large number of new englandbased computer companies that would falter in the late s and s marking the end of the massachusetts miracle for instance the struggling digital equipment corporation also significantly downsized in the s and was acquired by compaq a common view within the pc community is that wang labs failed because it specialized in computers designed specifically for word processing and did not foresee and was unable to compete against generalpurpose personal computers with word processing software in the s word processing was not actually the mainstay of wangs business by the time desktop computers began to gain in popularity although wang manufactured desktops its main business by the s was its vs line of minicomputer and midframe systems the market for these minicomputers was ultimately conquered by enhanced microcomputers like the apple macintosh and the wintel pc on one end and sun ibm and hewlettpackard servers on the other end an wangs insistence that his son fred wang succeed him contributed to the companys failure fred wang was a business school graduate but by almost any definition wrote charles c kenney unsuited for the job in which his father had placed him his assignment first as head of research and development then as president of the company led to resignations by key rd and business personnel amid declining revenues john f cunningham an year employee of the firm resigned as president and coo of wang labs to become chairman and chief executive of computer consoles inc cunningham resigned due to disagreement with an wang on how to pull the company out of the slump as well as being upset that fred wang was positioned as the successor an instance of nepotism one turning point occurred when fred wang was head of rd on october   wang laboratories announced fourteen major hardware and software products and promised dates of delivery the announcement was well received but even at the time there were warning signs according to datamation wang announced everything but the kitchen sink and if you could attach the kitchen sink to a personal computer they would announce that too very few of the products were close to completion and many of them had not even been started all were delivered late and some were never delivered at all in retrospect this was referred to as the vaporware announcement and it hurt the credibility of fred wang and wang laboratories in  fred wang then  years old was installed as president of wang laboratories however the companys fortunes continued to decline unlike most computer companies that funded their growth by issuing stock an wang had used debt to avoid further dilution of family control of the company by august  that debt was causing conflicts with its creditors on august   an wang fired his son richard w miller replaced him as the president of wang laboratories having been with the company since  miller announced in december  that the company would start to embrace established software standards rather than use traditional proprietary designs an wang died in march  and miller took on the additional posts of chairman and ceo the company underwent massive restructuring and in august  it eliminated its bank debt but still ended the year with a record net loss in november  wang announced their first personal computers running unix previously wangs presence in the unix and open systems markets had been modest in  wang developed a new typesetting system in conjunction with arlington mabased texet corp the system used xerox printers and unix workstations from sun but the product vanished before coming to market partially because few wang employees could use or support unix unix ran on the vs – interactive systems first ported inix their ibm version of sys unix to run in a vsos virtual machine circa  and then wang engineers completed the port so that it ran native on the vs hardware soon thereafter – but performance was always subpar as unix was never a good fit for the inherently batchmode nature of the vs hardware and the lineatatime processing approach taken by the vs workstations indeed the workstation code had to be largely rewritten to bundle up each keystroke into a frame to be sent back to the host when running unix so that tty style processing could be implemented pace which offered its data dictionary excellent referential integrity and speedy application development was in the process of being ported to unix under the name open pace a client server rdbms model built on the original products ideology open pace was demonstrated at the north american pace user group conferences in both boston and chicago open pace along with a new windowsbased word processor called upword which was at the time considered a strong contender to retake wangs original market leadership from microsoft were touted as their new direction however after a marketing study suggested that it would require large capital investments in order to be viable competitors against microsoft both products were simply abandoned ira magaziner who was brought in by miller in  proposed to take wang out of the manufacture of computers altogether and to go big into imaging software instead in march  the company introduced its office  marketing strategy focusing on office productivity in june  wang started reselling ibm computers in exchange for ibm investing in wang stock wang hardware strategy to resell ibm rss also included further pursuit of unix software in august  wang won a suit against nec and toshiba claiming violation of wangs patents on single inline memory modules simms the company still recorded a net loss for the  fiscal year wang laboratories filed for bankruptcy protection on august   final yearsedit wang labs emerged from bankruptcy on september   as part of its bankruptcy reorganization the companys iconic headquarters wang towers in lowell was sold at auction the complex which originally cost  million to build and housed  workers in over a million square feet  m of office space was sold in  for  the renovated complex which is now known as cross point was subsequently sold in  to a joint venture of yale properties and blackstone real estate advisors for a price reported to be over  million the company emerged from bankruptcy with  million in hand and embarked on a course of acquisition and selfreinvention eschewing its former role as an innovative designer and manufacturer of computer and related systems later in the s and under the guidance of then ceo joe tucci with the acquisition of the olsy division of olivetti the company changed its name to wang global by then wang had settled on network services as its chosen business the most advanced vs system capable of supporting over  users – the vs model  – was released in  and smaller models based on the same cpu chip were released in  – the vs and the vs these were the last vsbased hardware systemscitation needed kodak acquired the wang software arm in  strengthening its

c were used to ensure that brokerages would fill any wang stock orders with class b shares unless class c was specifically requested wang stock had been listed in the new york stock exchange but this

adding logarithms and roundoff in the display conversion was noticeable  times  yielded  from  to about  wang was a wellregarded calculator company wang calculators cost in the midfourfigures used nixie tube readouts performed transcendental functions had varying degrees of programmability and exploited magnetic core memory the  and  calculator models were available as timeshared simultaneous se packages that had a central processing unit the size of a small suitcase connected by cables leading to four individual desktop displaykeyboard units competition included hp which introduced the hp a in  and oldline calculator companies such as monroe and marchant wang calculators were at first sold to scientists and engineers but the company later won a solid niche in financialservices industries which had previously relied on complicated printed tables for mortgages and annuities one perhaps apocryphal story tells of a banker who spotchecked a wang calculator against a mortgage table and found a discrepancy the calculator was right the printed tables were wrong and the companys reputation was made in the early seventies wang believed that calculators would become unprofitable lowmargin commodities and decided to exit the calculator business word processorsedit the wang edit wangs first attempt at a word processor was the wang  announced in late  but not available until  the design consisted of the logic of a wang  calculator hooked up to an oemmanufactured ibm selectric typewriter for keying and printing and dual cassette decks for storage harold koplow who had written the microcode for the wang  and its derivative the wang  rewrote the microcode to perform word processing functions instead of number crunching the operator of a wang  typed text on a conventional ibm selectric keyboard when the return key was pressed the line of text was stored on a cassette tape one cassette held roughly  pages of text and could be played back eg the text retrieved by printing the contents on continuousform paper in the  typewriters print mode the stored text could also be edited using keys on a simple sixkey array basic editing functions included insert delete skip character line and so on the labor and cost savings of this device were immediate and remarkable pages of text no longer had to be retyped to correct simple errors and projects could be worked on stored and then retrieved for use later on the rudimentary wang  machine was the precursor of the wang office information system ois which revolutionized the way typing projects were performed in the american workplace wang oisedit following the wang  harold koplow and david moros made another attempt at designing a word processor they started by first writing the users manual for the product a  boston globe article refers to koplow as a wisecracking rebel who was waiting for dismissal when in  he developed the product that made computers popularly accessible in koplows words dr wang kicked me out of marketing i along with dave moros was relegated to long range planning — lrped this  was tantamount to being fired here is a temporary job until you find another one in some other company although he and moros were told to design a word processing machine they were given no resourcescitation needed they perceived the assignment as busywork they went ahead anyway wrote the manual and convinced an wang to turn it into a real project the word processing machine – the wang  wps – was introduced in june  and was an instant success as was its successor the  wang ois office information system these products were technological breakthroughs they were multiuser systems each workstation looked like a typical terminal but contained its own intel  microprocessor later versions used a z and  kb of ram comparable but lower in power than the original ibm pc which came out in  disk storage was centralized in a master unit and shared by the workstations and connection was via highspeed dual coaxial cable  link multiple ois masters could be networked to each other allowing file sharing among hundreds of users the systems were userfriendly and fairly easy to administer with the latter task often performed by office personnel in an era when most machines required trained administrators early computer modelsedit wang edit on its journey from calculators and word processing to serious data processing wang developed and marketed several lines of small computer system some of which were wordprocessingbased and some of which were dataprocessingbased instead of a clear linear progression the product lines overlapped and in some cases borrowed technology from each other the most identifiable wang minicomputer performing recognizable data processing was the wang  which appeared in may  unlike some other desktop computers such as the hp  it had a crt in a cabinet that also included an integrated computer controlled cassette tape storage unit and keyboard microcoded to run interpretive basic about  systems were shipped in its lifetime and it found wide use in small and mediumsize businesses worldwide the original  was a single user system the improved vp model increased performance more than tenfold and enhanced the language renamed basic the  vp evolved into a desktop computer and larger mvp system to support up to  workstations and utilized commercial disk technologies that appeared in the late s and early s the disk subsystems could be attached to up to  computers giving a theoretical upper limit of  workstations in a single cluster unlike the other product lines such as the vs and ois both described below wang aggressively used value added resellers vars to customize and market  systems one such creative solution deployed dozens of  systems and was developed in conjunction with hawaii and hong kongbased firm algorithms inc it provided paging beeper services for much of the hong kong market in the early s overshadowed by the wang vs the  languished as a costeffective but forgotten solution in the hands of the customers who had it in the late s wang revisited the  series one last time offering  customers a new  cs with bundled maintenance for less than customers were then paying just for maintenance of their aging s the  cs was accompanied by an intel  processor updated disk units and other peripherals most  customers upgraded to the  cs after which wang never again developed or marketed any new  products in  wang reported having about two hundred  systems still under maintenance around the world throughout wang had always offered maintenance services for the  the  basic language was ported to be compiled and run on nonwang hardware and operating systems by at least two companies niakwa inc created a product named npl originally named basicc kerridge computer now a part of adp created a product named kcml both products support dos windows and various unix systems the basic language has been substantially enhanced and extended by both companies to meet modern needs compared to the  wang hardware the compiled solutions improve all factors speed disk space memory user limits by tens to hundreds of times so while wang support for the  is gone many software applications continue to function during the s about  wang t computers were shipped to the ussr due to the afghan war in the s us and cocom export restrictions ended the shipment of wang computers the soviets were in great need of computers in  russian engineers at minpribors schetmash factory in kursk reverse engineered the wang t and created a computer they named the iskra  the cocom restrictions theory though while popular in the west is challenged by some russian computer historians on the basis of the fact that development for the iskra started in  two years before the afghan war one possible reason for this might be a soviet fear of the backdoors in the western hardware it is also significantly different from the wang  in its internals being more inspired by it rather than a direct clone it used the same basic language named tbasic with a few enhancements many research papers reference calculations done on the iskra  the computer won a  state prize later a somewhat scaleddown unix implementation was created for iskra which was widely used in the soviet union but is virtually unknown in the west wang oisedit the wang ois office information system was heavily wp oriented and featured wangs glossary function a glossary was a word processing document that was attached to a workstation which contained shortcuts to frequently typed phrases for example an operator in a law firm could insert the phrase united states constitution into a glossary document and then recall the phrase into a word processing document by pressing the gl key and the letter u thus saving numerous repetitive keystrokes a superset of glossary called decision processing was a system of programming that fitted into the wp model and was designed to be easy to master a simple ifthen program with subroutines could be constructed to perform tedious editing routines and then run on a word processing document while the operator performed other tasks the design goal of glossary and decision processing was that secretaries would be able to use them to extend the functionality of the document management and manipulation provided by the oiscitation needed like the wang  the ois was characterized by evolution into a user system the ois and the vs overlapped features such as dualcoax connections to workstations and printers were common to both system families buried deep in the vs microcode are entire pieces of ois code probably because wp did not figure into the original design of the vs but was added latercitation needed wang also had a line called alliance which was based on the high end ois  hardware architecture it had more powerful software compared to the ois word processing and list processing packages the system was tempest certified leading to global deployment in american embassies after the iran hostage crisis the most significant enhancementcitation needed was in the indexing capabilities of the alliance system documents could be indexed by every word contained in them the database product visual memory permitted every word in each field to be indexed in addition to the advanced indexing features the alliance word processor was also substantially enhancedcitation needed even though the z platform on which it ran forced it to remain as an bit application in a  kb workstation the wang vs computer lineedit the first wang vs computer was introduced in  about the same time as digital equipment corporations vax and continues to be in use  years later its instruction set was compatible with the ibm  series but it did not run any ibm  system software the vs operating system and all system software were built from the ground up to support interactive users as well as batch operations the vs was aimed directly at the business data processing market in general and ibm in particular while many programming languages were available the vs was typically programmed in cobol other languages supported in the vs integrated development environment included assembler cobol  cobol  basic ada rpg ii c pli fortran glossary mabasic speed ii and procedure a scripting language pascal was also supported for io coprocessor development the wang pace professional application creation environment gl and database was used from the mids onward by customers and third party developers to build complex applications sometimes involving many thousands of screens hundreds of distinct application modules and serving many hundreds of users substantial vertical applications were developed for the wang vs by third party software houses throughout the s in cobol pace basic pli and rpg ii the wang office family of applications and wang wp were both popular applications on the vs word processing ran on the vs through services that emulated the ois environment and downloaded the wp software as microcode in wang terminology to vs workstations the press and the industry referred to the class of machines made by wang including the vs as minicomputers and kenneys  book refers to the vs line as minicomputers throughout although some argue that the highend vses and their successors should qualify as mainframes wang avoided this term in his autobiography an wang rather than calling the vs  a mainframe said that it verges on mainframe performance he went on to draw distinction between the mainframes at the high end of ibms line just as detroit would rather sell large cars  so ibm would rather sell mainframes—in which ibm had a virtual monopoly—with the midsized systems in which ibm had not achieved dominance the minicomputer market is still healthy this is good for the customer and good for minicomputer makers wang laboratories positioned the vs line as minicomputers and reflected this in its marketing collateral and press releasescitation needed later models the small vs series launched in approximately  were userinstallable the smallest being physically similar in size to pcs of the era the largest supported an increasingly substantial number of users going after ibmedit an wang felt a personal sense of rivalry with ibm partly as a result of heavyhanded treatment by ibm in  over the rights to his magneticcore patents this encounter formed the subject of a long chapter in wangs own book lessons according to charles c kenney jack connors remembers being in wangs office one day when the doctor pulled out a chart on which he had plotted wangs growth and projected that wang laboratories would overtake ibm sometime in the middle of the s he had kept it a long time says connors and he believed it wang was one of the first computer companies to advertise on television and the first to run an ad during the super bowl in  their first ad literally cast wang laboratories as david and ibm as goliath several years before the famous  apple computer ad a later ad depicted wang laboratories as a helicopter gunship taking aim at ibm wang wanted to compete against ibm as a computer company selling directly to management information system departments before the vs however wang laboratories was not taken seriously as a computer company the calculators word processing systems and ois were sold into individual departments bypassing the corporate dataprocessing decisionmakers the chapter in wangs book dealing with them shows that he saw them only as a beachhead in the fortune  the wang vs was wangs entrée into it departments in his book an wang notes that to sell the vs we aggressively recruited salesmen with strong backgrounds in data processing  who had experience dealing with mis executives and who knew their way around fortune  companies as the vs took hold the word processor and ois lines were phased out the word processing software continued in the form of a loadablemicrocode environment that allowed vs workstations to take on the behavior of traditional wang wp terminals to operate with the vs and use it as a document server wang made inroads into ibm and dec markets in the s but did not have a serious impact on ibms mainframe market due to selflimiting factors even though an wang wanted to compete with ibm too many wang salespeople were incompletely trained on the significant dp capabilities of the vs in many instances the vs ran smaller enterprises up to about  millionyear and in larger organizations found use as a gateway to larger corporate mainframes handling workstation passthrough and massive print services at exxon corporation for instance  topoftheline vss at the houston headquarters were used in the s and into the s to receive mainframe reports and make them viewable online by executives at mellon mortgage  vs systems from the smallest to the largest were used as the enterprise mortgage origination servicing finance documentation and hedge system and also for mainframe gateway services for logon and printing between mellon mortgage and parent mellon bank their network contained  vs systems and the bank portion of the network supported about  wang office users for email report distribution and scheduling at kent and ktec electronics two related houston companies separate vs clusters were the enterprise systems handling distribution manufacturing and accounting with significant edi capability for receiving customer forecasts sending invoices and sending purchase orders and receiving shipping notifications both systems ran the geisco edi package kent which grew to  millionyear ran the arcus distribution software in cobol and ktec which grew to  millionyear ran the caelus mrp system for manufacturing in basic the highwater mark of the vs in the marketplace was probably about  systems operating worldwide at one time in the midtolate s serving at least several million desktop userscitation needed aggressive marketingedit in the late s a british television documentary accused the company of targeting a competitor canadian company aes wordplex in an attempt to take it out of the market however the documentary came to no conclusion regarding this wangs approach was called internally the gas cooker program named after similar programs to give discounts on new gas stoves by trading in an old one wang was accused of targeting wordplex by offering a large discount on wang ois systems with a tradein of wordplex machines regardless of the age or condition of the tradein machine based on its good reputation with users and its program of aggressive discounts wang gained an increasing share of a shrinking market wordplex was subsequently taken over by norsk data word processing market collapseedit the market for standalone word processing systems collapsed with the introduction of the personal computer multimate on the ibm pc replicated the interface and functions of the wang word processor and several other wysiwyg word processing programs also became popular wang did make one last play in this arena producing a dedicated intelbased word processor called the wang office assistant but by the time it appeared the pc with its flexibility of combining word processors with other programs such as spreadsheets had rendered such a specific task machine largely unsellable the digital voice exchangeedit the wang dvx was one of the first integrated switchboard and voicemail systems in the united kingdom it was selected for the dti office automation pilot schemes at the national coal board in about  lawrence e bergeron was instrumental in managing the voice engineering department at wang labscitation needed he promoted the purchase of a vax for realtime signal processing research and created the peripheral signal processor board psp the psp was placed into  racks to handle  phone lines for the dvx digital voice exchange voice prompts were created by a hired voice specialist to give a melodic presentation for the dvx to avoid false triggering of touchtones by the prompts due to inputoutput cross talk notch filters were created to remove the touch tone frequencies from the prompts some of the prompt languages supported were german spanish french british english american english and portuguese internal research on speech recognition was carried out and implemented for discrete word recognition but was never released to the field at one point there were  members of the voice engineering department this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it may  pcs and pc based productsedit despite the release of the  pcs personal computer system and  pcsii models as early as  the history of computing regards the earliest pc as one which contained a microprocessor which the  pcs did not however the selfcontained pcsii incorporated many of the innovations that would later be seen in pcs including the first  inch floppy drives that were especially designed for the pcsii by shugart associates the original wang pcedit an wang had initially refused to develop an ibmcompatible pc due to his personal dislike of ibm even though his son fred had pitched the idea the original wang pc was released april  to counter the ibm pc which had been released the previous august and which had gained wide acceptance in the market for which wang traditionally positioned the ois system it was based on the intel  microprocessor a slightly faster cpu than the ibm pcs  a hardwaresoftware package that permitted the wang pc to act as a terminal to the ois and vs products was available the hardware component the first version was made of two large addin boards called the wloc wang local office connection contained a z processor and  kb of memory one of the distinguishing features of the wang pc was the system software similar to the wang vs minicomputer the command line was not immediately evident everything could be run from menus including formatting a disk furthermore each item on a menu could be explained by hitting a dedicated help key on the keyboard this software was later sold in msdos compatible form for non wang hardware the wang word processing software was also very graphical the keyboard had  functionkeys and unlike wordstar the popular word processor of the day control key combinations were not required to navigate the system the fkeys had the word processing functions labeled on them however the biggest stumbling block was that – despite being a fully compliant msdos system – it was not compatible with the ibm pc at the hardware level this was a problem because msdos was rarely used as anything more than a simple program loader complex software spreadsheets flight simulator etc could only obtain acceptable performance by direct manipulation of the hardware wang used a bit data bus instead of the bit data bus used by ibm arguing that applications would run much faster since most operations required io disk screen keyboard printer with this bit design wang used peripheral hardware devices such as the wang pc display adapter that were not compatible with their counterparts in the ibm pc line this meant that the vast library of software available for the ibm pc could not be directly run on the wang pc only those programs that were either written specifically for the wang pc or ported from the ibm pc were available a basic word processing package developed by wang and microsofts multiplan spreadsheet were the two commonly marketed software products lotus  and dbase ii were also available this dearth of application software led to the early demise of the original wang pc and it was replaced by an intel  based product that was fully plug compatible with the ibm pc the unique system software was available at extra cost most wang pcs were released with a monochrome graphics adapter that supported a single video mode with text and graphics planes that could be scrolled independently unlike ibmcompatible pcs of the time which required selecting a specific video mode to allow graphics a color graphics adapter and wangbranded color monitor were also available an ergonomic feature of the wang pc was the monitor arm that clamped to the desk and held the monitor above and a system clamp that attached to the side of the desk and held the rather large computer box by using these there was nothing on the desktop except the keyboard ibm compatible wang pcsedit this

template message after it became clear that it had been a mistake to ignore the issue of pc compatibility wang belatedly released an emulation board for wang pc that enabled operation of many pc compatible software packages the board accomplished this by monitoring all io and memory transactions visible in those days before northsouth bridge chips to any board plugged into a slot on the expansion bus and generating a nonmaskable interrupt nmi whenever an operation was deemed to involve an incompatible device requiring emulation for example the floppy controller circuitry on the wang pc was similar to that of the ibm pc but involved enough design differences that pc compatible software attempting to manipulate it directly would fail wangs pc emulation hardware would detect io and memory operations involving the addresses associated with the floppy controller in the ibm pc and generate an nmi the nmi handler would immediately be activated the exception vector having been appropriated during system init to point to rom routines on the emulation board instead of the nmi routine in the pc bios and would then update an internal representation of the ibm pc floppy controller and manipulate the real controller to reflect its state reads were satisfied in a similar way by forcing an nmi decoding the machine code indicated by the instruction pointer at the time of the fault and then obtaining the desired info and updating the cpu registers accordingly before resuming the executing program the pc emulation board thus enabled execution of an impressive number of applications by presenting virtualized pc compatible hardware devices to them a monochrome textonly video controller a floppy controller uarts dma controller parallel port keyboard controller etc ibmpc emulation on the based wang pc was working fairly reliably when ibm released their based pcat wangs answer was the based wang apc advanced professional computer which not only perpetuated the pc incompatibility at the hardware level but revealed an unexpected wrinkle in the hitherto successful pc emulation strategy the  decoded and executed instructions onthefly and was therefore able to respond to nmi on every instruction boundary but the  decoded and queued instructions in a pipeline whose depth varied with each cpumask stepping but which always prevented timely nmi execution wangs engineers came up with and later patented a rather devious instructionprefetch monitor that managed to cope with that challenge at the expense of a modest performance penalty further iterations of the pc line were released commencing with the model number pc these later models booted directly into msdos or another compatible operating system and supported isastandard expansion cards this pc still wasnt entirely ibm pc standard as the keyboard although being a standard pcat device allowed for vs compatibility with  function keys rather than the normal  and a number of wang vs specific keys there was also a slight difference in cpu interrupts from ibm standard so some software had compatibility issues vs connectivity was via an isa based vsterminal card or via lightspeed the networked vs terminal emulator over an ipxbased ethernet connection originally the pc came with a wang specific hercules graphics card and compatible screen which also acted as a keyboard extension meaning the base unit could be kept some distance from the screen this was later replaced with an ega card and screen around  wang released the pc and pc which were intel  based clocked at  mhz and  mhz respectively they used the same vs compatible keyboard as the pc they had a maximum of  megabytes of ram and came with vga screens as standard they were generally supplied with msdos and windows  the  had an interestingaccording to whom bug where occasionally the machine would just freeze entirely and not even boot up if turned off and on at the mains although it would power on the bios just didnt start the solution was to turn on the machine at the mains and hold down the power button for  seconds at which point it would normally start it was suggestedby whom that this was due to an undervalued capacitor in the power circuit this problem appeared to be resolved in the  which had a different psu in  wang marketed a pccompatible based on the intel sx processor which they called the alliance cd it was clocked at  mhz and had a socket for an  math coprocessor it came with  megabytes of installed ram and was expandable to  megabytes using simm memory cards a wang invention that became an industry standard it had a  megabyte floppy disk drive an internal  megabyte hard disk and a cdrom drive five expansion slots were builtin it came with msdos and windows  operating systems in  wang released the slimline alliance cd  based pc in the united kingdom these machines used standard pcat keyboards and were entirely ibm compatible shipping with msdos  and windows  as standard the only unusual feature was that system bios settings and the realtime clock were maintained by four standard aa batteries as opposed to a more typical solution – such as a specialty battery pack or lithium battery while originally offered with a  mhz dx the cd could be upgraded to later socket  processors such as the dx through the use of third party cpu upgrade adapters or interposers this allowed upgrading to speeds beyond  mhz without overclocking or alternatively the potential for speeds in excess of  mhz with overclocking dependent on the processor used wang freestyleedit wang freestyle was a  product consisting of a tablet and stylus for written annotation of any file that could be displayed on the pc a phone handset for voice annotation but not voice communication demonstrated strongly in conjunction with the tablet for explaining the text annotations email via wang office of the resulting document set the product was not a success in anything except marketing terms a description of the system at the university of southern california usc shows the symptoms of the failure the  million usc system includes a vs  midrange computer  image workstations  with freestyle capabilities a laser printer five endorsers and five document scanners initial storage for document images is eight gigabytes of magnetic disk storage only  of the stations were freestyle stations the system was so costly even in the context of a wang integrated imaging system that freestyle was only affordable for highly specialized or very senior staff apart from usc unusual in that it was deployed at clerical level it was sold as a clevel tool for c grades to communicate with other c grades this reduced the marketplace immediately from the mass market where the system would have been effective decline and falledit former wang headquarters in lowell massachusetts the building is now called cross point and is anchored by motorola the horizontal windows at the top of the middle tower housed the executive offices including an wangs wang labs would be only one of a large number of new englandbased computer companies that would falter in the late s and s marking the end of the massachusetts miracle for instance the struggling digital equipment corporation also significantly downsized in the s and was acquired by compaq a common view within the pc community is that wang labs failed because it specialized in computers designed specifically for word processing and did not foresee and was unable to compete against generalpurpose personal computers with word processing software in the s word processing was not actually the mainstay of wangs business by the time desktop computers began to gain in popularity although wang manufactured desktops its main business by the s was its vs line of minicomputer and midframe systems the market for these minicomputers was ultimately conquered by enhanced microcomputers like the apple macintosh and the wintel pc on one end and sun ibm and hewlettpackard servers on the other end an wangs insistence that his son fred wang succeed him contributed to the companys failure fred wang was a business school graduate but by almost any definition wrote charles c kenney unsuited for the job in which his father had placed him his assignment first as head of research and development then as president of the company led to resignations by key rd and business personnel amid declining revenues john f cunningham an year employee of the firm resigned as president and coo of wang labs to become chairman and chief executive of computer consoles inc cunningham resigned due to disagreement with an wang on how to pull the company out of the slump as well as being upset that fred wang was positioned as the successor an instance of nepotism one turning point occurred when fred wang was head of rd on october   wang laboratories announced fourteen major hardware and software products and promised dates of delivery the announcement was well received but even at the time there were warning signs according to datamation wang announced everything but the kitchen sink and if you could attach the kitchen sink to a personal computer they would announce that too very few of the products were close to completion and many of them had not even been started all were delivered late and some were never delivered at all in retrospect this was referred to as the vaporware announcement and it hurt the credibility of fred wang and wang laboratories in  fred wang then  years old was installed as president of wang laboratories however the companys fortunes continued to decline unlike most computer companies that funded their growth by issuing stock an wang had used debt to avoid further dilution of family control of the company by august  that debt was causing conflicts with its creditors on august   an wang fired his son richard w miller replaced him as the president of wang laboratories having been with the company since  miller announced in december  that the company would start to embrace established software standards rather than use traditional proprietary designs an wang died in march  and miller took on the additional posts of chairman and ceo the company underwent massive restructuring and in august  it eliminated its bank debt but still ended the year with a record net loss in november  wang announced their first personal computers running unix previously wangs presence in the unix and open systems markets had been modest in  wang developed a new typesetting system in conjunction with arlington mabased texet corp the system used xerox printers and unix workstations from sun but the product vanished before coming to market partially because few wang employees could use or support unix unix ran on the vs – interactive systems first ported inix their ibm version of sys unix to run in a vsos virtual machine circa  and then wang engineers completed the port so that it ran native on the vs hardware soon thereafter – but performance was always subpar as unix was never a good fit for the inherently batchmode nature of the vs hardware and the lineatatime processing approach taken by the vs workstations indeed the workstation code had to be largely rewritten to bundle up each keystroke into a frame to be sent back to the host when running unix so that tty style processing could be implemented pace which offered its data dictionary excellent referential integrity and speedy application development was in the process of being ported to unix under the name open pace a client server rdbms model built on the original products ideology open pace was demonstrated at the north american pace user group conferences in both boston and chicago open pace along with a new windowsbased word processor called upword which was at the time considered a strong contender to retake wangs original market leadership from microsoft were touted as their new direction however after a marketing study suggested that it would require large capital investments in order to be viable competitors against microsoft both products were simply abandoned ira magaziner who was brought in by miller in  proposed to take wang out of the manufacture of computers altogether and to go big into imaging software instead in march  the company introduced its office  marketing strategy focusing on office productivity in june  wang started reselling ibm computers in exchange for ibm investing in wang stock wang hardware strategy to resell ibm rss also included further pursuit of unix software in august  wang won a suit against nec and toshiba claiming violation of wangs patents on single inline memory modules simms the company still recorded a net loss for the  fiscal year wang laboratories filed for bankruptcy protection on august   final yearsedit wang labs emerged from bankruptcy on september   as part of its bankruptcy reorganization the companys iconic headquarters wang towers in lowell was sold at auction the complex which originally cost  million to build and housed  workers in over a million square feet  m of office space was sold in  for  the renovated complex which is now known as cross point was subsequently sold in  to a joint venture of yale properties and blackstone real estate advisors for a price reported to be over  million the company emerged from bankruptcy with  million in hand and embarked on a course of acquisition and selfreinvention eschewing its former role as an innovative designer and manufacturer of computer and related systems later in the s and under the guidance of then ceo joe tucci with the acquisition of the olsy division of olivetti the company changed its name to wang global by then wang had settled on network services as its chosen business the most advanced vs system capable of supporting over  users – the vs model  – was released in  and smaller models based on the same cpu chip were released in  – the vs and the vs

four individual desktop displaykeyboard units competition included hp which introduced the hp a in  and oldline calculator companies such as monroe and marchant wang calculators were at first sold to scientists and engineers but the company later won a solid niche in financialservices industries which had previously relied on complicated printed tables for mortgages and annuities one perhaps apocryphal story tells of a banker who spotchecked a wang calculator against a mortgage table and found a discrepancy the calculator was right the printed tables were wrong and the companys reputation was made in the early seventies wang believed that calculators would become unprofitable lowmargin commodities and decided to exit the calculator business word processorsedit the wang edit wangs first attempt at a word processor was the wang  announced in late  but not available until  the design consisted of the logic of a wang  calculator hooked up to an oemmanufactured ibm selectric typewriter for keying and printing and dual cassette decks for storage harold koplow who had written the microcode for the wang  and its derivative the wang  rewrote the microcode to perform word processing functions instead of number crunching the operator of a wang  typed text on a conventional ibm selectric keyboard when the return key was pressed the line of text was stored on a cassette tape one cassette held roughly  pages of text and could be played back eg the text retrieved by printing the contents on continuousform paper in the  typewriters print mode the stored text could also be edited using keys on a simple sixkey array basic editing functions included insert delete skip character line and so on the labor and cost savings of this device were immediate and remarkable pages of text no longer had to be retyped to correct simple errors and projects could be worked on stored and then retrieved for use later on the rudimentary wang  machine was the precursor of the wang office information system ois which revolutionized the way typing projects were performed in the american workplace wang oisedit following the wang  harold koplow and david moros made another attempt at designing a word processor they started by first writing the users manual for the product a  boston globe article refers to koplow as a wisecracking rebel who was waiting for dismissal when in  he developed the product that made computers popularly accessible in koplows words dr wang kicked me out of marketing i along with dave moros was relegated to long range planning — lrped this  was tantamount to being fired here is a temporary job until you find another one in some other company although he and moros were told to design a word processing machine they were given no resourcescitation needed they perceived the assignment as busywork they went ahead anyway wrote the manual and convinced an wang to turn it into a real project the word processing machine – the wang  wps – was introduced in june  and was an instant success as was its successor the  wang ois office information system these products were technological breakthroughs they were multiuser systems each workstation looked like a typical terminal but contained its own intel  microprocessor later versions used a z and  kb of ram comparable but lower in power than the original ibm pc which came out in  disk storage was centralized in a master unit and shared by the workstations and connection was via highspeed dual coaxial cable  link multiple ois masters could be networked to each other allowing file sharing among hundreds of users the systems were userfriendly and fairly easy to administer with the latter task often performed by office personnel in an era when most machines required trained administrators early computer modelsedit wang edit on its journey from calculators and word processing to serious data processing wang developed and marketed several lines of small computer system some of which were wordprocessingbased and some of which were dataprocessingbased instead of a clear linear progression the product lines overlapped and in some cases borrowed technology from each other the most identifiable wang minicomputer performing recognizable data processing was the wang  which appeared in may  unlike some other desktop computers such as the hp  it had a crt in a cabinet that also included an integrated computer controlled cassette tape storage unit and keyboard microcoded to run interpretive basic about  systems were shipped in its lifetime and it found wide use in small and mediumsize businesses worldwide the original  was a single user system the improved vp model increased performance more than tenfold and enhanced the language renamed basic the  vp evolved into a desktop computer and larger mvp system to support up to  workstations and utilized commercial disk technologies that appeared in the late s and early s the disk subsystems could be attached to up to  computers giving a theoretical upper limit of  workstations in a single cluster unlike the other product lines such as the vs and ois both described below wang aggressively used value added resellers vars to customize and market  systems one such creative solution deployed dozens of  systems and was developed in conjunction with hawaii and hong kongbased firm algorithms inc it provided paging beeper services for much of the hong kong market in the early s overshadowed by the wang vs the  languished as a costeffective but forgotten solution in the hands of the customers who had it in the late s wang revisited the  series one last time offering  customers a new  cs with bundled maintenance for less than customers were then paying just for maintenance of their aging s the  cs was accompanied by an intel  processor updated disk units and other peripherals most  customers upgraded to the  cs after which wang never again developed or marketed any new  products in  wang reported having about two hundred  systems still under maintenance around the world throughout wang had always offered maintenance services for the  the  basic language was ported to be compiled and run on nonwang hardware and operating systems by at least two companies niakwa inc created a product named npl originally named basicc kerridge computer now a part of adp created a product named kcml both products support dos windows and various unix systems the basic language has been substantially enhanced and extended by both companies to meet modern needs compared to the  wang hardware the compiled solutions improve all factors speed disk space memory user limits by tens to hundreds of times so while wang support for the  is gone many software applications continue to function during the s about  wang t computers were shipped to the ussr due to the afghan war in the s us and cocom export restrictions ended the shipment of wang computers the soviets were in great need of computers in  russian engineers at minpribors schetmash factory in kursk reverse engineered the wang t and created a computer they named the iskra  the cocom restrictions theory though while popular in the west is challenged by some russian computer historians on the basis of the fact that development for the iskra started in  two years before the afghan war one possible reason for this might be a soviet fear of the backdoors in the western hardware it is also significantly different from the wang  in its internals being more inspired by it rather than a direct clone it used the same basic language named tbasic with a few enhancements many research papers reference calculations done on the iskra  the computer won a  state prize later a somewhat scaleddown unix implementation was created for iskra which was widely used in the soviet union but is virtually unknown in the west wang oisedit the wang ois office information system was heavily wp oriented and featured wangs glossary function a glossary was a word processing document that was attached to a workstation which contained shortcuts to frequently typed phrases for example an operator in a law firm could insert the phrase united states constitution into a glossary document and then recall the phrase into a word processing document by pressing the gl key and the letter u thus saving numerous repetitive keystrokes a superset of glossary called decision processing was a system of programming that fitted into the wp model and was designed to be easy to master a simple ifthen program with subroutines could be constructed to perform tedious editing routines and then run on a word processing document while the operator performed other tasks the design goal of glossary and decision processing was that secretaries would be able to use them to extend the functionality of the document management and manipulation provided by the oiscitation needed like the wang  the ois was characterized by evolution into a user system the ois and the vs overlapped features such as dualcoax connections to workstations and printers were common to both system families buried deep in the vs microcode are entire pieces of ois code probably because wp did not figure into the original design of the vs but was added latercitation needed wang also had a line called alliance which was based on the high end ois  hardware architecture it had more powerful software compared to the ois word processing and list processing packages the system was tempest certified leading to global deployment in american embassies after the iran hostage crisis the most significant enhancementcitation needed was in the indexing capabilities of the alliance system documents could be indexed by every word contained in them the database product visual memory permitted every word in each field to be indexed in addition to the advanced indexing features the alliance word processor was also substantially enhancedcitation needed even though the z platform on which it ran forced it to remain as an bit application in a  kb workstation the wang vs computer lineedit the first wang vs computer was introduced in  about the same time as digital equipment corporations vax and continues to be in use  years later its instruction set was compatible with the ibm  series but it did not run any ibm  system software the vs operating system and all system software were built from the ground up to support interactive users as well as batch operations the vs was aimed directly at the business data processing market in general and ibm in particular while many programming languages were available the vs was typically programmed in cobol other languages supported in the vs integrated development environment included assembler cobol  cobol  basic ada rpg ii c pli fortran glossary mabasic speed ii and procedure a scripting language pascal was also supported for io coprocessor development the wang pace professional application creation environment gl and database was used from the mids onward by customers and third party developers to build complex applications sometimes involving many thousands of screens hundreds of distinct application modules and serving many hundreds of users substantial vertical applications were developed for the wang vs by third party software houses throughout the s in cobol pace basic pli and rpg ii the wang office family of applications and wang wp were both popular applications on the vs word processing ran on the vs through services that emulated the ois environment and downloaded the wp software as microcode in wang terminology to vs workstations the press and the industry referred to the class of machines made by wang including the vs as minicomputers and kenneys  book refers to the vs line as minicomputers throughout although some argue that the highend vses and their successors should qualify as mainframes wang avoided this term in his autobiography an wang rather than calling the vs  a mainframe said that it verges on mainframe performance he went on to draw distinction between the mainframes at the high end of ibms line just as detroit would rather sell large cars  so ibm would rather sell mainframes—in which ibm had a virtual monopoly—with the midsized systems in which ibm had not achieved dominance the minicomputer market is still healthy this is good for the customer and good for minicomputer makers wang laboratories positioned the vs line as minicomputers and reflected this in its marketing collateral and press releasescitation needed later models the small vs series launched in approximately  were userinstallable the smallest being physically similar in size to pcs of the era the largest supported an increasingly substantial number of users going after ibmedit an wang felt a personal sense of rivalry with ibm partly as a result of heavyhanded treatment by ibm in  over the rights to his magneticcore patents this encounter formed the subject of a long chapter in wangs own book lessons according to charles c kenney jack connors remembers being in wangs office one day when the doctor pulled out a chart on which he had plotted wangs growth and projected that wang laboratories would overtake ibm sometime in the middle of the s he had kept it a long time says connors and he believed it wang was one of the first computer companies to advertise on television and the first to run an ad during the super bowl in  their first ad literally cast wang laboratories as david and ibm as goliath several years before the famous  apple computer ad a later ad depicted wang laboratories as a helicopter gunship taking aim at ibm wang wanted to compete against ibm as a computer company selling directly to management information system departments before the vs however wang laboratories was not taken seriously as a computer company the calculators word processing systems and ois were sold into individual departments bypassing the corporate dataprocessing decisionmakers the chapter in wangs book dealing with them shows that he saw them only as a beachhead in the fortune  the wang vs was wangs entrée into it departments in his book an wang notes that to sell the vs we aggressively recruited salesmen with strong backgrounds in data processing  who had experience dealing with mis executives and who knew their way around fortune  companies as the vs took hold the word processor and ois lines were phased out the word processing software continued in the form of a loadablemicrocode environment that allowed vs workstations to take on the behavior of traditional wang wp terminals to operate with the vs and use it as a document server wang made inroads into ibm and dec markets in the s but did not have a serious impact on ibms mainframe market due to selflimiting factors even though an wang wanted to compete with ibm too many wang salespeople were incompletely trained on the significant dp capabilities of the vs in many instances the vs ran smaller enterprises up to about  millionyear and in larger organizations found use as a gateway to larger corporate mainframes handling workstation passthrough and massive print services at exxon corporation for instance  topoftheline vss at the houston headquarters were used in the s and into the s to receive mainframe reports and make them viewable online by executives at mellon mortgage  vs systems from the smallest to the largest were used as the enterprise mortgage origination servicing finance documentation and hedge system and also for mainframe gateway services for logon and printing between mellon mortgage and parent mellon bank their network contained  vs systems and the bank portion of the network supported about  wang office users for email report distribution and scheduling at kent and ktec electronics two related houston companies separate vs clusters were the enterprise systems handling distribution manufacturing and accounting with significant edi capability for receiving customer forecasts sending invoices and sending purchase orders and receiving shipping notifications both systems ran the geisco edi package kent which grew to  millionyear ran the arcus distribution software in cobol and ktec which grew to  millionyear ran the caelus mrp system for manufacturing in basic the highwater mark of the vs in the marketplace was probably about  systems operating worldwide at one time in the midtolate s serving at least several million desktop userscitation needed aggressive marketingedit in the late s a british television documentary accused the company of targeting a competitor canadian company aes wordplex in an attempt to take it out of the market however the documentary came to no conclusion regarding this wangs approach was called internally the gas cooker program named after similar programs to give discounts on new gas stoves by trading in an old one wang was accused of targeting wordplex by offering a large discount on wang ois systems with a tradein of wordplex machines regardless of the age or condition of the tradein machine based on its good reputation with users and its program of aggressive discounts wang gained an increasing share of a shrinking market wordplex was subsequently taken over by norsk data word processing market collapseedit the market for standalone word processing systems collapsed with the introduction of the personal computer multimate on the ibm pc replicated the interface and functions of the wang word processor and several other wysiwyg word processing programs also became popular wang did make one last play in this arena producing a dedicated intelbased word processor called the wang office assistant but by the time it appeared the pc with its flexibility of combining word processors with other programs such as spreadsheets had rendered such a specific task machine largely unsellable the digital voice exchangeedit the wang dvx was one of the first integrated switchboard and voicemail systems in the united kingdom it was selected for the dti office automation pilot schemes at the national coal board in about  lawrence e bergeron was instrumental in managing the voice engineering department at wang labscitation needed he promoted the purchase of a vax for realtime signal processing research and created the peripheral signal processor board psp the psp was placed into  racks to handle  phone lines for the dvx digital voice exchange voice prompts were created by a hired voice specialist to give a melodic presentation for the dvx to avoid false triggering of touchtones by the prompts due to inputoutput cross talk notch filters were created to remove the touch tone frequencies from the prompts some of the prompt languages supported were german spanish french british english american english and portuguese internal research on speech recognition was carried out and implemented for discrete word recognition but was never released to the field at one point there were  members of the voice engineering department this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it may  pcs and pc based productsedit despite the release of the  pcs personal computer system and  pcsii models as early as  the history of computing regards the earliest pc as one which contained a microprocessor which the  pcs did not however the selfcontained pcsii incorporated many of the innovations that would later be seen in pcs including the first  inch floppy drives that were especially designed for the pcsii by shugart associates the original wang pcedit an wang had initially refused to develop an ibmcompatible pc due to his personal dislike of ibm even though his son fred had pitched the idea the original wang pc was released april  to counter the ibm pc which had been released the previous august and which had gained wide acceptance in the market for which wang traditionally positioned the ois system it was based on the intel  microprocessor a slightly faster cpu than the ibm pcs  a hardwaresoftware package that permitted the wang pc to act as a terminal to the ois and vs products was available the hardware component the first version was made of two large addin boards called the wloc wang local office connection contained a z processor and  kb of memory one of the distinguishing features of the wang pc was the system software similar to the wang vs minicomputer the command line was not immediately evident everything could be run from menus including formatting a disk furthermore each item on a menu could be explained by hitting a dedicated help key on the keyboard this software was later sold in msdos compatible form for non wang hardware the wang word processing software was also very graphical the keyboard had  functionkeys and unlike wordstar the popular word processor of the day control key combinations were not required to navigate the system the fkeys had the word processing functions labeled on them however the biggest stumbling block was that – despite being a fully compliant msdos system – it was not compatible with the ibm pc at the hardware level this was a problem because msdos was rarely used as anything more than a simple program loader complex software spreadsheets flight simulator etc could only obtain acceptable performance by direct manipulation of the hardware wang used a bit data bus instead of the bit data bus used by ibm arguing that applications would run much faster since most operations required io disk screen keyboard printer with this bit design wang used peripheral hardware devices such as the wang pc display adapter that were not compatible with their counterparts in the ibm pc line this meant that the vast library of software available for the ibm pc could not be directly run on the wang pc only those programs that were either written specifically for the wang pc or ported from the ibm pc were available a basic word processing package developed by wang and microsofts multiplan spreadsheet were the two commonly marketed software products lotus  and dbase ii were also available this dearth of application software led to the early demise of the original wang pc and it was replaced by an intel  based product that was fully plug compatible with the ibm pc the unique system software was available at extra cost most wang pcs were released with a monochrome graphics adapter that supported a single video mode with text and graphics planes that could be scrolled independently unlike ibmcompatible pcs of the time which required selecting a specific video mode to allow graphics a color graphics adapter and wangbranded color monitor were also available an ergonomic feature of the wang pc was the monitor arm that clamped to the desk and held the monitor above and a system clamp that attached to the side of the desk and held the rather large computer box by using these there was nothing on the desktop

and removed july  learn how and when to remove this template message after it became clear that it had been a mistake to ignore the issue of pc compatibility wang belatedly released an emulation board for wang pc that enabled operation of many pc compatible software packages the board accomplished this by monitoring all io and memory transactions visible in those days before northsouth bridge chips to any board plugged into a slot on the expansion bus and generating a nonmaskable interrupt nmi whenever an operation was deemed to involve an incompatible device requiring emulation for example the floppy controller circuitry on the wang pc was similar to that of the ibm pc but involved enough design differences that pc compatible software attempting to manipulate it directly would fail wangs pc emulation hardware would detect io and memory operations involving the addresses associated with the floppy controller in the ibm pc and generate an nmi the nmi handler would immediately be activated the exception vector having been appropriated during system init to point to rom routines on the emulation board instead of the nmi routine in the pc bios and would then update an internal representation of the ibm pc floppy controller and manipulate the real controller to reflect its state reads were satisfied in a similar way by forcing an nmi decoding the machine code indicated by the instruction pointer at the time of the fault and then obtaining the desired info and updating the cpu registers accordingly before resuming the executing program the pc emulation board thus enabled execution of an impressive number of applications by presenting virtualized pc compatible hardware devices to them a monochrome textonly video controller a floppy controller uarts dma controller parallel port keyboard controller etc ibmpc emulation on the based wang pc was working fairly reliably when ibm released their based pcat wangs answer was the based wang apc advanced professional computer which not only perpetuated the pc incompatibility at the hardware level but revealed an unexpected wrinkle in the hitherto successful pc emulation strategy the  decoded and executed instructions onthefly and was therefore able to respond to nmi on every instruction boundary but the  decoded and queued instructions in a pipeline whose depth varied with each cpumask stepping but which always prevented timely nmi execution wangs engineers came up with and later patented a rather devious instructionprefetch monitor that managed to cope with that challenge at the expense of a modest performance penalty further iterations of the pc line were released commencing with the model number pc these later models booted directly into msdos or another compatible operating system and supported isastandard expansion cards this pc still wasnt entirely ibm pc standard as the keyboard although being a standard pcat device allowed for vs compatibility with  function keys rather than the normal  and a number of wang vs specific keys there was also a slight difference in cpu interrupts from ibm standard so some software had compatibility issues vs connectivity was via an isa based vsterminal card or via lightspeed the networked vs terminal emulator over an ipxbased ethernet connection originally the pc came with a wang specific hercules graphics card and compatible screen which also acted as a keyboard extension meaning the base unit could be kept some distance from the screen this was later replaced with an ega card and screen around  wang released the pc and pc which were intel  based clocked at  mhz and  mhz respectively they used the same vs compatible keyboard as the pc they had a maximum of  megabytes of ram and came with vga screens as standard they were generally supplied with msdos and windows  the  had an interestingaccording to whom bug where occasionally the machine would just freeze entirely and not even boot up if turned off and on at the mains although it would power on the bios just didnt start the solution was to turn on the machine at the mains and hold down the power button for  seconds at which point it would normally start it was suggestedby whom that this was due to an undervalued capacitor in the power circuit this problem appeared to be resolved in the  which had a different psu in  wang marketed a pccompatible based on the intel sx processor which they called the alliance cd it was clocked at  mhz and had a socket for an  math coprocessor it came with  megabytes of installed ram and was expandable to  megabytes using simm memory cards a wang invention that became an industry standard it had a  megabyte floppy disk drive an internal  megabyte hard disk and a cdrom drive five expansion slots were builtin it came with msdos and windows  operating systems in  wang released the slimline alliance cd  based pc in the united kingdom these machines used standard pcat keyboards and were entirely ibm compatible shipping with msdos  and windows  as standard the only unusual feature was that system bios settings and the realtime clock were maintained by four standard aa batteries as opposed to a more typical solution – such as a specialty battery pack or lithium battery while originally offered with a  mhz dx the cd could be upgraded to later socket  processors such as the dx through the use of third party cpu upgrade adapters or interposers this allowed upgrading to speeds beyond  mhz without overclocking or alternatively the potential for speeds in excess of  mhz with overclocking dependent on the processor used wang freestyleedit wang freestyle was a  product consisting of a tablet and stylus for written annotation of any file that could be displayed on the pc a phone handset for voice annotation but not voice communication demonstrated strongly in conjunction with the tablet for explaining the text annotations email via wang office of the resulting document set the product was not a success in anything except marketing terms a description of the system at the university of southern california usc shows the symptoms of the failure the  million usc system includes a vs  midrange computer  image workstations  with freestyle capabilities a laser printer five endorsers and five document scanners initial storage for document images is eight gigabytes of magnetic disk storage only  of the stations were freestyle stations the system was so costly even in the context of a wang integrated imaging system that freestyle was only affordable for highly specialized or very senior staff apart from usc unusual in that it was deployed at clerical level it was sold as a clevel tool for c grades to communicate with other c grades this reduced the marketplace immediately from the mass market where the system would have been effective decline and falledit former wang headquarters in lowell massachusetts the building is now called cross point and is anchored by motorola the horizontal windows at the top of the middle tower housed the executive offices including an wangs wang labs would be only one of a large number of new englandbased computer companies that would falter in the late s and s marking the end of the massachusetts miracle for instance the struggling digital equipment corporation also significantly downsized in the s and was acquired by compaq a common view within the pc community is that wang labs failed because it specialized in computers designed specifically for word processing and did not foresee and was unable to compete against generalpurpose personal computers with word processing software in the s word processing was not actually the mainstay of wangs business by the time desktop computers began to gain in popularity although wang manufactured desktops its main business by the s was its vs line of minicomputer and midframe systems the market for these minicomputers was ultimately conquered by enhanced microcomputers like the apple macintosh and the wintel pc on one end and sun ibm and hewlettpackard servers on the other end an wangs insistence that his son fred wang succeed him contributed to the companys failure fred wang was a business school graduate but by almost any definition wrote charles c kenney unsuited for the job in which his father had placed him his assignment first as head of research and development then as president of the company led to resignations by key rd and business personnel amid declining revenues john f cunningham an year employee of the firm resigned as president and coo of wang labs to become chairman and chief executive of computer consoles inc cunningham resigned due to disagreement with an wang on how to pull the company out of the slump as well as being upset that fred wang was positioned as the successor an instance of nepotism one turning point occurred when fred wang was head of rd on october   wang laboratories announced fourteen major hardware and software products and promised dates of delivery the announcement was well received but even at the time there were warning signs according to datamation wang announced everything but the kitchen sink and if you could attach the kitchen sink to a personal computer they would announce that too very few of the products were close to completion and many of them had not even been started all were delivered late and some were never delivered at all in retrospect this was referred to as the vaporware announcement and it hurt the credibility of fred wang and wang laboratories in  fred wang then  years old was installed as president of wang laboratories however the companys fortunes continued to decline unlike most computer companies that funded their growth by issuing stock an wang had used debt to avoid further dilution of family control of the company by august  that debt was causing conflicts with its creditors on august   an wang fired his son richard w miller replaced him as the president of wang laboratories having been with the company since  miller announced in december  that the company would start to embrace established software standards rather than use traditional proprietary designs an wang died in march  and miller took on the additional posts of chairman and ceo the company underwent massive restructuring and in august  it eliminated its bank debt but still ended the year with a record net loss in november  wang announced their first personal computers running unix previously wangs presence in the unix and open systems markets had been modest in  wang developed a new typesetting system in conjunction with arlington mabased texet corp the system used xerox printers and unix workstations from sun but the product vanished before coming to market partially because few wang employees could use or support unix unix ran on the vs – interactive systems first ported inix their ibm version of sys unix to run in a vsos virtual machine circa  and then wang engineers completed the port so that it ran native on the vs hardware soon thereafter – but performance was always subpar as unix was never a good fit for the inherently batchmode nature of the vs hardware and the lineatatime processing approach taken by the vs workstations indeed the workstation code had to be largely rewritten to bundle up each keystroke into a frame to be sent back to the host when running unix so that tty style processing could be implemented pace which offered its data dictionary excellent referential integrity and speedy application development was in the process of being ported to unix under the name open pace a client server rdbms model built on the original products ideology open pace was demonstrated at the north american pace user group conferences in both boston and chicago open pace along with a new windowsbased word processor called upword which was at the time considered a strong contender to retake wangs original market leadership from microsoft were touted as their new direction however after a marketing study suggested that it would require large capital investments in order to be viable competitors against microsoft both products were simply abandoned ira magaziner who was brought in by miller in  proposed to take wang out of the manufacture of computers altogether and to go big into imaging software instead in march  the company introduced its office  marketing strategy focusing on office productivity in june  wang started reselling ibm computers in exchange for ibm investing in wang stock wang hardware strategy to resell ibm rss also included further pursuit of unix software in august  wang won a suit against nec and toshiba claiming violation of wangs patents on single inline memory modules simms the company still recorded a net loss for the  fiscal year wang laboratories filed for bankruptcy protection on august   final yearsedit wang labs emerged from bankruptcy on september   as part of its bankruptcy reorganization the companys iconic headquarters wang towers in lowell was sold at auction the complex which originally cost  million to build and housed  workers in over a million square feet  m of office space was sold in  for  the renovated complex which is now known as cross point was subsequently sold in  to a joint venture of yale properties and blackstone real estate advisors for a price reported to be over  million the company emerged from bankruptcy with  million in hand and embarked on a course of acquisition and selfreinvention eschewing its former role as an innovative designer and manufacturer of computer and related systems later in the s and under the guidance of then ceo joe tucci with the acquisition of the olsy division of olivetti the company changed its name to wang global by then wang had settled on network services as its chosen business the most advanced vs system capable of supporting over  users – the vs model  – was released in  and

were performed in the american workplace wang oisedit following the wang  harold koplow and david moros made another attempt at designing a word processor they started by first writing the users manual for the product a  boston globe article refers to koplow as a wisecracking rebel who was waiting for dismissal when in  he developed the product that made computers popularly accessible in koplows words dr wang kicked me out of marketing i along with dave moros was relegated to long range planning — lrped this  was tantamount to being fired here is a temporary job until you find another one in some other company although he and moros were told to design a word processing machine they were given no resourcescitation needed they perceived the assignment as busywork they went ahead anyway wrote the manual and convinced an wang to turn it into a real project the word processing machine – the wang  wps – was introduced in june  and was an instant success as was its successor the  wang ois office information system these products were technological breakthroughs they were multiuser systems each workstation looked like a typical terminal but contained its own intel  microprocessor later versions used a z and  kb of ram comparable but lower in power than the original ibm pc which came out in  disk storage was centralized in a master unit and shared by the workstations and connection was via highspeed dual coaxial cable  link multiple ois masters could be networked to each other allowing file sharing among hundreds of users the systems were userfriendly and fairly easy to administer with the latter task often performed by office personnel in an era when most machines required trained administrators early computer modelsedit wang edit on its journey from calculators and word processing to serious data processing wang developed and marketed several lines of small computer system some of which were wordprocessingbased and some of which were dataprocessingbased instead of a clear linear progression the product lines overlapped and in some cases borrowed technology from each other the most identifiable wang minicomputer performing recognizable data processing was the wang  which appeared in may  unlike some other desktop computers such as the hp  it had a crt in a cabinet that also included an integrated computer controlled cassette tape storage unit and keyboard microcoded to run interpretive basic about  systems were shipped in its lifetime and it found wide use in small and mediumsize businesses worldwide the original  was a single user system the improved vp model increased performance more than tenfold and enhanced the language renamed basic the  vp evolved into a desktop computer and larger mvp system to support up to  workstations and utilized commercial disk technologies that appeared in the late s and early s the disk subsystems could be attached to up to  computers giving a theoretical upper limit of  workstations in a single cluster unlike the other product lines such as the vs and ois both described below wang aggressively used value added resellers vars to customize and market  systems one such creative solution deployed dozens of  systems and was developed in conjunction with hawaii and hong kongbased firm algorithms inc it provided paging beeper services for much of the hong kong market in the early s overshadowed by the wang vs the  languished as a costeffective but forgotten solution in the hands of the customers who had it in the late s wang revisited the  series one last time offering  customers a new  cs with bundled maintenance for less than customers were then paying just for maintenance of their aging s the  cs was accompanied by an intel  processor updated disk units and other peripherals most  customers upgraded to the  cs after which wang never again developed or marketed any new  products in  wang reported having about two hundred  systems still under maintenance around the world throughout wang had always offered maintenance services for the  the  basic language was ported to be compiled and run on nonwang hardware and operating systems by at least two companies niakwa inc created a product named npl originally named basicc kerridge computer now a part of adp created a product named kcml both products support dos windows and various unix systems the basic language has been substantially enhanced and extended by both companies to meet modern needs compared to the  wang hardware the compiled solutions improve all factors speed disk space memory user limits by tens to hundreds of times so while wang support for the  is gone many software applications continue to function during the s about  wang t computers were shipped to the ussr due to the afghan war in the s us and cocom export restrictions ended the shipment of wang computers the soviets were in great need of computers in  russian engineers at minpribors schetmash factory in kursk reverse engineered the wang t and created a computer they named the iskra  the cocom restrictions theory though while popular in the west is challenged by some russian computer historians on the basis of the fact that development for the iskra started in  two years before the afghan war one possible reason for this might be a soviet fear of the backdoors in the western hardware it is also significantly different from the wang  in its internals being more inspired by it rather than a direct clone it used the same basic language named tbasic with a few enhancements many research papers reference calculations done on the iskra  the computer won a  state prize later a somewhat scaleddown unix implementation was created for iskra which was widely used in the soviet union but is virtually unknown in the west wang oisedit the wang ois office information system was heavily wp oriented and featured wangs glossary function a glossary was a word processing document that was attached to a workstation which contained shortcuts to frequently typed phrases for example an operator in a law firm could insert the phrase united states constitution into a glossary document and then recall the phrase into a word processing document by pressing the gl key and the letter u thus saving numerous repetitive keystrokes a superset of glossary called decision processing was a system of programming that fitted into the wp model and was designed to be easy to master a simple ifthen program with subroutines could be constructed to perform tedious editing routines and then run on a word processing document while the operator performed other tasks the design goal of glossary and decision processing was that secretaries would be able to use them to extend the functionality of the document management and manipulation provided by the oiscitation needed like the wang  the ois was characterized by evolution into a user system the ois and the vs overlapped features such as dualcoax connections to workstations and printers were common to both system families buried deep in the vs microcode are entire pieces of ois code probably because wp did not figure into the original design of the vs but was added latercitation needed wang also had a line called alliance which was based on the high end ois  hardware architecture it had more powerful software compared to the ois word processing and list processing packages the system was tempest certified leading to global deployment in american embassies after the iran hostage crisis the most significant enhancementcitation needed was in the indexing capabilities of the alliance system documents could be indexed by every word contained in them the database product visual memory permitted every word in each field to be indexed in addition to the advanced indexing features the alliance word processor was also substantially enhancedcitation needed even though the z platform on which it ran forced it to remain as an bit application in a  kb workstation the wang vs computer lineedit the first wang vs computer was introduced in  about the same time as digital equipment corporations vax and continues to be in use  years later its instruction set was compatible with the ibm  series but it did not run any ibm  system software the vs operating system and all system software were built from the ground up to support interactive users as well as batch operations the vs was aimed directly at the business data processing market in general and ibm in particular while many programming languages were available the vs was typically programmed in cobol other languages supported in the vs integrated development environment included assembler cobol  cobol  basic ada rpg ii c pli fortran glossary mabasic speed ii and procedure a scripting language pascal was also supported for io coprocessor development the wang pace professional application creation environment gl and database was used from the mids onward by customers and third party developers to build complex applications sometimes involving many thousands of screens hundreds of distinct application modules and serving many hundreds of users substantial vertical applications were developed for the wang vs by third party software houses throughout the s in cobol pace basic pli and rpg ii the wang office family of applications and wang wp were both popular applications on the vs word processing ran on the vs through services that emulated the ois environment and downloaded the wp software as microcode in wang terminology to vs workstations the press and the industry referred to the class of machines made by wang including the vs as minicomputers and kenneys  book refers to the vs line as minicomputers throughout although some argue that the highend vses and their successors should qualify as mainframes wang avoided this term in his autobiography an wang rather than calling the vs  a mainframe said that it verges on mainframe performance he went on to draw distinction between the mainframes at the high end of ibms line just as detroit would rather sell large cars  so ibm would rather sell mainframes—in which ibm had a virtual monopoly—with the midsized systems in which ibm had not achieved dominance the minicomputer market is still healthy this is good for the customer and good for minicomputer makers wang laboratories positioned the vs line as minicomputers and reflected this in its marketing collateral and press releasescitation needed later models the small vs series launched in approximately  were userinstallable the smallest being physically similar in size to pcs of the era the largest supported an increasingly substantial number of users going after ibmedit an wang felt a personal sense of rivalry with ibm partly as a result of heavyhanded treatment by ibm in  over the rights to his magneticcore patents this encounter formed the subject of a long chapter in wangs own book lessons according to charles c kenney jack connors remembers being in wangs office one day when the doctor pulled out a chart on which he had plotted wangs growth and projected that wang laboratories would overtake ibm sometime in the middle of the s he had kept it a long time says connors and he believed it wang was one of the first computer companies to advertise on television and the first to run an ad during the super bowl in  their first ad literally cast wang laboratories as david and ibm as goliath several years before the famous  apple computer ad a later ad depicted wang laboratories as a helicopter gunship taking aim at ibm wang wanted to compete against ibm as a computer company selling directly to management information system departments before the vs however wang laboratories was not taken seriously as a computer company the calculators word processing systems and ois were sold into individual departments bypassing the corporate dataprocessing decisionmakers the chapter in wangs book dealing with them shows that he saw them only as a beachhead in the fortune  the wang vs was wangs entrée into it departments in his book an wang notes that to sell the vs we aggressively recruited salesmen with strong backgrounds in data processing  who had experience dealing with mis executives and who knew their way around fortune  companies as the vs took hold the word processor and ois lines were phased out the word processing software continued in the form of a loadablemicrocode environment that allowed vs workstations to take on the behavior of traditional wang wp terminals to operate with the vs and use it as a document server wang made inroads into ibm and dec markets in the s but did not have a serious impact on ibms mainframe market due to selflimiting factors even though an wang wanted to compete with ibm too many wang salespeople were incompletely trained on the significant dp capabilities of the vs in many instances the vs ran smaller enterprises up to about  millionyear and in larger organizations found use as a gateway to larger corporate mainframes handling workstation passthrough and massive print services at exxon corporation for instance  topoftheline vss at the houston headquarters were used in the s and into the s to receive mainframe reports and make them viewable online by executives at mellon mortgage  vs systems from the smallest to the largest were used as the enterprise mortgage origination servicing finance documentation and hedge system and also for mainframe gateway services for logon and printing between mellon mortgage and parent mellon bank their network contained  vs systems and the bank portion of the network supported about  wang office users for email report distribution and scheduling at kent and ktec electronics two related houston companies separate vs clusters were the enterprise systems handling distribution manufacturing and accounting with significant edi capability for receiving customer forecasts sending invoices and sending purchase orders and receiving shipping notifications both systems ran the geisco edi package kent which grew to  millionyear ran the arcus distribution software in cobol and ktec which grew to  millionyear ran the caelus mrp system for manufacturing in basic the highwater mark of the vs in the marketplace was probably about  systems operating worldwide at one time in the midtolate s serving at least several million desktop userscitation needed aggressive marketingedit in the late s a british television documentary accused the company of targeting a competitor canadian company aes wordplex in an attempt to take it out of the market however the documentary came to no conclusion regarding this wangs approach was called internally the gas cooker program named after similar programs to give discounts on new gas stoves by trading in an old one wang was accused of targeting wordplex by offering a large discount on wang ois systems with a tradein of wordplex machines regardless of the age or condition of the tradein machine based on its good reputation with users and its program of aggressive discounts wang gained an increasing share of a shrinking market wordplex was subsequently taken over by norsk data word processing market collapseedit the market for standalone word processing systems collapsed with the introduction of the personal computer multimate on the ibm pc replicated the interface and functions of the wang word processor and several other wysiwyg word processing programs also became popular wang did make one last play in this arena producing a dedicated intelbased word processor called the wang office assistant but by the time it appeared the pc with its flexibility of combining word processors with other programs such as spreadsheets had rendered such a specific task machine largely unsellable the digital voice exchangeedit the wang dvx was one of the first integrated switchboard and voicemail systems in the united kingdom it was selected for the dti office automation pilot schemes at the national coal board in about  lawrence e bergeron was instrumental in managing the voice engineering department at wang labscitation needed he promoted the purchase of a vax for realtime signal processing research and created the peripheral signal processor board psp the psp was placed into  racks to handle  phone lines for the dvx digital voice exchange voice prompts were created by a hired voice specialist to give a melodic presentation for the dvx to avoid false triggering of touchtones by the prompts due to inputoutput cross talk notch filters were created to remove the touch tone frequencies from the prompts some of the prompt languages supported were german spanish french british english american english and portuguese internal research on speech recognition was carried out and implemented for discrete word recognition but was never released to the field at one point there were  members of the voice engineering department this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it may  pcs and pc based productsedit despite the release of the  pcs personal computer system and  pcsii models as early as  the history of computing regards the earliest pc as one which contained a microprocessor which the  pcs did not however the selfcontained pcsii incorporated many of the innovations that would later be seen in pcs including the first  inch floppy drives that were especially designed for the pcsii by shugart associates the original wang pcedit an wang had initially refused to develop an ibmcompatible pc due to his personal dislike of ibm even though his son fred had pitched the idea the original wang pc was released april  to counter the ibm pc which had been released the previous august and which had gained wide acceptance in the market for which wang traditionally positioned the ois system it was based on the intel  microprocessor a slightly faster cpu than the ibm pcs  a hardwaresoftware package that permitted the wang pc to act as a terminal to the ois and vs products was available the hardware component the first version was made of two large addin boards called the wloc wang local office connection contained a z processor and  kb of memory one of the distinguishing features of the wang pc was the system software similar to the wang vs minicomputer the command line was not immediately evident everything could be run from menus including formatting a disk furthermore each item on a menu could be explained by hitting a dedicated help key on the keyboard this software was later sold in msdos compatible form for non wang hardware the wang word processing software was also very graphical the keyboard had  functionkeys and unlike wordstar the popular word processor of the day control key combinations were not required to navigate the system the fkeys had the word processing functions labeled on them however the biggest stumbling block was that – despite being a fully compliant msdos system – it was not compatible with the ibm pc at the hardware level this was a problem because msdos was rarely used as anything more than a simple program loader complex software spreadsheets flight simulator etc could only obtain acceptable performance by direct manipulation of the hardware wang used a bit data bus instead of the bit data bus used by ibm arguing that applications would run much faster since most operations required io disk screen keyboard printer with this bit design wang used peripheral hardware devices such as the wang pc display adapter that were not compatible with their counterparts in the ibm pc line this meant that the vast library of software available for the ibm pc could not be directly run on the wang pc only those programs that were either written specifically for the wang pc or ported from the ibm pc were available a basic word processing package developed by wang and microsofts multiplan spreadsheet were the two commonly marketed software products lotus  and dbase ii were also available this dearth of application software led to the early demise of the original wang pc and it was replaced by an intel  based product that was fully plug compatible with the ibm pc the unique system software was available at extra cost most wang pcs were released with a monochrome graphics adapter that supported a single video mode with text and graphics planes that could be scrolled independently unlike ibmcompatible pcs of the time which required selecting a specific video mode to allow graphics a color graphics adapter and wangbranded color monitor were also available an ergonomic feature of the wang pc was the monitor arm that clamped to the desk and held the monitor above and a system clamp that attached to the side of the desk and held the rather large computer box by using these there was nothing on the desktop except the keyboard ibm compatible wang pcsedit this

template message after it became clear that it had been a mistake to ignore the issue of pc compatibility wang belatedly released an emulation board for wang pc that enabled operation of many pc compatible software packages the board accomplished this by monitoring all io and memory transactions visible in those days before northsouth bridge chips to any board plugged into a slot on the expansion bus and generating a nonmaskable interrupt nmi whenever an operation was deemed to involve an incompatible device requiring emulation for example the floppy controller circuitry on the wang pc was similar to that of the ibm pc but involved enough design differences that pc compatible software attempting to manipulate it directly would fail wangs pc emulation hardware would detect io and memory operations involving the addresses associated with the floppy controller in the ibm pc and generate an nmi the nmi handler would immediately be activated the exception vector having been appropriated during system init to point to rom routines on the emulation board instead of the nmi routine in the pc bios and would then update an internal representation of the ibm pc floppy controller and manipulate the real controller to reflect its state reads were satisfied in a similar way by forcing an nmi decoding the machine code indicated by the instruction pointer at the time of the fault and then obtaining the desired info and updating the cpu registers accordingly before resuming the executing program the pc emulation board thus enabled execution of an impressive number of applications by presenting virtualized pc compatible hardware devices to them a monochrome textonly video controller a floppy controller uarts dma controller parallel port keyboard controller etc ibmpc emulation on the based wang pc was working fairly reliably when ibm released their based pcat wangs answer was the based wang apc advanced professional computer which not only perpetuated the pc incompatibility at the hardware level but revealed an unexpected wrinkle in the hitherto successful pc emulation strategy the  decoded and executed instructions onthefly and was therefore able to respond to nmi on every instruction boundary but the  decoded and queued instructions in a pipeline whose depth varied with each cpumask stepping but which always prevented timely nmi execution wangs engineers came up with and later patented a rather devious instructionprefetch monitor that managed to cope with that challenge at the expense of a modest performance penalty further iterations of the pc line were released commencing with the model number pc these later models booted directly into msdos or another compatible operating system and supported isastandard expansion cards this pc still wasnt entirely ibm pc standard as the keyboard although being a standard pcat device allowed for vs compatibility with  function keys rather than the normal  and a number of wang vs specific keys there was also a slight difference in cpu interrupts from ibm standard so some software had compatibility issues vs connectivity was via an isa based vsterminal card or via lightspeed the networked vs terminal emulator over an ipxbased ethernet connection originally the pc came with a wang specific hercules graphics card and compatible screen which also acted as a keyboard extension meaning the base unit could be kept some distance from the screen this was later replaced with an ega card and screen around  wang released the pc and pc which were intel  based clocked at  mhz and  mhz respectively they used the same vs compatible keyboard as the pc they had a maximum of  megabytes of ram and came with vga screens as standard they were generally supplied with msdos and windows  the  had an interestingaccording to whom bug where occasionally the machine would just freeze entirely and not even boot up if turned off and on at the mains although it would power on the bios just didnt start the solution was to turn on the machine at the mains and hold down the power button for  seconds at which point it would normally start it was suggestedby whom that this was due to an undervalued capacitor in the power circuit this problem appeared to be resolved in the  which had a different psu in  wang marketed a pccompatible based on the intel sx processor which they called the alliance cd it was clocked at  mhz and had a socket for an  math coprocessor it came with  megabytes of installed ram and was expandable to  megabytes using simm memory cards a wang invention that became an industry standard it had a  megabyte floppy disk drive an internal  megabyte hard disk and a cdrom drive five expansion slots were builtin it came with msdos and windows  operating systems in  wang released the slimline alliance cd  based pc in the united kingdom these machines used standard pcat keyboards and were entirely ibm compatible shipping with msdos  and windows  as standard the only unusual feature was that system bios settings and the realtime clock were maintained by four standard aa batteries as opposed to a more typical solution – such as a specialty battery pack or lithium battery while originally offered with a  mhz dx the cd could be upgraded to later socket  processors such as the dx through the use of third party cpu upgrade adapters or interposers this allowed upgrading to speeds beyond  mhz without overclocking or alternatively the potential for speeds in excess of  mhz with overclocking dependent on the processor used wang freestyleedit wang freestyle was a  product consisting of a tablet and stylus for written annotation of any file that could be displayed on the pc a phone handset for voice annotation but not voice communication demonstrated strongly in conjunction with the tablet for explaining the text annotations email via wang office of the resulting document set the product was not a success in anything except marketing terms a description of the system at the university of southern california usc shows the symptoms of the failure the  million usc system includes a vs  midrange computer  image workstations  with freestyle capabilities a laser printer five endorsers and five document scanners initial storage for document images is eight gigabytes of magnetic disk storage only  of the stations were freestyle stations the system was so costly even in the context of a wang integrated imaging system that freestyle was only affordable for highly specialized or very senior staff apart from usc unusual in that it was deployed at clerical level it was sold as a clevel tool for c grades to communicate with other c grades this reduced the marketplace immediately from the mass market where the system would have been effective decline and falledit former wang headquarters in lowell massachusetts the building is now called cross point and is anchored by motorola the horizontal windows at the top of the middle tower housed the executive offices including an wangs wang labs would be only one of a large number of new englandbased computer companies that would falter in the late s and s marking the end of the massachusetts miracle for instance the struggling digital equipment corporation also significantly downsized in the s and was acquired by compaq a common view within the pc community is that wang labs failed because it specialized in computers designed specifically for word processing and did not foresee and was unable to compete against generalpurpose personal computers with word processing software in the s word processing was not actually the mainstay of wangs business by the time desktop computers began to gain in popularity although wang manufactured desktops its main business by the s was its vs line of minicomputer and midframe systems the market for these minicomputers was ultimately conquered by enhanced microcomputers like the apple macintosh and the wintel pc on one end and sun ibm and hewlettpackard servers on the other end an wangs insistence that his son fred wang succeed him contributed to the companys failure fred wang was a business school graduate but by almost any definition wrote charles c kenney unsuited for the job in which his father had placed him his assignment first as head of research and development then as president of the company led to resignations by key rd and business personnel amid declining revenues john f cunningham an year employee of the firm resigned as president and coo of wang labs to become chairman and chief executive of computer consoles inc cunningham resigned due to disagreement with an wang on how to pull the company out of the slump as well as being upset that fred wang was positioned as the successor an instance of nepotism one turning point occurred when fred wang was head of rd on october   wang laboratories announced fourteen major hardware and software products and promised dates of delivery the announcement was well received but even at the time there were warning signs according to datamation wang announced everything but the kitchen sink and if you could attach the kitchen sink to a personal computer they would announce that too very few of the products were close to completion and many of them had not even been started all were delivered late and some were never delivered at all in retrospect this was referred to as the vaporware announcement and it hurt the credibility of fred wang and wang laboratories in  fred wang then  years old was installed as president of wang laboratories however the companys fortunes continued to decline unlike most computer companies that funded their growth by issuing stock an wang had used debt to avoid further dilution of family control of the company by august  that debt was causing conflicts with its creditors on august   an wang fired his son richard w miller replaced him as the president of wang laboratories having been with the company since  miller announced in december  that the company would start to embrace established software standards rather than use traditional proprietary designs an wang died in march  and miller took on the additional posts of chairman and ceo the company underwent massive restructuring and in august  it eliminated its bank debt but still ended the year with a record net loss in november  wang announced their first personal computers running unix previously wangs presence in the unix and open systems markets had been modest in  wang developed a new typesetting system in conjunction with arlington mabased texet corp the system used xerox printers and unix workstations from sun but the product vanished before coming to market partially because few wang employees could use or support unix unix ran on the vs – interactive systems first ported inix their ibm version of sys unix to run in a vsos virtual machine circa  and then wang engineers completed the port so that it ran native on the vs hardware soon thereafter – but performance was always subpar as unix was never a good fit for the inherently batchmode nature of the vs hardware and the lineatatime processing approach taken by the vs workstations indeed the workstation code had to be largely rewritten to bundle up each keystroke into a frame to be sent back to the host when running unix so that tty style processing could be implemented pace which offered its data dictionary excellent referential integrity and speedy application development was in the process of being ported to unix under the name open pace a client server rdbms model built on the original products ideology open pace was demonstrated at the north american pace user group conferences in both boston and chicago open pace along with a new windowsbased word processor called upword which was at the time considered a strong contender to retake wangs original market leadership from microsoft were touted as their new direction however after a marketing study suggested that it would require large capital investments in order to be viable competitors against microsoft both products were simply abandoned ira magaziner who was brought in by miller in  proposed to take wang out of the manufacture of computers altogether and to go big into imaging software instead in march  the company introduced its office  marketing strategy focusing on office productivity in june  wang started reselling ibm computers in exchange for ibm investing in wang stock wang hardware strategy to resell ibm rss also included further pursuit of unix software in august  wang won a suit against nec and toshiba claiming violation of wangs patents on single inline memory modules simms the company still recorded a net loss for the  fiscal year wang laboratories filed for bankruptcy protection on august   final yearsedit wang labs emerged from bankruptcy on september   as part of its bankruptcy reorganization the companys iconic headquarters wang towers in lowell was sold at auction the complex which originally cost  million to build and housed  workers in over a million square feet  m of office space was sold in  for  the renovated complex which is now known as cross point was subsequently sold in  to a joint venture of yale properties and blackstone real estate advisors for a price reported to be over  million the company emerged from bankruptcy with  million in hand and embarked on a course of acquisition and selfreinvention eschewing its former role as an innovative designer and manufacturer of computer and related systems later in the s and under the guidance of then ceo joe tucci with the acquisition of the olsy division of olivetti the company changed its name to wang global by then wang had settled on network services as its chosen business the most advanced vs system capable of supporting over  users – the vs model  – was released in  and smaller models based on the same cpu chip were released in  – the vs and the vs these were the last vsbased hardware systemscitation needed kodak acquired the wang software arm in  strengthening its position in the then booming document imaging and workflow market in  wang global by then back up to  billion in annual revenues was acquired by getronics of the netherlands a  billion network services company active only in parts of europe and australia joe tucci departed wang after the acquisition wang labs then became getronics north america in  getronics announced new vs vsgx a product designed to seamlessly run the vs operating system and all vs software on intel x and ibm power machines under linux or unix using a hardware abstraction layer the product was a joint commercial effort of getronics and transvirtual systems developer of the wang vs virtualization

of support for the legacy vs line as existing contracts expired and that transvirtual systems would be exclusive reseller of the new vs platform shortly after in august  kpn sold getronics north america to compucom of dallas texas the wang vs product line not actively marketed since the  bankruptcy and a tiny portion of the getronics business survived in use into the st century by  about  to

wang was a wellregarded calculator company wang calculators cost in the midfourfigures used nixie tube readouts performed transcendental functions had varying degrees of programmability and exploited magnetic core memory the  and  calculator models were available as timeshared simultaneous se packages that had a central processing unit the size of a small suitcase connected by cables leading to four individual desktop displaykeyboard units competition included hp which introduced the hp a in  and oldline calculator companies such as monroe and marchant wang calculators were at first sold to scientists and engineers but the company later won a solid niche in financialservices industries which had previously relied on complicated printed tables for mortgages and annuities one perhaps apocryphal story tells of a banker who spotchecked a wang calculator against a mortgage table and found a discrepancy the calculator was right the printed tables were wrong and the companys reputation was made in the early seventies wang believed that calculators would become unprofitable lowmargin commodities and decided to exit the calculator business word processorsedit the wang edit wangs first attempt at a word processor was the wang  announced in late  but not available until  the design consisted of the logic of a wang  calculator hooked up to an oemmanufactured ibm selectric typewriter for keying and printing and dual cassette decks for storage harold koplow who had written the microcode for the wang  and its derivative the wang  rewrote the microcode to perform word processing functions instead of number crunching the operator of a wang  typed text on a conventional ibm selectric keyboard when the return key was pressed the line of text was stored on a cassette tape one cassette held roughly  pages of text and could be played back eg the text retrieved by printing the contents on continuousform paper in the  typewriters print mode the stored text could also be edited using keys on a simple sixkey array basic editing functions included insert delete skip character line and so on the labor and cost savings of this device were immediate and remarkable pages of text no longer had to be retyped to correct simple errors and projects could be worked on stored and then retrieved for use later on the rudimentary wang  machine was the precursor of the wang office information system ois which revolutionized the way typing projects were performed in the american workplace wang oisedit following the wang  harold koplow and david moros made another attempt at designing a word processor they started by first writing the users manual for the product a  boston globe article refers to koplow as a wisecracking rebel who was waiting for dismissal when in  he developed the product that made computers popularly accessible in koplows words dr wang kicked me out of marketing i along with dave moros was relegated to long range planning — lrped this  was tantamount to being fired here is a temporary job until you find another one in some other company although he and moros were told to design a word processing machine they were given no resourcescitation needed they perceived the assignment as busywork they went ahead anyway wrote the manual and convinced an wang to turn it into a real project the word processing machine – the wang  wps – was introduced in june  and was an instant success as was its successor the  wang ois office information system these products were technological breakthroughs they were multiuser systems each workstation looked like a typical terminal but contained its own intel  microprocessor later versions used a z and  kb of ram comparable but lower in power than the original ibm pc which came out in  disk storage was centralized in a master unit and shared by the workstations and connection was via highspeed dual coaxial cable  link multiple ois masters could be networked to each other allowing file sharing among hundreds of users the systems were userfriendly and fairly easy to administer with the latter task often performed by office personnel in an era when most machines required trained administrators early computer modelsedit wang edit on its journey from calculators and word processing to serious data processing wang developed and marketed several lines of small computer system some of which were wordprocessingbased and some of which were dataprocessingbased instead of a clear linear progression the product lines overlapped and in some cases borrowed technology from each other the most identifiable wang minicomputer performing recognizable data processing was the wang  which appeared in may  unlike some other desktop computers such as the hp  it had a crt in a cabinet that also included an integrated computer controlled cassette tape storage unit and keyboard microcoded to run interpretive basic about  systems were shipped in its lifetime and it found wide use in small and mediumsize businesses worldwide the original  was a single user system the improved vp model increased performance more than tenfold and enhanced the language renamed basic the  vp evolved into a desktop computer and larger mvp system to support up to  workstations and utilized commercial disk technologies that appeared in the late s and early s the disk subsystems could be attached to up to  computers giving a theoretical upper limit of  workstations in a single cluster unlike the other product lines such as the vs and ois both described below wang aggressively used value added resellers vars to customize and market  systems one such creative solution deployed dozens of  systems and was developed in conjunction with hawaii and hong kongbased firm algorithms inc it provided paging beeper services for much of the hong kong market in the early s overshadowed by the wang vs the  languished as a costeffective but forgotten solution in the hands of the customers who had it in the late s wang revisited the  series one last time offering  customers a new  cs with bundled maintenance for less than customers were then paying just for maintenance of their aging s the  cs was accompanied by an intel  processor updated disk units and other peripherals most  customers upgraded to the  cs after which wang never again developed or marketed any new  products in  wang reported having about two hundred  systems still under maintenance around the world throughout wang had always offered maintenance services for the  the  basic language was ported to be compiled and run on nonwang hardware and operating systems by at least two companies niakwa inc created a product named npl originally named basicc kerridge computer now a part of adp created a product named kcml both products support dos windows and various unix systems the basic language has been substantially enhanced and extended by both companies to meet modern needs compared to the  wang hardware the compiled solutions improve all factors speed disk space memory user limits by tens to hundreds of times so while wang support for the  is gone many software applications continue to function during the s about  wang t computers were shipped to the ussr due to the afghan war in the s us and cocom export restrictions ended the shipment of wang computers the soviets were in great need of computers in  russian engineers at minpribors schetmash factory in kursk reverse engineered the wang t and created a computer they named the iskra  the cocom restrictions theory though while popular in the west is challenged by some russian computer historians on the basis of the fact that development for the iskra started in  two years before the afghan war one possible reason for this might be a soviet fear of the backdoors in the western hardware it is also significantly different from the wang  in its internals being more inspired by it rather than a direct clone it used the same basic language named tbasic with a few enhancements many research papers reference calculations done on the iskra  the computer won a  state prize later a somewhat scaleddown unix implementation was created for iskra which was widely used in the soviet union but is virtually unknown in the west wang oisedit the wang ois office information system was heavily wp oriented and featured wangs glossary function a glossary was a word processing document that was attached to a workstation which contained shortcuts to frequently typed phrases for example an operator in a law firm could insert the phrase united states constitution into a glossary document and then recall the phrase into a word processing document by pressing the gl key and the letter u thus saving numerous repetitive keystrokes a superset of glossary called decision processing was a system of programming that fitted into the wp model and was designed to be easy to master a simple ifthen program with subroutines could be constructed to perform tedious editing routines and then run on a word processing document while the operator performed other tasks the design goal of glossary and decision processing was that secretaries would be able to use them to extend the functionality of the document management and manipulation provided by the oiscitation needed like the wang  the ois was characterized by evolution into a user system the ois and the vs overlapped features such as dualcoax connections to workstations and printers were common to both system families buried deep in the vs microcode are entire pieces of ois code probably because wp did not figure into the original design of the vs but was added latercitation needed wang also had a line called alliance which was based on the high end ois  hardware architecture it had more powerful software compared to the ois word processing and list processing packages the system was tempest certified leading to global deployment in american embassies after the iran hostage crisis the most significant enhancementcitation needed was in the indexing capabilities of the alliance system documents could be indexed by every word contained in them the database product visual memory permitted every word in each field to be indexed in addition to the advanced indexing features the alliance word processor was also substantially enhancedcitation needed even though the z platform on which it ran forced it to remain as an bit application in a  kb workstation the wang vs computer lineedit the first wang vs computer was introduced in  about the same time as digital equipment corporations vax and continues to be in use  years later its instruction set was compatible with the ibm  series but it did not run any ibm  system software the vs operating system and all system software were built from the ground up to support interactive users as well as batch operations the vs was aimed directly at the business data processing market in general and ibm in particular while many programming languages were available the vs was typically programmed in cobol other languages supported in the vs integrated development environment included assembler cobol  cobol  basic ada rpg ii c pli fortran glossary mabasic speed ii and procedure a scripting language pascal was also supported for io coprocessor development the wang pace professional application creation environment gl and database was used from the mids onward by customers and third party developers to build complex applications sometimes involving many thousands of screens hundreds of distinct application modules and serving many hundreds of users substantial vertical applications were developed for the wang vs by third party software houses throughout the s in cobol pace basic pli and rpg ii the wang office family of applications and wang wp were both popular applications on the vs word processing ran on the vs through services that emulated the ois environment and downloaded the wp software as microcode in wang terminology to vs workstations the press and the industry referred to the class of machines made by wang including the vs as minicomputers and kenneys  book refers to the vs line as minicomputers throughout although some argue that the highend vses and their successors should qualify as mainframes wang avoided this term in his autobiography an wang rather than calling the vs  a mainframe said that it verges on mainframe performance he went on to draw distinction between the mainframes at the high end of ibms line just as detroit would rather sell large cars  so ibm would rather sell mainframes—in which ibm had a virtual monopoly—with the midsized systems in which ibm had not achieved dominance the minicomputer market is still healthy this is good for the customer and good for minicomputer makers wang laboratories positioned the vs line as minicomputers and reflected this in its marketing collateral and press releasescitation needed later models the small vs series launched in approximately  were userinstallable the smallest being physically similar in size to pcs of the era the largest supported an increasingly substantial number of users going after ibmedit an wang felt a personal sense of rivalry with ibm partly as a result of heavyhanded treatment by ibm in  over the rights to his magneticcore patents this encounter formed the subject of a long chapter in wangs own book lessons according to charles c kenney jack connors remembers being in wangs office one day when the doctor pulled out a chart on which he had plotted wangs growth and projected that wang laboratories would overtake ibm sometime in the middle of the s he had kept it a long time says connors and he believed it wang was one of the first computer companies to advertise on television and the first to run an ad during the super bowl in  their first ad literally cast wang laboratories as david and ibm as goliath several years before the famous  apple computer ad a later ad depicted wang laboratories as a helicopter gunship taking aim at ibm wang wanted to compete against ibm as a computer company selling directly to management information system departments before the vs however wang laboratories was not taken seriously as a computer company the calculators word processing systems and ois were sold into individual departments bypassing the corporate dataprocessing decisionmakers the chapter in wangs book dealing with them shows that he saw them only as a beachhead in the fortune  the wang vs was wangs entrée into it departments in his book an wang notes that to sell the vs we aggressively recruited salesmen with strong backgrounds in data processing  who had experience dealing with mis executives and who knew their way around fortune  companies as the vs took hold the word processor and ois lines were phased out the word processing software continued in the form of a loadablemicrocode environment that allowed vs workstations to take on the behavior of traditional wang wp terminals to operate with the vs and use it as a document server wang made inroads into ibm and dec markets in the s but did not have a serious impact on ibms mainframe market due to selflimiting factors even though an wang wanted to compete with ibm too many wang salespeople were incompletely trained on the significant dp capabilities of the vs in many instances the vs ran smaller enterprises up to about  millionyear and in larger organizations found use as a gateway to larger corporate mainframes handling workstation passthrough and massive print services at exxon corporation for instance  topoftheline vss at the houston headquarters were used in the s and into the s to receive mainframe reports and make them viewable online by executives at mellon mortgage  vs systems from the smallest to the largest were used as the enterprise mortgage origination servicing finance documentation and hedge system and also for mainframe gateway services for logon and printing between mellon mortgage and parent mellon bank their network contained  vs systems and the bank portion of the network supported about  wang office users for email report distribution and scheduling at kent and ktec electronics two related houston companies separate vs clusters were the enterprise systems handling distribution manufacturing and accounting with significant edi capability for receiving customer forecasts sending invoices and sending purchase orders and receiving shipping notifications both systems ran the geisco edi package kent which grew to  millionyear ran the arcus distribution software in cobol and ktec which grew to  millionyear ran the caelus mrp system for manufacturing in basic the highwater mark of the vs in the marketplace was probably about  systems operating worldwide at one time in the midtolate s serving at least several million desktop userscitation needed aggressive marketingedit in the late s a british television documentary accused the company of targeting a competitor canadian company aes wordplex in an attempt to take it out of the market however the documentary came to no conclusion regarding this wangs approach was called internally the gas cooker program named after similar programs to give discounts on new gas stoves by trading in an old one wang was accused of targeting wordplex by offering a large discount on wang ois systems with a tradein of wordplex machines regardless of the age or condition of the tradein machine based on its good reputation with users and its program of aggressive discounts wang gained an increasing share of a shrinking market wordplex was subsequently taken over by norsk data word processing market collapseedit the market for standalone word processing systems collapsed with the introduction of the personal computer multimate on the ibm pc replicated the interface and functions of the wang word processor and several other wysiwyg word processing programs also became popular wang did make one last play in this arena producing a dedicated intelbased word processor called the wang office assistant but by the time it appeared the pc with its flexibility of combining word processors with other programs such as spreadsheets had rendered such a specific task machine largely unsellable the digital voice exchangeedit the wang dvx was one of the first integrated switchboard and voicemail systems in the united kingdom it was selected for the dti office automation pilot schemes at the national coal board in about  lawrence e bergeron was instrumental in managing the voice engineering department at wang labscitation needed he promoted the purchase of a vax for realtime signal processing research and created the peripheral signal processor board psp the psp was placed into  racks to handle  phone lines for the dvx digital voice exchange voice prompts were created by a hired voice specialist to give a melodic presentation for the dvx to avoid false triggering of touchtones by the prompts due to inputoutput cross talk notch filters were created to remove the touch tone frequencies from the prompts some of the prompt languages supported were german spanish french british english american english and portuguese internal research on speech recognition was carried out and implemented for discrete word recognition but was never released to the field at one point there were  members of the voice engineering department this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it may  pcs and pc based productsedit despite the release of the  pcs personal computer system and  pcsii models as early as  the history of computing regards the earliest pc as one which contained a microprocessor which the  pcs did not however the selfcontained pcsii incorporated many of the innovations that would later be seen in pcs including the first  inch floppy drives that were especially designed for the pcsii by shugart associates the original wang pcedit an wang had initially refused to develop an ibmcompatible pc due to his personal dislike of ibm even though his son fred had pitched the idea the original wang pc was released april  to counter the ibm pc which had been released the previous august and which had gained wide acceptance in the market for which wang traditionally positioned the ois system it was based on the intel  microprocessor a slightly faster cpu than the ibm pcs  a hardwaresoftware package that permitted the wang pc to act as a terminal to the ois and vs products was available the hardware component the first version was made of two large addin boards called the wloc wang local office connection contained a z processor and  kb of memory one of the distinguishing features of the wang pc was the system software similar to the wang vs minicomputer the command line was not immediately evident everything could be run from menus including formatting a disk furthermore each item on a menu could be explained by hitting a dedicated help key on the keyboard this software was later sold in msdos compatible form for non wang hardware the wang word processing software was also very graphical the keyboard had  functionkeys and unlike wordstar the popular word processor of the day control key combinations were not required to navigate the system the fkeys had the word processing functions labeled on them however the biggest stumbling block was that – despite being a fully compliant msdos system – it was not compatible with the ibm pc at the hardware level this was a problem because msdos was rarely used as anything more than a simple program loader complex software spreadsheets flight simulator etc could only obtain acceptable performance by direct manipulation of the hardware wang used a bit data bus instead of the bit data bus used by ibm arguing that applications would run much faster since most operations required io disk screen keyboard printer with this bit design wang used peripheral hardware devices such as the wang pc display adapter that were not compatible with their counterparts in the ibm pc line this meant that the vast library of software available for the ibm pc could not be directly run on the wang pc only those programs that were either written specifically for the wang pc or ported from the ibm pc were available a basic word processing package developed by wang and microsofts multiplan spreadsheet were the two commonly marketed software products lotus  and dbase ii were also available this dearth of application software led to the early demise of the original wang pc and it was replaced by an intel  based product that was fully plug compatible with the ibm pc the unique system software was available at extra cost most wang pcs were released with a monochrome graphics adapter that supported a single video mode with text and graphics planes that could be scrolled independently unlike ibmcompatible pcs of the time which required selecting a specific video mode to allow graphics a color graphics adapter and wangbranded color monitor were also available an ergonomic feature of the wang pc was the monitor arm that clamped to the desk and held the monitor above and a system clamp that attached to the side of the desk and held the rather large computer box by using these there was nothing on the desktop

and removed july  learn how and when to remove this template message after it became clear that it had been a mistake to ignore the issue of pc compatibility wang belatedly released an emulation board for wang pc that enabled operation of many pc compatible software packages the board accomplished this by monitoring all io and memory transactions visible in those days before northsouth bridge chips to any board plugged into a slot on the expansion bus and generating a nonmaskable interrupt nmi whenever an operation was deemed to involve an incompatible device requiring emulation for example the floppy controller circuitry on the wang pc was similar to that of the ibm pc but involved enough design differences that pc compatible software attempting to manipulate it directly would fail wangs pc emulation hardware would detect io and memory operations involving the addresses associated with the floppy controller in the ibm pc and generate an nmi the nmi handler would immediately be activated the exception vector having been appropriated during system init to point to rom routines on the emulation board instead of the nmi routine in the pc bios and would then update an internal representation of the ibm pc floppy controller and manipulate the real controller to reflect its state reads were satisfied in a similar way by forcing an nmi decoding the machine code indicated by the instruction pointer at the time of the fault and then obtaining the desired info and updating the cpu registers accordingly before resuming the executing program the pc emulation board thus enabled execution of an impressive number of applications by presenting virtualized pc compatible hardware devices to them a monochrome textonly video controller a floppy controller uarts dma controller parallel port keyboard controller etc ibmpc emulation on the based wang pc was working fairly reliably when ibm released their based pcat wangs answer was the based wang apc advanced professional computer which not only perpetuated the pc incompatibility at the hardware level but revealed an unexpected wrinkle in the hitherto successful pc emulation strategy the  decoded and executed instructions onthefly and was therefore able to respond to nmi on every instruction boundary but the  decoded and queued instructions in a pipeline whose depth varied with each cpumask stepping but which always prevented timely nmi execution wangs engineers came up with and later patented a rather devious instructionprefetch monitor that managed to cope with that challenge at the expense of a modest performance penalty further iterations of the pc line were released commencing with the model number pc these later models booted directly into msdos or another compatible operating system and supported isastandard expansion cards this pc still wasnt entirely ibm pc standard as the keyboard although being a standard pcat device allowed for vs compatibility with  function keys rather than the normal  and a number of wang vs specific keys there was also a slight difference in cpu interrupts from ibm standard so some software had compatibility issues vs connectivity was via an isa based vsterminal card or via lightspeed the networked vs terminal emulator over an ipxbased ethernet connection originally the pc came with a wang specific hercules graphics card and compatible screen which also acted as a keyboard extension meaning the base unit could be kept some distance from the screen this was later replaced with an ega card and screen around  wang released the pc and pc which were intel  based clocked at  mhz and  mhz respectively they used the same vs compatible keyboard as the pc they had a maximum of  megabytes of ram and came with vga screens as standard they were generally supplied with msdos and windows  the  had an interestingaccording to whom bug where occasionally the machine would just freeze entirely and not even boot up if turned off and on at the mains although it would power on the bios just didnt start the solution was to turn on the machine at the mains and hold down the power button for  seconds at which point it would normally start it was suggestedby whom that this was due to an undervalued capacitor in the power circuit this problem appeared to be resolved in the  which had a different psu in  wang marketed a pccompatible based on the intel sx processor which they called the alliance cd it was clocked at  mhz and had a socket for an  math coprocessor it came with  megabytes of installed ram and was expandable to  megabytes using simm memory cards a wang invention that became an industry standard it had a  megabyte floppy disk drive an internal  megabyte hard disk and a cdrom drive five expansion slots were builtin it came with msdos and windows  operating systems in  wang released the slimline alliance cd  based pc in the united kingdom these machines used standard pcat keyboards and were entirely ibm compatible shipping with msdos  and windows  as standard the only unusual feature was that system bios settings and the realtime clock were maintained by four standard aa batteries as opposed to a more typical solution – such as a specialty battery pack or lithium battery while originally offered with a  mhz dx the cd could be upgraded to later socket  processors such as the dx through the use of third party cpu upgrade adapters or interposers this allowed upgrading to speeds beyond  mhz without overclocking or alternatively the potential for speeds in excess of  mhz with overclocking dependent on the processor used wang freestyleedit wang freestyle was a  product consisting of a tablet and stylus for written annotation of any file that could be displayed on the pc a phone handset for voice annotation but not voice communication demonstrated strongly in conjunction with the tablet for explaining the text annotations email via wang office of the resulting document set the product was not a success in anything except marketing terms a description of the system at the university of southern california usc shows the symptoms of the failure the  million usc system includes a vs  midrange computer  image workstations  with freestyle capabilities a laser printer five endorsers and five document scanners initial storage for document images is eight gigabytes of magnetic disk storage only  of the stations were freestyle stations the system was so costly even in the context of a wang integrated imaging system that freestyle was only affordable for highly specialized or very senior staff apart from usc unusual in that it was deployed at clerical level it was sold as a clevel tool for c grades to communicate with other c grades this reduced the marketplace immediately from the mass market where the system would have been effective decline and falledit former wang headquarters in lowell massachusetts the building is now called cross point and is anchored by motorola the horizontal windows at the top of the middle tower housed the executive offices including an wangs wang labs would be only one of a large number of new englandbased computer companies that would falter in the late s and s marking the end of the massachusetts miracle for instance the struggling digital equipment corporation also significantly downsized in the s and was acquired by compaq a common view within the pc community is that wang labs failed because it specialized in computers designed specifically for word processing and did not foresee and was unable to compete against generalpurpose personal computers with word processing software in the s word processing was not actually the mainstay of wangs business by the time desktop computers began to gain in popularity although wang manufactured desktops its main business by the s was its vs line of minicomputer and midframe systems the market for these minicomputers was ultimately conquered by enhanced microcomputers like the apple macintosh and the wintel pc on one end and sun ibm and hewlettpackard servers on the other end an wangs insistence that his son fred wang succeed him contributed to the companys failure fred wang was a business school graduate but by almost any definition wrote charles c kenney unsuited for the job in which his father had placed him his assignment first as head of research and development then as president of the company led to resignations by key rd and business personnel amid declining revenues john f cunningham an year employee of the firm resigned as president and coo of wang labs to become chairman and chief executive of computer consoles inc cunningham resigned due to disagreement with an wang on how to pull the company out of the slump as well as being upset that fred wang was positioned as the successor an instance of nepotism one turning point occurred when fred wang was head of rd on october   wang laboratories announced fourteen major hardware and software products and promised dates of delivery the announcement was well received but even at the time there were warning signs according to datamation wang announced everything but the kitchen sink and if you could attach the kitchen sink to a personal computer they would announce that too very few of the products were close to completion and many of them had not even been started all were delivered late and some were never delivered at all in retrospect this was referred to as the vaporware announcement and it hurt the credibility of fred wang and wang laboratories in  fred wang then  years old was installed as president of wang laboratories however the companys fortunes continued to decline unlike most computer companies that funded their growth by issuing stock an wang had used debt to avoid further dilution of family control of the company by august  that debt was causing conflicts with its creditors on august   an wang fired his son richard w miller replaced him as the president of wang laboratories having been with the company since  miller announced in december  that the company would start to embrace established software standards rather than use traditional proprietary designs an wang died in march  and miller took on the additional posts of chairman and ceo the company underwent massive restructuring and in august  it eliminated its bank debt but still ended the year with a record net loss in november  wang announced their first personal computers running unix previously wangs presence in the unix and open systems markets had been modest in  wang developed a new typesetting system in conjunction with arlington mabased texet corp the system used xerox printers and unix workstations from sun but the product vanished before coming to market partially because few wang employees could use or support unix unix ran on the vs – interactive systems first ported inix their ibm version of sys unix to run in a vsos virtual machine circa  and then wang engineers completed the port so that it ran native on the vs hardware soon thereafter – but performance was always subpar as unix was never a good fit for the inherently batchmode
