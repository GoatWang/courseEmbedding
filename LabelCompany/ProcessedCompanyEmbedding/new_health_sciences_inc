under anaerobic conditions removing o during storage removes the primary “fuel” for oxidative stress previous published research has demonstrated that preventing oxidative damage can alleviate many of the signs associated with storage lesion development including anaerobic storage has been shown to improved maintenance of dpg reduce donor variability in rbc storage characteristics improved deformability compared to conventionally stored rbc decrease iron overload leading to higher proportion of viable rbc per unit transfused new health sciences continues to invest significant resources in developing the technology and demonstrating both its effect on the characteristics of rbcs during storage and eventually in clinical usage with patients to learn more about the storage lesions and
