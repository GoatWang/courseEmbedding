today’s presentation and in our k and subsequent sec filings we’ll also discuss items that do not conform to generally accepted accounting principles we’ve reconciled those measures to gaap measures in the appendix of the slide presentation and in the supplemental schedules of the earnings release with that i’ll hand the call over to frank frank bisignano thank you everyone it’s a pleasure to be on the call today as we have in the past i’ll open with a brief recap of the first quarter’s financial results and then i’ll update you on some of our key initiatives our adjusted eps improved by  to  per diluted share segment revenue growth was  constant currency in the quarter and was fairly evenly spread across all segments segment ebitda increased  constant currency in the quarter free cash flow was healthy at  million in the quarter that’s up  million or  over the prior year quarter and since the beginning of the year we’ve refinanced over  billion of debt as we continuously seek to lower our borrowing cost and extend maturities now i’d like to update you on few key initiatives let me start with the enterprise client space i feel great about our enterprise sales force and its continued ability to sell our broad array of products across all our businesses around the world i’ll start with the deal that jack henry announced last week a strategic partnership between us jack henry and pscu this is very exciting to us to partner with these two great organizations to help jack henry expand its services and pscu has been a fantastic partner and client of us for more than  years this deal really exemplifies the collaborative nature of first data with its partners moving to processor for both debit and credit for jack henry and jack henry has agreed to become referral partner for our star network this sizeable transaction represents a takeaway from competitors in the network and card processing space as well as an outsourcing win for first data we expanded our partnership with first citizens bank a longtime client has decided to leverage our single issuer processing platform and convert their credit portfolios to first data we started processing installment loans from barclays in the unites states we also began processing loans on behalf of our client citizens bank for their vivint smart home loan portfolio we won a significant end ph deal to be the payment provider for a large pay bank ph in the ecommerce space we’ve recently expanded our relationship with mcdonald’s by payment enabling their orderahead app and we’re partnering with sunoco on the roll out of their mobile payment strategy we’ve been very successful at renewing our bank acquiring partnerships in recent years i’m pleased to report that so far this year we’ve renewed important acquiring agreements with three significant banking partners including independent bankersbank and pinnacle bank i also like to highlight a deal where we renewed and significantly expanded our acquiring partnership relationship at td bank with its more than  branches on this call and the past several calls we talked a lot about our success in the enterprise space we will come back to you later this year with metrics that help you to mention the size and duration of our enterprise backlog of signed but not implemented wins next on the smb direct business we completed another quarter where we saw progress across a number of metrics including better sales force and merchant retention the initiatives that we put in place last year are working and we remain confident that we will continue to see steady improvement in this portion of our gbs north america business i am pleased with the progress that we’re making in the isv space while it’s still early days we’ve seen solid interest from developers and becoming evident at our clover platform is the key differentiator for them since we last spoke in february we’ve been busy signing up isv partners like micamp ph and breadcrumb in the popular restaurant vertical and the inventory software management software provider shopventory in the ecommerce space we have also new isv partnerships with flywire and barracuda signnow and lastly i’d be remiss if i didn’t touch on the momentum we are seeing in all of our financial businesses for example one of our largest gfs clients in asiapac recently acquired new portfolios and the client has chosen first data to be their provider for these portfolios now let me spend a moment discussing our recently announced acquisition acculynk acculynk is the leader in online debit solutions in particular acculynk solution set is the sweet spot of helping merchants lower their cost of acceptance we have worked with and admired this company for a few years and in the short time since our acquisition announcement it’s clear that first data will be an accelerator for acculynk and its product set now before i close i think it’s important to briefly discuss our us jv acquiring business while the lead flow softness in this business has been well telegraphed it’s important to also know that we’re in close partnership with all three banks to improve results and are very confident that the current weakness is transitory himanshu will provide more details on this later in closing we feel really good about our momentum over the remainder of the year we are weighing enterprise mandates across all three of our segments whether its new logos or expanding existing relationships and i honestly believe we can and will get even better at it we are in the early innings in developing an isv channel and are encouraged by the progress we are making in the level of interest in our products and capabilities from the developer community the smb business within gbs north america is on path to recovery and we will stay focused on that business each of our international regions is seeing great business momentum we are as always driving productivity and expect positive operating leverage for the full year we continue to manage our balance sheet by paying down debt and opportunistically refinancing and for these reasons our confidence in meeting our guidance for  and in the medium is high now i’d like to turn it over to himanshu himanshu patel thank you frank good morning good afternoon everyone i’m going to start on slide  the summary of our q results i’ll focus on the nongaap and segment financial metrics which more closely reflects how we manage our business segment revenue which modifies consolidated revenue primarily to exclude certain passthrough costs and to proportionately consolidate the revenue of our major joint ventures was  billion in the quarter this was up  on a reported basis or up  excluding the impacts from currency and the divestiture of the australian atm business in september  q adjusted net income a measure of earnings that excludes amortization of acquisition related intangibles stockbased compensation costs restructuring costs and other items was  million or  per diluted share up  versus the prior year quarter the improvement was driven primarily by improved operating results and lower interest expense q total segment ebitda of  million was up  on the reported basis or up  excluding the impacts from currency and the australian atm divestiture both our revenue growth and ebitda growth in q were negatively impacted by previously disclosed benefits reflected in the prior year’s q results including an  million licensing fee resolution in gfs latin america last year the revenue tailwind associated with interchange rate changes in gbs emea last year one extra calendar day of transaction revenue from leap year last year and finally on the expense side of the ledger last year period saw a  million positive impact from the devaluation of the peso in our latin american operations we estimate that excluding these items from the prior year period our constant currency growth rates for both revenue and ebitda in q of this year was comfortably within our annual guidance growth rate ranges for these two metrics despite the items i just mentioned which do create noise in yearoveryear comparability our reported q  segment ebitda margin improved slightly by  basis points to  in the quarter during the quarter we generated  million of free cash flow in what typically is a seasonally weaker cash flow quarter that is up  million over the prior year period i’ll discuss cash flow in detail in the later slides slide  is an information slide that summarizes financial performance for q including a breakout of results by segment you can see on this slide for example that our  total segment revenue growth reflects  growth in gbs  in gfs and  in nss let’s discuss the segments separately beginning with gbs in slide  and slide  gbs q segment revenue of  million was up  on a reported basis or up  excluding the impacts from currency and the australian atm divestiture gbs segment ebitda grew  on a reported basis or  excluding the impacts from currency and the australian atm divestiture and its reported margin declined  basis points to  let me discuss gbs revenue results by region gbs north american revenue grew  in q this figure includes  to  basis points in estimated benefits from the clover accounting change net of the impact of leap year in the prior year period therefore we believe the underlying growth in gbs north america was slightly better than q ’s  level but below the reported  figure in this quarter transaction growth remains solid at  i think it would be helpful to provide some color on the gbs north american results by distribution channel because there was a measurable difference in the growth rate performance this quarter between our jv channel and what i’ll collectively refer to as our nonjv channels which primarily includes our smb direct business our midmarket business our enterprise business and our iso business our revenue from the jv channels which makes up over  of gbm north america’s annual revenue declined modestly in q the revenue decline primarily reflects the impact of the lead flow softening that we started seeing in the second half of last year from our jvs due to some of the welltelegraphed issues in the media we continue to believe that our jvs are fundamentally good businesses that are going through a transitory soft patch we know that lead flow at our jvs has improved in q  versus the fairly weak q levels we saw although the softness in our jv revenue growth is likely to take the few quarters to recover the remaining portion of our gbs north american business or what i refer to as our nonjv channels collectively posted low to mid single digit growth in q led by strength in our enterprise and midmarket businesses overall our message on gbs north america remains unchanged we expect a gradual recovery in this business underpinned nearterm by the strengthening of our nonjv channels moving to results outside of north america gbs emea revenue declined  on a constant currency basis however we estimate this units underlying constant currency revenue growth to be positive midsingledigit when normalizing to exclude items such as the emea interchange rate reduction benefit in the yearago quarter we believe we have a solid business in gbs emea gbs latin america continues to be an outstanding performer this constant currency revenue grew  in the quarter driven by the ongoing growth of our brazilian acquiring business as well as strong growth in argentina driven by good transaction growth and inflation we remain bullish about our ability to continue to post doubledigit constant currency growth in this geography gbs apac revenue grew  constant currency and excluding the impact of the australian atm divestiture this divestiture coupled with the improved growth that we are announcing in india and across several of our smaller markets in the region has made us increasingly comfortable in the growth outlook of our gbs apac business let’s turn to gfs covered on slide  and  gfs q segment revenue was  million representing growth of  or a healthy  excluding currency impacts gfs segment ebitda was  million flat on a reported basis or up  on a constant currency basis gfs reported margin declined  basis points to  gfs north american revenue grew  in the quarter we continue to see good midsingledigit growth in credit and retail processing driven by new business and internal growth within output services our plastic card personalization business continues to see notably lower volumes as it did in the latter part of  we believe volume declines in the card personalization business will moderate in the second half of this year as the industry works through the hangover effect of strong emv related card reissuance gfs emea revenue grew  on a constant currency basis in q primarily driven by new business internal growth and increased professional services revenue primarily in the uk gfs latin america grew  on a constant currency basis in q strong growth in argentina and colombia was partly offset by the benefit from the previously disclosed  million licensing fee resolution in the prior year gfs apac grew  on a constant currency basis in the quarter driven by new business and internal growth primarily in australia the pipeline of potential new contract wins in gfs both in the us and each of our three international regions is robust please turn to slide  to cover nss nss q segment revenue was  million up  from the prior year nss q segment ebitda was  million up  and its margins improved  basis points to  let me talk a little bit about the three main business lines within nss eft network solutions revenue was flat as transaction growth was offset by modest yield decline we remain excited about star and expect the business to see growth from the continued rollout of our new product enhancements signature and pinless and from new wins in the coming quarters security and fraud solutions revenues were up  in the quarter reflecting midteens growth in our core security and fraud products partly offset by highsingledigit decline in telecheck revenue stored value network revenue was up  driven by solid growth in our open loop money network payroll card business moving to free cash flow shown on slide  we think free cash flow largely as cash flow from operations less capex and distributions to minority interests we provide reconciliation of cash flow from operations to free cash flow in the appendix of the slide deck this table on slide  walks you from total segment ebitda to free cash flow we had a healthy cash flow quarter in q with free cash flow coming in at  million the improvement in free cash flow this quarter was primarily driven by improved operating results as well as improved working capital the working capital results can vary from quartertoquarter we should expect some lumpiness there over the course of the year i’d also like to draw your attention to the second row of this table cash interest payments where you see repaid  million in cash interest in q two things to note on this first as you can see in the call out box at the bottom of the slide we expect fullyear cash interest to be about  million which if you do the math will imply lower quarterly cash interest costs over the remaining three quarters of  relative to the q level second just a clarification on the  million yearoveryear increase in cash interest in q  this negative comparison should not occur in any of the remaining quarters of  the increase this quarter primarily reflects unusually depressed yearago cash interest that resulted from the significant early debt pay off and refinancing activities we did in the fourth quarter of  shortly after our october  ipo which served to effectively pull cash interest costs from q  into q  so over the remainder of the year we expect to see quarterly yearoveryear improvement in cash interest payment now let’s discussed our balance sheet slide  lays out our debt balance and presents it at the end of  and at the end of the first quarter of  net debt declined by  million in q  given our performance in paying down debt over the last three quarters of  that may come as a surprise in our net debt declined only marginally this quarter despite generating  million of free cash flow there were three primary reasons for this first our capital lease balance which first data includes in its net debt calculation increased  million in q  and this was driven by the renewal of a few particularly large multiyear technology vendor lease contracts second we incurred approximately  million in debt refinancing costs which show up in cash flow from financing in the cash flow statement and therefore are not part of free cash flow debt refinancing costs of this magnitude are typically only incurred when we refinance or repay one of our bonds like we did this past quarter we do not expect to incur debt refinancing costs of similar magnitude in the near future third in q we incurred approximately  million in cash costs related to withholding taxes that we pay on vested employee stock compensation which tends to be seasonally high in q this is another cost that shows up in cash flow from financing in the cash flow statement and therefore is not part of free cash flow as an additional insight when we paid the withholding taxes for vested employee stock compensation we withhold shares from the employees’ grant so we are essentially buying back shares with that cash i note that if you look back at q  it was also a quarter when net debt reduction was well below free cash generation and it was for many of the same reasons i just cited in that quarter as well yet we were still able to reduced net debt by over  billion last year lastly our leverage ratio defined as net debttoebitda is  times down modestly from yearend and our coverage ratio using  cash interest guidance is now  times turning to slide  we provide color on recent refinancing activity and our debt maturities we continue to be opportunistic in the market on our fourth quarter call we discussed the january refinancing of  billion of  first lien bonds due in  we replaced those bonds with  billion of amortizing term loan debt ph at libor plus  basis points then in april we announced that we refinanced  billion of term loans savings  basis points in interest and extending the maturity from  to  you can also see from this page that we have no significant maturities until the  billion of amortizing term loans mature in june of  lastly as mentioned by frank we reiterate the financial guidance we provided at our investor day as a reminder we stated our guidance for fullyear  as the following constant currency growth excluding the divested in australian atm business to be  to  for segment revenue and  to  for segment ebitda adjusted eps growth of approximately  and  free cash flow to be in excess of  billion and we also said that we expect the second half of the year to be stronger than the first half in closing we feel good about our business and financial outlook our us merchant acquiring business is seeing healthy foundational improvements our global enterprise business which covers gfs gbs and nss is moving from strength to strength and we are clearly taking share in this space in our view each of our three international regions are pointing to healthy growth in the balance of this year and we are maintaining a right balance of expense discipline to ensure positive operating leverage and all of this coupled with the significant improvements we have made to our balance sheet should allow us to generate substantial free cash flow in the coming quarters and years which we plan to use to primarily delever the balance sheet andor for strategic opportunities with that let me hand it back to the operator to open it up for qa questionandanswer session operator operator instructions the first question comes from darrin peller of barclays please go ahead darrin peller all right thanks guys nice job just want to start off look gbs revenue did come in better than our estimate despite obviously some concerns around tough comps and with the jvs as well just to be clear i know you mentioned lead flow is improving should revenue headwinds be similar to the first quarter levels because it will take longer i know you said revenue made through a couple of quarters and then just from your conversations with them is that just pentup demand and then frank just to be clear can you just give us more  level of comfort on these jvs in the sense that your comfort level at both your largest partners continue to look at these structures as the way of they want to handle merchant acquiring business going forward despite any of the challenges they’ve had and i know it had very  nothing to do with the jvs specifically but just to reiterate your view on them thanks guys frank bisignano yes why don’t i start on the jvs and my view on them and our view on them the first thing i’d say is we in my tenure here and i can’t talk about before me have never had as closer relationship with our bank partners as we do today and so it is quite common for us to be talking at the senior most levels about how to improve our business on at least a monthly basis that meeting myself with senior people at the institutions and really very focused on how to add value to both institutions so i would say we feel very very strong about these partnerships i think if you ask those banks they’d tell you the same exact thing and for that we think they have great opportunity obviously everybody knows the media events that occurred and that’s just one element of it but we have a lot of partnership going on and it’s deep and it’s close and i talk to guys who are on these businesses and these places all the time so i feel very very good about it and the best we felt since we’ve been in the company about how they act how we act as partners together himanshu patel and darrin your question on lead flows so our comment on lead flow sequentially improving was deliberate we did see a noticeable improvement from the fourth quarter level above and beyond normal seasonality that said as you can imagine there are multiple factors that go into the revenue print for any of our distribution channels lead flow was the one we highlighted because it was the main item that actually change all of the other core kbis in the businesses has been fairly healthy so it’s hard to exactly call the timing on these things but i would say in short it’s sort of behaving as we would have expected in q so… darrin peller all right that’s helpful himanshu just a quick followup now and then i’ll turn it back to the queue but the list of variables that impacted the quarter from a tough comp standpoint or discrete items there is just a fair amount of them and i think without them growth would have even been obviously better on the top line can you just remind us those things i mean those interchange pricing that are touch comps some others like emv anything else we should remember and how much those were himanshu patel yes your big items are we had a  million good guy in gfs latin america in the yearago period that was related to a licensing fee resolution those happen by the way pretty regularly in our business it was just that was a lumpy one that was large so we called it out last year number two we also had leap year which is a comparability issue on a yearoveryear basis obviously for everyone not just first data number three there was if you remember it european interchange rates were altered over the course of  a big change actually happened in december of  that led many acquirers to have a sort of an overly strong set of net revenue in kind of q of  so we’re facing a comp related to that and those are kind of the main items that that we’d call out related to our top line on our expenses which does not impact our top line there was also a  million benefit from the argentine peso devaluation which shows up as a  essentially a benefit to first data’s expense line because we’re in a net asset position on some us dollar denominated assets in that business but that doesn’t affect revenue darrin peller right all right that’s helpful guys nice job thanks again operator the next question comes from ashwin shirvaikar from citigroup please go ahead ashwin shirvaikar thanks good morning frank himanshu good quarter my first question is just taking that last one forward the cadence of how revenues and ebitda might pan out as we look at the rest of the year if you could kind of take into account i guess the benefit of clover accounting will that be ratable timing of the recovery of jv channel easier emv comps so putting it altogether should we in general expect sequential improvement as the year progresses himanshu patel well look ashwin i don’t want to provide explicit quarterly guidance but we’ve obviously given some texture by saying first half was going to be softer in terms of growth rate versus the second half so you got a data point right there your other question there are no  there is always yearoveryear comparability noise issues in any given quarter the list of items in q was particularly large i wouldn’t say the items are that large in q so it should be more of a normal quarter and then obviously we have good business fundamentals going on that aren’t on the pl we have a very good enterprise business that is ramping up we talked to you guys over the last several quarters about a handful of new merchant acquiring bank rsa partnerships which are call it somewhere between  to  ramp but definitely not at full speed and we’ve got some good turnarounds happening in gbs north america our nonjv channel some of which you guys saw on the current quarter so it’s the collective of all of those that’s influencing our comment that second half would be better than the first half obviously the jvs are a little bit of an unknown right now but as i mentioned one of the most critical things we’ve been watching in lead flow and that did show a movement in the right direction in q ashwin shirvaikar that’s good to hear and then in terms of gbs transaction and revenue growth obviously one element you have dealt with is a sort of large merchant weakness related specifically to store shutdowns and lower mall traffic can you give me comment on the offset to that which is growth of omnicommerce ecommerce how’s that business doing for you and what’s the overlap of your omnicommerce work specific to your large merchant exposure himanshu patel so you should think about first data’s ecommerce business is having a really good balance between merchants that our customers of ours on physical point of sale as well as online we also have a lot of wholesale ecom relationships for large ecom only clients so there are not necessarily omnichannel but we’ve got a lot of get exposure there but i think the bigger point i’d make is all of that for the most part shows up when you talk about big box retailers and the weakness there in the first data’s gbs enterprise business and one of the things we called out deliberately in this quarter was you saw strength in our midmarket and enterprise business this is  were really redraw ph of lot of the strength in our nonjv channel and so  i think that’s reflecting the collective benefit over two years of us not losing a lot of business or any business in that space and us generally winning new customers in that space ashwin shirvaikar got it thank you operator the next question comes from tim willi of wells fargo please go ahead timothy willi thank you and good morning i had two questions around gbs i guess first was in the ongoing efforts to improve sort of the direct north american sales channels that you’ve been working on now for two to three quarters could you talk about anything you sort of learned midstride that you know where you’d find within particular geographies or verticals around attrition retention best practices that you’ve been able to find and employ it you still think to further add to the progress you’re seeing are there any major learning’s out there so far frank bisignano yes i just start off with  i commented was that one sales force attrition is down two i think our client smb attrition’s probably at the best level that i’ve seen in the company since i’ve been here we are doing a lot around that space but i think when you look at the company also have to look at clover has had an impact and we see  i mean talk about the isv community really thinking about clover now that we’ve opened it up and a tremendous amount of change in people’s emotion around it where i was a competitor before and now i can be a partner i think that’s a big strategic change that that isn’t in the number yet you won’t probably see the outcome till next year in the number but we’ve seen that that has a lot of desire and then i do think when you think about us you should think about alliances and we’re going to talk about those and then the rest of our business and all the work we’re doing in the enterprise space is paying off and that’s why i talk about  us talking about it in the future to you all and we have real traction in the midmarket so i think across the board we feel like all the seeds we planted that we have a bunch of good outcomes coming up in our north america business timothy willi great and then the followup was that you mentioned at sort of the initial i guess signs of success in isv and how clover is coming to play there and i guess as you think about the  that market and everybody just sort of trying to get into that is clover and your opinion probably the single differentiator versus the competition is it size and scale the first data that the developers have really come to recognize just sort of curious there’s a way to sort of think about what is the real winning point here on a go forward basis in that channel frank bisignano i think it’s a few things first of all we hadn’t focused on that channel ever in the company and in fact we’ve changed how this company operates if you look at the jack henry deal and that would have been a deal that was done that’s back to collaboration we found out that the isv community wouldn’t build to a closed clover but it build to an open clover so i think that’s one component of it i think our distribution breadth and ability to help developers be able to get the places they couldn’t get to before is really very attractive to them we can source a lead to the best available place and that is the unique position where you have once again all these things take time but we are completely engaged in it and then we have global connectivity so i think early innings as i like to say very very early innings but the receptivity is large and we’re executing on the field in all three of these cases that i highlight timothy willi great thank you very much for the time operator the next question comes from lisa ellis of bernstein please go ahead lisa ellis hi all right first question on margins with margins up about  basis points yeartoyear is the implication that much of the cost program that was a big focus last year is complete and from here any additional margin expansion will largely just to be leverage in the business frank bisignano no no as you know we love to look at our technology investment and our process and the side how it was continuously drive operating efficiency and you will watch us continually stay at that so i mean yes it was a small margin improvement but as we talked about there a whole lot of factors in the quarter so quarterly view but you should expect us to stay vigilant cost opportunity now we are not doing anything at the expense of growth or the expense of investment in technology but we continue to work on how to improve our uor ph and drive expenses out himanshu patel lisa i would just also say if you step back and take the collective of all of our margin commentary over the last six quarters we’ve been talking about the rate of yearoveryear margin expansion moderating at the same time if you look at our guidance right ebitda growth rate is higher than revenue growth rate so we are clearly implying margin expansion on a fullyear basis and if you were do the math that’s greater than what we get in q what happened in q is worth understanding that list of comparability issues that darrin ask about but i mentioned earlier whether the natheling ph our licensing fee resolution or leap year or emea interchange most of those things have exceptionally high contribution margins so you have a comp issue on margins as well so most of the things don’t really have a lot of cost associated with it so i wouldn’t read too much into the  basis points on a yearoveryear basis that said the rate of margin expansion for the company definitely going to be added different rhythm this year than what it was over the last year but i’d say that will be consistent with our guidance for the fullyear lisa ellis perfect and then my followup just on the acculynk acquisition exciting little tuckin can you just give us a sense for the timing in the magnitude of that i guess it going to impact cash flow for the year and then also sort of  how we should think about it sitting within the overall first data portfolio was that going to be part of nss and part of that product suite just a little more color there would be helpful himanshu patel yes so your characterization of it is right it’s a very strategic tuckin for us it will impact our financial starting in q but there is really very negligible impact from it today because it’s obviously a very small company but really the purchase price will actually show up in q it will not show up in free cash flow it will show up as an acquisition obviously so that’s how it will impact our financials in terms of what division it shows up in  the results will be  over time you will see it more prevalently but it will all be in gbs lisa ellis perfect thank you operator the next question comes from ramsey elassal of jefferies please go ahead ramsey elassal hi guys i wanted to ask about just your view on the mediumterm trend for the revenue per transaction metric in your gbs business can you just kind of parse out for us the different drivers over time and what do you expect that to settle in himanshu patel yes ramsey it’s a tough one for us to opine on mediumterm because unlike any other publicly traded acquire that you’re potentially using as a comp the diversity of first data’s gbs north american business is second to none so we don’t have a large smb business we have that plus a very large enterprise business we also have proportionate consolidation with alliances which affects our calculation so we really don’t manage the business to rpt that’s probably the most useful statement to provide you guys we manage the business to total revenue growth in terms of revenue we don’t really think about rpt now rpt sometimes can be a useful piece of analysis for you guys as you’re trying to unpack what happen on pricing but as we talked about in many of our previous calls a very large portion of rpt changes that first data have nothing to do with pricing they can often have a lot more to do with mix that would be channel mix and customer mix being large client versus small client so in an ideal world you’d say revenue is growing transaction is growing rpt is growing but you can have many situations where revenue grows but rpt doesn’t grow and that would really just be largely impacted by lot of the items we are talking about it ramsey elassal okay that was a good segue into my next question which was on pricing in north america gbs direct any  have you’ve been able to implement any selective pricing actions is that showing up a number is that something we can expect to contribute as the year goes on himanshu patel yes we won’t talk regularly about any individual pricing actions because we have competing distribution channels inside of gbs north america and each one had its own pricing strategy for lack of a better world but i think it’s fair to say our foot was off the accelerator pedal on pricing actions for the better part of the last  months as we were trying to really work on attrition in our smb direct business and i think it’s fair to say that as attrition has improved and it is that level where  would likely to get better but quite honestly it’s actually at a pretty decent level now i think it gives us the privilege to start considering surgical price activity going forward we are not going to be anything that’s blunt or peanut butter we’re going to be very thoughtful and surgical about it so you’ll see some of that sprinkled in over the course of this year more of it next year but i’d consider more bau in terms of how we were do that i don’t think you’re going to see any one big quarter we notice on impacts on that ramsey elassal terrific thanks a lot operator the next question comes from andrew jeffrey of suntrust please go ahead andrew jeffrey hi guys good morning thanks for taking the question frank i wonder if you could just sort of qualitatively talk about your data proposition in  pardon me your value proposition in the enterprise offering and i’m thinking specifically in gbs so the resonate you have the pitch around lowering merchant card acceptance cost versus driving value and i’m thinking about security and tokenization and other things like that is contributing to the success we are having in enterprise sale sort of the relative importance of the different value props that first data brings to the table frank bisignano yes i take  first of all when we talk enterprise sales we are talking about the whole comp for me and so there is many times that were any large institutions office and we are bringing the full power of the franchise we do recognize that generally the lower cost of acceptance is a high value prop and that you could look across our product set it could be a retail private label card it could be the debit network it could be gift card we had some actual big telecheck win this quarter even so telecheck even still exist as lowering in cost of acceptance and enhance applicability we’ve modernized that product we on the frontend think we have very good security solutions we think in the middle to the back our fraud product and our talent against fraud is very large we do believe that we have an industryleading position when you take all of that so it’s lower the cost of acceptance global connectivity we have the best global connectivity you’re going to find out there we have the best security in the industry and bringing all of that to the client’s office so along with information in gift really is a powerful offering and i just like to make a point that when we talk enterprise we talk full firm one of the big things we’re darn product of is this is no longer a siloed company and we show up with big partnership model how to win business andrew jeffrey thank you very much operator and the next question comes from george mihalos of cowen please go ahead george mihalos great good morning guys just wanted to start off you talked positively about some of the progress even if it is early days on the isv channel side just curious if there are any metrics you can share with us where we can kind of gauge the progress going forward in  and then himanshu the north america gbs segment the  billion or so of revenue is there a way you can kind of give us a sense as to how much of that revenue would you consider being tied to an integrated payment himanshu patel yes that’s the right way of thinking about it  billion is a large part of revenue and so obviously we’ve been deliberate in our choice of words that our isv channel is really in its early days at this stage so we’re not prepared to give out a revenue target for that business at this stage although we will at some stage because we genuinely have been pleasantly surprised that the number of inbounds we’ve gotten as soon as we sort of opened ourselves for business your question about how much of existing revenue comes through integrated providers it’s an interesting one to think about the short answer is it’s more than you think but not for the reasons you think first data does have a lot of isvs and gateways that connect to first data so it’s not like we’re starting an integrated business with  where we’re trying to find these guys lot of these guys actually are connected to us mainly because over time if you’re going to build an integrated business it was pretty dangerous to not have the connection to the largest processer in north america so that’s a little bit of our early start if you will in this space but that number of connections doesn’t necessarily translate into revenue that is being  acquiring revenue that is being feared by an isv to first data you could have a situation where a bank partner of ours one of our jv alliances for example may have a merchant that’s coming to us through an isv in that scenario the lead really originated from the bank partner not the isv so technical connections to integrated providers is pretty significant and that’s probably one of our biggest inherent advantages in getting into this space on the other hand we’ve never really had a business model of historically where those integrated providers were commercial partnerships of first data obviously we grew up as a company much more in the bank space but that’s also the opportunity for us because going back to our existing guys as well as new ones and putting essentially a commercial partnership in place where they’re sending us traffic is really the business model we’re trying to create george mihalos okay that’s helpful and then just maybe as a quick followup in the gfs segment the account on file growth was solid again i think it accelerated now for three quarters in a row just curious what you’re seeing there is that predominantly coming from your existing customers or are you seeing a pipeline of new wins that’s starting to come through thank you himanshu patel so remember gfs is mainly credit and credit for us is generalpurpose credit and retail private label primarily and we did see a good  growth in aof in north america this quarter i would say it’s primarily internal growth there is a little bit of benefit there from new wins but nothing material at this stage there will be more though as the enterprise pipeline over the course of this year and next year but the majority of our growth is really organic or internal growth george mihalos thank you operator the next question comes from jim schneider of goldman sachs please ago ahead james schneider good morning thanks for taking my question just following up on the earlier question on gfs if you look at the pipeline as it extends forward can you maybe give us a sense about when that pipeline of booked but unconverted business starts to really flow into the numbers in a big way and maybe just a broader sense about what’s going on in the competitor landscape for gfs deals especially north america and with respect to pricing himanshu patel your question jim on timing you’ll definitely see some of that this year that’s partly influencing our comment on second half versus first half but in all fairness the majority of it you’ll start feeling over an month period we always give everyone the example that in the enterprise space from the time we meet the client to the time it actually hits your pl there could easily be a twoyear gap between the two and all of that is not just us lot of it is client work they got to do on their side to start the relationship so i think you will see a little bit this year you’ll see probably more in the next year is probably the best characterization on timing right now your second question was really around competitive wins and sort of what’s happening on the landscape look i don’t think we need to overcomplicate it we don’t have great external data from industry sources on what our competitors are seeing in the enterprise space whether it’s the gfs space or gbs but we feel pretty adamant that we are taking market share in that space over the course of the last  months and that’s a combination of not losing business which first data did actually have a decent amount of that as an issue three four years ago to date we don’t really lose any material large enterprise clients on renewals or anything like that and we generally see that when we’re  when we show up in a client’s office we have a very good shot of lending that deal because many times the clients don’t even know the breadth of offering we are offering and they may have had a rfp on one product but we’re going in often times with three or four offerings and they’re very delighted to see first data at the table on that so i can’t speak for our competitors but we know what we’re seeing in our pipeline we know what we’re seeing in our backlog and i’m sure our competitors are feeling first data at this stage james schneider that’s great thanks and maybe just as a quick followup on the  the gbs transactions have been rock solid at  for some time now but can you just give us a sense about what you’re seeing from the bigbox retailers in particular clearly there’s been kind of an overall weakness in that space so at this point is it going to be a situation where the mix shift from gbs north america on the small merchants starts to really improve they can offset that your confidence level and you kind of maintaining that same level of transaction growth going forward frank bisignano i mean as we probably had said a couple of times here between our ecom and our physical presence with large institutional clients and that’s a bucket i’d put the bigbox retailers in it’s been strong for us it’s been strong and it’s been good for us i don’t equate all store closures to necessarily volume decreases we had a rotation there but we’ve seen a very very good national client base in both volume and in growth himanshu patel yeah and it’s not just transactions i would say revenue growth for us in the gbs enterprise space was very solid in q and has been for the last six quarters james schneider thank you himanshu patel good operator the next question comes from david togut of evercore isi please go ahead david togut thank you good morning could you comment on your strategy for psd in europe and specifically how you’re positioning first data for ach consumer payments himanshu patel we view that as something we’ve obviously watched and studied i’d say our current assessment is on the gbs side we’re viewing it as another payment type so we offer merchants many ways to accept payments and which will be one additional item there and i think we’re fine with that and i think on the gfs side which is half of our european revenue and it could create some revenue opportunities as well so obviously we’re still getting more into it and we’ll have strong reviews on it over time but our initial assessment is i’d say neutral to positive for us david togut as a follow up what do you see as your major revenue opportunities for gfs coming from psd himanshu patel really just helping banks deal with it right i mean they’re not really accustomed to sending payments to merchants directly so that’s new business for them usually they’re working with issuer processors who sent to card brand so i think for them it’s a new landscape so we provide a lot of services to issuers and there is no reason why that couldn’t be in the repertoire of what we do for them david togut understood thank you very much operator the last question will come from sanjay sakhrani of kbw please go ahead unidentified analyst hi thanks for taking the question this is actually steven showing in for sanjay i just had a question around your relationship with fleetcor and the new prepay gift car jv can you provide some color around it and what the revenue and potential synergies are thanks frank bisignano well right now we’re in regulatory review obviously we and fleetcor like it or we want to have done it right and i think it’s  when we come out of regulatory review we’re happy to walk you through on much more detailed level unidentified analyst great and is there any expectation around when this regulatory approval would happen frank bisignano no comment unidentified analyst all right thank you operator this concludes our questionandanswer session i would like to turn the conference back over to frank bisignano ceo for any closing remarks frank bisignano as always we appreciate everyone joining us in the
