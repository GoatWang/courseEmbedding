design why this product a good pair of boots deserves respect we clean them we condition them we have them weatherproofed and resoled we may even rub them with exotic oils and liniments all in the name of prolonging their life span because when you put on a good pair of boots odds are they’re about to take a beating   as it turns out what happens when you take those boots off can be just as important to preserving their longevity with its low profile and simple shape the humble boot jack might not look like much but it’s ingeniously efficient and easy to use instead of resorting to the same violent game of tug of war this lightweight tool makes it possible to remove your boots without putting any undue stress on the stitching and soles because you remain standing throughout the whole process it’s also easy on the back — a nice way to show yourself the same care you devote to your favorite footwear use  care after laying the boot jack flat on the ground so that the perpendicular lip faces down and creates a seesaw effect place the heel of one boot inside the semicircular groove next firmly press your other foot down on the end of the board that rests on the ground you have now created enough powerful leverage to lift your foot free from the tallest most tenacious boot to care for the boot jack lightly sand with  grit sandpaper to revive the cedars natural aroma over time you can expect the cedar which begins as a mix of red and white grain to develop a more brown appearance production  design turned from eastern red cedar scrap wood from the west virginia forest region the wood is kiln dried in a large oven fueled by sawdust byproduct from wood cut in the manufacturers own plant   the small new hampshire manufacturer employs a cellular manufacturing process where the cedar items go from one process to the next with one person in charge of each step after being cut and shaped the raw cedar boot jack is sanded and finished by hand

today’s world we have all learned the value of a natural product especially when it comes to cooking there are no chemicals used in any part of manufacturing our wood products also because of the purity of wood products vs charcoal briquettes they only leave about a  residual ash in your bbq pit to clean out charcoal briquettes depending on the quality will leave between    residual ash due to all the chemical binders that hold the briquettes together although several people add cooking chunks to their charcoal fire for flavor the only way to cook completely naturally is to use  wood quality – w w wood inc has been manufacturing cooking wood products for more than  years over these years we have realized the importance of consistency to you our customers we take great pride in the sizing and the drying process we use in the production of our wood products the monitoring of the consistency of the moisture content we provide you our customer is what sets us apart from most cooking wood producers our products are dried in approximate batches of  pounds  each batch is tested for moisture content and recorded for guaranteed consistency starts fast burns hotter – because we dry our product to a consistent moisture content this not only kills any bugs that may be in the natural wood but it also helps in the fire starting process of your barbeque our dried wood will allow you to start your fire and be ready to cook within  minutes remember these are hardwood chunks which burn hotter and longer than charcoal briquettes so be very careful when you are first learning to use them so as not to burn your food cooking off to the side of the fire will help you to prevent overcooking until you have mastered this fuel in your pit it may take a bit longer to cook your food at first but once you become accustomed to using wood there is no better fuel on the market today for adding great flavor and texture to your barbeque dishes   infowoodinccom   copyright western
