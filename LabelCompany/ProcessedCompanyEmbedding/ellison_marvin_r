everyone for q we delivered sales comps down  this disappointing top line result was in large part due to a very difficult month of february although were less than pleased with the overall top line sales result for the first quarter we were encouraged by the positive comp performance achieved in april our comp performance during the nineweek march and april period improved approximately  basis points versus february in our earlier earnings release we announced our plans to maintain our annual guidance of down  to up  this decision was based on the q to q sales improvements in womens apparel which well discuss more in a moment the companys positive comp performance in april and our investments in sephora and our home refresh categories including appliances as we celebrate our year anniversary as a company id like to thank our associates at all levels for their hard work and commitment in the first quarter of this year now id like to briefly summarize a few of the financial results from the first quarter while the quarter proved to be challenging on the top line we continued to make great progress on improving the companys financial condition ed will discuss this in more detail in a moment now let me discuss our allimportant apparel business as you know it is critical for us to improve the performance of the apparel segment of our business and although our overall apparel business struggled in the first quarter we were encouraged by the strong customer response to our now trending items in womens were pleased with our sales performance in active apparel and our dress business improvements in these apparel categories bode well for the balance of  as these items become a much larger piece of our business moving forward even in the face of difficult top line for the first quarter our new growth initiatives delivered another quarter of strong performance and positive comps particularly appliances inhome custom window mattresses furniture sephora salon activewear and fine jewelry all of these businesses are expected to deliver even greater benefits for the remainder of  in addition we recently held grand openings with  new sephora locations in may with plans to open another  sephora locations in the month of june were also in the process of rolling out  new appliance showrooms this month as well as rebranding an additional  of our salons to salon by instyle fine jewelry had a strong quarter delivering positive comps our fine jewelry performance is a classic example of great alignment between the merchants and the stores the merchants have done an outstanding job of selecting inspiring product at a value and the store team delivered outstanding product knowledge training and customer engagement now lets discuss in more detail the results of the first quarter sales and gross margin performance all apparel categories mens kids and womens performed below the company comp for the quarter although sales in womens apparel remained challenged throughout most of the quarter it did deliver much improved results in the combined march and april periods versus february womens apparel also delivered the best comp trend improvement from q of last year to q broadly speaking were pleased that our new apparel strategy highlighting inspiring trends at a value performed well in the casual and contemporary categories of women now we must build on the success in the entire womens division and expand the same philosophy and process to kids and other apparel areas we are also pleased with our gross margin performance for the first quarter although we face gross margin pressure from continued growth in dotcom and our  appliance showrooms we were able to deliver a  basis points improvement in gross margin admittedly we have a lot of work to do to deliver sustained gross margin improvement for the balance of  however this gives us confidence that our focus on pricing analytics store operations supply chain merchandising systems are beginning to reap benefits for the company with that let me turn it over to ed to provide more detail on the first quarter our balance sheet and capital market activities edward j record  j c penney co inc thank you marvin and good morning everyone as marvin said first quarter proved challenging on the top line but we continue to improve the companys financial condition through significant debt retirement selling our buena park distribution center and our recently announced tender offers i plan to cover our first quarter results and discuss the financial opportunities we have in  ill recap what we achieved in the capital markets this quarter and discuss our initiatives to further improve financial condition by deleveraging our debt position and ill end with a review of our first quarter balance sheet and our financial guidance for  which we reaffirmed earlier this morning turning to the first quarter results comparable store sales declined  for the first quarter for the combined march and april periods comp sales improved significantly versus february units per transaction and average unit retail were up versus last years first quarter while transaction counts were down geographically the southwest and southeast were the bestperforming regions of the country and the northeast was our worstperforming region gross margin for the first quarter was  of sales an increase of  basis points compared to the same period last year gross margin was positively impacted by improved selling margins for the quarter partially offset by the continued growth of the companys online and major appliance businesses we have considerable gross margin opportunities in  and we are well underway with many of the initiatives we laid out in our last call we are already seeing benefits in such areas as pricing analytics modernizing our replenishment processes and systems and improving the profitability of our private brands through design sourcing and speedtomarket initiatives we continue to optimize our supply chain network including the recent sale and future relocation of our buena park supply chain facility also in conjunction with the  store closures we plan to close our lakeland florida distribution center and redirect residual operations to our atlanta facility we expect these gross margin initiatives will enable us to offset the expected pressures from our growing appliances and online businesses and drive gross margin into the guided range of up  basis points to  basis points for the year moving now to expenses sga expenses for the quarter declined  million compared to the same period last year the savings were primarily driven by marketing store controllable costs and incentive compensation as a percentage of sales sga expenses delevered  basis points for the first quarter we drove  basis point improvement in our private label credit penetration to  we continue to make progress driving our credit penetration and we expect to end the year with a penetration rate of approximately  as a reminder we will start the liquidation process later this month for the majority of the  stores we previously announced disclosing we expect approximately an  basis point impact to our gross margin in the second quarter as we liquidate these locations this expectation is included in our gross margin guidance for the year as expected we recorded approximately  million in asset impairment and severancerelated charges during the first quarter associated with these store closures in addition we expect to record an estimated  million in charges primarily associated with the present value of the remaining lease obligations on these stores later this year with the majority of these charges being recorded in the third quarter while our overall sales results for the quarter were below our expectations our performance improved in the combined march and april period versus february and we continue to effectively manage the business by delivering improved gross margins and maintaining our focus on expense management lets now turn to our liquidity position and capital structure we are very pleased with the recent upgrades from sp to raise our credit rating one notch to b and confirmed the positive outlook clearly this upgrade demonstrates that credit rating agencies continue to recognize the progress weve made with our deleveraging efforts and the strategic initiatives we have in place to continue driving sustainable growth and profitability and improve our overall financial condition in q we completed the sale of our buena park distribution facility for a net sales price of approximately  million the sale of this facility resulted in a gain of approximately  million in the first quarter looking at our debt reduction initiatives since the start of the year we continue to improve our capital structure by strengthening our balance sheet through significant debt reductions in april we utilized available cash on hand to retire at maturity approximately  million of the  outstanding bonds which lowered our annualized interest expense by approximately  million additionally and as previously announced earlier this week we launched cash tender offers to purchase up to  million aggregate principal amount of two outstanding series of securities a cap has been placed on the  outstanding bonds to tender up to  million in principal with the balance of the tender offer focused on the outstanding bonds due in  the retirement of these bonds is expected to contribute annualized interest expense savings of approximately  million we are utilizing the proceeds received from the sale of the home office last year to primarily fund the tender offer given our debt reduction initiatives we expect our  net debttoebitda ratio to be approximately  times by the end of this year this is down from  times at the end of  and  times at the end of  lets move now to cash and inventory as i stated earlier we are using cash on hand to retire  million of bonds that matured in april we ended the first quarter with approximately  million of cash and cash equivalents and no outstanding borrowings under our abl as such our liquidity position at the end of the quarter was approximately  billion capital expenditures net of landlord allowances in the quarter were  million an increase of  million over the first quarter of last year during the first quarter free cash flow was a use of  million an improvement of  million versus the same period last year as a reminder we continue to expect to generate between  million and  million in free cash flow in  this fullyear range includes the expected cash impacts from our store closings and charges related to our voluntary early retirement program as well as expected proceeds from the sale of operating assets inventory at the end of the first quarter was  billion up  from last years first quarter and was in line with our expectations approximately  basis points of the increase was driven by inventory investments in floor samples for major appliance showrooms and higher inventory levels to support our continued investment in new sephora shops we are prudently managing our inventory levels and are pleased with the progress we made this quarter our teams remain committed to reducing inventory levels where appropriate throughout the remainder of this year and we expect total inventory at the end of  to be down at least  versus the end of  merchandise accounts payable was  million down  million from the end of the first quarter last year the decline was primarily due to reduced purchases in the first quarter we have reaffirmed our financial guidance for the full year of  as a reminder  is a week year the impact of which has been incorporated into our guidance we expect the rd week is worth approximately  basis points on total sales while comparable store sales are on a week basis in addition the following guidance incorporates the impact of our store closures discussed earlier for fiscal  comparable store sales are expected to be down  to up  gross margin is expected to be up  to  basis points versus last year sga dollars are expected to be down  to  versus last year and adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of  to  in closing although we faced a tough top line this quarter given the challenging environment we continue to manage the business well through executing on gross margin opportunities exercising sga discipline controlling inventory levels and deleveraging our debt position our teams remain committed to delivering on our  fullyear guidance with that id like to now turn the call back over to marvin marvin r ellison  j c penney co inc okay thank you ed and while we remain focused on our strategic framework of private brands omnichannel and increasing revenue per customer id like to discuss the key growth initiatives that give us confidence in our  financial plan first our beauty categories continue to deliver significant comp growth the key component of our beauty strategy is our bestinclass partnership with sephora as a reminder we currently operate  sephora inside jcpenney shops and will open  new locations in  ending the year with nearly  locations at that time well have sephora shops in approximately  of our stores year to date were also expanding  existing sephora growing each location by nearly  to accommodate more products and client services were hiring over  beauty consultants in  who are a key component of our sephora inside jcpenney experience another component of our beauty strategy is salon jcpenneys salon business once again drove positive comps for the quarter and we continue to see benefits from rebranding to salon by instyle we recently announced plans to rebrand  more of our salons to instyle and hire nearly  skilled stylists who will help us to create even more reasons for customers to visit our improved salons our salon customers shop our stores over eight times a year so we see salon as a tremendous customer acquisition strategy the unique experiences were able to create for our customers in store through our salon and our sephora growth initiatives are hard to replicate online and magnify the importance of a physical store second our home refresh initiatives continue to provide strong results we delivered positive comps in our home division for the first quarter appliance sales both instore and online continue to drive significant comp sales growth and improve productivity in our home store we added new highermargin takewith categories in our appliance department such as microwaves and minirefrigerators as we continue to round out our assortment were also leveraging this performance by opening approximately  new appliance showrooms in the second quarter and adding new brand partners to the showroom throughout  as some of you may have read and seen were conducting several tests within our home store focused on home services programs with the resurgence of the housing market consumers are spending over  billion annually to upgrade their homes since nearly twothirds of the nations homes are over  years old the programs were testing will provide turnkey services for heating and cooling systems simple bathroom remodels home water treatment systems and quick shipandinstall blinds look we understand that well never be number one in market share in these categories however with  of our customers being female and over  of our customers owning homes we feel its prudent for us to try to position ourselves to gain a piece of the  billion market opportunity and third we remain committed to becoming a worldclass omnichannel retailer we continue to see significant increase in our online sku growth and we plan to continue the sku expansion throughout  were also expanding our shipfromstore fulfillment strategy from approximately  stores today to  of our store network this means that approximately  stores will have the ability to fulfill online orders which will nearly quadruple the available inventory for sale online this will also significantly expand the fulfillment capacity of our company and reduce the lastmile cost of online fulfillment were launching this new process in the second quarter our investments and our focus on omnichannel are working throughout  approximately  of all online orders touched a physical store and this number continued to grow in the first quarter so as we improve site functionality enhance our shipfromstore capabilities and develop a much improved mobile app we continue to drive increased online revenue in  and lastly well continue to improve and strategically adjust our apparel categories areas where we are excited to see improvements in  are number one active wear for the entire family as previously announced were enhancing our partnership with nike by leveraging over  new nike store environments to offer a vastly improved assortment of apparel accessories and footwear across all divisions were also expanding one of the hottest brands right now adidas we added womens adidas apparel to  stores in march and saw much improved sales and were excited to expand this adidas presentation to over  stores for backtoschool footwear will also be a focus for us in  we transitioned to an open sale concept in  in only  of our womens shoe areas given the outstanding performance of the open sale environment were in the process of converting all womens shoe areas to open sale fixtures this year we also introduced new styles and comfort features in order to seize available market share in footwear in closing my optimism on the future of jcpenney is in large part due to the fact that were still playing catchup to many of our competitors as we improve our instore environment and modernize systems like pricing and omnichannel we see immediate benefits therefore we know the upside for profit and revenue exist we simply have to move faster in addition we believe weve developed a series of very specific growth initiatives that serve the needs of our valueoriented customer and provides us with differentiation from our traditional competitors and with that kaley well open the line for questions questionandanswer session operator our first question comes from the line of paul trussell with deutsche bank your line is open paul trussell  deutsche bank securities inc good morning just wanted to get a little bit more clarification on category performance marvin you discussed womens apparel showcasing some sequential improvement what specifically was the comp performance of womens apparel and how are stores with appliances performing versus stores without it thank you marvin r ellison  j c penney co inc so paul our optimism on womens apparel really stems through the performance of the casual and contemporary categories that was a tough business for us last year and we had a spring launch with the now trending concept that really resonated with our customers extremely well and in many cases we sold out a product and were now reordering for additional launches in the summer so john tighe our chief merchant is here in the room so im going to let john provide a little bit more color on why were excited about the specific categories of womens apparel relative to appliances appliance stores performed better because appliances had a significant impact to the overall comp the good news for us is that q is our lowest appliance penetrated month so were going to see almost double the comp impact of appliances going into the second quarter because of patriotic holidays so we remain very excited about appliances but im going to let john talk to you about the optimism of our spring launch and why we think thats going to help us to get these categories online for summer as well john john tighe  j c penney co inc good morning this is john tighe the chief merchant as we moved into march we really leveraged the design capabilities of our talented organization of product development and design and leveraged our international sourcing to deliver great trends at a great value and the customer really responded it was terrific alignment with the stores organization with the marketing organization and the merchants to pull this together and really it moved the performance of womens apparel and improved half of the loss we had in the fourth quarter it was an improvement for march and april so we are excited to expand that and use that as our future model for success and expanding it not just in womens apparel but around the rest of the store paul trussell  deutsche bank securities inc thank you and just want to also get clarification on ebitda guidance for this year you reiterating the  billion and is there any additional real estate or asset sales that are to be included in that edward j record  j c penney co inc paul this is ed ill take that well technically we havent given ebitda guidance but its implicit in our eps guidance and as we stated in fourth quarter the midpoint is about a  billion ebitda we also stated we expected sales of operating assets to be north of  million obviously the buena park was at  million so that came in at the high end of our range were still working on a few other transactions probably one significant one that will close in the fourth quarter so we think theres upside to that sale of operating asset estimate we gave were not upping our guidance right now obviously we just had a very challenging quarter in a very challenging environment but our hope is that some of that flows through as upside as we get through the year paul trussell  deutsche bank securities inc and last one very quickly marvin are you willing to comment at all about trends more recently over the last few weeks and how youre kicking off the second quarter marvin r ellison  j c penney co inc paul we try not to get into interquarter updates but what i will tell you is that a fact that we are holding our annual guidance is a reflection that we have confidence that the initiatives that weve talked about are starting to reap some of the dividends that we hoped and more importantly we talked in the prepared comments about our margin improvement and although  basis points may not appear to be significant when you factor in that we are going against  new appliance showrooms and pretty rapid dotcom growth which are margin rate dilutive the fact that we can deliver  basis points of improvement while having significant reductions in inventory gives us confidence that some of the pricing analytics and supply chain improvements and store operations merchandising systems are paying off so although i wont give you specifics on how were trending this quarter i will tell you that were confident that our initiatives will allow us to have a successful year paul trussell  deutsche bank securities inc thanks for the color good luck marvin r ellison  j c penney co inc okay thanks operator thank you our next question comes from the line of jeff van sinderen with b riley your line is open jeff van sinderen  b riley  co llc good morning just kind of a followup on apparel to start with maybe you can talk a little bit more about what youre doing to drive sustainable improvement in the private label part of womens apparel particularly in terms of speed to market and then also if you could touch on inventory in apparel at the end of the quarter how youre planning to manage inventory in apparel into q and q and then also separately if you could speak a little bit about how youre thinking about monetizing additional real estate and what we should expect over the next year or so in terms of real estate sales or saleleasebacks thanks marvin r ellison  j c penney co inc okay jeff i will take the first part of the womens apparel question and ill hand it back to our chief merchant john tighe to provide some additional color one of the first things that we had to do was really accelerate the design sourcing to sales floor part of our business for private brands and were pleased with the improvements we made in gross margin in private brands were also pleased with the fact that for a large percent of our private brands we actually cut  of the supply chain time out meaning that we were able to get these goods from design to the physical sales floor  faster and that was driven by a great partnership with the merchants the supply chain sourcing team the design team and the stores one of the reasons why were able to be nimble in the changes weve made in womens apparel in contemporary and casual was primarily because of that speed initiative ill give it to john and let john talk about the benefits of that and how we see that new process driving success for the remainder of the year and then ill hand it to ed to let him talk about inventory and potential real estate monetization going forward john john tighe  j c penney co inc sure thank you marvin this is john last year we reorganized our whole process for product development and design and in some areas reduced it by over  from where we were this is allowing us to be much faster to market and be more trendright and allowing us to really deliver the right trend and value at the timely basis we continue to use this as we move through the year and get better at it and will allow us to reorder and be more nimble with the reaction to the customer we also did lots of consumer research last year in better understanding our customer to align our assortment with her needs and really what she told us is that shes more casual – and i think everyone realizes that casualization of america continues to expand – and that she loves activewear so as we go and scan for trend and value by leveraging our design and product development teams well also lean into casual and active to grow our business marvin r ellison  j c penney co inc okay ed edward j record  j c penney co inc good morning jeff on the inventory question as we said our inventory is up  at the end of the first quarter the investments – incremental investments we made in showrooms for appliances and the additional sephora stores were worth over  basis points so apparel inventory was down at the end of q and as we move forward we expect the end of the year to be down over  we would still expect that incremental  basis points or so for additional showrooms and sephora so were expecting apparel inventories to be down highsingle digits by the end of the year and we would expect it to be a continual stepdown each quarter between now and then as far as real estate sales we continue to look at our assets and if theyre worth more to – as real estate as they are to us for stores we continue to look to try to and make deals there as i mentioned earlier we expect to have one of those deals later this year and we think theres probably a handful of stores that that may apply to and well continue to look at that and see if it makes sense for us although i dont expect it to be hundreds of millions of dollars go forward i do think there continues to be opportunity for us to monetize some assets jeff van sinderen  b riley  co llc thanks for taking my questions and best of luck marvin r ellison  j c penney co inc thanks jeff operator thank you our next question comes from the line of lorraine hutchinson with bank of america your line is open lorraine maikis hutchinson  bank of america merrill lynch thank you good morning what were first quarter apparel comps and where do you need them to get to for the remainder of the year to hit that minus  to plus  comp guidance marvin r ellison  j c penney co inc for the quarter overall apparel performed worse than the company comp i think thats probably the best way to illustrate the overall performance and candidly as we look at our sales plan and our guidance of down  to plus  apparel is obviously planned down so we have no great optimism that were going to swing apparel to positive comps overall there are categories in apparel active being one dresses and some components of contemporary and casual that we are expecting to see positive comps in but overall we have apparel planned down appropriately so if we can hit a plan which is a modest plan of negative comps for apparel and continue to see the growth trajectory that we discussed in categories like home and appliances and sephora and salon and fine jewelry and all of those other growth areas including omni we think we are well within our range for guidance but were going to work very hard and we have stretch targets but those stretch targets wont get us in trouble from an inventory standpoint and were in a good position because of the speed initiative john talked about that we can be nimble and we can make decisions with a lot more data but overall were just going to continue to work on it but were not overly optimistic that were going to swing it to positive lorraine maikis hutchinson  bank of america merrill lynch and then it sounds like there will be some gross margin pressure in the second quarter but what youre seeing quarter to date you still feel confident that the second quarter comps can be within your guided range marvin r ellison  j c penney co inc yes and the gross margin pressure as ed mentioned is primarily coming from the liquidation in our closed stores when you separate the closed store inventory liquidation we see the goforward stores as being margin accretive we expect and plan margin growth lorraine maikis hutchinson  bank of america merrill lynch thank you marvin r ellison  j c penney co inc thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of matthew boss with jpmorgan your line is open matthew robert boss  jpmorgan securities llc thanks so if we broke down the comps a little further so versus the negative  what was the traffic decline in the quarter and then just how did private label comps versus national brands edward j record  j c penney co inc matt this is ed ill take the second part first private brands outcomped national brands for the quarter we had a really great quarter in private brands as we said margin was up  basis points margin significantly improved in private brands in q as our sourcing initiatives are really starting to kick in so we feel really good about private brands as we move forward the first part of your question was about matthew robert boss  jpmorgan securities llc traffic edward j record  j c penney co inc traffic yes so aur was up slightly for the quarter upts was up low single digits the rest of the loss came from negative traffic matthew robert boss  jpmorgan securities llc okay and then just to follow up on the gross margin so q up  basis points and you walked through the  basis point headwind in q can you just walk through the drivers of the back half gross margin build to bridge to that full year up  to  basis points edward j record  j c penney co inc and just to be clear there is  basis points of pressure in q from the closing stores were not saying q will be down  basis points to last year we do expect to get some margin accretion as marvin just said we expect fall margins to be up to get us into that range as i said in my prepared remarks we continue to see significant benefits from our sourcing initiatives even though there is raw material pricing pressure we continue to see average unit cost going down in our sourcing group also our pricing analytics continues to be significantly accretive to the gross margin and between those two we expect it to continue to build throughout the year and get us into the margin range matthew robert boss  jpmorgan securities llc great best of luck edward j record  j c penney co inc thanks operator thank you our next question comes from the line of paul lejuez with citi your line is open paul lejuez  citigroup global markets inc thanks guys you made some comments during the quarter i think about some of your stores that are going to be closed are actually going to stay open a little bit longer and i was just curious what were the sales that we could attribute to those stores in first quarter results and im just curious you mentioned the margin pressure for q what sort of comp impact will those liquidation sales have and im just curious how it impacted the comp and gross margin this quarter as well thanks marvin r ellison  j c penney co inc so paul on the second part of your question we see zero sales impact for second quarter because we pulled those stores from the comp calculation for q but relative to the comp benefit in q its almost impossible to calculate because we also had cannibalization that occurred from the closing store sales so as an example if we have a closing store in a market with two additional stores we saw sales dilution in the existing stores because of the traffic in the closing stores so for us to give a comp benefit or a negative comp impact is virtually impossible to calculate what we can calculate is that the closed store performance was margin dilutive to the company just driven by mix so they hurt margin but from a sales standpoint its virtually impossible to determine what the impact was paul lejuez  citigroup global markets inc got you and then just one followup can you talk about performance at mall locations versus offmall locations in q and then im also curious if you could talk within malls performance in a versus b and c centers thanks edward j record  j c penney co inc paul this is ed ill take those we continue to see offmall outpace mall its a couple hundred basis points for the quarter that we see the offmall outpace the mall within malls theres really no clear winner you would expect a and b to be outpacing c and d and were seeing them all about the same paul lejuez  citigroup global markets inc great thanks guys good luck marvin r ellison  j c penney co inc okay thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of mark altschwager with robert w baird your line is open mark r altschwager  robert w baird  co inc great good morning and thanks for taking the question i wanted to ask on the marketing front can you just talk a little more about your strategy there for  and any changes going on i think advertising efficiency has been one of the drivers to sga reduction im just wondering if you think youre investing enough in marketing to drive traffic to the stores and website clearly a lot of exciting change is happening in the stores but with casual foot traffic steadily declining in the mall just how are you working to get the word out to potential customers marvin r ellison  j c penney co inc mark its a very timely question for us because john mentioned that we spent a lot of time doing market and consumer research and what the research has identified as pretty obvious we have different customer segmentations but within those segmentations they have dramatically different shopping patterns and they have dramatically different desires and habits on how they consume media information so were going to make some shifts in our marketing mix to ensure that we are driving the right marketing media to identify the correct customer for the correct category we spent a lot of time going through the calendar for the balance of the year making adjustments and we feel great about the changes that well see relative to shifting from print to social and digital understanding what are the categories and the customer segments we want to identify via mediums like direct mail but also leveraging the much improved mobile app as a way to drive awareness and retention so as we think about strategy well see those shifts going to be more customer segment dependent but relative to do we believe that we have cut too much out of marketing the short answer is no as a percent of sales we outspend all of our competitor on marketing so we think we are properly funding marketing we just have to get better at the overall allocation of the spend relative to the segments and the categories that were trying to drive revenue in mark r altschwager  robert w baird  co inc thats helpful thank you and if i could just ask a followup on the sga side youve made some nice progress there with the results in q guidance would suggest that the reductions in sga slow for the balance of the year so can you just talk about how much flexibility you have on that front where is there still lowhanging fruit and then as the store closures youve identified begin to hit the pl would you expect to see more significant declines in sga dollars in the back half of the year just any help with those dynamics would be great thank you edward j record  j c penney co inc sure mark this is ed again we continue to believe we have opportunity around sga with the store closures moving out that obviously puts more pressure on there because a significant piece of our dollar savings were coming out of the closed stores but with them all being closed at the beginning of q most of the dollar savings in q and q will come out of the closed stores but we know we have opportunities around the entire company we continue to rightsize our corporate office as marvin talked about we advertise at a higher percent than most if not all of our peers we know we have opportunities to be more efficient in the stores from how we sign things to how we receive goods so were tackling all of that we know our supply chain has opportunities as well so we continue to go after all of our sga reductions and hopefully we think – hopefully therell be some upside to the guidance weve given but weve been conservative with that mark r altschwager  robert w baird  co inc thank you and best of luck edward j record  j c penney co inc thanks operator thank you our next question comes from the line of dana telsey with telsey advisory group your line is open dana telsey  telsey advisory group good morning everyone as you think about the store closings what do you see as the cadence of the store closings and the sales recapture rate how are you planning that thank you marvin r ellison  j c penney co inc so dana on the sales recapture rate its something that were obviously spending a lot of time on and we think the key for us will be leveraging our ecommerce business leveraging our loyalty program and making sure that we understand the onetoone marketing opportunities that exist even in a market where we dont have a physical store location i mentioned earlier the importance of omnichannel and we think omnichannel is going to be significant for us to maintain that recapture rate and that retention rate joe mcfarland our evp of stores is here and joe has been leading the closed store efforts so ill let joe kind of talk about the cadence of the store closing process and kind of how we see it for q and where we think well kind of have the process concluded when we get to the end of this quarter joseph mcfarland  j c penney co inc thank you marvin good morning this is joe from a store closing standpoint on monday may  we will begin the closing store commencement the closing store process is approximately nine weeks and as we begin the commencement we will have an instore visual sign package calling out store closing in addition to newspaper rops some direct mail email well have exterior banners on the store to really drive the awareness as we move through we have very specific weeks identified that we will begin that closing sale with a  to  off and then move forward from there we have flexibility with great partnership from our thirdparty liquidator that weve partnered with weve got some great analytical tools to drive the decisions that we make and the cadence in which we close the stores all stores will be closed to the public by monday july  edward j record  j c penney co inc and dana this is ed just to chime in all the stores that go into the liquidation well we dont liquidate all  there is a handful that will go into fall based on lease agreements we have joseph mcfarland  j c penney co inc but those will truly be exceptions edward j record  j c penney co inc yeah dana telsey  telsey advisory group thank you marvin r ellison  j c penney co inc okay thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of bob drbul with guggenheim your line is open robert drbul  guggenheim securities llc hi good morning guys i just had a question around the sephora shops and comp store sales in the stores that have the sephora shops like how are they performing versus the rest of the fleet and then the second question i have is can you talk a little more on mattresses and furniture needs to be called out in department stores whats happening with those categories is my second question if you could talk about that and the third one is fulfillment costs and shipping costs on the ecommerce side how much of a drag has that been and how do you have that forecast in the gross margin expectation for this year thank you marvin r ellison  j c penney co inc okay bob look ill take the sephora question and also the fulfillment call so on the sephora the comps for stores with sephora shops are up versus stores without it was one of the key driving factors on identifying stores that would close we simply did an analysis on capital investment possibilities and where we had stores performing well were obviously stores with sephora locations stores with appliance showrooms et cetera and so as i mentioned in my prepared remarks when we finish this year were going to have roughly  stores with sephora shops which will be roughly  of all stores at that time were going to evaluate which we already are and look at a combination of new locations and also expanding locations i mean weve been exceptionally pleased with the  stores this year that weve expanded and weve expanded as i mentioned in some cases that space by over  and were seeing expanded sales floor productivity so its not diluting productivity its actually increasing productivity relative to fulfillment costs we are very pleased with the fact that we run a supply chain and we run an online fulfillment process that is cost effective i would argue that were probably one of the few retailers that run a profitable ecommerce business thats in large part due to the excellence of the team but also the coordination between mike amend and also our supply chain leadership team mike amend is in the room and if i could i want mike just to talk a little bit about the performance of our ecommerce site specifically that the mobile wallet that were rolling out on our new mobile app that launched within the last couple of weeks that were having success with mike do you want to discuss that for a second michael amend  j c penney co inc yeah thanks marvin so yes so we recently launched a mobile app with a wallet capability and so in going in stores and talking with customers about opportunities to aid in the shopping experience both with inside of our store and also outside of our store we recently added this wallet capability and what this does is this allow us to be able to put both coupons expose their rewards that theyve earned from our loyalty program as well as that gift cards and other capabilities and what we believe that this will do is that this will allow customers just a simple onestop shop access for all of these things that theyve earned with jcpenney and so were very excited about this weve seen this with this launch weve seen great engagement with our customers and we believe this is going to continue to drive a great opportunity for us to reengage our customers from an ongoing basis and also help in aiding in the instore experience on doing a variety of things whether itd be picking up their orders price checking and many more things so were very excited about this as we move forward marvin r ellison  j c penney co inc and look on mattresses and furniture were very excited we mentioned that these two categories positive comp in the first quarter so im going to let john tighe talk about what our potential growth in these areas are and why were excited about both categories john tighe  j c penney co inc hi this is john last year we reset our mattress floor to be organized by comfort as opposed to by brand and we reorganized the vendor structure and the assortment the response has been terrific as well as our furniture assortment that we readjusted with ashleys furniture and private brand both businesses are running ahead of plan and beating last year and well be looking to expand into new markets this year to capture share in markets where closed stores are giving us opportunity to get volume marvin r ellison  j c penney co inc so more to come on that and well be talking a lot more about the expansion of the mattress and furniture categories here in the near future robert drbul  guggenheim securities llc thank you michael amend  j c penney co inc so one other thing – hey bob one other thing that i would add on the online fulfillment so we are in the process right now of rolling out an intelligent order sourcing logic capability that is actually live right now for some subs and as marvin mentioned earlier were moving from around  stores doing shipfromstore to chain wide which will expose another billion dollars of inventory and so what this new system does is it actually has a realtime optimization functionality that looks at speed it looks at delivery expense it looks at labor it also looks at markdowns in terms of current markdowns and future markdown avoidance so one of the things that were doing here is rolling out the system to continue to increase driving reduced cost actually of deliveries and also heavily leveraging our store footprint to drive shiptostore capabilities which will also have a reduced delivery expense because delivering to a commercial location versus a residential location is cheaper and this also helps us get foot traffic to our stores so a lot more to come here on this capability but what id tell you is in partnership with mike robbins our evp of supply chain he and i are working on a number of really great initiatives that are going to continue to reduce our fulfillment expense within our online business robert drbul  guggenheim securities llc great edward j record  j c penney co inc hey bob this is ed just to follow on while were really optimistic about being able to drive those costs down going forward to answer your question directly in q fulfillment costs were down highsingle digits on a per unit basis so we continue to see significant improvement even before we get the system support we need robert drbul  guggenheim securities llc thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of michael binetti with ubs your line is open michael binetti  ubs securities llc hey guys thanks for taking my question i think as you guys studied your stores for the – like changes you made to your fleet this year you also started testing smaller format appliance pads or smaller support pads to give you an idea whether those could be put in as comp drivers in some of your smaller stores am i right on that if so would you mind commenting on that test or those categories that could be a comp driver in the some of the smaller boxes in the future marvin r ellison  j c penney co inc michael you are correct and we are in the process of testing those initiatives as we speak weve had early success with some of the smaller footprint sephora locations we have seen lines out the door of the mall a block long in some of our rural locations where we rolled out smaller sephora locations and we are now in this store expansion of appliances were going to be testing some smaller footprint appliance locations that were very optimistic will work well for us just because we have the extended product selection online we can serve a customer regardless of the units we have on the sales floor ill let john give you a little bit more color on the sephora test because thats something that were very excited about john tighe  j c penney co inc this is john our sephora expansion has really worked almost anywhere weve done it and were really thinking about growing sephora on two tracks theres the expanding out to many of our doors small stores urban stores rural stores its been working while were thinking about expanding were also going back and renovating and expanding our flagships so this year while we opened  new sephoras we also are in the process of expanding to  new flagships and where weve done that weve seen the dollars per square foot actually increase so we see the expansion of sephora continuing into the future michael binetti  ubs securities llc okay and then would you mind just helping us calibrate a little bit your thinking on the second quarter i think the gross margin comment we have one piece of it being  basis points of pressure i think you start – thats from the liquidations you start to anniversary some of the appliances which have a structurally different gross margin and then maybe some of the other puts and takes there on both the comps and the gross margins thats quite a noisy quarter for you in the second quarter im not quite sure where youre pointing us in the model edward j record  j c penney co inc mike this is ed ill take that so without the closing stores we would expect margin expansion in the quarter within our guidance range of  to  basis points and then you layer the  basis points of pressure on top of that i wouldnt make it any more complex than that there are obviously incremental pressures with dotcom and the appliance ramp up but that was incorporated in our plan michael binetti  ubs securities llc okay thanks a lot i appreciate it guys marvin r ellison  j c penney co inc okay thanks operator thank you our next question comes from the line of charles grom with gordon haskett your line is open charles grom  gordon haskett research advisors thanks good morning and thanks for all the color here on the quarter just to follow up on lorraines question earlier that you guys expect comps in the second quarter to be within the range of your fullyear guide did i hear that correctly earlier edward j record  j c penney co inc yes charles grom  gordon haskett research advisors okay great and then just on the other components of your fullyear guide ed just asset sales you expect to still be a little over  million any color on depreciation andor the tax rate for the full year edward j record  j c penney co inc on depreciation we expect it to be down in the  million range give or take we also expect interest expense in the  million to  million range before any cost to extinguish debt coming out of the tender and then on tax rate we really dont have a tax rate were expecting dollars to be give or take flat plus or minus a couple million charles grom  gordon haskett research advisors okay great and then just on the omni just if we could just take a step back are your inventory systems between the brickandmortar stores and online speaking to one another yet because obviously once you get that congruent the margin opportunities to your point marvin are significant and then in addition can you just give us a little perspective on where your online skus are today relative to instore sku count and where you think that can grow to over time and if you have it the percentage of overlap of skus online versus instore marvin r ellison  j c penney co inc so charles ill let mike amend take that he can give you some specific color to your questions michael amend  j c penney co inc so yes our inventory systems are connected actually the intelligent sourcing system that i spoke to earlier that were rolling out right now has a single view actually near realtime view of inventory both of our stores as well as dotcom that gets updated so with that system as you mentioned one of the great capabilities that were going to continue to leverage there is the most intelligent sourcing of order fulfillment to leverage the store inventory and the store base as well as our dotcom dcs and so over time we will continue to balance that inventory in an appropriate way to optimize for cost one of the great capabilities that this really adds and allows us to do is be able to leverage fashion and some of the other areas that its harder to understand what the appropriate sales rate of thats going to be from an online perspective so we can also spread that across the stores and leverage that so that was one question and then speaking to your question in terms of our sku growth so our online right now our sku capacity or online number of skus is about twice what our largest store is in the first quarter our sku count was up about  we believe theres a huge opportunity for us to continue to expand in this space if you look at what customer feedback is as well as if you look at what customers are searching for on our site theres a clear opportunity for us to both expand in the categories that were already in as well as new categories and with new brands and so were in the pilot phase right now actually of rolling out a new product information management system which will allow us to expose a portal directly to our vendors and with that portal what our suppliers will now be able to do our dropship suppliers that were currently working on many many different partnerships with will be able to then upload their catalogs directly into our system and we will start to dramatically increase the assortment that we have available online responding to customer needs in areas and so were doing this obviously with our dropship partners so theyll own that inventory and theyll ship and fulfill those goods but were very excited about that and believe that that represents a very very material growth opportunity for us going forward marvin r ellison  j c penney co inc and charles it goes without saying that this is truly not only the future of retail this is modern day retailing and for us having been very slow and very traditional and candidly very oldfashioned about omnichannel weve made a significant transformation within the last  months to a modernized omnichannel retailer thats going to have the ability to leverage every physical store location for fulfillment that is significant for retail in general and very significant for jcpenney and thats just a start so we truly see this as a gamechanger for us to continue to drive down those fulfillment costs that lastmile fulfillment cost is going to continue to put pressure on retail either pure play or brickandmortar and as ed mentioned i mean were managing the cost well even without these new systems and as mike is able to on board these new processing systems we see that only becoming more efficient charles grom  gordon haskett research advisors thats great color and just one last question for you marvin obviously youve been really forward thinking here with the appliances and continuing to roll out sephora and some of the home installment tests that youre doing just can you show us a little bit of the playbook into  other parts of the store where you think you guys can get really creative and just more companyspecific drivers for jcpenney marvin r ellison  j c penney co inc we have a couple of things that were looking at but the foundational focus we have is going to center around two things number one its going to have to be value oriented we know we serve a valuebased customer for many years we lost sight of that and we try to serve customers that were not putting jcpenney in their consideration set so we know that sweet spot for us is that customer with that household income of  a year and less and we also understand within that we want to have a very balanced view of selling the whole store i mean weve been too focused category by category and thats why weve gotten ourselves in trouble being so dependent on apparel that when apparel dramatically downturned we had no other categories we could lean on so youre going to see us be much more balanced we need apparel and apparel will always be important but we also have to ramp up these other businesses so that we can have more balance across the entire chain having said that we want to become a dominant home retailer all the data tells us is that our customers want us to be in these spaces they want us to sell appliances didnt appear counterintuitive initially but its one of our best businesses and its continuing to grow they want us to be in the beauty business but also we want to just serve the customers well so well update the external world on some of these initiatives but for now were very excited about the home strategy regarding appliances and furniture and mattresses and some of these home install initiatives that we are very excited about and were very excited about beauty were excited about what that does from a differentiation standpoint and were excited about serving the underserved needs of our plussized and bigandtall customer which we didnt talk a lot about on this call but were still working on it so more to come and were excited about communicating these initiatives here in the future charles grom  gordon haskett research advisors great best of luck operator thank you and our last question comes from the line of kristen mcduffy with goldman sachs your line is open kristen mcduffy  goldman sachs  co llc great thanks for the question can you talk a little bit about your plans with respect to future debt reduction i know youve made a good effort with this  million tender would you consider a broader tender as market conditions improve and also how do you think about using your  million of secured capacity thanks edward j record  j c penney co inc sure ill take that obviously so obviously we announced a tender earlier this week to take that  million we have  billion of nearterm maturities as we sit today a little under  billion this will take us down to  million we continue to assess the market and see if it makes sense to upsize that tender or to initiate an additional tender to reduce those nearterm maturities even more than that we feel really good about the capital structure i didnt mention in my prepared remarks but weve taken  billion of debt out at the completion of this tender over the last  years and as i did say were going to at a net debttoebitda ratio well end this year approximately  times so we think weve made substantial improvement to our capital structure and were going to continue to look for ways to improve it as we move forward kristen mcduffy  goldman sachs  co llc and just as a followup do you think of that  million of secured capacity as a rainy day kind of fund or is it something you would be willing to tap to take out some of your unsecured maturities at some point edward j record  j c penney co inc as we sit today its out there if we need it and if i go and tap it then i lose that liquidity basically especially if i use it to pay down nearterm maturities right now were looking at the unsecured market and seeing if theres anything out there but its always there if we need it kristen mcduffy  goldman sachs  co llc great thanks so

who’s reinventing jc penney by phil wahba photograph by nancy newberry for fortune february    am edt marvin ellison has scored some early successes at the troubled department store but there’s a lot left to fix question if you wanted to buy a pair of men’s shoes at a department store would you look for them next to a men’s clothing or b women’s footwear most shoppers would probably answer “a” but at jc penney jcp  the yearold retailing mainstay the answer until very recently was “b” women make up about  of penney’s clientele and penney managers believed that generally speaking those women were likely to buy shoes for their spouses and beaus just as they did during the kennedy administration “it was a terrible idea” says marvin ellison shaking his head as he walks a reporter through a penney store in frisco texas “it took space away from women’s shoes and it made it very difficult for men to want to buy shoes” ellison penney’s newly minted yearold ceo had a better idea he ran a test to see whether men’s shoes would sell faster when showcased next to say men’s suits once the data showed that they did he instituted that change last summer across the company’s plus stores since entrusting guys to buy their own brogues and boots penney has seen doubledigit sales gains in footwear “that reset has been one of the smartest things we’ve done” says ellison this frisco store not far from company headquarters in plano north of dallas serves as penney’s retail living lab and as he continues the tour ellison proudly points out similar changes fashion jewelry now sits closer to its liz claiborne apparel brand so women can try on accessories to go with a dress they might buy the decor has been gussied up at the store’s trafficdriving inhouse salons handbags got a facelift too after penney failed to cash in on the recent handbag boom managers did a deepdive market analysis ellison’s conclusion “our handbags were ugly we had to change them” it sounds less harsh in ellison’s gentle tennessee baritone penney’s recent store makeovers highlight popular brands like liz claiborne which it ownsphotograph by nancy newberry for fortune as the adage goes “retail is detail” and if the details ellison is addressing seem foreheadslap obvious signs of how far jc penney had fallen behind its rivals—well welcome to his world ellison became ceo last august with a mandate to plug the store’s countless leaks in operations strategy and technology problems left over from the chain’s nearly fatal attempt to reinvent itself four years ago he and penney’s board are betting that such small but meaningful improvements will add up to a full recovery that nowinfamous overhaul under thenceo and former apple aapl retail guru ron johnson sought to reposition penney as a flashier retailer with fancier merchandise but it backfired customers fled sales tumbled by almost a third and penney was crippled financially three years ago the board brought back mike ullman the ceo it had unceremoniously chased out in favor of johnson to stop the uss penney from sinking and last summer he handed the reins to ellison—an executive the opposite of flashy it’s fitting that ellison a lifelong musician plays electric bass an instrument that rarely gets a flashy solo but without which no band can click he made his reputation in retail at home depot hd  helping engineer that chain’s turnaround by focusing on unsexy but primordial things like the supply chain and the integration of stores and ecommerce he’s a data devotee who grounds every decision in information—including that seemingly intuitive shoe move “pure intuition without any data gets you in trouble” ellison says referring to the johnson era he adds “we went through  months of that and we’re not going to do it again” mike ullman photographed in  under the watchful eye of founder james cash penney steadied the ship but penney still lost ground to rivalsphotograph by gregg segal for fortune ellison’s early results are encouraging penney reported a  increase in comparable sales during the  holidays one of the best performances in retail that season rival macy’s saw “comps” shrink by  that followed seven quarters of sales growth in the previous eight and although penney hasn’t reported a profit since —and hasn’t predicted when it will again—it’s aiming for  billion in ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization for fiscal  nearly double the level of fiscal  the trees look nice but the forest is daunting penney’s sales an estimated  billion for the justcompleted year are still down  from their  peak its nascent recovery part of its fourth turnaround effort since  hasn’t swayed wall street—its stock trades close to a year low in the long term the problem isn’t just that penney has been dysfunctional it’s also that penney is a department store a practitioner of a business model under siege it faces hordes of competitors in its core apparel and homegoods businesses departmentstore rivals kohl’s kss and macy’s m  target tgt and walmart wmt  discounters like tj maxx tjx  and of course amazon amzn  and consumers especially younger ones have lost interest in browsing at the mall “the struggle is not going to end” says mark cohen director of retail studies at columbia business school “the traffic that is off isn’t coming back” ellison’s response has been to make penney smarter and more efficient at keeping customers loyal and selling more to each one that means embracing penney’s mallness—and trusting that there’s still a place in the retail landscape for a midmarket department store and if that means playing catchup for a few years before making bigger bolder moves so be it “we’re going to start with the foundation no one can beat us being us” ellison says turnarounds are nothing new at jc penney founded in  as a wyoming dry goods store penney became one of the th century’s biggest department stores and catalogue retailers dominating middleamerican towns and suburban malls but sales began to erode in the late s penney was slower than rivals to emerge from the great recession and struggled with shrinking profit margins in its apparel business this was the situation ron johnson was hired to turn around in  he began a sweeping transformation aimed at shedding penney’s stodgy image he dumped its coupon program and changed everything from the logo to the checkout process most notably he tried to make penney hipper johnson dropped or deemphasized several profitable inhouse clothing and homegoods product lines while trotting out cheaper versions of upscale brands like michael graves and bodum the results have been widely chronicled including in fortune the makeover bombed sales plummeted and some  jobs were eliminated johnson declined to comment for this article in the spring of  the board ousted johnson and rehired ullman but the worst damage was done the chain’s inventory management and ecommerce operations were in chaos and penney ended up with some  billion in longterm debt the hindsight consensus was that johnson had dismissed penney’s core shoppers middleincome suburban moms with neither the inclination nor the budget to worry about being cuttingedge if anybody can relate to those customers it’s marvin ellison ellison one of only five africanamerican ceos in the fortune  grew up in brownsville tenn a twostoplight town between memphis and nashville that was segregated well into the s he’s one of seven children and his family was poor his father at one point worked three jobs at once too proud to take government assistance still the ellison family would shop twice a year at jc penney first for backtoschool clothes and then at christmas the family also performed as a gospel act—and got its stage outfits there too “going to jc penney was a big deal it was something we looked forward to” his older sister virginia recalls the ellison family shown here in  performed as a gospel act in outfits bought at jc penney marvin with bass guitar stands at the far rightcourtesy of jc penney marvin’s father an honors student had to drop out of high school to support his family after marvin’s grandfather suffered a heart attack at harvest time the senior ellison saw education as a way out of poverty and imparted a deep love of reading to his kids marvin developed big ambitions at an early age the books he likes best are biographies of presidents harry truman is his favorite he met his wife sharyn when both were students in the s at what’s now the university of memphis he later earned an mba from emory in  sharyn  says marvin caught her eye as the only young man on campus toting a briefcase rather than a backpack date nights early on revolved around episodes of dallas the ultimate business soap opera ellison’s retail career started during college almost by accident to help pay for books and rent he took a parttime job as a security officer at target at  an hour that gig turned into  years at the retailer as he climbed the ranks in theft prevention those early jobs gave ellison a closeup view of how retail works at the store level everything from the cadence of markdowns to the science behind keeping shelves stocked but the jobs also taught him something that would shape his management style too many managers don’t listen to the troops on the frontlines the workers in stores ellison had tons of ideas but didn’t share them with managers he says because they wouldn’t ask “too many ceos in retail like to be the smartest person in the room” says home depot cofounder and former ceo and chairman bernie marcus “marvin’s not like that” after ellison joined home depot in  he promptly sought advice from marcus who had recently retired the two went on store visits three or four times a year to talk strategy and culture home depot soon went through its own crisis enduring lagging sales and plummeting morale under ceo bob nardelli after frank blake replaced nardelli in  blake became another advocate for ellison eventually naming him head of us stores blake credits his former protégé with helping fix home depot’s dismal customersatisfaction ratings and turning the company from an ecommerce laggard into a leader he also praises ellison’s knack for galvanizing workers in one memorable innovation ellison launched a weekly video feature on home depot’s internal tv station that showcased customerservice success stories blake compares them to espn’s sportscenter highlights “they provided a ‘wow that’s amazing’ element to work so that people could see how impactful their work could be … it makes the associates stars” “everyone on the board knew marvin would end up running a major retailer” adds blake but it wasn’t to be at home depot in  the company chose craig menear to succeed blake menear had been the chain’s chief merchant which meant he had an edge ellison lacked extensive experience deciding which merchandise to sell and working with buyers to spot promising products such “merchant princes” tend to dominate the corner office in retail former top merchants currently run kohl’s and macy’s but that résumé gap didn’t stop penney’s board from approaching ellison that summer to be its future ceo mike ullman who was instrumental in the search says that while ellison may not know merchandising inside and out he is selfaware enough to surround himself with people who do “he knows who he is and exactly what he wants to accomplish” ullman says penney announced ellison’s hiring in october  and since then ellison has conducted more than  employee town halls and visited  stores in a relatively uncommon hiring agreement ellison was designated to become ceo but first would spend nine months as president under ullman the two men traveled the world visiting vendors and partners so that ullman could give ellison a crash course in areas he was less familiar with like apparel factories sourcing and merchandising the ullmantoellison ceo handoff took place last august but even today ellison is constantly listening and watching taking the measure of his colleagues facetoface interaction helped ellison quickly spot disconnects between penney’s executives and its store employees early on he was irked to see senior management in stores wearing designer clothing far beyond the budget of a typical staffer or customer a snappy dresser himself ellison implemented a rule requiring executives to wear jc penney–made clothes when they visit stores and to wear the same name tags store workers do during the frisco store tour ellison and the executives all wore penney brands—ellison and the other men in michael strahan and stafford suits a woman colleague in worthington fashion choices weren’t the only issue on which management and staff weren’t connecting one legacy of the reinvention fiasco was that inventory management was a mess senior management frequently felt that stores were sufficiently stocked but instore employees were constantly alerting ellison to shortages management’s misreading was exposed on black friday weekend in  penney rang up decent sales but left money on the table as stores were out of stock of hot items because they had ordered too few one hint of the magnitude of lost sales penney ordered  pairs of women’s boots for thanksgiving weekend in  and ran out in  it ordered  million pairs inventory management is a challenge tailormade for ellison—part organizational part technological his new tech team which includes several of his former home depot lieutenants has instituted “demandbased logic” rather than say automatically shipping  handbags of a given make to every store every month penney now replenishes inventory based on realtime sales data that may sound like an obvious fix but hey remember the men’s shoes ellison is also refining penney’s pricing decisions by building databases to better synchronize markdowns and promotions with changes in demand penney’s tech todo list is lengthy particularly in ecommerce all kohl’s and macy’s stores offer sameday pickup for online orders something that penney is only getting around to this year and with smartphones fueling  of digital traffic penney cannot afford to have what ellison concedes is currently a subpar shopping app mike amend one of the home depot transplants is hustling to overhaul it his priorities integrating coupons and other incentives so that the app can tell shoppers an item’s bottomline cost amend needs to hurry up—kohl’s app already does that coming later this year handheld devices that will let store workers check customers out from anywhere in the store not just the registers these devices may look familiar to some shoppers they’re identical to the ones used at home depot as ellison sees it penney’s growth will come from getting a lot more sales from its existing customers penney says it now has  million active shoppers the same as in  at its nadir in  penney had lost  million customers it posted average annual sales of about  a square foot in — below their  peak and well behind those of its competitors see charts below to make its stores more productive penney can tap a host of enviable retail franchises take its  hair salons few people know it but the jc penney salon business is the largest such chain in the country in some markets they’re the dominant salons in town destinations for prom days and wedding weekends the salons themselves generate almost  of sales even more important penney says salon customers are among its most reliable shoppers as ullman says “you can’t get a haircut online” the salonistas come in eight times a year—twice as often as the average departmentstore customer—and spend twice as much many of the salons frankly look tired but penney signed a deal last year with instyle magazine to rebrand and upgrade them with a full rollout due to be completed this year instyle like fortune is owned by time inc time at the frisco store the salon has been overhauled already with slick signage exposedbrick walls and a bigger entryway designed to make it more visible and inviting penney hopes the rebranded salons will attract topnotch stylists who will in turn bring their clients—a new set of customers to woo jc penney’s instylecobranded hair salons instyle like fortune is owned by time incphotograph by nancy newberry for fortune ellison also plans to better coordinate the salons with penney’s instore sephora cosmetics boutiques—veritable cash machines where annual sales per square foot are almost  of course many sephora shoppers come in buy lipstick and mascara and walk right out ellison is betting that soupedup salons in proximity to sephora will offer customers a reason to spend more time at the store and keep them off amazoncom another prong of ellison’s strategy expanding a strong suite of privatelabel clothing brands penneyonly brands in home goods and clothing together generate  of company sales its topselling attire brands include arizona st john’s bay and liz claiborne penney is already a player in clothes for “big and tall” men and it now wants a similar position in plussize women’s clothing but it also believes its brands could lure younger shoppers that’s an existential priority according to consultant kantar retail the average penney shopper is nearly  years old—up from  in  and slightly older than the average at target and macy’s ken mangone who oversees private brands says penney recently noticed that its ana clothing brand was unexpectedly popular with younger women penney quickly developed belle  sky a similar line intentionally focused on young shoppers which it just rolled out to  stores ellison also used belle  sky to accomplish another goal faster turnaround times to compete with “fast fashion” leaders like hm and forever  penney squeezed the concepttoproduction cycle time to  weeks for belle  sky compared with about  weeks on average for its apparel lines penney’s recent store makeovers highlight popular brands like levi’sphotograph by nancy newberry for fortune penney’s inhouse brands have one thing in common they’re affordable according to kantar the average household income of a penney shopper is  vs  or so at target and kohl’s and  at macy’s memories of watching his parents stretch their budget help ellison relate to a lowerincome customer he says he recalls that at one point to make ends meet his studious and ambitious father took an extra job as a busboy at a ramada inn “if you saw the guy with a bow tie on serving drinks you had no idea who he was if you didn’t ask” the bluecollar crowd isn’t the market that looks sexiest to investors but he’s adamant that penney’s future hinges on it “we can convince ourselves that our core customers are a more affluent demographic but really they’re not” he says as we tour the handbags section in the frisco store an annoyed customer approaches ellison and his nametagwearing coexecs there’s nobody around to ring her up she complains and she had the same problem at the holidays “why don’t the four of y’all get some cashiers” she says a store manager quickly steps forward to help but when one underling tells the woman that the store has been busy ellison snaps “ ‘busy’ and ‘bad’ are the same thing to the customer” in a sense being “busy” is a sign of a broader contraction as sales have declined department stores have closed locations and reduced headcount compromising service and fueling more customer defections industry trends like those fuel skepticism about penney’s future retail experts speak of ellison with admiration but many see builtin limits to what he can do “macy’s and jc penney are fighting it out amongst themselves for a dwindling share of the market” says consultant robin lewis ceo of the robin report and a former head of goldman sachs’s gs retail practice kathy gersch founder of consultant kotter international notes that jc penney is “fixing the major problems” but if it can’t become relevant to younger customers “ultimately there is a ceiling” the decline of the american mall makes ellison’s job harder according to green street advisors  of penney’s  stores are in malls and about a third of those are in socalled c and dmalls—locations with a lot of vacancies which in turn hurt traffic for the remaining tenants penney has reduced store count by about  since  but ellison has resisted closing more ellison’s biggest initiative so far is actually a play on the weakening mall climate this year for the first time since  penney is selling appliances beginning with a store pilot project the decision is data driven the stores realized that a lot of customers were searching for appliances on jcpcom but it’s also a response to the fact that sears shld  another mall anchor is shrinking fast—giving penney a chance to grab shoppers looking for a fridge observers waiting for a big splashy move from penney will have to keep waiting penney’s debt which generates about  million a year in interest costs is a handcuff that impedes any major makeovers its capitalspending budget is about  million a year a fraction of what target macy’s and kohl’s each spend while macy’s has been plotting an international expansion and kohl’s plays around with incorporating virtual reality and robots on the sales floor ellison is stuck with prosaic tasks in february he announced that penney was looking into selling and leasing back its plano headquarters to whittle down some of that debt pressed on whether penney can return to its  apex when it had  billion in revenue ellison punts saying he’s not so concerned with a topline number as he is with creating a profitable sustainable business “we’re not going to sit on our hands and play the same cards we played in the past” he says “we’re going to be a modern retailer” but there will be no retailrockstar pyrotechnics for now ellison is playing bass

of the year marvin ellison is penney wise forget fancy what jcpenney has now in chairman and ceo marvin r ellison is just what it needs—a humble relatable leader who is quietly steadily brilliantly turning the company around by alisa gumbs    posted december   a   a   a   jcpenney chairman and ceo marvin r ellison photo jesse hornbuckle if you’ve walked into one of the more than  jcpenney stores across the us and puerto rico lately you may have been surprised to find what looks like—pardon the pun— a shiny new penney many of the stores have been refreshed with updated areas showcasing handbags and jewelry called center core this year an additional  stores have seen the introduction of a sephora inside jcpenney makeup boutique also  of the chain’s hair salons have been rebranded in a partnership with instyle magazine and now have attractive features such as modern signage and exposed brick the numbers behind the retailer are looking just as bright it has  million active shoppers having recouped the  million shoppers it lost between  and  sales per square foot were  in fiscal  up  from two years prior—the best they’ve been since fiscal  with the first half of the year demonstrating growth—comparable store sales rose  in the second quarter—jcpenney is sticking to its earnings estimates it’s projecting ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization of  billion for  and  billion for  up from an adjusted  million in  and a restated  million in  all of this good news has boosted analyst and investor confidence in the stock jcpenney shares have rallied more than  this year the man behind the turnaround chairman and ceo marvin r ellison is—not surprisingly—also making headlines but the yearold who became president in  and took over as chief executive last year is more often lauded for his steadiness than his shine last year the dallas morning news proclaimed that ellison’s story is “classic jcpenney” with his hardworking middleincome upbringing and his willingness to grind every day a fortune cover story in march dubbed him “the opposite of flashy” with astute attention to details especially those often overlooked as obvious and a relatability to the penney customer while ellison may lack flash he’s got no shortage of brilliance jcpenney executives describe him as an intelligent inspiring driven leader who has coalesced the company’s  employees around a singular mission to help their customer find what she loves with less time money and effort his leadership in restoring the value of jcpenney for its customers associates and shareholders is precisely why ellison has been named the  black enterprise corporate executive of the year jcpenney ceo marvin ellison in the frisco texas store photo jesse hornbuckle     teaching an old retailer new tricks   it’s no small task to bring a legacy retailer like the yearold jcpenney—founded as “the golden rule” by james cash penney in kemmerer wyoming—into the age of amazon however that challenge becomes gargantuan when the company is reeling from a failed reinvention which saw sales plummet by  and resulted in the layoff of  employees “i don’t think anyone in the external environment can really understand how difficult the situation was that mike ullman walked into in ” ellison said of his predecessor at this year’s analyst meeting adding that when he took over he’d counted more than  projects the company was trying to tackle simultaneously to turn itself around “when i started one of the first things i would ask the team was ‘describe our customer outline who our three chief competitors are what are some of the key financial milestones we need to try to hit really what’s our mission as a company’ those sound like very basic and fundamental questions” ellison says “but if you’re in the midst of a turnaround everything’s important you want to serve every customer you want to chase every financial measure but when you’re chasing so many different things you’re diluting your focus and you’re diluting your ability to solve the biggest most importunate issues” in addition to streamlining and clarifying the company’s objectives ellison had to build a team that could take them through the next phase of the turnaround of the original  people that reported to the ceo when he first arrived only two remain today all are focused on the framework of three areas that are key to the company’s resurgence ellison calls them the “strategic pillars” revenue per customer omnichannel and private brands one of the ways the company plans to increase revenue per customer is with its center core concept which it tested in  of its stores for almost a year before rolling it out to a third of all stores those stores are now outperforming the chain such datadriven decisions and similar testing are hallmarks of new initiatives such as a return to selling appliances after a year hiatus the omnichannel strategy is all about balancing traditional sales and ecommerce “we’re all facing the same challenges and that is how you create a seamless connection between brickandmortar and your digital customer it is critically important in any traditional retailer there is no perfect science but we were way behind” ellison says jcpenney’s been working hard to catch up with this year’s chainwide rollout of its “buy online pick up in store” service and a redesigned mobile app “streamlining the experience so customers can find what they want when they want and how they want is something that we’re keenly focused on we’re continuing to make shopping simpler than it ever has been before” says michael amend executive vice president of omnichannel private labels currently account for just over half of the retailer’s sales or  billion in  but the company plans to grow that to as much as  within the next three years just this quarter it has announced a new signature line of highend cookware from cooks and a plussize line from project runway winner ashley nell tipton one of the private label success stories is collection by michael strahan a menswear line from the nfl player turned television host that launched last year online and in  stores with suits sports coats dress shirts and accessories such as ties belts cufflinks and suspenders this year saw the addition of shoes to the collection as well as a new line of activewear under the label msx by michael strahan both lines are available in extended sizes and are now in  stores “i remember the jcpenney catalog as a kid that was always a big thing when that came in the mail” strahan told usa today when the first collection launched “they have always made fashionable stylish clothing but most important affordable clothing i thought that was very important to make things people can actually afford and that are fashionforward i’m glad that we’re partners” gross profit margins are higher on private brands at a reported  for jcpenney compared to  for the national brands it carries “how we build our private brands and build value into them is going to be the key” says chief merchant john tighe “marvin has helped us find ways to expand our brands expand our offering and get better every day in what we do” “as long as we can give the customers a reason to shop with us in store and online and we can offer products that create a level of differentiation between us and everyone else this company will continue to be successful” ellison says “if we can hit our financial plan for the second half of the year we will bring this company back from the brink of extinction to profitability” the right man for the job   at the time of ellison’s hiring in  thomas j engibous then chairman of jcpenney’s board of directors said in a press release “the board has completed its search for the right ceo to lead the next stage of jcpenney’s growth we are delighted to have found that person in marvin ellison a highly accomplished retail executive with a history of delivering top and bottom line results at major american retailers … we believe he is well equipped to return the company to profitable growth” ellison’s predecessor former ceo ullman agreed “over the course of his career he has proven his ability to produce results by improving operations building customer loyalty and motivating his teams his experience and leadership are exactly what we need to accelerate the progress we have made over the last  months” a lot of what ellison has been able to accomplish since then has been datadriven which is part of the science of retail however there’s also an art to what he does and his retail instincts have served him well especially in this position “because i grew up most of my life with value and saving money as the primary expectation around how to live life as we think about the ways we can serve customers operating in the same demographic and the same household income i connect really well with that” he says simply put ellison knows the jcpenney customer so intimately because he’s been the jcpenney customer the fourth of seven children ellison grew up in the small town of brownsville tennessee roughly an hour and  minutes northeast of memphis “there was a jcpenney in jackson tennessee about  minutes from our home we would oftentimes shop there for backtoschool and for christmas” ellison says “my parents for many years struggled financially to maintain a good household making sure that we had clothes to wear we had food to eat we had a place to stay and that we could get up every day and feel good about ourselves but we also operated on a pretty tight budget we had an understanding that it was important for us to be really really smart about everything we did and how we spent our money growing up that way working my way through college and in some cases having to work two jobs while going to school full time gives you a sense of appreciation for anyone operating on a budget and customers that are looking for value” he says ironically it was his need to work during college that ignited ellison’s career in retail he went to his school’s employment office with one simple request employment at the highest paying parttime job that they had available it happened to be at target and it paid four dollars and thirtyfive cents an hour ellison’s start at target as an hourly store security officer marked the beginning of both his love of retail and his leadership philosophy of listening to the employees on the front lines he went on to earn a business administration degree in marketing from the university of memphis and an mba from emory university he also spent  years working his way up the ranks before heading to the home depot for a year stint that led to his rise to executive vice president of us stores with responsibility for more than  stores and  associates “i’ve always had big dreams and aspirations i had no idea how i would get there but my parents were so wise that they never snuffed out a dream it didn’t matter if it didn’t make any sense at all they would just say ‘you can do it focus on your education put god first be a good person work hard and you can achieve all your dreams in life’” he says ellison was very serious about those big dreams as his wife sharyn can attest “i used to tell him when we were in college ‘you’re going to be real good at being old because you’re getting so much practice right now’ well he’s actually a lot lighter now than he was when we were in college because he was very serious he was stricken with wisdom at an early age” jcpenney ceo marvin ellison with senior jcp executives photo jesse hornbuckle the secret to his success   so how has ellison been able to translate that wisdom into forward momentum across an organization as weary and wary of change as jcpenney must have been after its failed makeover according to the executive team ellison’s built to help him effect that change it involves getting a lot of feedback setting a crystalclear vision and getting everyone on board “marvin has the ability to put himself in other people’s shoes in a really profound way i don’t think he’s ever forgotten where he’s come from even as he interacts with people on a daytoday basis he starts with positive intent and an ability to understand where that person is coming from he’s an incredible listener and an incredible storyteller” says chief customer and marketing officer mary beth west one of black enterprise’s “ most powerful women in business” and “top women in advertising and marketing” west who had served on jcpenney’s board since  when she was tapped for the position last year has brought  years of marketing leadership and brand management from kraft and mondelēz to the retailer ellison’s listening skills are a strength mentioned again and again by his colleagues “if you talk to those who have worked for and with marvin the feedback from them would be that he truly looks to engage each and every individual throughout the organization hear what their input is and see what they are seeing” amend says joe mcfarland executive vice president of stores who followed  ellison from home depot agrees “he understands how to motivate people he understands the buttons to push to get the best out of a person marvin has extremely high standards as it relates to performance there are no free rides he sets a very aggressive timeline for us but he’s also a great mentor to guide you on the how to get there you’ll never have one of those moments where you sit back and ask yourself ‘am i on the right track’ the way that he leads he brings you along with him” that ride is a long way from over there’s still a lot of work to be done at jcpenney the share price at just under  is still well below its  peak from  average annual sales per square foot are still significantly below competitors such as kohl’s and total sales are nowhere near the  billion the retailer produced in  but analysts are seeing the bright side earlier this year deutsche bank reiterated its “buy” rating on the stock “jcp is taking market share from peers which likely include other department stores as well as specialty apparel players many of whom are closing doors at an accelerated pace this topline resurgence is occurring while the company is rightsizing the entity” analyst paul trussell reported “ceo marvin ellison has his newly assembled team focused and his recent open market purchase ellison bought  shares of jcp stock in march highlights his personal conviction in the opportunity that lies ahead” and ellison himself believes the company is in its final phase of the turnaround which he’s calling the “growth and profitability” phase “we’ve been working our way over the past twelve months and we’ve made great progress” he says “we have a lot of work to do but the journey has at least started” this story appeared in the september  issue of black enterprise magazine ﻿ ﻿ related stories how business
