promise of hypoxia inducible factor hif technology elevation  ft akaishi mountains japan hif regulation harnesses the body’s natural strategy for adapting to low oxygen levels hif a primary regulator involved in multiple major biological pathways hif technology exploring the promise of hypoxia inducible factor hif technology hif a primary regulator involved in multiple major biological pathways hif is the primary regulator of the production of red blood cells rbcs in the body and a potentially novel mechanism of treating anemia this novel mechanism of action is referred to as hypoxia inducible factorprolyl hydroxylase hifph inhibitors hifph inhibitors act by simulating the body’s natural response to anemia this allows a controlled adaptive stimulation of the erythropoietic system in the body this activation of the whole system results in both increased red blood cell rbc production and improved stabilization of the bone marrow’s iron supply which ensures the proper incorporation of iron into hemoglobin necessary for such rbc production this adaptive simulation is very similar to the natural response that is induced when a person ascends in altitude at higher altitudes low levels of oxygen circulating in the bloodstream lead to reduced hifph activity in relevant cells in the kidney and liver the reduced hifph activity stabilizes and increases intracellular levels of proteins hifα and hifα referred to as hifα collectively for most cells the stabilization of hifα is greater than that of hifα which ultimately leads to an increase in erythropoietin epo secretion and a subsequent increase in rbc production hifph inhibitors work by blocking the effect of the prolyl hydroxylase enzymes which promote the breakdown of hifα proteins as the breakdown is inhibited the level of these hifα proteins increases in cells these hifs are the primary protein mediators that enable the body and all of its individual cells to adapt to changes in levels of oxygen both hifα proteins are consistently produced and their levels in cells are adjusted by the activity of the hifph enzymes which target the hifα proteins for degradation hifα helps cells survive under very low oxygen conditions whereas hifα helps cells and the body to adapt to modest changes in oxygen such that would occur with a change in altitude from sea level to up to  feet when hifα is stabilized it travels to the nucleus of the cell where it binds to the protein hifß when bound together they induce the genetic signal for the production of epo and several other proteins the hifph inhibitors increase hifα levels much in the same way that a reduction in oxygen increases hifα levels by inhibiting the hifph enzymes in the body with continued stabilization of hifα either by staying at higher altitude or by daily dosing of the hifph inhibitor the level of hemoglobin and rbcs will rise in order to increase the amount of oxygen circulating in the blood in this way oncedaily dosing of vadadustat also known as akb may have the potential to restore the normal level of epo for a patient with anemia vadadustat our lead compound in development works by inhibiting hifph leading to stabilization and increased levels of hifα and improved production of hemoglobin and rbcs while maintaining normal levels of epo in patients in addition we believe that vadadustat’s mechanism of action provides for the ability to induce a more prominent hifα response as naturally occurs with a moderate increase in altitude and an enhancement in the normal diurnal variation of epo which is the normal rise and fall of epo during each day about akebia global leadership in hif biology our pipeline pursuing indications in kidney disease and other serious conditions contact us media contacts

better since  hi fool premium advice help fool answers contact us login search search better buy organovo holdings inc vs akebia therapeutics inc which stock wins in a headtohead matchup between organovo and akebia therapeutics keith speights tmffishbiz jan   at am at first glance organovo holdings nasdaqonvo versus akebia therapeutics nasdaqakba might seem like an applesandoranges comparison organovo develops d bioprinted human tissues while akebia has a promising anemia drug in its pipeline there are similarities though the two companies market caps are nearly exactly the same  around  million wall street analysts expect both stocks to perform well in  which stock is the better buy right now lets see how organovo and akebia stack up against each other image source getty images the case for organovo the argument for why investors should consider buying organovos stock is one word growth shares of the d bioprinting leader have soared more than  over the last  months organovos revenue more than quadrupled in its most recent reported quarter compared to the prior year period ceo keith murphy predicts tripledigit percentage growth for the next several years organovo is racking up this kind of growth in a couple of ways first the company is driving increased adoption of its d human tissues through a concerted effort to educate prospective customers about the benefits of its products organovo has enlisted the help of several large customers to highlight the capabilities of d tissues to detect toxicity levels very early in the development process through conference presentations and scientific publications second organovo is rolling out new products and services the company launched its second product d human kidney tissue in september following success for its d liver tissue organovo plans to offer metabolism studies to customers in the near future a move that could double its annual revenue potential in october the company also announced plans to develop bioprinted human liver tissue for direct transplantation to patients    although organovos revenue is growing rapidly its still really low in its last quarter the company reported revenue of less than  million over onefourth of that revenue came from collaborations and grants rather than sales of its products and services however organovos management team believes the company could ultimately generate annual revenue of more than  million the case for akebia therapeutics akebia on the other hand hasnt experienced real growth its stock dropped  in  the biotech hasnt generated any product revenue yet so whats the investment case for akebia potential the company currently has two latestage clinical studies in progress evaluating experimental drug vadadustat in treating anemia related to chronic kidney disease ckd around  million americans suffer from ckd with approximately  million of them experiencing anemia related to the disease erythropoiesisstimulating agents esas are currently used to treat this anemia but they can cause hemoglobin levels to increase too much vadadustat holds the potential to treat anemia related to ckd and keep hemoglobin levels within a desired range even better the drug should be able to be used in treating both dialysis and nondialysis patients japanese drugmaker otsuka pharmaceutical liked vadadustats prospects enough to shell out  million up front for marketing rights and commit to potential milestone payments of up to  million analysts project that akebias share price will increase by more than  over the next  months in anticipation of latestage study results for vadadustat the first study for nondialysis ckd should wrap up in late  with the second study concluding in the third quarter of  better buy which of these stocks is the better pick for investors its a question of risk versus reward organovo probably has less risk the company already has two products on the market and doesnt face any large competitors with d tissue offerings however organovos revenue ceiling is lower than akebias so the potential rewards are also less akebia faces three primary risks one is that vadadustat fails to win regulatory approval another risk is that akebias drug gets beaten by a rival product fibrogen nasdaqfgen is developing its own drug roxadustat to treat anemia in ckd patients using a similar approach as akebia the biotech has several latestage clinical studies in progress for roxadustat that are scheduled to complete later this year akebia also has a risk that it will lose in patent litigation against fibrogen despite these risks i think akebia has a good shot at success over the long run  with a significantly higher peak revenue potential than organovo i like organovo but the better buy in this case appears to be akebia keith speights has no position in any stocks mentioned the motley fool has no position in any of the stocks mentioned the motley fool has a disclosure policy author keith speights
