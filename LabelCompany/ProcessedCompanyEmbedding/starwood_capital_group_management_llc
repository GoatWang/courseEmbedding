an offmarket transaction for  billion the vast majority of assets were located in the highgrowth markets of raleigh nashville and south florida the portfolio at acquisition included  existing buildings and  acres of land as well as a building under construction in raleigh the buildings were based in markets with minimal supply under construction with the majority of that new construction preleased—thus greatly reducing the negative impact new supply might have on the portfolio moreover these office markets are expected to continue experiencing strong rent growth with projected job and population increases that are among the best in the nation starwood capital has built a dedicated office asset management team that is positioning the portfolio’s assets to capitalize on strong cash flow and maximize profit by investing in highreturn amenities actively engaging tenants on early renewals and increasing rents to market levels the team has also taken advantage of opportunities to generate upside through early asset sales—including selling nonstrategic properties for prices well above initial allocationsthis investment demonstrated starwood capital’s ability to identify an attractive point in the cycle to enter markets in this case for suburban offices that were wellpositioned for growth starwood land ventures anticipating an opportunity that would emerge following the financial crisis the firm in  began to selectively acquire both small and large assemblages of finished and semifinished residential lots in some of the nation’s most distressed markets that the team nonetheless believed were positioned for recovery to pursue this strategy starwood capital created an affiliate starwood land ventures which teamed up on an exclusive basis with bestinclass local residential land experts in arizona california colorado and florida since its inception starwood land ventures on behalf of multiple funds has purchased nearly  lots at an average price of over  per lot—resulting in what the firm believes may be the largest independent fee assemblage of finished and semifinished lots in the united states since the great recession among its acquisitions starwood

residential sites to the homebuilding industry denver union station assemblage in  starwood capital via sof viii capitalized on the opportunity to form a joint venture with the master developer for the acre union station project in denver colorado—the largest transitoriented development in the us the fim believed that denver was poised for a resurgence and that the lower downtown lodo area in particular—which includes the union station neighborhood—was primed to emerge as the new city center as part of the jv sof viii’s partner contributed several undeveloped land parcels that were all located within steps of the historic union station which has become denver’s new transit hub the first building that the jv developed one union station was sold in —and established a new highwater

denver office market continues to thrive with lodo in particular becoming a destination of choice for fortune  companies the team is excited to see the market play out as expected in its original investment thesis  west th street in  sof ix acquired  west th street a k square foot retail building  leased to old navy the fund purchased the property—situated in the heart of new york city’s th street retail corridor between sixth and seventh avenues—from a seller that was determined to close quickly thus the starwood capital team was able to showcase the ability to rapidly and thoroughly analyze and finalize what it viewed as a fantastic opportunity to acquire a prime retail asset—with an investmentgrade tenant and valuable optionality through development rights—in one of nyc’s top shopping districts at acquisition the th street corridor was experiencing a major rejuvenation—some of its most prominent stores such as the macy’s and hm flagships were undergoing significant renovations due to the disparity in rents between th street and the times square madison avenue and fifth avenue shopping districts the team believed that tenants would increasingly be attracted to this corridor with penn station down the block foot traffic averaged up to  pedestrians per hour at peak times—and the team knew the neighborhood was wellpositioned to reap the additional benefits of hudson yards and other nearby development and improvement projects with market participants recognizing the increasing strength of the th street retail corridor in new york the team elected to realize those gains by selling  west th street for significantly more than its purchase price—barely one year after sof ix’s acquisition of the asset walker tower with its walker tower investment starwood capital was able to position itself to capitalize on the new york city luxury condo boom in december  the team negotiated a  interest in a story condominium complex located at  west th street between th and th avenues in new york city’s stylish chelsea neighborhood at the time of acquisition the firm’s outlook for highend luxury development in the downtown manhattan area was extremely positive due to decreasing supply a stable price environment increasing sales volumes and limited new construction originally built in  for bell telephone company the property was designed by ralph thomas walker—named “the architect of the century” by the new york times walker tower presented an exciting redevelopment opportunity due to its ’” average ceiling heights art deco architecture space for residential terraces unobstructed views of the empire state building hudson river new york harbor and both midtown and downtown neighborhood amenities and existing development rights the transformation of the asset into  highend residential condominiums involved a gut renovation of the entire building as well as the construction of four additional floors starwood capital’s inhouse design staff in collaboration with the firm’s development partners produced what we believed to be an extraordinary product clearly the market agreed with the team’s assessment—extremely high demand allowed walker tower to sell out at an average of  per square foot a fullfloor penthouse unit in the building sold in january  for  million or nearly  per square foot—setting a new record for a downtown manhattan condominium transaction public offerings starwood property trust amid the depths of the great recession starwood capital recognized that traditional commercial lenders were

aesthetics which ultimately help drive value for the firm’s investors approach starwood capital seeks to deliver consistent robust returns while placing a premium on preserving capital the team performs a comprehensive riskreturn analysis on each potential transaction and only invest in assets and businesses with asymmetrical return potential guided by common sense discipline and the recognition that intellectual humility is the foundation of successful investing the firm adheres to the following core principles invest when new supply is low target markets with high barriers to entry and little to no competitive supply planned or under construction since the economic recovery has generally been slow and steady starwood capital has not seen the type of aggressive supply that would typically result from the recent rent growth and strength of the markets anticipate capital flows seek to get ahead of capital flows in areas where economic growth is projected to drive tenant demand but new supply is not yet on the horizon the starwood capital team has found that capital flows often influence asset valuations as much as—or more than—the impact of local market supply and demand trends once these target markets are identified the team works on the “micro” side to pinpoint opportunities for asymmetrical return potential through valueadd asset management buy below replacement cost purchase—at favorable prices—fundamentally sound assets that have previously lacked capital attention or effective management buying below replacement cost offers a margin of safety typically ensuring that no new construction competition will be completed until values rise to justify new product starwood capital’s recent transactions demonstrate that opportunities continue to arise to acquire assets at discounted prices utilize appropriate debt to generate positive leverage seek to use proper leverage—in amount and duration—to reflect the stability of each asset’s cash flow in the current market starwood capital can typically buy property at yields in excess of the cost of debt and generate strong cashoncash yields during the hold period positive leverage allows the investment team to be patient for a recovery lessening the reliance on the residual value to achieve strong returns in most cases starwood capital can secure debt longer than the expected hold period—thus creating a potential asset upon exit if interest rates rise construct diversified portfolios actively manage concentrations of fund capital by diversifying exposures across risk profiles geographic areas asset classes and positions in the capital structure add value to investments through handson asset management acquire undermanaged or undercapitalized assets that the starwood capital team can stabilize and refurbish and implement a dynamic asset management plan in order to position each investment for sale at the maximum price in appropriate cases the firm can create a growth platform through the acquisition of complementary assets andor portfolios maintain investment discipline seek to enhance returns in both cyclical downturns and upswings by maintaining a
