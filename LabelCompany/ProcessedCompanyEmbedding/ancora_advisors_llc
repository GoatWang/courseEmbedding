corporation pbpb urging the board of directors to change its strategy or sell the company jun   am edt cleveland june   prnewswire  ancora advisors llc ancora a  shareholder of potbelly corporation company sent a letter this morning to the board of directors of potbelly corporation please find below a summary of and link to the full text of the letter ancora advisors llc is a significant shareholder of potbelly corporation potbelly or company owning approximately  of the outstanding shares we believe potbelly has the potential to be a very attractive investment at the current valuation underpinned by robust store level return on invested capital roic a strong balance sheet a quality brand and product and significant growth runway  however while the company targets  shop level roic it has been unable to translate strong unit level returns to acceptable shareholder returns since going public in october  investors have experienced nothing but losses as owners of potbelly  over every measurable period potbelly has underperformed the market dramatically for the most part  we believe management and the boards focus on growth at the expense of returns is the primary driver of the underperformance and we outline some key areas where a change in strategy is needed to put the company on a path that will reward rather than punish shareholders  if the board remains convinced that it now has the appropriate strategy in place we would strongly urge it to immediately pursue a sale  going private transaction as we do not believe the current strategy would be attractive for current or potential publicminority shareholders over any investable timeframe since the ipo we believe there has been a lack of accountability by this board with regards to driving value for shareholders  by slowing low or negative returning owned store growth and shifting to a franchise based model the company can produce meaningfully higher fcf  share than the current consensus projections particularly should the proceeds from a refranchising transaction be used to repurchase stock adopting the franchise strategy could realistically double the share price by  considering the majority of this board has overseen the significant underperformance of potbellys shares and has shown such a lack of conviction in the companys operating plan as evidenced by minimal purchases of stock shareholders deserve representation on the board by professionals that actually have a real vested interest in maximizing shareholder value  we would be happy to assist the board in identifying acceptable board candidates and we reserve the right to potentially pursue board representation at next years annual meeting if necessary please click the following link to access the full
