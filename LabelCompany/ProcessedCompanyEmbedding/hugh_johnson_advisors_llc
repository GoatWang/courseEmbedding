appreciate in value but we dont like to pay the taxes on the gain when we sell an asset so lets discuss an often overlooked tax provision that could eliminate capital gains taxes first some ground rules you must differentiate between capital assets and all others capital assets generally speaking are assets you hold for investment like stocks bonds and real estate if you are unsure consult your tax advisors short –term gains are taxed at your ordinary income tax rate they are assets held for one year or less longterm gains are taxed at favorable rates they are assets that you hold for more than one year sorry but we need to get just a touch technical here the starting point in determining the amount of gain you will be taxed on is to figure out the tax basis of the asset basis is a technical tax term that roughly equates to the purchase price of an asset with perhaps some adjustments to keep this simple we wont delve into what adjustments are made to purchase price but you should consult your tax advisor before you sell a capital asset to be sure that you have figured the amount of gain correctly the difference between the tax basis and the sales proceeds is either a capital gain or loss now for the planning idea it involves capital assets that you hold at your death a provision in the tax law allows the capital gain to be eliminated if a capital asset is held in your estate at your death this is accomplished by virtue of receiving a new tax basis in the asset equal to its date of death value lets say that you bought apple stock at  per share lets also assume that you hold the shares until your death when they are worth  per share you heirs will receive the stock with a new tax basis of  meaning that the  capital gain has been eliminated so what should you be thinking about lets use your home as an example if you own your home jointly as many married couples do onehalf of the value is included in the estate of the first spouse to die so only onehalf of the home gets a steppedup basis at death if instead the first spouse to die owned the entire home the surviving spouse would receive the home with a full basis stepup that means a sale of the home at that point would produce no capital gains tax unless it is sold for a value higher than the date of death value of course in most cases it isnt certain which spouse will die first however in some cases due to age differences or illnesses it might be more predictable something else to think about is the ownership of securities with a very low tax basis or said another way a very large capital gain that are held by elderly family members if the securities are owned at death they get a full tax basis stepup eliminating all capital gain you might want to think twice before selling securities with a large capital gain if the owner is infirm or elderly the reverse is true for assets that have fallen in value since they were purchased the provision that eliminates the gain at death also eliminates the loss at death so if you have an asset with a large capital loss you may want to sell it before death in order to get the tax benefit of the loss the primary tax benefit to a capital loss is that it offsets capital gains but only those that are taken before death one wrinkle to consider – if you transfer the ownership of an asset within one year of the date of death you dont get the stepup the irs assumes that it was done to avoid taxes the ownership of assets at death have consequences well beyond capital gain tax planning so you need to consult with your tax advisor andor estate planning attorney before making any changes but paying attention to asset ownership you could have significant tax savings for the family for informational purposes only consult with your tax

we use in our separately managed accounts   hugh johnson advisors  investment strategies client login investment strategies when it comes to compounding dont trust your intuition  you have no idea how powerful it is  manoj arora from the rat race to financial freedom core balanced portfolio with individual stocks the core portfolio consists of individual common stocks and bonds like most of the portfolios we manage we integrate a topdown approach to managing portfolios asset allocation with a bottomup approach individual stock and bond selection we will increase the percent of assets invested in equities when our disciplines tell us times are good and reduce the percent in equities when our disciplines tell us that times are not as good preserving capital when times are not good is an important goal of our approach we generally own about  individual stocks and a number of individual bonds we diversify the stocks among the different market segments and only buy higherquality issues both steps are designed to reduce the risk of the portfolio diversification is further enhanced by buying some midsized and small capitalization and some international equity positions core balanced portfolio with indexes for clients that prefer to avoid the potential volatility of individual stocks we offer a series of portfolio strategies that only use indexes exchangetraded funds rather than individual stocks and bonds as with all core portfolios we use a topdown approach asset allocation the risk of these portfolios is somewhat less than the risk associated with the core portfolio with individual stocks because greater diversification is built into the indexes the fees that we charge are also lower athena dividend strategy our athena dividend strategy is an allequity portfolio emphasizing lower portfolio volatility through dividend paying stocks including those with a global footprint we look to purchase world class companies with a compelling margin of safety these businesses generate excess cash that management can return to investors in the form of dividends unlike other dividend portfolios that focus mostly on income or yield our higher than market dividend yield is a byproduct of our investment process the portfolio is well suited for clients with a longterm time horizon focused on absolute returns fixed income portfolio with investment grade bonds the most important objectives for our fixedincome portfolios are stability abovebenchmark returns and avoiding negative returns in any given  month period our strategies are conservative because we use only investment grade bonds we do not buy longterm bonds with higher interest rate risk and all fixedincome portfolios are welldiversified we actively manage our fixedincome portfolios our specialized fixedincome team with decades of experience actively adjusts the government bondcorporate bond mix in the context of the business cycle stage our team adroitly exploits pricing distortions that may occur in times of emotional extremes high yield fixed income portfolio with below investment grade high yield bonds our high yield fixedincome strategy is designed to deliver high yieldincome from a portfolio of eight diversified higher yield higher risk strategies which are structured using liquid marketable exchangetraded funds the allocation to the eight strategies is adjusted in response to the changing environment cash and shortterm fixed income management the objectives of our cash and shortterm investment management programs are preservation of principal liquidity maximum yield in that order of priority client portfolios are individually designed to match each clients unique circumstances portfolios are creative and effective solutions to client challenges we always
