apple single product company its not the iphone  apple inc nasdaqaapl  seeking alphasign in  join nowgo»apple single product company its not the iphonejun  about apple inc aapl save money retire early long only longterm horizon cfasummarysomeday the iphone will be disrupted by an even better user interface we are still long apple despite this expectationservices is targeted to double in the next four years but even longer term we believe it will be more important to apple than the iphonethe services ecosystem is the single product the iphone ipad mac watch tv and homepods are accessories hardware is a means of accessing the real productwe believe apple nasdaqaapl is a single product company but that product is not the iphone someday the iphone will likely get disrupted by a new user interface probably related to augmented reality ar but we dont think this will impact apple as much as some might expect because the iphone is not the true product people are buying we see the services ecosystem functioning as the single product all the hardware including the iphone are accessories that give access to the ecosystem the ecosystem of services is much harder to disrupt it is made of so many components developers and partners it provides so much utility for so many people even if the way we access it changes the ecosystem will continue to provide an incredible experience but coming back to the current reality of ipads and iphones to access the ecosystem we see iphone demand remaining flattish over the next couple of quarters and then seeing a catchup period when the next iphone launches and we expect ipad demand to bottom in  with a fiveyear refresh cycle starting in  as the  ipad air becomes a legacy piece of hardware a single product company it has come to our attention that apple is viewed by some as a single product company we believe apple ceo tim cook sees that opinion becoming more widespread coaxing him to make comments like our services revenue topped  billion and its well on the way to being the size of a fortune  company were very happy to see the deep level of customer engagement with the apple ecosystem across all of our services  ceo tim cook q earnings call and demand for airpods significantly exceeds supply and growth in beats products has also been very strong in fact when we combine apple watch airpods and beats headphones our revenue from wearable products in the last four quarters was the size of a fortune  company  ceo tim cook q earnings call services nearly a fortune  company in the last  months services has generated revenue of  billion after eight years of growing at  cagr services include digital content and services itunes app store ibooks apple music applecare apple pay licensing and other services currently capital one financial nysecof bookends the fortune  list with  billion in revenue kraft heinz nasdaqkhc at  is close to the same revenue as apple services while notable companies not far away are facebook nasdaqfb at  and nike nysenke at  in the q earnings calls cfo luca maestri reiterated our goal is to double the size of our services business by  if apple can achieve this goal it could eclipse cocacola nyseko in revenue assuming cocacola stands still for four years  yy in  other apple hardware a fortune  company apples other products generated revenue of  billion in the last  months it has stayed in this range for a number of years as products come in and out of fashion ie ipod apple watch apple tv this includes sales of apple tv apple watch beats products ipod and applebranded and thirdparty accessories abm industries nyseabm closes out the fortune  list with  billion in revenue apples other products at  billion would be closer to the fortune  biogen nasdaqbiib at  is close to the same revenue as apples other products other notable companies nearby include estee lauder at  and toys r us at  iphone is not the single product… iphone ranks in the top  on fortune as a standalone product just ahead of amazon nasdaqamzn and iphone made up  of apples revenue in  we get it many people see iphone as the product apple will succeed by or fail because of and we dont disagree but hear us out …the ecosystem is the single product as important as the iphone is to apple the iphone is just a popular accessory arguably something will disrupt the smartphone someday people will instead use something else to access the apple ecosystem perhaps an augmented reality user interface source minority report how much time would you spend with your iphone if you had no wifi no data connectivity and no apps now think about all the great synergies you get when you have your iphone synced with your mac your ipad your apple watch your apple tv your apple carplay and soon your apple homepod all these pieces of hardware are simply accessories to connect you to the ecosystem of functionality the ecosystem is what improves your life and the ecosystem is what makes apples hardware products so great hardware is an enabler no doubt the ecosystem became what it is today because of hardware like the iphone but the focus has changed apple gives you the choice of how you want to interact with the ecosystem while we have seen people with ipads on the street taking photos the result has so far been that most people choose an iphone source extremetech since  over  billion iphones have been sold with  million or  of those sold in the last  months ipad has not fared as well since  apple has sold about  million ipads the gap in the number of units sold is interesting even despite the ipad selling at  of the price of the iphone many would say the upgrade cycle for consumers is longer but why is it longer our ipad story at home we have one ipad its an ipad air from  it has been nearly four years since we bought it we use it mostly to browse the web play candy crush were on level  but by far we watch youtube on it the most we used to use it for facetime but the quality of the camera is no longer comparable to our newer iphones so we are willing to give up size for quality we only use the ipad a couple of hours a day so the battery is more than sufficient the ipad never leaves our flat so running out of power is never an issue doing a double take of our ipad story we understand that everyone doesnt use their ipad the same way as us but one thing in common is the battery life even if you take your fouryearold ipad out with you all day you will probably come home with enough power to watch a cooking video for dinner our iphone story an iphone is a completely different story i have had two iphones in the last  years my current setup is an iphone s in space gray which i got at the end of  in the batch that had the battery issues as a result i have a new battery in my almost yearold iphone but my next refresh could be longer than average because of the battery change my first smartphone and first iphone was the iphone  which i got in late  the last six months with my iphone  i suffered with a battery that would only last half a day and shut down suddenly when it reached  on the battery bar were not telling you this because we want to give a bad review of apples products on the contrary we want to demonstrate that one of the reasons iphones are refreshed by consumers more often than ipads is because of the battery a brand new iphone or ipad connects the user into the apple ecosystem in different but very similar ways giving access to apps and files fullday usage of either product should not be an issue for new hardware but an iphones battery will see diminishing life below a usable threshold faster than an ipad this is simply due to the size and usage difference tomac did a poll with  votes on how often people upgrade their ipad over  upgrade less often than every three years with about  maybe upgrading annually source tomac we have a similar story with our mac air from  but you get the point we are still using it but we are starting to see the battery life diminish almost time for a new one after five years iphone refresh cycle less than half as long customers just want to get access to apples incredible ecosystem of apps and services they can do that with a number of products but so far they have chosen the iphone by far the iphone is strategically positioned with a smaller battery that has just enough power as a new product for a full day of heavy usage with hardware upgrades coming with a premium price and often appealing to the early adopters the majority of people will delay an upgrade until their current phone is causing them more headaches than providing value for many that means the battery is dying before they get home they are tethered to a wall all the time or attached to a power bank the beauty and coolness of an iphone are lost at this point this has meant that the iphone has had a refresh cycle of  years this compares to longer battery life products like ipad and mac which have  years or more to give with the new iphone plus versions getting bigger batteries we could see upgrade cycles on these plus versions extending a bit longer of course there are many other reasons people choose iphones like portability capability usability etc what does this mean financially first on the ecosystem apples ecosystem is a hidden asset in its services revenue line services has grown at  cagr for the last eight years and apples goal is to double the revenue between now and  which implies a  cagr through the first two quarters of  it has posted  yy growth consistently with the app store growing at  yy in q we think the apple pay cash card could add a billion dollars to the bottom line in a few years as well see our article apple bank on a topline basis apple services may never eclipse hardware products due to the difference in margin profiles but we believe in the long term apple services will mature into the largest contributor to the bottom line for apple hardware has already just become an accessory to the functionality of the services ecosystem ipad apple reached peak ipad in  this is year four since then after two quarters in  ipad sales are down  yy a sign that this may not be the refresh year but arguably  will be pushing the boundaries of the fiveyearold ipad airs capabilities were forecasting  ipad units to decline by  yy to  million ipads however in  we expect the trend to start reversing as the fiveyear refresh cycle starts to take hold at the end of the day we still believe there is a time and place for an ipad in the house we dont always want to turn our computers on but we want a bigger screen as well note units in thousands green bars are authors forecast source author apple we see mac units holding steady in the middle of a  million unit range for the next two years as well as they have over the last six years iphone we see iphone as a mature product now this year we expect some purchase delays will limit the unit growth its that there are more rumors floating and more press articles and mentions of new things and when that happens a percentage of people delay and so yeah we see a piece of that that probably affects us more in china than other places because theres a tendency there to buy the latest thing  ceo tim cook on cnbc but with an expected year anniversary of iphone in the fallwinter  should see a lift from delayed upgrades though a potential supply shortage could limit the upside given the maturity of the iphone and the already short refresh cycle the relative impact is expected to be minimal we forecast  yy unit growth in  to  million units and  yy unit growth in  to  million units as the majority of new iphones will fall into fiscal  note units in thousands green bars are authors forecast source author apple wrap up apple is a single product company but that product is not the iphone its the services ecosystem when the iphone and smartphones are disrupted by a new user interface like ar we will still be long apple because the ecosystem is a huge moat in our minds the ecosystem of services is much harder to disrupt it is made of so many components developers and partners it provides so much utility for so many people even if the way we access it changes it will continue to provide incredible utility apples ecosystem is a hidden asset in its services revenue line services are targeted to double by  implying a  cagr apple services may never eclipse hardware products in revenue but we believe in the long term apple services will mature into the largest

history of apple inc – founding and incorporation the birthplace of apple computer in  steve jobs cofounded the company in the garage of his childhood home on crist drive in los altos california apples first product the apple i invented by apple cofounder steve wozniak was sold as an assembled circuit board and lacked basic features such as a keyboard monitor and case the owner of this unit added a keyboard and wooden case the apple ii introduced in  was a major technological advancement over its predecessor apple computer company was founded on april   by steve jobs steve wozniak and ronald wayne the companys first product was the apple i a computer singlehandedly designed and handbuilt by wozniak and first shown to the public at the homebrew computer club apple i was sold as a motherboard with cpu ram and basic textualvideo chips which was less than what is now considered a complete personal computer the apple i went on sale in july  and was marketpriced at   in  dollars adjusted for inflation apple computer inc was incorporated on january   without wayne who sold his share of the company back to jobs and wozniak for  multimillionaire mike markkula provided essential business expertise and funding of  during the incorporation of apple during the first five years of operations revenues grew exponentially doubling about every four months between september  and september  yearly sales grew from  to m an average annual growth rate of  the apple ii also invented by wozniak was introduced on april   at the first west coast computer faire it differed from its major rivals the trs and commodore pet because of its character cellbased color graphics and open architecture while early apple ii models used ordinary cassette tapes as storage devices they were superseded by the introduction of a  ¼ inch floppy disk drive and interface called the disk ii the apple ii was chosen to be the desktop platform for the first killer app of the business world visicalc a spreadsheet program visicalc created a business market for the apple ii and gave home users an additional reason to buy an apple ii compatibility with the office before visicalc apple had been a distant third place competitor to commodore and tandy by the end of s apple had a staff of computer designers and a production line the company introduced the apple iii in may  in an attempt to compete with ibm and microsoft in the business and corporate computing market jobs and several apple employees including jef raskin visited xerox parc in december  to see the xerox alto xerox granted apple engineers three days of access to the parc facilities in return for the option to buy  shares  splitadjusted shares of apple at the preipo price of  a share jobs was immediately convinced that all future computers would use a graphical user interface gui and development of a gui began for the apple lisa in  however he was pushed from the lisa team due to infighting jobs took over jef raskins lowcostcomputer project the macintosh a race broke out between the lisa team and the macintosh team over which product would ship first lisa won the race in  and became the first personal computer sold to the public with a gui but was a commercial failure due to its high price tag and limited software titles on december   apple went public at  per share generating more capital than any ipo since ford motor company in  and immediately creating  millionaires – success with macintosh see also timeline of macintosh models the macintosh released in  was the first massmarket personal computer that featured an integral graphical user interface and mouse in  apple launched the macintosh the first personal computer to be sold without a programming language its debut was signified by  a  million television commercial directed by ridley scott that aired during the third quarter of super bowl xviii on january   the commercial is now hailed as a watershed event for apples success and was called a masterpiece by cnn and one of the greatest commercials of all time by tv guide the macintosh initially sold well but followup sales were not strong due to its high price and limited range of software titles the machines fortunes changed with the introduction of the laserwriter the first postscript laser printer to be sold at a reasonable price and pagemaker an early desktop publishing package it has been suggested that the combination of these three products were responsible for the creation of the desktop publishing market the macintosh was particularly powerful in the desktop publishing market due to its advanced graphics capabilities which had necessarily been built in to create the intuitive macintosh gui in  a power struggle developed between jobs and ceo john sculley who had been hired two years earlier the apple board of directors instructed sculley to contain jobs and limit his ability to launch expensive forays into untested products rather than submit to sculleys direction jobs attempted to oust him from his leadership role at apple sculley found out that jobs had been attempting to organize a coup and called a board meeting at which apples board of directors sided with sculley and removed jobs from his managerial duties jobs resigned from apple and founded next inc the same year the macintosh portable released in  was apples first batterypowered portable macintosh personal computer after jobs departure the macintosh product line underwent a steady change of focus to higher price points the socalled highright policy named for the position on a chart of price vs profits jobs had argued the company should produce products aimed at the consumer market and aimed for a  price for the macintosh which they were unable to meet newer models selling at higher price points offered higher profit margin and appeared to have no effect on total sales as power users snapped up every increase in power although some worried about pricing themselves out of the market the highright policy was in full force by the mids notably due to jeanlouis gassées mantra of fiftyfive or die referring to the  profit margins of the macintosh ii this policy began to backfire in the last years of the decade as new desktop publishing programs appeared on pc clones that offered some or much of the same functionality of the macintosh but at far lower price points the company lost its monopoly in this market and had already estranged many of its original consumer customer base who could no longer afford their highpriced products the christmas season of  was the first in the companys history that saw declining sales and led to a  drop in apples stock price gassées objections were overruled and he was forced from the company in  later that year apple introduced three lower cost models the macintosh classic macintosh lc and macintosh iisi all of which saw significant sales due to pent up demand in  apple introduced the powerbook replacing the luggable macintosh portable with a design that set the current shape for almost all modern laptops the same year apple introduced system  a major upgrade to the operating system which added color to the interface and introduced new networking capabilities it remained the architectural basis for the classic mac os the success of the powerbook and other products brought increasing revenue for some time apple was doing incredibly well introducing fresh new products and generating increasing profits in the process the magazine macaddict named the period between  and  as the first golden age of the macintosh apple believed the apple ii series was too expensive to produce and took away sales from the lowend macintosh in the s apple released the macintosh lc and began efforts to promote that computer by advising developer technical support staff to recommend developing applications for macintosh rather than apple ii and authorizing salespersons to direct consumers towards macintosh and away from apple ii the apple iie was discontinued in  – decline and restructuring see also timeline of the apple ii family the penlite was apples first attempt at a tablet computer created in  the project was designed to bring the mac os to a tablet – but was shelved in favor of the newton the success of apples lowercost consumer models especially the lc also led to cannibalization of their higher priced machines to address this management introduced several new brands selling largely identical machines at different price points aimed at different markets these were the highend quadra the midrange centris line and the illfated performa series this led to significant market confusion as customers did not understand the difference between models apple also experimented with a number of other unsuccessful consumer targeted products during the s including digital cameras portable cd audio players speakers video consoles the eworld online service and tv appliances enormous resources were also invested in the problemplagued newton division based on john sculleys unrealistic market forecastscitation needed ultimately none of these products helped and apples market share and stock prices continued to slidecitation needed throughout this period microsoft continued to gain market share with windows by focusing on delivering software to cheap commodity personal computers while apple was delivering a richly engineered but expensive experience apple relied on high profit margins and never developed a clear response instead they sued microsoft for using a gui similar to the apple lisa in apple computer inc v microsoft corp the lawsuit dragged on for years before it was finally dismissed at this time a series of major product flops and missed deadlines sullied apples reputation and sculley was replaced as ceo by michael spindler the newton was apples first foray into the pda markets as well as one of the first in the industry despite being a financial flop at the time of its release it helped pave the way for the palmpilot and apples own iphone and ipad in the future by the early s apple was developing alternative platforms to the macintosh such as aux the macintosh platform itself was becoming outdated because it was not built for multitasking and because several important software routines were programmed directly into the hardware in addition apple was facing competition from os and unix vendors such as sun microsystems the macintosh would need to be replaced by a new platform or reworked to run on more powerful hardware in  apple allied with ibm and motorola in the aim alliance with the goal of creating a new computing platform the powerpc reference platform which would use ibm and motorola hardware coupled with apple software the aim alliance hoped that preps performance and apples software would leave the pc far behind and thus counter microsoft the same year apple introduced the power macintosh the first of many apple computers to use motorolas powerpc processor in  spindler was replaced by gil amelio as ceo amelio made numerous changes at apple including extensive layoffs and cut costs after numerous failed attempts to improve mac os first with the taligent project and later with copland and gershwin amelio chose to purchase next and its nextstep operating system and bring steve jobs back to apple – return to

capital and filemaker inc corporate culture apple was one of several highly successful companies founded in the s that bucked the traditional notions of corporate culture jobs often walked around the office barefoot even after apple became a fortune  company by the time of the  television commercial apples informal culture had become a key trait that differentiated it from its competitors according to a  report in fortune this has resulted in a corporate culture more akin to a startup rather than a multinational corporation as the company has grown and been led by a series of differently opinionated chief executives it has arguably lost some of its original character nonetheless it has maintained a reputation for fostering individuality and excellence that reliably attracts talented workers particularly after jobs returned to the company numerous apple employees have stated that projects without jobss involvement often took longer than projects with it to recognize the best of its employees apple created the apple fellows program which awards individuals who make extraordinary technical or leadership contributions to personal computing while at the company the apple fellowship has so far been awarded to individuals including bill atkinson steve capps rod holt alan kay guy kawasaki al alcorn don norman rich page and steve wozniak steve wozniak and andy hertzfeld in  at apple employees are specialists who are not exposed to functions outside their area of expertise jobs saw this as a means of having bestinclass employees in every role for instance ron johnson—senior vice president of retail operations until november  —was responsible for site selection instore service and store layout yet had no control of the inventory in his stores this was done by cook who had a background in supplychain management apple is also known for strictly enforcing accountability each project has a directly responsible individual or dri in apple jargon

companies apple provides a relatively simple compensation policy for executives that does not include perks enjoyed by other ceos like country club fees or private use of company aircraft the company typically grants stock options to executives every other year in  apple had  fulltime employees this increased to  fulltime employees the next year a notable hiring decrease largely due to its first revenue decline apple does not specify how many of its employees work in retail though its  sec filing put the number at approximately half of its employee base an editorial article in the verge in september  by technology journalist thomas ricker explored some of the publics perceived lack of innovation at apple in recent years specifically stating that samsung has matched and even surpassed apple in terms of smartphone industrial design and citing the belief that apple is incapable of producing another breakthrough moment in technology with its products he goes on to write that the criticism focuses on individual pieces of hardware rather than the ecosystem as a whole stating yes iteration is boring but its also how apple does business  it enters a new market and then refines and refines and continues refining until it yields a success he acknowledges that people are wishing for the excitement of revolution but argues that people want the comfort that comes with harmony furthermore he writes that a device is only the starting point of an experience that will ultimately be ruled by the ecosystem in which it was spawned referring to how decent hardware products can still fail without a proper ecosystem specifically mentioning that walkman didnt have an ecosystem to keep users from leaving once something better came along but how apple devices in different hardware segments are able to communicate and cooperate through the icloud cloud service with features including universal clipboard in which text copied on one device can be pasted on a different device as well as interconnected device functionality including auto unlock in which an apple watch can unlock a mac in close proximity he argues that apples ecosystem is its greatest innovation apple has a strong culture of corporate secrecy and has an antileak global security team that recruits from the national security agency the federal bureau of investigation and the united states secret service manufacturing the companys manufacturing procurement and logistics enable it to execute massive product launches without having to maintain large profitsapping inventories in  apples profit margins were  percent compared with between  and  percent for most other hardware companies cooks catchphrase to describe his focus on the companys operational arm is nobody wants to buy sour milk during the macs early history apple generally refused to adopt prevailing industry standards for hardware instead creating their own this trend was largely reversed in the late s beginning with apples adoption of the pci bus in the  power macs apple has since joined the industry standards groups to influence the future direction of technology standards such as usb agp hypertransport wifi nvme pcie

wozniak was introduced on april   at the first west coast computer faire it differed from its major rivals the trs and commodore pet because of its character cellbased color graphics and open architecture while early apple ii models used ordinary cassette tapes as storage devices they were superseded by the introduction of a  ¼ inch floppy disk drive and interface called the disk ii the apple ii was chosen to be the desktop platform for the first killer app of the business world visicalc a spreadsheet program visicalc created a business market for the apple ii and gave home users an additional reason to buy an apple ii compatibility with the office before visicalc apple had been a distant third place competitor to commodore and tandy by the end of s apple had a staff of computer designers and a production line the company introduced the apple iii in may  in an attempt to compete with ibm and microsoft in the business and corporate computing market jobs and several apple

apple lisa in  however he was pushed from the lisa team due to infighting jobs took over jef raskins lowcostcomputer project the macintosh a race broke out between the lisa team and the macintosh team over which product would ship first lisa won the race in  and became the first personal computer sold to the public with a gui but was a commercial failure due to its high price tag and limited software titles on december   apple went public at  per share generating more capital than any ipo since ford motor company in  and immediately creating  millionaires – success with macintosh see also timeline of macintosh models the macintosh released in  was the first massmarket personal computer that featured an integral graphical user interface and mouse in  apple launched the macintosh the first personal computer to be sold without a programming language its debut was signified by  a  million television commercial directed by ridley scott that aired during the third quarter of super bowl xviii on january   the commercial is now hailed as a watershed event for apples success and was called a masterpiece by cnn and one of the greatest commercials of all time by tv guide the macintosh initially sold well but followup sales were not strong due to its high price and limited range of software titles the machines fortunes changed with the introduction of the laserwriter the first postscript laser printer to be sold at a reasonable price and pagemaker an early desktop publishing package it has been suggested that the combination of these three products were responsible for the creation of the desktop publishing market the macintosh was particularly powerful in the desktop publishing market due to its advanced graphics capabilities which had necessarily been built in to create the intuitive macintosh gui in  a power struggle developed between jobs and ceo john sculley who had been hired two years earlier the apple board of directors instructed sculley to contain jobs and limit his ability to launch expensive forays into untested products rather than submit to sculleys direction jobs attempted to oust him from his leadership role at apple sculley found out that jobs had been attempting to organize a coup and called a board meeting at which apples board of directors sided with sculley and removed jobs from his managerial duties jobs resigned from apple and founded next inc the same year the macintosh portable released in  was apples first batterypowered portable macintosh personal computer after jobs departure the macintosh product line underwent a steady change of focus to higher price points the socalled highright policy named for the position on a chart of price vs profits jobs had argued the company should produce products aimed at the consumer market and aimed for a  price for the macintosh which they were unable to meet newer models selling at higher price points offered higher profit margin and appeared to have no effect on total sales as power users snapped up every increase in power although some worried about pricing themselves out of the market the highright policy was in full force by the mids notably due to jeanlouis gassées mantra of fiftyfive or die referring to the  profit margins of the macintosh ii this policy began to backfire in the last years of the decade as new desktop publishing programs appeared on pc clones that offered some or much of the same functionality of the macintosh but at far lower price points the company lost its monopoly in this market and had already estranged many of its original consumer customer base who could no longer afford their highpriced products the christmas season of  was the first in the companys history that saw declining sales and led to a  drop in apples stock price gassées objections were overruled and he was forced from the company in  later that year apple introduced three lower cost models the macintosh classic macintosh lc and macintosh iisi all of which saw significant sales due to pent up demand in  apple introduced the powerbook replacing the luggable macintosh portable with a design that set the current shape for almost all modern laptops the same year apple introduced system  a major upgrade to the operating system which added color to the interface and introduced new networking capabilities it remained the architectural basis for the classic mac os the success of the powerbook and other products brought increasing revenue for some time apple was doing incredibly well introducing fresh new products and generating increasing profits in the process the magazine macaddict named the period between  and  as the first golden age of the macintosh apple believed the apple ii series was too expensive to produce and took away sales from the lowend macintosh in the s apple released the macintosh lc and began efforts to promote that computer by advising developer technical support staff to recommend developing applications for macintosh rather than apple ii and authorizing salespersons to direct consumers towards macintosh and away from apple ii the apple iie was discontinued in  – decline and restructuring see also timeline of the apple ii family the penlite was apples first attempt at a tablet computer created in  the project was designed to bring the mac os to a tablet – but was shelved in favor of the newton the success of apples lowercost consumer models especially the lc also led to cannibalization of their higher priced machines to address this management introduced several new brands selling largely identical machines at different price points aimed at different markets these were the highend quadra the midrange centris line and the illfated performa series this led to significant market confusion as customers did not understand the difference between models apple also experimented with a number of other unsuccessful consumer targeted products during the s including digital cameras portable cd audio players speakers video consoles the eworld online service and tv appliances enormous resources were also invested in the problemplagued newton division based on john sculleys unrealistic market forecastscitation needed ultimately none of these products helped and apples market share and stock prices continued to slidecitation needed throughout this period microsoft continued to gain market share with windows by focusing on delivering software to cheap commodity personal computers while apple was delivering a richly engineered but expensive experience apple relied on high profit margins and never developed a clear response instead they sued microsoft for using a gui similar to the apple lisa in apple computer inc v microsoft corp the lawsuit dragged on for years before it was finally dismissed at this time a series of major product flops and missed deadlines sullied apples reputation and sculley was replaced as ceo by michael spindler the newton was

platform the powerpc reference platform which would use ibm and motorola hardware coupled with apple software the aim alliance hoped that preps performance and apples software would leave the pc far behind and thus counter microsoft the same year apple introduced the power macintosh the first of many apple computers to use motorolas powerpc processor in  spindler was replaced by gil amelio as ceo amelio made numerous changes at apple including extensive layoffs and cut costs after numerous failed attempts to improve mac os first with the taligent project and later with copland and gershwin

highly successful companies founded in the s that bucked the traditional notions of corporate culture jobs often walked around the office barefoot even after apple became a fortune  company by the time of the  television commercial apples informal culture had become a key trait that differentiated it from its competitors according to a  report in fortune this has resulted in a corporate culture more akin to a startup rather than a multinational corporation as the company has grown and been led by a series of differently opinionated chief executives it has arguably lost some of its original character nonetheless it has maintained a reputation for fostering individuality and excellence that reliably attracts talented workers particularly after jobs returned to the company numerous apple employees have stated that projects without jobss involvement often took longer than projects with it to recognize the best of its employees apple created the apple fellows program which awards individuals who make extraordinary technical or leadership contributions to personal computing while at the company the apple fellowship has so far been awarded to individuals including bill atkinson steve capps rod holt alan kay guy kawasaki al alcorn don norman rich page and steve wozniak steve wozniak and andy hertzfeld in  at apple employees are specialists who are not exposed to functions outside their area of expertise jobs saw this as a means of having bestinclass employees in every role for instance ron johnson—senior vice president of retail operations until november  —was responsible for site selection instore service and store layout yet had no control of the inventory in his stores this was done by cook who had a background in supplychain management apple is also

employees this increased to  fulltime employees the next year a notable hiring decrease largely due to its first revenue decline apple does not specify how many of its employees work in retail though its  sec filing put the number at approximately half of its employee base an editorial article in the verge in september  by technology journalist thomas ricker explored some of the publics perceived lack of innovation at apple in recent years specifically stating that samsung has matched and even surpassed apple in terms of smartphone industrial design and citing the belief that apple is incapable of producing another breakthrough moment in technology with its products he goes on to write that the criticism focuses on individual pieces of hardware rather than the ecosystem as a whole stating yes iteration is boring but its also how apple does business  it enters a new market and then refines and refines and continues refining until it yields a success he acknowledges that people are wishing for the excitement of revolution but argues that people want the comfort that comes with harmony furthermore he writes that a device is only the starting point of an experience that will ultimately be ruled by the ecosystem in which it was spawned referring to how decent hardware products can still fail without a proper ecosystem specifically mentioning that walkman didnt have an ecosystem to keep users from leaving once something better came along but how apple devices in different hardware segments are able to communicate and cooperate through the icloud cloud service with features including universal clipboard in which text copied on one device can be pasted on a different device as well as interconnected device functionality including auto unlock in which an apple watch can unlock a mac in close proximity he argues that apples ecosystem is its greatest innovation apple has a strong culture of corporate secrecy and has an antileak global security team that recruits from the national security agency the federal bureau of investigation and the united states secret service manufacturing the companys manufacturing procurement and logistics enable it to execute massive product launches without having to maintain large profitsapping inventories in  apples profit margins were  percent compared with between  and  percent for most other hardware

over which product would ship first lisa won the race in  and became the first personal computer sold to the public with a gui but was a commercial failure due to its high price tag and limited software titles on december   apple went public at  per share generating more capital than any ipo since ford motor company in  and immediately creating  millionaires – success with macintosh see also timeline of macintosh models the macintosh released in  was the first massmarket personal computer that featured an integral graphical user interface and mouse in  apple launched the macintosh the first personal computer to be sold without a programming language its debut was signified by  a  million television commercial directed by ridley scott that aired during the third quarter of super bowl xviii on january   the commercial is now hailed as a watershed event for apples success and was called a masterpiece by cnn and one of the greatest commercials of all time by tv guide the macintosh initially sold well but followup sales were not strong due to its high price and limited range of software titles the machines fortunes changed with the introduction of the laserwriter the first postscript laser printer to be sold at a reasonable price and pagemaker an early desktop publishing package it has been suggested that the combination of these three products were responsible for the creation of the desktop publishing market the macintosh was particularly powerful in the desktop publishing market due to its advanced graphics capabilities which had necessarily been built in to create the intuitive macintosh gui in  a power struggle developed between jobs and ceo john sculley who had been hired two years earlier the apple board of directors instructed sculley to contain jobs and limit his ability to launch expensive forays into untested products rather than submit to sculleys direction jobs attempted to oust him from his leadership role at apple sculley found out that jobs had been attempting to organize a coup and called a board meeting at which apples board of directors sided with sculley and removed jobs from his managerial duties jobs resigned from apple and founded next inc the same year the macintosh portable released in  was apples first batterypowered portable macintosh personal computer after jobs departure the macintosh product line underwent a steady change of focus to higher price points the socalled highright policy named for the position on a chart of price vs profits jobs had argued the company should produce products aimed at the consumer market and aimed for a  price for the macintosh which they were unable to meet newer models selling at higher price points offered higher profit margin and appeared to have no effect on total sales as power users snapped up every increase in power although some worried about pricing themselves out of the market the highright policy was in full force by the mids notably due to jeanlouis gassées mantra of fiftyfive or die referring to the  profit margins of the macintosh ii this policy began to backfire in the last years of the decade as new desktop publishing programs appeared on pc clones that offered some or much of the same functionality of the macintosh but at far lower price points the company lost its monopoly in this market and had already estranged many of its original consumer customer base who could no longer afford their highpriced products the christmas season of  was the first in the companys history that saw declining sales and led to a  drop in apples stock price gassées objections were overruled and he was forced from the company in  later that year apple introduced three lower cost models the macintosh classic macintosh lc and macintosh iisi all of

classic mac os the success of the powerbook and other products brought increasing revenue for some time apple was doing incredibly well introducing fresh new products and generating increasing profits in the process the magazine macaddict named the period between  and  as the first golden age of the macintosh apple believed the apple ii series was too expensive to produce and took away sales from the lowend macintosh in the s apple released the macintosh lc and began efforts to promote that computer by advising developer technical support staff to recommend developing applications for macintosh rather than apple ii and authorizing salespersons to direct consumers towards macintosh and away from apple ii the apple iie was discontinued in  – decline and restructuring see also timeline of the apple ii family the penlite was apples first attempt at a tablet computer created in  the project was designed to bring the mac os to a tablet – but was shelved in favor of the newton the success of apples lowercost consumer models especially the lc also led to cannibalization of their higher priced machines to address this management introduced several new brands selling largely identical machines at different price points aimed at different markets these were the highend quadra the midrange centris line and the illfated performa series this led to significant market confusion as customers did not understand the difference between models apple also experimented with a number of other unsuccessful consumer targeted products during the s including digital cameras portable cd audio players speakers video consoles the eworld online service and tv appliances enormous resources were also invested in the problemplagued newton division based on john sculleys unrealistic market forecastscitation needed ultimately none of these products helped and apples market share and stock prices continued to slidecitation needed throughout this period microsoft continued to gain market share with windows by focusing on delivering software to cheap commodity personal computers while apple was delivering a richly engineered but expensive experience apple relied on high profit margins and never developed a clear response instead they sued microsoft for using a gui similar to the apple lisa in apple computer inc v microsoft corp the lawsuit dragged on for years before it was finally dismissed at this time a series of major product flops and missed deadlines sullied apples reputation and sculley was replaced as ceo by michael spindler the newton was

janoff presented jobs with several different monochromatic themes for the bitten logo and jobs immediately took a liking to it however jobs insisted that the logo be colorized to humanize the company

highly successful companies founded in the s that bucked the traditional notions of corporate culture jobs often walked around the office barefoot even after apple became a fortune  company by the time of the  television commercial apples informal culture had become a key trait that differentiated it from its competitors according to a  report in fortune this has resulted in a corporate culture more akin to a startup rather than a multinational corporation as the company has grown and been led by a series of differently opinionated chief executives it has arguably lost some of its original character nonetheless it has maintained a reputation for fostering individuality and excellence that reliably attracts talented workers particularly after jobs returned to the company numerous apple employees have stated that projects without jobss involvement often took longer than projects with it to recognize the best of its employees apple created the apple fellows program which awards individuals who make extraordinary technical or leadership contributions to personal computing while at the company the apple fellowship has so far been awarded to individuals including bill atkinson steve capps rod holt alan kay guy kawasaki al alcorn don norman rich page and steve wozniak steve wozniak and andy hertzfeld in  at apple employees are specialists who are not exposed to functions outside their area of expertise jobs saw this as a means of having bestinclass employees in every role for instance ron johnson—senior vice president of retail operations until november  —was responsible for site selection instore service and store layout yet had no control of the inventory in his stores this was done by cook who had a background in supplychain management apple is also known for strictly enforcing accountability each project has a directly responsible individual or dri in apple jargon as an example when ios senior vice president scott forstall refused to sign apples official apology for numerous errors in the redesigned maps app he was forced to resign unlike other major us companies apple provides a relatively simple compensation policy for executives that does not include perks enjoyed by other ceos like country club fees or private use of company aircraft the company typically grants stock options to executives every other year in  apple had  fulltime employees this increased to  fulltime employees the next year a notable hiring decrease largely due to its first revenue decline apple does not specify how many of its employees work in retail though its  sec filing put the number at approximately half of its employee base an editorial article in the verge in september  by technology journalist thomas ricker explored some of the publics perceived lack of innovation at apple in recent years specifically stating that samsung has matched and even surpassed apple in terms of smartphone industrial design and citing the belief that apple is incapable of producing another breakthrough moment in technology with its products he goes on to write that the criticism focuses on individual pieces of hardware rather than the ecosystem as a whole stating yes iteration is boring but its also how apple does business  it enters a new market and then refines and refines and continues refining until it yields a success he acknowledges that people are wishing for the excitement of revolution but argues that people want the comfort that comes with harmony furthermore he writes that a device is only the starting point of an experience that will ultimately be ruled by the ecosystem in which it was spawned referring to how decent hardware products can still fail without a proper ecosystem specifically mentioning that walkman didnt have an ecosystem to keep users from leaving once something better came along but how apple devices in different hardware segments are able to communicate and cooperate through the icloud cloud service with features including universal clipboard in which text copied on one device can be pasted on a different device as well as interconnected device functionality including auto unlock in which an apple watch can unlock a mac in close proximity he argues that apples ecosystem is its greatest innovation apple has a strong culture of corporate secrecy and has an antileak global security team that recruits from the national security agency the federal bureau of investigation and the united states secret service manufacturing the companys manufacturing procurement and logistics enable it to execute massive product launches without having to maintain large profitsapping inventories in  apples profit margins were  percent compared with between  and  percent for most other hardware companies cooks catchphrase to describe his focus on the companys operational arm is nobody wants to buy sour milk during the macs early history apple generally refused to adopt prevailing industry standards for hardware instead creating their own this trend was largely reversed in the late s beginning with apples adoption of the pci bus in the  power macs apple has since joined the industry standards groups to influence the future direction of technology standards such as usb agp hypertransport wifi nvme pcie and others in its products firewire is an appleoriginated standard that was widely adopted across the industry after it was standardized as ieee  and is a legally mandated port in all cable tv boxes in the united states apple has gradually expanded its efforts in getting its

the late s however as a result of outsourcing initiatives in the s almost all of its manufacturing is now handled abroad according to a report by the new york times apple insiders believe the vast

suicides at foxconn  a team from apple is independently evaluating the steps they are taking to address these tragic events and we will continue our ongoing inspections of the facilities where our products are made the statement was released after the results from the companys probe into its suppliers labor practices were published in early  foxconn was not specifically named in the report but apple identified a series of serious labor violations of labor laws including apples own rules and some child labor existed in a number of factories apple committed to the implementation of changes following the suicides also in  workers in china planned to sue iphone contractors over poisoning by a cleaner used to clean lcd screens one worker claimed that he and his coworkers had not been informed of possible occupational illnesses after a high suicide rate in a foxconn facility in china making ipads and iphones albeit a lower rate than that of china as a whole workers were forced to sign a legally binding document guaranteeing that they would not kill themselves workers in factories producing apple products have also been exposed to nhexane a neurotoxin that is a cheaper alternative than alcohol for cleaning the products a  bbc investigation found excessive hours and other problems persisted despite apples promise to reform factory practice after the  foxconn suicides the pegatron factory was once again the subject of review as reporters gained access to the working conditions inside through recruitment as employees while the bbc maintained that the experiences of its reporters showed that labor violations were continuing since  apple publicly disagreed with the bbc and stated we are aware of no other company doing as much as apple to ensure fair and safe working conditions in december  the institute for global labour and human rights published a report which documented inhumane conditions for the  workers at a zhen ding technology factory in shenzhen china which serves as a major supplier of circuit boards for apples iphone and ipad according to the report workers are pressured into hour work weeks which leaves them so exhausted that they often

apple has created subsidiaries in lowtax places such as ireland the netherlands luxembourg and the british virgin islands to cut the taxes it pays around the world according to the new york times in the s apple was among the first tech companies to designate overseas salespeople in hightax countries in a manner that allowed the company to sell on behalf of lowtax subsidiaries on other continents sidestepping income taxes in the late s apple was a pioneer of an accounting technique known as the double irish with a dutch sandwich which reduces taxes by routing profits through irish subsidiaries and the netherlands and then to the caribbean british conservative party member of parliament charlie elphicke published research on october   which showed that some multinational companies including apple inc were making billions of pounds of profit in the uk but were paying an effective tax rate to the uk treasury of only  percent well below standard corporation tax he followed this research by calling on the chancellor of the exchequer george osborne to force these multinationals which also included google and the cocacola company to state the effective rate of tax they pay on their uk revenues elphicke also said that government contracts should be withheld from multinationals who do not pay their fair share of uk tax it is a matter of public record that apple inc is the single

cofounded the company in the garage of his childhood home on crist drive in los altos california apples first product the apple i invented by apple cofounder steve wozniak was sold as an assembled circuit board and lacked basic features such as a keyboard monitor and case the owner of this unit added a keyboard and wooden case the apple ii introduced in  was a major technological advancement over its predecessor apple computer company was founded on april   by steve jobs steve wozniak and ronald wayne the companys first product was the apple i a computer singlehandedly designed and handbuilt by wozniak and first shown to the public at the homebrew computer club apple i was sold as a motherboard with cpu ram and basic textualvideo chips which was less than what is now considered a complete personal computer the apple i went on sale in july  and was marketpriced at   in  dollars adjusted for inflation apple computer inc was incorporated on january   without wayne who sold his share of the company back to jobs and wozniak for  multimillionaire mike markkula provided essential business expertise and funding of  during the incorporation of apple during the first five years of operations revenues grew exponentially doubling about every four months between september  and september  yearly sales grew from  to m an average annual growth rate of  the apple ii also invented by wozniak was introduced on april   at the first west coast computer faire it differed from its major rivals the trs and commodore pet because of its character cellbased color graphics and open architecture while early apple ii models used ordinary cassette tapes as storage devices they were superseded by the introduction of a  ¼ inch floppy disk drive and interface called the disk ii the apple ii was chosen to be the desktop platform for the first killer app of the business world visicalc a spreadsheet program visicalc created a business market for the apple ii and gave home users an additional reason to buy an apple ii compatibility with the office before visicalc apple had been a distant third place competitor to commodore and tandy by the end of s apple had a staff of computer designers and a production line the company introduced the apple iii in may  in an attempt to compete with ibm and microsoft in the business and corporate computing market jobs and several apple employees including jef raskin visited xerox parc in december  to see the xerox alto xerox granted apple engineers three days of access to the parc facilities in return for the option to buy  shares  splitadjusted shares of apple at the preipo price of  a share jobs was immediately convinced that all future computers would use a graphical user interface gui and development of a gui began for the apple lisa in  however he was pushed from the lisa team due to infighting jobs took over jef raskins lowcostcomputer project the macintosh a race broke out between the lisa team and the macintosh team over which product would ship first lisa won the race in  and became the first personal computer sold to the public with a gui but was a commercial failure due to its high price tag and limited software titles on december   apple went public at  per share generating more capital than any ipo since ford motor company in  and immediately creating  millionaires – success with macintosh see also timeline of macintosh models the macintosh released in  was the first massmarket personal computer that featured an integral graphical user interface and mouse in  apple launched the macintosh the first personal computer to be sold without a programming language its debut was signified by  a  million television commercial directed by ridley scott that aired during the third quarter of super bowl xviii on january   the commercial is now hailed as a watershed event for apples success and was called a masterpiece by cnn and one of the greatest commercials of all time by tv guide the macintosh initially sold well but followup sales were not strong due to its high price and limited range of software titles the machines fortunes changed with the introduction of the laserwriter the first postscript laser printer to be sold at a reasonable price and pagemaker an early desktop publishing package it has been suggested that the combination of these three products were responsible for the creation of the desktop publishing market the macintosh was particularly powerful in the desktop publishing market due to its advanced graphics capabilities which had necessarily been built in to create the intuitive macintosh gui in  a power struggle developed between jobs and ceo john sculley who had been hired two years earlier the apple board of directors instructed sculley to contain jobs and limit his ability to launch expensive forays into untested products rather than submit to sculleys direction jobs attempted to oust him from his leadership role at apple sculley found out that jobs had been attempting to organize a coup and called a board meeting at which apples board of directors sided with sculley and removed jobs from his managerial duties jobs resigned from apple and founded next inc the same year the macintosh portable released in  was apples first batterypowered portable macintosh personal computer after jobs departure the macintosh product line underwent a steady change of focus to higher price points the socalled highright policy named for the position on a chart of price vs profits jobs had argued the company should produce products aimed at the consumer market and aimed for a  price for the macintosh which they were unable to meet newer models selling at higher price points offered higher profit margin and appeared to have no effect on total sales as power users snapped up every increase in power although some worried about pricing themselves out of the market the highright policy was in full force by the mids notably due to jeanlouis gassées mantra of fiftyfive or die referring to the  profit margins of the macintosh ii this policy began to backfire in the last years of the decade as new desktop publishing programs appeared on pc clones that offered some or much of the same functionality of the macintosh but at far lower price points the company lost its monopoly in this market and had already estranged many of its original consumer customer base who could no longer afford their highpriced products the christmas season of  was the first in the companys history that saw declining sales and led to a  drop in apples stock price gassées objections were overruled and he was forced from the company in  later that year apple introduced three lower cost models the macintosh classic macintosh lc and macintosh iisi all of which saw significant sales due to pent up demand in  apple introduced the powerbook replacing the luggable macintosh portable with a design that set the current shape for almost all modern laptops

of the companys products he began an effort in  to revamp the retail program to get an improved relationship to consumers and hired ron johnson in  jobs relaunched apples online store in  and opened the first two physical stores in  despite initial media speculation that apple would fail its stores were highly successful bypassing the sales numbers of competing nearby stores and within three

locations it has been granted design patents and received architectural awards for its stores designs and construction specifically for its use of glass staircases and cubes the success of apple stores have had significant influence over other consumer electronics retailers who have lost traffic control and profits due to a perceived higher quality of service and products at apple stores apples notable brand loyalty among consumers causes long lines of hundreds of people at new apple store openings or product releases due to the popularity of the brand there are numerous job applications many of which from young workers although apple store employees receive aboveaverage pay are offered money toward education and health care and receive product discounts there are limited or no paths of career advancement a may  report with an anonymous retail employee highlighted a hostile work environment with harassment from customers intense internal criticism and a lack of

sydney ifc mall store in hong kong barcelona cologne corporate affairs see also list of mergers and acquisitions by apple braeburn capital and filemaker inc corporate culture apple was one of several highly successful companies founded in the s that bucked the traditional notions of corporate culture jobs often walked around the office barefoot even after apple became a fortune  company by the time of the  television commercial apples informal culture had become a key trait that differentiated it from its competitors according to a  report in fortune this has resulted in a corporate culture more akin to a startup rather than a multinational corporation as the company has grown and been led by a series of differently opinionated chief executives it has arguably lost some of its original character nonetheless it has maintained a reputation for fostering individuality and excellence that reliably attracts talented workers particularly after jobs returned to the company numerous apple employees have stated that projects without jobss involvement often took longer than projects with it to recognize the best of its employees apple created the apple fellows program which awards individuals who make extraordinary technical or leadership contributions to personal computing while at the company the apple fellowship has so far been awarded to individuals including bill atkinson steve capps rod holt alan kay guy kawasaki al alcorn don norman rich page and steve wozniak steve wozniak and andy hertzfeld in  at apple employees are specialists who are not exposed to functions outside their area of expertise jobs saw this as a means of having bestinclass employees in every role for instance ron johnson—senior vice president of retail operations until november  —was responsible for site selection instore service and store layout yet had no control of the inventory in his stores this was done by cook who had a background in supplychain management apple is also known for strictly enforcing accountability each project has a directly responsible individual or dri in apple jargon as an example when ios senior vice president scott forstall refused to sign apples official apology for numerous errors in the redesigned maps app he was forced to resign unlike other major us companies apple provides a relatively simple compensation policy for executives that does not include perks enjoyed by other ceos like country club fees or private use of company aircraft the company typically grants stock options to executives every other year in  apple had  fulltime employees this increased to  fulltime employees the next year a notable hiring decrease largely due to its first revenue decline apple does not specify how many of its employees work in retail though its  sec filing put the number at approximately half of its employee base an editorial article in the verge in september  by technology journalist thomas ricker explored some of the publics perceived lack of innovation at apple in recent years specifically stating that samsung has matched and even surpassed apple in terms of smartphone industrial design and citing the belief that apple is incapable of producing another breakthrough moment in technology with its products he goes on to write that the criticism focuses on individual pieces of hardware rather than the ecosystem as a whole stating yes iteration is boring but its also how apple does business  it enters a new market and then refines and refines and continues refining until it yields a success he acknowledges that people are wishing for the excitement of revolution but argues that people want the comfort that comes with harmony furthermore he writes that a device is only the starting point of an experience that will ultimately be ruled by the ecosystem in which it was spawned referring to how decent hardware products can still fail without a proper ecosystem specifically mentioning that walkman didnt have an ecosystem to keep users from leaving once something better came along but how apple devices in different hardware segments are able to communicate and cooperate through the icloud cloud service with features including universal clipboard in which text copied on one device can be pasted on a different device as well as interconnected device functionality including auto unlock in which an apple watch can unlock a mac in close proximity he argues that apples ecosystem is its greatest innovation apple has a strong culture of corporate secrecy and has an antileak global security team that recruits from the national security agency the federal bureau of investigation and the united states secret service manufacturing the companys manufacturing procurement and logistics enable it to execute massive product launches without having to maintain large profitsapping inventories in  apples profit margins were  percent compared with between  and  percent for most other hardware companies cooks catchphrase to describe his focus on the companys operational arm is nobody wants to buy sour milk during the macs early history apple generally refused to adopt prevailing industry standards for hardware instead creating their own this trend was largely reversed in the late s beginning with apples adoption of the pci bus in the  power macs apple has since joined the industry standards groups to influence the future direction of technology standards such as usb agp hypertransport wifi nvme pcie and others in its products firewire is an appleoriginated standard that was widely adopted across the industry after it was standardized as ieee  and is a legally mandated port in all cable tv boxes in the united states apple has gradually expanded its efforts in getting its products into the indian market in july  during a conference call with investors ceo tim cook said that he loves india but that apple saw larger opportunities outside the region indias requirement that  of products sold be manufactured in the country was described as really adds cost to getting product to market in october  indian apple executives unveiled a plan for selling devices through instalment plans and storewithinastore concepts in an effort to expand further into the market the news followed cooks acknowledgment of the country in july when sales results showed that iphone sales in india grew  during the second quarter of  in march  the times of india reported that apple had sought permission from the indian government to sell refurbished iphones in the country however two months later the application was rejected citing official country policy in may  apple opened an ios app development center in bangalore in february  apple once again requested permission to sell used iphones in the country the same month bloomberg reported that apple was close to receiving permission to open its first retail store in the country in march the wall street journal reported that apple would begin manufacturing iphone models in india over the next two months and in may the journal wrote that an apple manufacturer had begun production of iphone se in the country while apple told cnbc that the manufacturing was for a small number of units labor practices further information criticism of apple inc § labor practices the company advertised its products as being made in america until the late s however as a result of outsourcing initiatives in the s almost all of its manufacturing is now handled abroad according to a report by the new york times apple insiders believe the vast scale of overseas factories as well as the flexibility diligence and industrial skills of foreign workers have so outpaced their american counterparts that made in the usa is no longer a viable option for most apple products in  the mail on sunday reported on the working conditions of the chinese factories where contract manufacturers foxconn and inventec produced the ipod the article stated that one complex of factories that assembled the ipod and other items had over  workers living and working within it employees regularly worked more than  hours per week and made around  per month a little

employees attempted suicide resulting in  deaths—the company was the worlds largest contract electronics manufacturer for clients including apple at the time the suicides drew media attention and employment practices at foxconn were investigated by apple apple issued a public statement about the suicides and company spokesperson steven dowling said apple is saddened and upset by the recent suicides at foxconn  a team from apple is independently evaluating the steps they are taking to address these tragic events and we will continue our ongoing inspections of the facilities where our products are made the statement was released after the results from the companys probe into its suppliers labor practices were published in early  foxconn was not specifically named in the report but apple identified a series of serious labor violations of labor laws including apples own rules and some child labor existed in a number of factories apple committed to the implementation of changes following the suicides also in  workers in china planned to sue iphone contractors over poisoning by a cleaner used to clean lcd screens one worker claimed that he and his coworkers had not been informed of possible occupational illnesses after a high suicide rate in a foxconn facility in china making ipads and iphones albeit a lower rate than that of china as a whole workers were forced to sign a legally binding document guaranteeing that they would not kill themselves workers in factories producing apple products have also been exposed to nhexane a neurotoxin that is a cheaper alternative than alcohol for cleaning the products a  bbc investigation found excessive hours and other problems persisted despite apples promise to reform factory practice after the  foxconn suicides the pegatron factory was once again the subject of review as reporters gained access to the working conditions inside through recruitment as employees while the bbc maintained that the experiences of its reporters showed that labor violations were continuing since  apple publicly disagreed with the bbc and stated we are aware of no other company doing as much as apple to ensure fair and safe working conditions in december  the institute for global labour and human rights published a report which documented inhumane conditions for the  workers at a zhen ding technology factory in shenzhen china which serves as a major supplier of circuit boards for apples iphone and ipad according to the report workers are pressured into hour work weeks which leaves them so exhausted that they often sleep during lunch breaks they are also made to reside in primitive dark and filthy dorms where they sleep on plywood with six to ten workers in each crowded room omnipresent security personnel also

apple has created subsidiaries in lowtax places such as ireland the netherlands luxembourg and the british virgin islands to cut the taxes it pays around the world according to the new york times in the s apple was among the first tech companies to designate overseas salespeople in hightax countries in a manner that allowed the company to sell on behalf of lowtax subsidiaries on other continents sidestepping income taxes in the late s apple was a pioneer of an accounting technique known as the double irish with a dutch sandwich which reduces taxes by routing profits through irish subsidiaries and the netherlands and then to the caribbean british conservative party member of parliament charlie elphicke published research on october   which showed that some multinational companies including apple inc were making billions of pounds of profit in the uk but were paying an effective tax rate to the uk treasury of only  percent well below standard corporation tax he followed this research by calling on the chancellor of the exchequer george osborne to force these multinationals which also included google and the cocacola company to state the effective rate of tax they pay on their uk revenues elphicke also said that government contracts should be withheld from multinationals who do not pay their fair share of uk tax it is a matter of public record that apple inc is the single largest taxpayer to the department of the treasury of the united states of america with an effective tax rate of approximately of  as of the second quarter of the apple fiscal year  in  reuters reported that apple had earnings abroad of  billion which were untaxed by the irs of the united states under us tax law governed by the irc corporations dont pay income tax on overseas profits unless the profits are repatriated into the united states and as such apple argues that to benefit its shareholders it will leave it overseas until a repatriation holiday or comprehensive tax reform takes place in the united states on august   after a threeyear investigation by the eus competition commissioner that concluded that apple received illegal state aid from ireland the eu ordered apple to pay  billion euros  billion plus interest in unpaid taxes specifically the commissioner found that apple had benefitted from irish department of revenue tax rulings that allowed it to split the profits recorded by apple sales international internally between its irish branch and a stateless head office entity lacking employees or premises permitted under irish law until  the chancellor of austria

cofounded the company in the garage of his childhood home on crist drive in los altos california apples first product the apple i invented by apple cofounder steve wozniak was sold as an assembled circuit board and lacked basic features such as a keyboard monitor and case the owner of this unit added a keyboard and wooden case the apple ii introduced in  was a major technological advancement over its predecessor apple computer company was founded on april   by steve jobs steve wozniak and ronald wayne the companys first product was the apple i a computer singlehandedly designed and handbuilt by wozniak and first shown to the public at the homebrew computer club apple i was sold as a motherboard with cpu ram and basic textualvideo chips which was less than what is now considered a complete personal computer the apple i went on sale in july  and was marketpriced at   in  dollars adjusted for inflation apple computer inc was incorporated on january   without wayne who sold his share of the company back to jobs and wozniak for  multimillionaire mike markkula provided essential business expertise and funding of  during the incorporation of apple during the first five years of operations revenues grew exponentially doubling about every four months between september  and september  yearly sales grew from  to m an average annual growth rate of  the apple ii also invented by wozniak was introduced on april   at the first west coast computer faire it differed from its major rivals the trs and commodore pet because of its character cellbased color graphics and open architecture while early apple ii models used ordinary cassette tapes as storage devices they were superseded by the introduction of a  ¼ inch floppy disk drive and interface called the disk ii the apple ii was chosen to be the desktop platform for the first killer app of the business world visicalc a spreadsheet program visicalc created a business market for the apple ii and gave home users an additional reason to buy an apple ii compatibility with the office before visicalc apple had been a distant third place competitor to commodore and tandy by the end of s apple had a staff of computer designers and a production line the company introduced the apple iii in may  in an attempt to compete with ibm and microsoft in the business and corporate computing market jobs and several apple employees including jef raskin visited xerox parc in december  to see the xerox alto xerox granted apple engineers three days of access to the parc facilities in return for the option to buy  shares  splitadjusted shares of apple at the preipo price of  a share jobs was immediately convinced that all future computers would use a graphical user interface gui and development of a gui began for the apple lisa in  however he was pushed from the lisa team due to infighting jobs took over jef raskins lowcostcomputer project the macintosh a race broke out between the lisa team and the macintosh team over which product would ship first lisa won the race in  and became the first personal computer sold to the public with a gui but was a commercial failure due to its high price tag and limited software titles on december   apple went public at  per share generating more capital than any ipo since ford motor company in  and immediately creating  millionaires – success with macintosh see also timeline of macintosh models the macintosh released in  was the first massmarket personal computer that featured an integral graphical user interface and mouse in  apple launched the macintosh the first personal computer to be sold without a programming language its debut was signified by  a  million television commercial directed by ridley scott that aired during the third quarter of super bowl xviii on january   the commercial is now hailed as a watershed event for apples success and was called a masterpiece by cnn and one of the greatest commercials of all time by tv guide the macintosh initially sold well but followup sales were not strong due to its high price and limited range of software titles the machines fortunes changed with the introduction of the laserwriter the first postscript laser printer to be sold at a reasonable price and pagemaker an early desktop publishing package it has been suggested that the combination of these three products were responsible for the creation of the desktop publishing market the macintosh was particularly powerful in the desktop publishing market due to its advanced graphics capabilities which had necessarily been built in to create the intuitive macintosh gui in  a power struggle developed between jobs and ceo john sculley who had been hired two years earlier the apple board of directors instructed sculley to contain jobs and limit his ability to launch expensive forays into untested products rather than submit to sculleys direction jobs attempted to oust him from his leadership role at apple sculley found out that jobs had been attempting to organize a coup and called a board meeting at which apples board of directors sided with sculley and removed jobs from his managerial duties jobs resigned from apple and founded next inc the same year the macintosh portable released in  was apples first batterypowered portable macintosh personal computer after jobs departure the macintosh product line underwent a steady change of focus to higher price points the socalled highright policy named for the position on a chart of price vs profits jobs had argued the company should produce products aimed at the consumer market and aimed for a  price for the macintosh which they were unable to meet newer models selling at higher price points offered higher profit margin and appeared to have no effect on total sales as power users snapped up every increase in power although some worried about pricing themselves out of the market the highright policy was in full force by the mids notably due to jeanlouis gassées mantra of fiftyfive or die referring to the  profit margins of the macintosh ii this policy began to backfire in the last years of the decade as new desktop publishing programs appeared on pc clones that offered some or much of the same functionality of the macintosh but at far lower price points the company lost its monopoly in this market and had already estranged many of its original consumer customer base who could no longer afford their highpriced products the christmas season of  was the first in the companys history that saw declining sales and led to a  drop in apples stock price gassées objections were overruled and he was forced from the company in  later that year apple introduced three lower cost models the macintosh classic macintosh lc and macintosh iisi all of which saw significant sales due to pent up demand in  apple introduced the powerbook replacing the luggable macintosh portable with a design that set the current shape for almost all modern laptops the same year apple introduced system  a major upgrade to the operating system which added color to the interface and introduced new networking capabilities it remained the architectural basis for the classic mac os the success of the powerbook and other products brought increasing revenue for some time apple was doing incredibly well introducing fresh new products and generating increasing profits in the process the magazine macaddict named the period between  and  as the first golden age of the macintosh apple believed the apple ii series was too expensive to produce and took away sales from the lowend macintosh in the s apple released the macintosh lc and began efforts to promote that computer by advising developer technical support staff to recommend developing applications for macintosh rather than apple ii and authorizing salespersons to direct consumers towards macintosh and away from apple ii the apple iie was discontinued in  – decline and restructuring see also timeline of the apple ii family the penlite was apples first attempt at a tablet computer created in  the project was designed to bring the mac os to a tablet – but was shelved in favor of the newton the success of apples lowercost consumer models especially the lc also led to cannibalization of their higher priced machines to address this management introduced several new brands selling largely identical machines at different price points aimed at different markets these were the highend quadra the midrange centris line and the illfated performa series this led to significant market confusion as customers did not understand the difference between models apple also experimented with a number of other unsuccessful consumer targeted products during the s including digital cameras portable cd audio players speakers video consoles the eworld online service and tv appliances enormous resources were also invested in the problemplagued newton division based on john sculleys unrealistic market forecastscitation needed ultimately none of these products helped and apples market share and stock prices continued to slidecitation needed throughout this period microsoft continued to gain market share with windows by focusing on delivering software to cheap commodity personal computers while apple was delivering a richly engineered but expensive experience apple relied on high profit margins and never developed a clear response instead they sued microsoft for using a gui similar to the apple lisa in apple computer inc v microsoft corp the lawsuit dragged on for years before it was finally dismissed at this time a series of major product flops and missed deadlines sullied apples reputation and sculley was replaced as ceo by michael spindler the newton was apples first foray into the pda markets as well as one of the first in the industry despite being a financial flop at the time of its release it helped pave the way for the palmpilot and apples own iphone and ipad in the future by the early s apple was developing alternative platforms to the macintosh such as aux the macintosh platform itself was becoming outdated because it was not built for multitasking and because several important software routines were programmed directly into the hardware in addition apple was facing competition from os and unix vendors such as sun microsystems the macintosh would need to be replaced by a new platform or reworked to run on more powerful hardware in  apple allied with ibm and motorola in the aim alliance with the goal of creating a new computing platform the powerpc reference platform which would use ibm and motorola hardware coupled with apple software the aim alliance hoped that preps performance and apples software would leave the pc far behind and thus counter microsoft the same year apple introduced the power macintosh the first of many apple computers to use motorolas powerpc processor in  spindler was replaced by gil amelio as ceo amelio made numerous changes at apple including extensive layoffs and cut costs after numerous failed attempts to improve mac os first with the taligent project and later with copland and gershwin amelio chose to purchase next and its nextstep operating system and bring steve jobs back to apple – return to profitability power mac was a line of apple macintosh workstationclass personal computers based on various models of powerpc microprocessors that were developed from  to  the next deal was finalized on february   bringing jobs back to apple as an advisor on july   amelio was ousted by the board of directors after overseeing a threeyear recordlow stock price and crippling financial losses jobs acted as the interim ceo and began restructuring the companys product line it was during this period that he identified the design talent of jonathan ive and the pair worked collaboratively to rebuild apples status at the  macworld expo jobs announced that apple would join microsoft to release new versions of microsoft office for the macintosh and that microsoft had made a  million investment in nonvoting apple stock on november   apple introduced the apple online store which was tied to a new buildtoorder manufacturing strategy on august   apple introduced a new allinone computer reminiscent of the macintosh k the imac the imac design team was led by ive who would later design the ipod and the iphone the imac featured modern technology and a unique design and sold almost  units in its first five months during this periodwhen apple completed numerous acquisitions to create a portfolio of digital production software for both professionals and consumers in  apple purchased macromedias key grip software project signaling an expansion into the digital video editing market the

locations it has been granted design patents and received architectural awards for its stores designs and construction specifically for its use of glass staircases and cubes the success of apple stores have had significant influence over other consumer electronics retailers who have lost traffic control and profits due to a perceived higher quality of service and products at apple stores apples notable brand loyalty among consumers causes long lines of hundreds of people at new apple store openings or product releases due to the popularity of the brand there are numerous job applications many of which from young workers although apple store employees receive aboveaverage pay are offered money toward education and health care and receive product discounts there are limited or no paths of career advancement a may  report with an anonymous retail employee highlighted a hostile work environment with harassment from customers intense internal criticism and a lack of significant bonuses for securing major business contracts apples new store design in union square san francisco new store design in new town plaza hong kong fifth avenue new york city london paris sydney ifc mall store in hong kong barcelona cologne corporate affairs see also list of mergers and acquisitions by apple braeburn capital and filemaker inc corporate culture apple was one of several highly successful companies founded in the s that bucked the traditional notions of corporate culture jobs often walked around the office barefoot even after apple became a fortune  company by the time of the  television commercial apples informal culture had become a key trait that differentiated it from its competitors according to a  report in fortune this has resulted in a corporate culture more akin to a startup rather than a multinational corporation as the company has grown and been led by a series of differently opinionated chief executives it has arguably lost some of its original character nonetheless it has maintained a reputation for fostering individuality and excellence that reliably attracts talented workers particularly after jobs returned to the company numerous apple employees have stated that projects without jobss involvement often took longer than projects with it to recognize the best of its employees apple created the apple fellows program which awards individuals who make extraordinary technical or leadership contributions to personal computing while at the company the apple fellowship has so far been awarded to individuals including bill atkinson steve capps rod holt alan kay guy kawasaki al alcorn don norman rich page and steve wozniak steve wozniak and andy hertzfeld in  at apple employees are specialists who are not exposed to functions outside their area of expertise jobs saw this as a means of having bestinclass employees in every role for instance ron johnson—senior vice president of retail operations until november  —was responsible for site selection instore service and store layout yet had no control of the inventory in his stores this was done by cook who had a background in supplychain management apple is also known for strictly enforcing accountability each project has a directly responsible individual or dri in apple jargon as an example when ios senior vice president scott forstall refused to sign apples official apology for numerous errors in the redesigned maps app he was forced to resign unlike other major us companies apple provides a relatively simple compensation policy for executives that does not include perks enjoyed by other ceos like country club fees or private use of company aircraft the company typically grants stock options to executives every other year in  apple had  fulltime employees this increased to  fulltime employees the next year a notable hiring decrease largely due to its first revenue decline apple does not specify how many of its employees work in retail though its  sec filing put the number at approximately half of its employee base an editorial article in the verge in september  by technology journalist thomas ricker explored some of the publics perceived lack of innovation at apple in recent years specifically stating that samsung has matched and even surpassed apple in terms of smartphone industrial design and citing the belief that apple is incapable of producing another breakthrough moment in technology with its products he goes on to write that the criticism focuses on individual pieces of hardware rather than the ecosystem as a whole stating yes iteration is boring but its also how apple does business  it enters a new market and then refines and refines and continues refining until it yields a success he acknowledges that people are wishing for the excitement of revolution but argues that people want the comfort that comes with harmony furthermore he writes that a device is only the starting point of an experience that will ultimately be ruled by the ecosystem in which it was spawned referring to how decent hardware products can still fail without a proper ecosystem specifically mentioning that walkman didnt have an ecosystem to keep users from leaving once something better came along but how apple devices in different hardware segments are able to communicate and cooperate through the icloud cloud service with features including universal clipboard in which text copied on one device can be pasted on a different device as well as interconnected device functionality including auto unlock in which an apple watch can unlock a mac in close proximity he argues that apples ecosystem is its greatest innovation apple has a strong culture of corporate secrecy and has an antileak global security team that recruits from the national security agency the federal bureau of investigation and the united states secret service manufacturing the companys manufacturing procurement and logistics enable it to execute massive product launches without having to maintain large profitsapping inventories in  apples profit margins were  percent compared with between  and  percent for most other hardware companies cooks catchphrase to describe his focus on the companys operational arm is nobody wants to buy sour milk during the macs early history apple generally refused to adopt prevailing industry standards for hardware instead creating their own this trend was largely reversed in the late s beginning with apples adoption of the pci bus in the  power macs apple has since joined the industry standards groups to influence the future direction of technology standards such as usb agp hypertransport wifi nvme pcie and others in its products firewire is an appleoriginated standard that was widely adopted across the industry after it was standardized as ieee  and is a legally mandated port in all cable tv boxes in the united states apple has gradually expanded its efforts in getting its products into the indian market in july  during a conference call with investors ceo tim cook said that he loves india but that apple saw larger opportunities outside the region indias requirement that  of products sold be manufactured in the country was described as really adds cost to getting product to market in october  indian apple executives unveiled a plan for selling devices through instalment plans and storewithinastore concepts in an effort to expand further into the market the news followed cooks acknowledgment of the country in july when sales results showed that iphone sales in india grew  during the second quarter of  in march  the times of india reported that apple had sought permission from the indian government to sell refurbished iphones in the country however two months later the application was rejected citing official country policy in may  apple opened an ios app development center in bangalore in february  apple once again requested permission to sell used iphones in the country the same month bloomberg reported that apple was close to receiving permission to open its first retail store in the country in march the wall street journal reported that apple would begin manufacturing iphone models in india over the next two months and in may the journal wrote that an apple manufacturer had begun production of iphone se in the country while apple told cnbc that the manufacturing was for a small number of units labor practices further information criticism of apple inc § labor practices the company advertised its products as being made in america until the late s however as a result of outsourcing initiatives in the s almost all of its manufacturing is now handled abroad according to a report by the new york times apple insiders believe the vast scale of overseas factories as well as the flexibility diligence and industrial skills of foreign workers have so outpaced their american counterparts that made in the usa is no longer a viable option for most apple products in  the mail on sunday reported on the working conditions of the chinese factories where contract manufacturers foxconn and inventec produced the ipod the article stated that one complex of factories that assembled the ipod and other items had over  workers living and working within it employees regularly worked more than  hours per week and made around  per month a little over half of the workers earnings was required to pay for rent and food from the company apple immediately launched an investigation after the  media report and worked with their manufacturers to ensure acceptable working conditions in  apple started yearly audits of all its suppliers regarding workers rights slowly raising standards and pruning suppliers that did not comply yearly progress reports have been published since  in  apple admitted that its suppliers child labor practices in china had worsened the foxconn suicides occurred between january and november  when  foxconn chinese  employees attempted suicide resulting in  deaths—the company was the worlds largest contract electronics manufacturer for clients including apple at the time the suicides drew media attention and employment practices at foxconn were investigated by apple apple issued a public statement about the suicides and company spokesperson steven dowling said apple is saddened and upset by the recent suicides at foxconn  a team from apple is independently evaluating the steps they are taking to address these tragic events and we will continue our ongoing inspections of the facilities where our products are made the statement was released after the results from the companys probe into its suppliers labor practices were published in early  foxconn was not specifically named in the report but apple identified a series of serious labor violations of labor laws including apples own rules and some child labor existed in a number of factories apple committed to the implementation of changes following the suicides also in  workers in china planned to sue iphone contractors over poisoning by a cleaner used to clean lcd screens one worker claimed that he and his coworkers had not been informed of possible occupational illnesses after a high suicide rate in a foxconn facility in china making ipads and iphones albeit a lower rate than that of china as a whole workers were forced to sign a legally binding document guaranteeing that they would not kill themselves workers in factories producing apple products have also been exposed to nhexane a neurotoxin that is a cheaper alternative than alcohol for cleaning the products a  bbc investigation found excessive hours and other problems persisted despite apples promise to reform factory practice after the  foxconn suicides the pegatron factory was once again the subject of review as reporters gained access to the working conditions inside through recruitment as employees while the bbc maintained that the experiences of its reporters showed that labor violations were continuing since  apple publicly disagreed with the bbc and stated we are aware of no other company doing as much as apple to ensure fair and safe working conditions in december  the institute for global labour and human rights published a report which documented inhumane conditions for the  workers at a zhen ding technology factory in shenzhen china which serves as a major supplier of circuit boards for apples iphone and ipad according to the report workers are pressured into hour work weeks which leaves them so exhausted that they often sleep during lunch breaks they are also made to reside in primitive dark and filthy dorms where they sleep on plywood with six to ten workers in each crowded room omnipresent security personnel also routinely harass and beat the workers environmental practices and initiatives energy and resources following a greenpeace protest apple released a statement on april   committing to ending its use of

renewable energy and  of apples global operations run on renewable energy however the facilities are connected to the local grid which usually contains a mix of fossil and renewable sources so apple

apple has created subsidiaries in lowtax places such as ireland the netherlands luxembourg and the british virgin islands to cut the taxes it pays around the world according to the new york times in the s apple was among the first tech companies to designate overseas salespeople in hightax countries in a manner that allowed the company to sell on behalf of lowtax subsidiaries on other continents sidestepping income taxes in the late s apple was a pioneer of an accounting technique known as the double irish with a dutch sandwich which reduces taxes by routing profits through irish subsidiaries and the netherlands and then to the caribbean british conservative party member of parliament charlie elphicke published research on october   which showed that some multinational companies including apple inc were making billions of pounds of profit in the uk but were paying an effective tax rate to the uk treasury of only  percent well below standard corporation tax he followed this research by calling on the chancellor of the exchequer george osborne to force these multinationals which also included google and the cocacola company to state the effective rate of tax they pay on their uk revenues elphicke also said that government contracts should be withheld from multinationals who do not pay their fair share of uk tax it is a matter of public record that apple inc is the single largest taxpayer to the department of the treasury of the united states of america with an effective tax rate of approximately of  as of the second quarter of the apple fiscal year  in  reuters reported that apple had earnings abroad of  billion which were untaxed by the irs of the united states under us tax law governed by the irc corporations dont pay income tax on overseas profits unless the profits are repatriated into the united states and as such apple argues that to benefit its shareholders it will leave it overseas until a repatriation holiday or comprehensive tax reform takes place in the united states on august   after a threeyear investigation by the eus competition commissioner that concluded that apple received illegal state aid from ireland the eu ordered apple to pay  billion euros  billion plus interest in unpaid taxes specifically the commissioner found that apple had benefitted from irish department of revenue tax rulings that allowed it to split the profits recorded by apple sales international internally between its irish branch and a stateless head office entity lacking employees or premises permitted under irish law until  the chancellor of austria christian kern put this decision into perspective by stating that every viennese cafe every sausage stand pays more tax in austria than a multinational corporation ownership apple inc is a jointstock

new products everything you need to know a special edition iphone an aggressively priced ipad a new app and more heres what you missed daniel sparks tmfdanielsparks mar   at pm as you might have heard apple nasdaqaapl just dropped some new products the company opting to announce the updates in a series of press releases on tuesday unveiled new versions of its iphone and ipad as well as a new app heres a quick overview of the products and what they mean for apples business special edition productred iphone  while the most drastic update in terms of exterior appearance apples new special addition productred iphone  is essentially the same as the existing iphone  except for its color and the exclusion of the base  gb storage tier like the jet black version of the iphone  the new red iphone is only available in  gb and  gb storage options productred special edition iphone  image source apple as it does with all productred devices it has released over the  years its participated in this initiative apple is contributing a portion of proceeds from sales of its special edition iphone to the global fund which is aimed at bringing the world a step closer to an aidsfree generation according to the company  even after the donation to the global fund this could serve as a slight catalyst for iphone sales in the past the introduction of new iphone colors has helped demand for the devices released about six months after the iphone s launch a new color could reinvigorate some consumer interest in the device but since its virtually the same phone as the iphone  investors shouldnt expect any incremental sales to be very meaningful in another update to the iphone lineup apple also doubled the storage options for its lowercost iphone se from  gb and  gb to  gb to  gb an aggressively priced ipad apple also introduced a cheaper inch ipad replacing its ipad air  the new tablet  simply called ipad  is equipped with an improved a processor the ipad air  sported apples ax chip a brighter retina display and a higher storage capacity for the base version  gb versus  gb for the ipad air  but whats perhaps most surprising is the new ipads aggressive pricing the entrylevel version of the tablet starts at  down from a  for the ipad air  combining its improved specs and its lower price the new ipad offers significantly more value than the previous ipad air  and it has the potential to help give ipad sales a boost apple clips app image source apple clips an expressive photo and video app in a surprise move apple also announced an entirely new app called clips the video app helps users quickly make expressive videos on iphone and ipad the app is designed to create media well suited for social apps like facebook instagram and snapchat in addition to these updates it also launched some new accessories including new apple watch band designs and new silicone and leather iphone  case colors overall none of apples updates were enough to substantially move the needle but they should at least help the company create some incremental interest as the tech giant readies more extensive product updates in the future daniel sparks owns shares of apple the motley fool

search  apple inc product launches to look forward to in  this fool is excited about these two apple products  and the potential they have to boost apples financial results and ecosystem ashraf eassa tmfchipfool jun   at am the first half of  has been quite a busy one for apple nasdaqaapl in terms of new product launches the company has updated several of its mac personal computers released new inch and inch ipad pro models with a host of interesting new features and previewed a lot of the software goodness thats coming to apples major platforms as exciting as the first half of  has been for the mac maker i think the second half of this year should be even more exciting image source apple new iphones this year promises to be one of the biggest years for apples iphone yet the company is reportedly planning to release a highendpremium iphone commonly referred to as the iphone  which sounds like it should be quite the showstopper this new iphone is expected to come with an allnew fullface oled display which should dramatically increase image quality and deliver a substantially better user experience its also expected to come with d sensing capabilities that some believe will be critical to enabling new augmentedreality use cases of course im sure that apple will update much if not all of the internals to deliver higher performance and better device efficiency the iphone  just sounds like its going to be a cool product that has the very real potential to spark an iphone super cycle and boost the iphones average selling prices additionally apple is expected to launch two standard iphone models commonly referred to as the iphone ss plus because theyre said to be relatively straightforward upgrades to the current iphone  and iphone  plus smartphones these admittedly arent anywhere near as exciting as the new iphone  promises to be but they should bring solid new features with more affordable price points compared to what the iphone  is likely to cost and thats always a good thing the imac pro apple announced its new imac pro personal computers at wwdc but they wont be available for sale until the end of the year although the wait may certainly be frustrating for prousers looking to stick with apple the company does seem to have a compelling product with the imac pro the new imac pro systems should include extremely fast highcore count processors a powerful graphics processor a great display and other goodies for content creators developers and other potential users for whom time is equal to money having access to extremely powerful macospowered devices should be rather nice once apple begins selling these systems which i suspect will do far better in the marketplace than the mac pro has id expect a noticeable boost in the macs average selling prices  and therefore revenue all else being equal of course the imac pro isnt going to be a financially significant boost for apple though boosts to any of apples businesses should be welcomed by stockholders but itll certainly help entice pro users to stick with or perhaps even migrate to apples mac platform  a longterm positive for the platform and ultimately for apple ashraf

cloud by daplie is like using your garage instead you pay for it once and no one owns it but you you don’t own your media you pay to rent media you already own you pay more for space that’s never enough you forfeit privacy your data is sold to advertisers a new hope with cloud by daplie your media can be securely uploaded from all your devices and drives automatically you access it by typing

time we use technology we become digital creators whether it’s snapping a photo visiting a site or simply using your gps we create and store information and content those creations should belong to us in some ways our devices are like our digital residences many consumers don’t even realize that they are giving up ownership of their data when they agree to use most internet services or they dont feel they have a choice if they want the convenience of the cloud rather than give a company the right to use our content however and whenever the company wants indefinitely daplie aims to empower the individual to take control of how they use and interact with the internet with a personal server and the daplie framework we dont have to sacrifice privacy control and security for convenience what is cloud by daplie cloud is a personal server that allows you to stream share and backup your digital stuff from anywhere without restrictions that means you can stream your music without having to pay or listen to ads you can download and share large files or sensitive information without signing ownership rights over to a rd party cloud service and even host your own website email and social network securely this product offers owners a technology that enables them to have full ownership over their digital life through a localized and selfcontained server this server has a distributed user and device authentication system it also features a scalable application and services architecture data storage is easily extended by adding storage that ergonomically stacks on top of the device external usb hard drives can be connected as well the product offers secure and direct connection to devices in the home the ability to securely sync and backup files from multiple devices and access the system across public connections cloud by daplie allows users to backup their entire cloud on the device of another daplie owner who they know and trust or on another unit in a different location the general idea of cloud is similar to a tablet with apps that store your data and is also accessible from any device thats connected to the internet what problems is daplie trying to solve nobody likes lots of monthly charges running out of space on their phone or forfeiting the rights to their personal data like many companies daplie was created by a team of driven individuals looking to solve a real problem experienced by everyday people as avid users of technology both in our varied work experiences as well as in our day to day lives taking pictures and recording videos we have all had issues with lack of space on our digital devices or had trouble accessing and sharing our own data in some way ownership of our digital lives has fallen by the wayside and replaced with convenience and in result more vulnerability as the internet of things and smart devices such as cameras or locks start entering our homes we will need a way to keep our most personal information and ourselves secure with the daplie cloud infrastructure we can keep our families and data secure without sacrificing convenience who are your customers and what does your market look like our customer is any person who creates digital content and wants a place to easily access store and share that digital content from anywhere they have internet and across any device we are talking about regular

passionate about personal responsibility earned value traditional values and loyalty making sure the things he owns creates and is responsible for in the analog or digital worlds are of utmost importance to him daplie would allow steve to easily secure his data in a physical proximate place he could access it anywhere without compromise to security and share it safely with those he trusts and pay for it once with the ability to add additional storage in the future if neededbobby spends much of his time in a tax platform and in excel spreadsheets he backs up his clients’ important information by printing the documents exporting them to an external hard drive or simply storing them on his local os hard drive daplie would allow bobby to securely transfer and store his clients financial documents without any fear of them being accessed by external parties the large and secure storage would also allow him to keep financial documents for a long time without running out of space in the event of audits or a client wanting access to an old document he would also take advantage of the ability to access the documents from anywhere on any device and could share accordingly who’s your competition and how are you different generally speaking any company that is currently storing personal digital content could be considered a competitor this includes data that is stored both on public cloud servers and also data stored on personal storage devices at home there are many places that people currently host their digital life social media public clouds personal computing and storage devices could generally be considered competitors with most storage services customers are not knowledgeable about where their content is being held who has responsibility for it or who can have access to it cloud by daplie is a personal server where people can host and share their personal data there are currently a number of companies that offer a network attached storage devices only a very select few of these companies allow users to configure a userchosen domain name to the device or to expand storage at a fixed cost this process is often cumbersome and requires considerable expertise to set up companies that offer services like this include synology qnap  drobo these devices are considered networkdetached storage with technical expertise they can be configured as personal servers unlike these competitors daplie’s configuration is automated and easy to use no technical expertise is required setup syncing and file access are simple enough for the least tech savvy customers to manage there are a few direct competitors operating within our space lima has a product that allows users to proxy a single hard drive to any and all devices you own it is similar to daplie because it enables you to own your own storage and access it from all your devices however it is different from daplie because lima is not a personal server and lima still owns the entire infrastructure that connects your storage to your devices simply explained all of your data passes through lima’s data center server when it travels between your storage device and your computing device lima is still the middleman daplie customers have their own server their own domain and they have complete control of their content between their storage and their devices daplie is not a middleman cloud by daplie is a standalone product that does not require your data to pass through daplie’s data center sherly is another direct competitor they offer an integrated personal server that is designed for interorganization collaboration the functionality is designed for teams to data share such as employees who telecommute their focus is on storage not on apps sherly’s offering is similar to daplie’s offering because both allow remote shared storage that is accessed through a personal server however unlike sherly daplie does not charge annual per user license fees in addition to the hardware daplie only sells the hardware and the domain daplie is much more attractive from a pricing perspective protonet also offers a private cloud server that hosts social project management and collaboration software like sherly it is also designed mostly for business use protonet is similar to daplie because they also charge a onetime hardware purchase fee instead of license fees like sherly protonet is different from daplie because currently their hardware costs thousands of dollars again daplie is much more attractive financially although there are many types of indirect competitors the market is enormous there is no one that is doing exactly what daplie does with daplie’s focus on offering something that is designed for the users by the users we intend to gain market share and grow much faster than any of our direct competitors can i buy a cloud server right now yes preorders are open for all those who would like to buy cloud by daplie click here to preorder if i invest xxxxx can i get a lower stock price short answer no the deal terms of this offering have been submitted to and are on file with the sec to change them now would not only be unfair to current investors at this valuation but would entail amending our securities filings and reinitiating all investments made prior to that point this would not be in the best interest of the company or the current investorsfor those investing a larger amount there are more valuable perks available which should be taken into account have you done any live updates since the campaign started yes
