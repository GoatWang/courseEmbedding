nongaap financial measures  adjusted gross margin below nongaap financial measure  adjusted gross margin adjusted gross margin is defined as total revenue less cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization expense adjusted gross margin is included as a supplemental disclosure because it is a primary measure used by management as it represents the results of revenue and cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization expense which are key operating components depreciation expense is a necessary element of costs and the ability to generate revenue and selling general and administrative expense is a necessary cost to support operations and required corporate activities management uses this nongaap measure as a supplemental measure to other gaap results to provide a more complete understanding of the companys performance as an indicator of operating performance adjusted gross margin should not be considered an alternative to or more meaningful than operating income as determined in accordance with gaap adjusted gross margin may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure of another company because other entities may not calculate adjusted gross margin in the same manner the reconciliation of operating income to adjusted gross margin is as follows   three months ended march      in thousands         operating income           depreciation and amortization         selling general and administration expenses         adjusted gross margin           non gaap financial measures  adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda reflects net income or loss before interest taxes depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda is a measure used by analysts and investors as an indicator of operating cash flow since it excludes the impact of movements in working capital items noncash charges and financing costs therefore adjusted ebitda gives the investor information as to the cash generated from the operations of a business however adjusted ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles gaap and should not be considered a substitute for other financial measures of performance adjusted ebitda as calculated by ngs may not be comparable to adjusted ebitda as calculated and reported by other companies the most comparable gaap measure to adjusted ebitda is net income the reconciliation of net income to adjusted ebitda and

accordance with gaap please read nongaap financial measures  adjusted gross margin below nongaap financial measure  adjusted gross margin adjusted gross margin is defined as total revenue less cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization expense adjusted gross margin is included as a supplemental disclosure because it is a primary measure used by management as it represents the results of revenue and cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization expense which are key operating components depreciation expense is a necessary element of costs and the ability to generate revenue and selling general and administrative expense is a necessary cost to support operations and required corporate activities management uses this nongaap measure as a supplemental measure to other gaap results to provide a more complete understanding of the companys performance as an indicator of operating performance adjusted gross margin should not be considered an alternative to or more meaningful than operating income as determined in accordance with gaap adjusted gross margin may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure of another company because other entities may not calculate adjusted gross margin in the same manner the reconciliation of operating income to adjusted gross margin is as follows   three months ended march      in thousands         operating income

net income or loss before interest taxes depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda is a measure used by analysts and investors as an indicator of operating cash flow since it excludes the impact of movements in working capital items noncash charges and financing costs therefore adjusted ebitda gives the investor information as to the cash generated from the operations of a business however adjusted ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles gaap and should not be considered a substitute for other financial measures of performance adjusted ebitda as calculated by ngs may not be comparable to adjusted ebitda as calculated and reported by other companies the most comparable gaap measure to adjusted ebitda is net income the reconciliation of net

before an earnings release it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago the crux of this approach is comparing the most accurate estimate to the zacks consensus estimate although the zacks rank is also an important feature of the esp metric combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report and hopefully surge higher in price too in fact when combining a zacks rank  or better and a positive earnings esp stocks produced a
