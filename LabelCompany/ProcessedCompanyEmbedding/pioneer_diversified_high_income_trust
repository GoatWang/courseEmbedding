 seeking alphasign in  join nowgo»the pioneer diversified high income fund deserves its premiumnov  about pioneer diversified hnw michael fabian registered investment advisor etf investing closedend funds dividend investingfmd capital managementive always been intrigued by brands that command a consistent premium in the market they compete in just as apple nasdaqaapl products demand a premium over the likes of samsungs otcssngy despite equal or greater performance and features its difficult to quantify at first glance but when the fine detail and intricacies are examined it becomes obvious a premium product was designed to stand out amongst a sea of mediocrity pioneer investments is a firm thats been around nearly a century and currently manages roughly  billion in assets based in the us although it is owned by the much larger pioneer global asset management based in italy to put that sum in perspective their aum is nearly identical to what doubleline capital has raised since its launch in april of  while both firms pale in comparison to the asset gathering might of pimco with several trillion under management to my point pioneer is likely a firm many investors have passed over for more prominently marketed counterparts however this is one contributing factor to my interest in the firm its boutique approach to investment selection and risk management so how have pioneer closedend funds cefs been able to maintain consistent premiums undeterred by the difficult fixedincome environment in  the answer is obviously in the details and for the purposes of this analysis id like to focus on the pioneer diversified high income fund nysemkthnw the fund is designed to seek a high level of income through the investment in fixed income securities in various sectors of the high yield market more specifically the fund specializes in global credit with the majority of its portfolio allocated to us high yield senior loans eventlinked securities and emerging markets with the exception of the catastrophe bond sleeve the stated portfolio mix is not uncommon in the cef market place the primary reason the portfolio has performed so well in light of interest rate volatility is the floating rate exposure through senior loans and eventlinked securities which make up roughly  of the holdings for those that are not familiar with catastrophe bonds or cat bonds they are sold by insurance companies seeking alternative means of reinsurance and risktransfer through capital market investment the coupon rate traditionally floats in relation to an index similar to senior loans while the principal value is attached to natural disasters or other insurance claims for example if a natural disaster does occur there are triggers that lead to principle forgiveness or writedowns by investors conversely if no loss claims occur investors stand to collect attractive cash flow as eventlinked bonds are typically rated below investment grade cat bonds have posted great returns over the last several years as hurricanetropical storm related damage throughout the us has been relatively low by historical standards hnws management has exhibited superior expertise in security selection in this relatively unknown alternative asset class adding additional value to retail investors searching for diversification outside traditional fixedincome strategies in sum the funds concentration of floating rate issues and unique diversification amongst high yield issuers globally has contributed to excellent nav returns despite  interest rate volatility in fact the effective duration of its  holdings currently rests at just  years furthermore the fund currently yields  on its market price but more importantly it has built up a unii surplus of  as of its most recent annual report with data compiled through april an updated semiannual report is due out shortly with data through october st overall the fund has an excellent history of meeting or exceeding its dividend distribution contributing to investor confidence in hnw as a core position and potentially reducing retail turnover in addition it has been able to do so with a leverage ratio of  a percentage that is inline with comparable funds with less than stellar nav performance investors should take caution with several factors currently surrounding hnw first being the funds relatively small size and second being the current premium exceeding its trailing twelve month average for clients in our dynamic cef income portfolio we exited the position in mid october when it became temporarily stretched above its  week average with the intent on buying it back during the next correction fridays cef volatility afforded us that opportunity as we were able to purchase the position back below the key average i believe that absent a large amount of volatility in the credit markets hnw will continue to trade at a healthy premium to nav due to its unique qualities i believe the fund strikes an excellent balance of traditional asset management and expertise in a relatively small area of the fixed income markets investors would have a difficult time accessing otherwise as with many other unique strategies we currently utilize for our clients we dont have a problem paying a premium price for a premium product however monitoring the funds health on an ongoing basis will contribute to our investment process alongside its size and place within our portfolio disclosure i am long hnw i wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions i am not receiving
