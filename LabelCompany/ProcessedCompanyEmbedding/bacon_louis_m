toward  percent clean energy while this is certainly encouraging we must face a harsh reality essential getting off fossil fuels won’t be enough every scientific model i have seen proposing pathways to limit temperature increases to  degrees celsius includes both a rapid reduction in carbon emissions and a dramatic increase in the amount of carbon dioxide being removed from the atmosphere standing natural forests are the only proven system that can operate at the scale necessary to remove enough carbon from the atmosphere within the timeframe necessary to avoid climate catastrophe

change is warming the ocean making it increasingly acidic overfishing is putting species dangerously at risk and ecosystems are being pushed beyond their limit despite covering  per cent of the earth’s surface only three per cent of the ocean is currently under some form of protection and much of the remaining  per cent suffers from poor management there is also so much we still don’t know –

executive officer of moore capital management and founder and chairman of the moore charitable foundation category ocean preservation sharks how much is a shark worth that might sound like a strange question to conservationists biologists or people who love the ocean it might be impossible to quantify the value of such a magnificent creature for fishers around the world the answer is probably more straightforward but one thing is now clear sharks are worth much more alive than dead in the state of florida a new independent report commissioned by oceana found that live sharks provide significant economic benefits to the state of florida divers and tourists travel from around the world to see sharks in person supporting a tourism industry that depends on healthy animals given the global threats to survival of sharks and the key roles they play both in nature and in some coastal economies the report commissioned by oceana and research by others highlights the need for congress

on the front porch for north carolinians who live near industrial hog operations however these rites of spring are distant memories the coastal plain of north carolina is littered with industrial hog facilities—concentrated animal feeding operations cafos in the legal terminology the state is second to only iowa in annual pork production thousands of cafos are concentrated in eastern north carolina with the greatest densities in duplin and sampson counties each of these facilities hosts hundreds or even thousands of hogs which are typically brought in to the facility as piglets and kept on site until they reach slaughter weight after the hogs are taken away their waste is left behind it’s that waste that haunts nearby communities which are disproportionately lowincome communities of

forests burn it’s good for wildlife and local communities by jay jensen southern region director national fish and wildlife foundation category north carolina southern forests were once covered by the longleaf pine — over  million acres of it longleaf was the dominant forest type for the coastal plain and hundreds of plants and animals evolved and thrived within the open parklike stands that characterize longleaf pine habitat by the midth century that acreage was down to just  million acres partially due to a lack of regular fire which is critical to maintaining the habitat conditions favored by plants and wildlife unique to this ecosystem but recently thanks to hardfought collaborative conservation efforts the longleaf range has begun to expand again reaching nearly five million acres unfortunately the decline in the acreage and the quality of longleaf forests has translated into a similar decline for the plants and animals that depend on healthy longleaf habitat sending many of these species to the emergency triage room that is the endangered species act but there is a plan to reverse this troubling trend fire in north carolina getting more fire in the longleaf pine

miles of snowcapped mountain peaks and a spectacular array of natural elements that are so vital to our lives water trees wildlife sun and wind unfortunately as the ski industry grew over the last few decades conservationists began pointing out the harm the industry was causing to its surroundings from an overreliance on fossil fuels to employment practices that weren’t always fair to workers and

mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed
