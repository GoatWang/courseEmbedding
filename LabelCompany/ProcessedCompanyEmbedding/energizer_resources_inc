as of the date hereof we undertake no obligation to update these forwardlooking statements background  company overview we are incorporated in the state of minnesota usa and have a fiscal year end of june  our principal business is the acquisition exploration and development of mineral resources we have not generated operating revenues or paid dividends since inception on march   to the period ended december   and we are unlikely to do so in the immediate future our business activities have been entirely financed from the proceeds of securities subscriptions during fiscal  we incorporated energizer resources mauritius ltd ermau a mauritius subsidiary and energizer resources madagascar sarl ermad a madagascar subsidiary of ermau during fiscal  the company incorporated thb ventures ltd thb a mauritius subsidiary of ermau and energizer resources minerals sarl ermin a madagascar subsidiary of thb which holds the  ownership interest of the green giant property in madagascar see note  during fiscal  the company incorporated madagascar�erg joint venture mauritius ltd ergjvm a mauritius subsidiary of ermau and erg madagascar sarl ergmad a madagascar subsidiary of ergjvm which holds the malagasy joint venture ground during fiscal  the company incorporated  ontario inc an ontario canada subsidiary our authorized capital is six hundred fifty million  shares with a par value of  per share of which  are deemed common shares and the remaining  are deemed eligible to be divisible into classes series and types with rights and preferences as designated by our board of directors we have not had any bankruptcy receivership or similar proceeding since incorporation except as described below there have been no material reclassifications mergers consolidations or purchases or sales of any significant amount of assets not in the ordinary course of business since the date of incorporation cautionary note based on the nature of our business we anticipate incurring operating losses for the foreseeable future we base this expectation in part on the fact that very few mineral properties in the exploration stage are ultimately developed into producing and profitable mines our future financial results are uncertain due to a number of factors some of which are outside the companys control these factors include but are not limited to  our ability to raise additional funding  the market price for graphite vanadium gold andor uranium  the results of the exploration programs and metallurgical analysis of our mineral properties  the political instability andor environmental regulations that may adversely impact costs and ability to operate in madagascar and  our ability to find joint venture andor offtake partners in order to advance the development of our mineral properties any future equity financing will cause existing shareholders to experience dilution of their ownership interest in the company in the event the company is not successful in raising additional financing we anticipate the company will not be able to proceed with its business plan in such a case the company may decide to discontinue or modify its current business plan and seek other business opportunities in the resource sector during this period the company will need to maintain periodic filings with the appropriate regulatory authorities and will incur legal accounting administrative and listing costs in the event no other such opportunities are available and the company cannot raise additional capital to sustain operations the company may be forced to discontinue the business the company does not have any specific alternative business opportunities under consideration and have not planned for any such contingency due to the lack of operating history and present inability to generate revenues the company auditors have stated their opinion in the notes to our audited financial statements in the annual report on form k and the company has included in note  of this quarterly report that there currently exists doubt as to the companys ability to continue as a going concern summary of our business we are an exploration stage company primarily engaged in the advancement of the molo graphite project consisting of a commercially minable graphite deposit situated in the african country of madagascar we have additional exploration stage properties situated in madagascar and in the province of quebec canada our executive offices are situated at  adelaide street west toronto ontario canada mh l and the primary telephone number is   our website is

technical report on the green giant property in madagascar can be found on the companys website at wwwenergizerresourcescom which website is expressly not incorporated by reference into this filing or in the companys canadian regulatory filings at wwwsedarcom which website and content is expressly not incorporated by reference into this filing we report mineral reserve estimates in accordance with the securities and exchange commissions industry guide  guide  under the securities act of  as amended the us securities act as a reporting issuer in canada with our primary trading market in canada we are also required to prepare reports on our mineral properties in accordance with ni  the technical reports referenced in this document uses the terms mineral resource measured mineral resource indicated mineral resource and inferred mineral resource these terms are defined in and required to be disclosed by ni  however these terms are not defined terms under guide  and are normally not permitted to be used in reports filed with the securities and exchange commission as a result information in respect of our resources determined in accordance with ni  are not contained in this document summary of milestones and future plans we are pursuing negotiations in respect of potential offtake agreements with graphite endusers and intermediaries with the intention of securing project financing alternatives which may include debt equity and derivative instruments discussions in respect of these matters have been ongoing for the past  months and are expected to continue during the coming months with no assurances as to the conclusion or results of these discussions in july  we appointed ukbased hcf international advisers limited hcf as advisor in negotiating and structuring strategic partnerships off take agreements and debt financing for its molo graphite project in august  we initiated a front end engineering design study the feed study and value engineering for our molo graphite project in madagascar the feed study was undertaken in order to optimize the mine plan as envisioned in the molo feasibility study and determine the optimal development path based on discussions with prospective strategic partners all costing aspects were examined with the goal of providing a method to produce meaningful multitonne test samples of molo graphite concentrate to potential offtakers while reducing the capex and time required to the commencement of commercial production on november   we outlined a multiphase development plan for the molo graphite project based on the feed study and value engineering the results support the construction of a costeffective demonstration plant to test and verify the flow sheet design from the molo graphite project feasibility study under an exploration permit the company will initially be limited to an ore input of  cubic meters or approximately  tonnes of frontend feed into the demonstration plant the company has already initiated the application process for a mining permit which upon approval would remove the  cubic meter test limit at full capacity the demonstration plant would be capable of processing up to  tonnes of feed per annum which equates to  tonnes per hour of ore feed and roughly  to  tonnes of flake graphite concentrate production per hour phase  energizer has advance discussions with several potential offtakers to the stage where they have requested multitonne samples of molo concentrate for fullscale endproduct production runs prior to entering into any definitive offtake contracts phase  will consist of the construction of a demonstration processing plant capable of producing flake graphite concentrate on a test basis the demonstration plant is designed to be a proof of concept operation with the goal of optimizing the process circuit while allowing the company to supply a true runofmine flake concentrate to potential offtakers and customers for final product validation base essentialonly infrastructure will be constructed during this phase the plant will utilize drystack tailings in order to eliminate the upfront capital costs associated with a tailings dam energizers existing camp adjacent to the nearby town of fotadrevo will be used to accommodate employees and offices with additional housing available within the town for additional employees it is estimated that once financed the phase i processing plant will require a total of  months to complete this buildout will include detailed engineering equipment procurement offsite fabrication and assembly of plant modules factory assurance testing fat module disassembly and shipping plant infrastructure construction and onsite module assembly total costs are estimated at approximately us  for the processing plant and  for related infrastructure phase  once the process circuit has been proven and optimized in phase  phase  will be initiated which includes the development of sustaining infrastructure required for longterm processing and the ramp up of the demonstration plant production to its full capacity of  tonnes per annum or  tonnes per hour of ore this phase will likely include the construction of additional onsite accommodation and offices upgrading of road infrastructure to access the minesite and equipment purchases to provide redundancy within the processing circuit the costs for these expenditures are unknown at this time but will be assessed in parallel with the development of phase  energizer will also assess the addition of backend valueadded processing for lithiumion battery and graphite foil applications in the classification portion of the demonstration plant the costs for these expenditures are unknown at this time but will be assessed in parallel with the development of phase  assuming the demonstration plant operates at full capacity it is estimated it could produce up to  tonnes of graphite at the estimated operating costs outlined in the table below feed study operating cost summary ore ust concentrate ust mining     processing     general  administrative     trucking to port   shipping cif rotterdam   total costs   phase  upon the successful completion of phases  and  we anticipate the initiation of phase  of the development of the molo project this will involve additional construction of mine infrastructure and plant construction into a fully operational largescale mine as envisioned in the molo feasibility study this would include construction of a tailings dam facility and upgrading of the regional road system used to transport graphite concentrate to the port the results of the feed study is part of managements ongoing assessment of project optimization strategies with the intention of reducing the capital and operating costs relating to the molo graphite project with no assurances as to the conclusion and results of these assessments and efforts during phase  this will include the assessment of the possibility of utilizing a modular build methodology for the fullscale molo mine we anticipate that any modules used in phase  and  will be integrated where possible into the phase  plant buildout if these efforts are successful we expect it will be possible to achieve capex and opex cost savings for fullscale production relative to those envisioned in the molo feasibility study from the date of this report and subject to availability of capital our plan during the next  months is to incur between  and  on further engineering exploration testing phase  construction and permitting to advance the molo graphite project subject to the availability of capital and any other unforeseen delays by december   no assurances can be provided that we will achieve our objectives by that date the following is a summary of the amounts budgeted to be incurred presuming all  is required feed study and value engineering   metallurgy   phase  processing plant   phase  related infrastructure   permitting fees   total   the above amounts may be updated based on actual costs and the timing may be delayed based on several factors including the availability of capital to fund the budget we anticipate that the source of funds required to complete the budgeted items disclosed above will come from private placements in the capital markets but there can be no assurance that financing will be available on terms favorable to the company or at all results of operations the following are explanations of the material changes for the six and three month periods ended december   compared to

related to the feed study and for general molo graphite project expenditures as compared to the previous period  professional fees and general and administrative ga costs decreased as a result of a reduction in employees and consultants but increased overall due to an increase in travel costs as compared to the previous period  part xii taxes were incurred to settle taxes payable to the canada revenue agency cra related to the issuance of flowthrough shares during fiscal   warrants expiring in january  were issued in a currency other than our functional currency in accordance with asc

managements primary objective is to ensure the entity can continue as a going concern while raising additional funding to meet our obligations as they come due our operations to date have been funded by issuing equity our company expects to raise additional working capital to fund planned project expenditures by securing additional financing the existing working capital position is expected to be sufficient to fund nonproject expenditures for the next  months we hold a significant portion of our cash reserves in canadian dollars to satisfy nonexploration expenditures such as professional and consulting fees and general and administrative costs which are mainly incurred in canadian dollars due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations the remeasurement of the value of canadian dollar reserves into us dollars results in foreign currency translation gains or losses if there was to be a significant decline in the canadian dollar against the us dollar the value of that canadian dollar cash reserves as presented on the balance sheet could significantly decline causing significant foreign currency translation losses in addition certain of our ongoing expenditures are in south african rand madagascar ariary and euros requiring us to occasionally hold reserves of these foreign currencies with a similar risk of foreign exchange currency translation losses capital financings we have funded our business to date from sales of our securities we will require additional funding throughout fiscal  to advance our projects which will likely be in the form of equity financing from the issuance of additional common shares however we cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funding from the sale of our common shares net proceeds during the past two
