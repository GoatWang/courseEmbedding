are state employees anything worth  or more is of substantial value fors  purposes by accepting a total of approximately  in drinksmeals golf and theater entertainment from sawyer scott andhunt all while rep walsh was in a position to take officialactions which could benefit those legislative agents andor theirprincipals rep walsh accepted items of substantial value for orbecause of official acts or acts within his official responsibilityperformed or to be performed by him in doing so rep walshviolated s b as the facts above indicate rep walsh received inaddition to the  in gratuities from sawyer scott and hunt atotal of  in gratuities of  or more where he did not knowthe specific identity of the source of the gratuities section b prohibits a public employee fromknowingly or with reason to know acting in a manner which wouldcause a reasonable person knowing all of the circumstances toconclude that anyone can improperly influence or unduly enjoy hisfavor in the performance of his official duties by accepting gratuities of  or more in value where hedid not know the specific identity of the donor but had reason toknow that the donors were massachusetts lobbyists rep walsh actedin a manner which would cause a reasonable person knowing all thesefacts to conclude that the lobbyists present could improperlyinfluence him in the performance of his official duties inother words rep walsh knew or had reason to know that his actionswould create an appearance of favoritism in so doing rep walshviolated s b the commission is aware of no evidence that thegratuities referenced above were provided to rep walsh with theintent to influence any specific act by him as a legislator or anyparticular act within his official responsibility also thecommission is aware of no evidence that rep walsh took anyofficial action concerning any proposed legislation which wouldaffect any of the registered massachusetts lobbyists in return forthe gratuities however even though the gratuities were onlyintended to foster official goodwill and access they were stillimpermissible rep walsh cooperated with the commissionsinvestigationin view of the foregoing violations of gl c a by repwalsh the commission has determined that the public interest wouldbe served by the disposition of this matter without furtherenforcement proceedings on the basis of the following terms andconditions agreed to by rep walsh that rep walsh pay to the commission the sum of twothousand five hundred dollars  for violatinggl c a sb and sb and that rep walsh waive all rights to contest thefindings of fact conclusions of law and terms andconditions contained in thispage agreement in this or any related administrative orjudicial proceedings to which the commission is or may bea partydate issued  may   this dinner is not identified in scotts records rep walshvoluntarily disclosed the dinner in his testimony before thecommission he had no recollection as to its cost but believed itdid not equal or exceed  this dinner is not identified in sawyers records rep walshvoluntarily disclosed the dinner in his testimony before thecommission he had no recollection as to its cost but believed itdid not equal or exceed  rep walsh testified that sawyer informed him that the ticketswere provided to hancock freeofcharge in return for hancockssupport of the wang centers restoration and that thus rep walshbelieved that the value of the tickets was zero because sawyerhas refused to testify in this matter the commission has beenunable to confirm rep walshs testimony on this point howeverregardless of whether hancock paid for the tickets and regardlessof what sawyer may have told rep walsh the value of the ticketsfor gl c a purposes was the price at which such tickets wereavailable for purchase by the general public see footnote  the commission has evidence carroll subsequently receivedcontributions of  and  from two of the massachusettslobbyists who were at this meal see commonwealth v famigletti  mass app ct   eccoi  scott   sawyer   sawyer  sawyer   sawyer  and  hunt  for s  purposes it is unnecessary to prove that thegratuities given were generated by some specific identifiable actperformed or to be performed as the commission explained inadvisory no  issued may   prohibiting private partiesfrom giving free tickets worth  or more to public employees whoregulate themeven in the absence of any specifically identifiablematter that was is or soon will be pending before theofficial s  may apply thus where there is no priorsocial or business relationship between the giver and therecipient and the recipient is a public official who isin a position to use his authority in a manner whichcould affect the giver an inference can be drawn thatthe giver was seeking the goodwill of the officialbecause of a perception by the giver that the publicofficials influence could benefit the giver in such acase the gratuity is given for his yet unidentifiableacts to be performedspecifically s  applies to generalized goodwillengenderingentertainment of legislators by private parties even where nospecific legislation is discussed in re flaherty  sec issued december   majority leader violates s by acceptingsix celtics tickets from billboard companys lobbyists in remassachusetts candy and tobacco distributors inc  sec company representing distributors violates s by providing a freedays outing a barbecue lunch golf or tennis a cocktail hour anda clam bake dinner worth over  per person to over legislators their staffers and family members with the intent ofenhancing the distributors image with the legislature and wherethe legislators were in a position to benefit the distributorssection  applies to meals and golf including those occasionsmotivated by business reasons for example the socalled businesslunch in re us trust  sec  finally s applies toentertainment gratuities of  or more even in connection witheducational conferences in re stone  webster  sec  andin re state street bank  sec rep walsh has argued that s  does not apply to meals givento legislators there is nothing in the legislative historyregarding s  or the language of s  to support that argument inthe commissions view s  applies to any form of entertainmentincluding meals given to any public officialon the present facts s  applies to the lobbyistsentertaining rep walsh where the intent was generally to creategoodwill and the opportunity for access even though specificlegislation was not discussed the walshes  share of the march   dinner paid forby carroll moreover no matter how carefully this matter is investigatedthe possibility can never be eliminated that rep walsh would laterbe told of the specific sources of the various gratuities describedabove this only adds to the appearance concern created by suchconduct this conduct also raises issues under s discussed abovenothing in s requires that the public official know the source ofthe gift all that is required is that the public official knowthat he is receiving the gift for or because of his position onthe foregoing facts that could be inferred even though rep walshdid not know the specific identity of the donor in any eventbecause this is a matter of first impression the commission hasdecided to resolve this conduct pursuant to s  as discussed above in footnote  s  of gl c a isviolated even where there is no evidence of an understanding thatthe gratuity is being given in exchange for a specific actperformed or to be performed indeed and such quid pro quounderstanding would raise extremely serious concerns under thebribery section of the conflict of interest of law gl c as  section  is not applicable in this case however as therewas no such quid pro quo between the lobbyists and rep walshpage  this amount is approximately three times the value of the in prohibited gratuities received by rep walsh in violation of s and s b it represents both a disgorgement of the gratuitiesand a civil sanctionpage     commonwealth of massachusetts massgov® is a registered service mark of the commonwealth of massachusetts state ethics
