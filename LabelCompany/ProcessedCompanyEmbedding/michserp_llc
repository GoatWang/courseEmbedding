greater love has no one than this that he lay down his life for his friends john  niv a friend loves at all times and a brother is born for adversity proverbs  niv taste and see that the lord is good blessed is the man who takes refuge in him psalm  niv one thing i ask of the lord this is what i seek that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life to gaze upon the beauty of the lord and to seek him in his temple psalm  niv for i know the plans i have for you says the lord they are plans for good and not for disaster to give you a future and a hope  jeremiah  nlt the name of the lord is a strong fortress the godly run to him and are safe proverbs  nlt and we know that god causes everything to work together for the good of those who love god and are called according to his purpose for them romans  nlt and i am convinced that nothing can ever separate us from god’s love neither death nor life neither angels nor demons neither our fears for today nor our worries about tomorrow—not even the powers of hell can separate us from god’s love no power in the sky above or in the earth below—indeed nothing in all creation will ever be able to separate us from the love of god that is revealed in christ jesus our lord romans  nlt but they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary and they shall walk and not faint isaiah  kjv pin it on pinterest share this facebook twitter google pinterest microsoft personalized ad preferences to opt out of personalized ads in this browser your browser
