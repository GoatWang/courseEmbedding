lcms foundation contact the trust administrators blog today  tomorrow  forever the new logo contains the brand theme “today  tomorrow  forever” this phrase is not new it has been a component of our vision and promise statements for a number of years every christian with a lifetime plan for giving today tomorrow and forever the lcms foundation is the only lcms organization that offers you comprehensive charitable expertise and services to help you plan and direct your passion for giving to family and all ministries of the church today tomorrow and forever in the past the foundation has defined the phrase in terms of giving how the gift is managed and when it provides resources for ministry we categorized direct gifts as “gifts today” deferred gifts as “gifts tomorrow” and perpetual gifts endowments as “gifts forever” each year our annual report provided the number and value of these areas of giving using these definitions the new definition of “today  tomorrow  forever” will move away from categorizing types of gifts and provide broader more encompassing support for all the foundation’s services to the church a foundation marketing survey revealed common denominators in how people see the foundation the survey asked people to rank  the most important reason why they would work with us and  the most important expectation of the foundation tied for first the two most important reasons to work with the foundation were to help the ministries people care about and to provide for their family the most important expectation is being christcentered “today” provides the opportunity for action or response it is the foundation position to serve our church right now for individuals and families it is our opportunity to meet with them speak with them assist them with their stewardship plans and respond to their questions for organizations it is the desired action of contacting us “today” to begin the process of starting a gift planning program or relationship and initiating our investment services “tomorrow” is the resulting expectation of that action or response it is the completed stewardship plan created together with gift planning counselors it is the consistent professional services provided by the foundation’s investment program “tomorrow” develops the confidence in our constituency that the foundation will carry through with the plans and provide fiduciary responsibility for those plans unlike “today” and “tomorrow” both time measures used by people “forever” is the immeasurable assurance of christ’s love for those we serve and the foundation only christ is “forever” and the foundation is a christcentered organization during our fall board of trustees meeting members of the gift planning subcommittee were introduced to the new theme the committee provided this reaction “as we get to the ‘forever’ part we can not only point to the fact that our ‘today’ and ‘tomorrow’ efforts are all ultimately for the sake of the eternal kingdom of god but also to emphasize that we both gain our strength from and seek only to serve the one who alone really is the same yesterday today and forever” the foundation will continue to expand the theme’s definition as we listen and gain feedback from those we serve it is the donors investors associates allied professionals and you that truly make the foundation what it is we will continue to focus our efforts to honor and give glory to christ about us history leadership ministry report audited financials resources video resources employment foundation grants contact information the

church–missouri synod originsedit the missouri synod emerged from several communities of german lutheran immigrants during the s and s in indiana ohio and michigan isolated germans in the dense forests of the american frontier were brought together and ministered to by missionary f c d wyneken a movement of confessional lutherans under martin stephan created a community in perry county missouri and st louis missouri in michigan and ohio missionaries sent by wilhelm löhe ministered to scattered congregations and founded german lutheran communities in frankenmuth michigan and the saginaw valley of michigan the saxon immigrationedit main article saxon lutheran immigration  in the thcentury german kingdom of saxony lutheran pastor martin stephan and many of his followers found themselves increasingly at odds with the rationalism christian ecumenism and the prospect of a forced unionism of the lutheran church with the reformed church in the neighboring kingdom of prussia the prussian union of  put in place what they considered nonlutheran communion and baptismal doctrine and practice in order to freely practice their christian faith in accordance with the lutheran confessions outlined in the book of concord stephan and between  and  other saxon lutherans left for the united states in november  their ships arrived between december   and january   in new orleans with one ship lost at sea most of the remaining immigrants left almost immediately with the first group arriving in st louis on january   the final group led by stephan remained in new orleans for ten days possibly to wait for the passengers of the lost ship amalia the immigrants ultimately settled in perry county missouri and in and around st louis stephan was initially the bishop of the new settlement but he soon became embroiled in charges of corruption and sexual misconduct with members of the congregation and was expelled from the settlement leaving c f w walther as the leader of the colony during this period there was considerable debate within the settlement over the proper status of the church in the new world whether it was a new church or whether it remained within the lutheran hierarchy in germany walthers view that they could consider themselves a new church prevailed foundingedit st pauls in chicago where the first meeting of the missouri synod was held old lutheran free church leader friedrich august brünn sent about  men to serve as pastors in the missouri synod on april   twelve pastors representing  german lutheran congregations met in chicago illinois and founded a new church body the german evangelical lutheran synod of missouri ohio and other states walther became the fledgling denominations first president in its early days the synod was conservative on a number of issues following walthers lead it strongly opposed humanism and religious syncretism he also advocated practicing church fellowship with only those lutheran congregations and synods who were in complete doctrinal agreement with the missouri synod under the leadership of its second president f c d wyneken the missouri synod poured much effort into caring for german immigrants helping them find a home among other germans building churches and parochial schools and providing pastors and teachers to serve in them as a result the new synod grew quickly during the th century reaching  members by its fiftieth anniversary in  in  it joined the wisconsin ohio norwegian minnesota and illinois synods other conservative lutheran bodies in forming the evangelical lutheran synodical conference of north america english transition and mergersedit as one scholar has explained the overwhelming evidence from internal documents of these missouri synod churches and particularly their schools indicates that the germanamerican school was a bilingual one much perhaps a whole generation or more earlier than  and that the majority of the pupils may have been englishdominant bilinguals from the early s on until the united states involvement in the first and second world wars the older members of the synod remained overwhelmingly german in their language but younger members had increasingly switched to english the antigerman sentiment during the wars hastened the americanization of the church and caused many churches to add english services and in some cases drop german services entirely during the years of language transition the synods membership continued to grow until by  the synod had grown to over  million members franz pieper june   – june   in  the church body shortened its name from evangelical lutheran synod of missouri ohio and other states to the present one the lutheran church–missouri synod on january   the national evangelical lutheran church an historically finnishamerican lutheran church merged with the lcms in  the synod of evangelical lutheran churches an historically slovakamerican church also merged with the lcms forming the selc district beginning in the s the lcms became somewhat friendlier to the more liberal lutheran bodies despite the opposition of the other members of the synodical conference this culminated in the break up of the synodical conference in  six years later the lcms formed the lutheran council in the united states of america lcusa with several moderatetoliberal lutheran bodies however with the election of j a o preus ii as its president in  the lcms began a sharp turn towards a more conservative direction a dispute over the use of the historicalcritical method for biblical interpretation led to the suspension of john tietjen as president of concordia seminary in response many of the faculty and students left the seminary and formed seminex concordia seminary in exile which took up residence at the nearby eden theological seminary in suburban st louis in  about  of the congregations supporting seminex left the synod to form the association of evangelical lutheran churches which became part of the evangelical lutheran church in america in  the lcms pulled out of lcusa shortly after the aelc schism only a few years after the organizations formation the entire controversy marked an instance of a conservative religious body resisting theological change rather than incorporating its tenets something relatively rare among american religious bodies with the only other analogous scenario being the fundamentalist resurgence in the southern baptist convention from the late s to the early s the lcms also oversaw an extensive roster of congregations in canada until  when the canadian component became a separate and autonomous organization lutheran churchcanada however this was an administrative and not theological division and the two groups still share close ties a small number of ontario and quebec churches remain within the lcms beliefsedit doctrinal sourcesedit one of the signature teachings of the lutheran reformation is the teaching named sola scriptura—scripture alone the missouri synod believes that the bible is the only standard by which church teachings can be judged it also holds that scripture is explained and interpreted by the book of concord—a series of confessions of faith composed by lutherans in the th century missouri synod pastors and congregations agree to teach in harmony with the book of concord because it teaches and faithfully explains the word of god not based on its own authority alone since the missouri synod is a confessional church body its ordained and commissioned ministers of religion are sworn by their oaths of ordination or installation or both to interpret the sacred scriptures according to the book of concord its ordained and commissioned ministers of religion are asked to honor and uphold other official teachings of the synod meaning to abide by act and teach in accordance with but are not sworn to believe confess and teach them as correct interpretations of the sacred scriptures the missouri synod also teaches biblical inerrancy the teaching that bible is inspired by god and is without error for this reason they reject much—if not all—of modern liberal scholarship franz august

international lutheran fellowship charismatic revival alliance of renewal churches  lutheranism portal v t e salvationedit the missouri synod believes that justification comes from god by divine grace alone through faith alone on account of christ alone it teaches that jesus is the focus of the entire bible and that faith in him alone is the way to eternal salvation the synod rejects any attempt to attribute salvation to anything other than christs death and resurrection means of graceedit the synod teaches that the word of god both written and preached and the sacraments are means of grace through which the holy spirit gives the gift of gods grace creates faith in the hearts of individuals forgives sins for the sake of christs death on the cross and grants eternal life and salvation many missouri synod lutherans define a sacrament as an action instituted by jesus that combines a promise in gods word with a physical element although the synod holds no official definition for sacrament this means that some may disagree on the number of sacraments all agree that baptism and communion are sacraments confession and absolution is called a sacrament in the apology of the augsburg confession and so is also considered by many lutherans to be a sacrament because it was instituted by christ and has his promise of grace even though it is not tied to a physical element unlike calvinists lutherans agree that the means of grace are resistible this belief is based on numerous biblical references as discussed in the book of concord sacramental union and the eucharistedit regarding the eucharist the lcms rejects both the roman catholic doctrine of transubstantiation and the reformed teaching that the true body and blood of christ are not consumed with the consecrated bread and wine in the eucharist rather it believes in the doctrine of the sacramental union real presence that the body and blood of christ are truly present in with and under the elements of bread and wine or as the smalcald articles express this mystery of the sacrament of the altar we hold that the bread and wine in the supper are christs true body and blood it is occasionally reported that the lcms and other lutherans teach the doctrine of consubstantiation consubstantiation is generally rejected by lutherans and is explicitly rejected by the lcms as an attempt to define the holy mystery of christs presence eschatologyedit the missouri synod flatly rejects millennialism and considers itself amillennialist this means that they believe there will be no literal year visible earthly kingdom of jesus a view termed as realized millennialism in which the thousand years of rev – is taken figuratively as a reference to the time of christs reign as king from the day of his ascension hence the millennium is a present reality christs heavenly reign not a future hope for a rule of christ on earth after his return the parousia cf mt – mt  eph  col – law and gospeledit the lcms believes that the holy scriptures contain two crucial teachings—the law and the gospel the law is all those demands in the bible which must be obeyed in order to gain salvation however because all people are sinners it is impossible for people to completely obey the law therefore the law implies an inevitable consequence of gods wrath judgment and damnation the gospel on the other hand is the promise of free salvation from god to sinners the law condemns the gospel saves both the law and the gospel are gifts from god both are necessary the function of the law is to show people their sinful nature and drive them to the gospel in which the forgiveness of sin is promised for the sake of the death and resurrection of jesus christ the lcms holds that the old testament and the new testament both contain both law and gospel the old testament therefore is valuable to christians its teachings point forward in time to the cross of christ in the same way that the new testament points backward in time to the cross this lutheran doctrine was summarized by c f w walther in the proper distinction between law and gospel other doctrineedit antichristsedit the lcms holds that all false teachers who teach contrary to christs word are opponents of christ and insofar as they do so are antichrist the lcms does not teach nor has it ever taught that any individual pope as a person is to be identified with the antichrist however to the extent that the papacy continues to claim as official dogma the canons and decrees of the council of trent the lcms position is that the office of the papacy is the antichrist creationismedit the lcms officially supports literal creationism but does not have an official position on the precise age of the earth an official publication of the synod the well known brief statement of  states under the heading of creation we teach that god has created heaven and earth and that in the manner and in the space of time recorded in the holy scriptures especially gen  and  namely by his almighty creative word and in six days according to the recent  lcms synodical resolution a to commend preaching and teaching creation all lcms churches and educational institutions—including preschool through th grade universities and seminaries—are to teach creation from the biblical perspective the lcms website states that an individuals personal views regarding creation do not disqualify a person from being a member of the lcms freemasonryedit the missouri synod is opposed to freemasonry and its pastors and its laypeople are to avoid membership or participation in it baptism and other doctrineedit the lcms practices infant baptism based on acts – and other passages of scripture it also subscribes to the statement of faith found in the apostles creed the ten commandments and the lords prayer to be applicable to daily life these doctrines are emphasized in luthers small catechism practicesedit worship and musicedit the missouri synods original constitution stated that one of its purposes is to strive toward uniformity in practice while more recent changes to those documents also encourage responsible and doctrinally sound diversity the synod requires that hymns songs liturgies and practices be in harmony with the bible and book of concord worship in missouri synod congregations is generally thought of as orthodox and liturgical utilizing a printed order of service and hymnal and is typically accompanied by a pipe organ or piano the contents of lcms hymnals from the past such as the lutheran hymnal and lutheran worship and those of its newest hymnal lutheran service book highlight the synods unwavering stance towards more traditional styles of hymnody and liturgy more traditional lcms lutherans point to the lutheran confessions in their defense of liturgical worship towards the later parts of the twentieth century and up until present day some congregations have adopted a more progressive style of worship employing different styles such as contemporary christian music with guitars and praise bands and often display song lyrics onto screens instead of using hymnals while this shift in style challenges the traditionalism of hymnody that the lcms holds strongly the lcms has released a statement on worship admitting that the best of musical traditions both ancient and modern are embraced by the lutheran church in its worship with an emphasis on congregational singing reinforced by the choir reception of communionedit the lcms endorses the doctrine of close or closed communion—the policy of sharing the eucharist ordinarily only with those who are baptized and confirmed members of one of the congregations of the lutheran church–missouri synod or of a congregation of one of its sister churches with which it has formally declared altar and pulpit fellowship ie agreement in all articles of doctrine missouri synod congregations implement closed communion in various ways requiring conformity to official doctrine in various degrees usually visitors are asked to speak with the pastor before coming to that congregations altar for the first time most congregations invite those uneducated on the subject of the eucharist to join in the fellowship and receive a blessing instead of the body and blood of christ this is because as bonhoeffer emphasizes in his book life together christ comes to us and sustains us through community some congregations however do not implement the synods policy celebrating open communion and welcoming all to their altars the existence of such divergent practice of doctrine challenges the unity of the lcms ordinationedit ordination is seen as a public ceremony of recognition that a man has received and accepted a divine call and hence is considered to be in the office of the public ministry the treatise on the power and primacy of the pope agrees that ordination was nothing else than such a ratification of local elections by the people the lcms does not believe ordination is divinely instituted or an extension of an episcopal form of apostolic succession but sees the office grounded in the word and sacrament ministry of the gospel arguing that scripture makes no distinction between a presbyter priest and a bishop see treatise on the power and primacy of the pope paragraphs  citing st jerome the augsburg confession article xiv holds that no one is to preach teach or administer the sacraments without a regular call lcms pastors are generally required to have a fouryear bachelors degree in any discipline as well as a fouryear master of divinity degree which is usually obtained from one of these institutions concordia seminary in st louis or the concordia theological seminary in fort wayne indiana or at the two seminaries run by the lutheran church–canada candidates may earn their master of divinity degree at other seminaries but may then be required to take colloquy classes at either st louis or ft wayne seminary training includes classwork in historical theology biblical languages biblical greek and hebrew practical application education preaching and mission and doctrine the basic teachings and beliefs of the synod the missouri synod teaches that the ordination of women as clergy is contrary to scripture the issue of womens roles in the church body has continued to be a subject of debate within the synod during the cooperative clergy study project in the year   out of  lcms pastors surveyed stated that all clergy positions should be open to women while  disagreed congregations were permitted to enact female suffrage within missouri synod congregations in  and it was affirmed at the synods  convention that women may also serve in humanly established offices as long as those offices do not include any of the distinctive functions of the pastoral office thus in many congregations of the lcms women now serve as congregation president or chairperson etc this is the cause of contention within the lcms with some congregations utilizing women in public worship to read lessons and assist in the distribution of holy communion other traditional lutherans reject such practices as unbiblical with a minority of congregations continuing the historic practice of male suffrage similar to the wisconsin synod lcms national youth gatheringedit the national youth gathering is held every three years the most recent gathering took place from july –  in new orleans louisiana the theme for the  gathering was in christ alone the previous gathering took place in  in san antonio texas from july –  it was based on the theme live loved the  gathering in new orleans was based on the theme we believe in both  and  the lcms national youth gatherings were held at the orange county convention center in orlando florida the gatherings theme in  was chosen the gathering in  was originally planned to be held in new orleans louisiana but due to hurricane katrina the location was changed to orlando florida around  youth attend each gathering many christian bands and artists perform at gatherings church structureedit the lcms has a modified form of congregational polity this is different from some other lutheran bodies which have maintained episcopal polity however this is not considered to be a point of doctrine as the synod is in fellowship with some lutheran church bodies in europe that have an episcopal structure the corporate lcms is formally constituted of two types of members autonomous local congregations that qualify for membership by mutual agreement to adhere to stated principles and clergymen who qualify by similar means congregations hold legal title to their church buildings and other property and call hire and dismiss their own clergy much of the practical work of the lcms structure is as a free employment brokerage to bring the two together it also allows the congregations to work together on projects far too large for even a local consortium of congregations to accomplish such as foreign mission work synodedit the lcms as a whole is led by an ordained synodical president currently the rev dr matthew c harrison the president is chosen at a synodical convention a gathering of the two membership groups professional clergymen and lay representatives from the member congregations the convention is held every three years discussions of doctrine and policy take place at these events and elections are held to fill various synod positions the next synod convention will be in  local conventions within each circuit and district are held in the intervening years districtsedit main article districts of the lutheran church–missouri synod the entire synod is divided into districts usually corresponding to a specific geographic area as well as two nongeographical districts the english and the selc which were formed when the formerly separate english missouri synod and the slovak synod respectively merged with the formerly germanspeaking missouri synod each district is led by an elected district president who must be an ordained clergyman most district presidencies are fulltime positions but there are a few exceptions in which the district president also serves as a parish pastor the districts are subdivided into circuits each of which is led by a circuit counselor who is an ordained pastor from one of the member congregations districts are roughly analogous to dioceses in other christian communities congregationsedit peace lutheran church built  near baldwin wisconsin congregations are served by fulltime professional clergy the lcms is congregationalist with regard to polity organizationsedit in addition to its two seminaries the lcms operates ten universities known as the concordia university system among the lcmss other auxiliary organizations are the lutheran laymens league now known as lutheran hour ministries which conducts outreach ministries including the lutheran hour radio program and the lutheran womens missionary league the synod also operates concordia publishing house through which it publishes the official periodical of the lcms the lutheran witness relationship with other lutheran bodiesedit maintaining its position as a confessional church body emphasizing the importance of full agreement in the teachings of the bible the lcms is not associated with ecumenical organizations such as the national council of churches the national association of evangelicals the world council of churches or the lutheran world federation it is however a member of the international lutheran council made up of over  lutheran churches worldwide that support the confessional doctrines of the bible and the book of concord at the  convention the delegates voted to establish altar and pulpit fellowship with the american association of lutheran churches aalc although its strongly conservative views on theology and ethics might seem to make the lcms politically compatible with protestant evangelicals and fundamentalists in the us the lcms largely eschews political activity partly out of concerns to keep the denomination untainted with potential heresies and also because of its strict understanding of the lutheran distinction between the two kingdoms see above which repudiates the primarily calvinist presuppositions about the totalizing rule of god that informs much if not most of us evangelical understanding of politics and christianity however both lcms and evangelicals share the common belief that life begins and should be protected by law since conception the lcms is distinguished from the wisconsin evangelical lutheran synod wels by three main theological beliefs the biblical understanding of fellowship the lcms believes in a distinction between the altar pulpit fellowship and other manifestations of christian fellowship ie a prayer fellowship the wels does not the doctrine of the ministry the lcms believes that the pastoral office is divinely established but all other offices are human institutions and hence are not divinely established the wels believes that the ministry of the word is divinely established and that congregations and the synod may choose the forms of public ministry they wish to use the role of women in the church although both the lcms and wels agree that scripture reserves the pastoral office for men the wels also believes that scripture forbids womens suffrage in the congregation respondents to the pew research centers us religious landscape survey of  included members of lcms and the evangelical

they considered nonlutheran communion and baptismal doctrine and practice in order to freely practice their christian faith in accordance with the lutheran confessions outlined in the book of concord stephan and between  and  other saxon lutherans left for the united states in november  their ships arrived between december   and january   in new orleans with one ship lost at sea most of the remaining immigrants left almost immediately with the first group arriving in st louis on january   the final group led by stephan remained in new orleans for ten days possibly to wait for the passengers of the lost ship amalia the immigrants ultimately settled in perry county missouri and in and around st louis stephan was initially the bishop of the new settlement but he soon became embroiled in charges of corruption and sexual misconduct with members of the congregation and was expelled from the settlement leaving c f w walther as the leader of the colony during this period there was considerable debate within the settlement over the proper status of the church in the new world whether it was a new church or whether it remained within the lutheran hierarchy in germany walthers view that they could consider themselves a new church prevailed foundingedit st pauls in chicago where the first meeting of the missouri synod was held old lutheran free church leader friedrich august brünn sent about  men to serve as pastors in the missouri synod on april   twelve pastors representing  german lutheran congregations met in chicago illinois and founded a new church body the german evangelical lutheran synod of missouri ohio and other states walther became the fledgling denominations first president in its early days the synod was conservative on a number of issues following walthers lead it strongly opposed humanism and religious syncretism he also advocated practicing church fellowship with only those lutheran congregations and synods who were in complete doctrinal agreement with the missouri synod under the leadership of its second president f c d wyneken the missouri synod poured much effort into caring for german immigrants helping them find a home among other germans building churches and parochial schools and providing pastors and teachers to serve in them as a result the new synod grew quickly during the th century reaching  members by its fiftieth anniversary in  in  it joined the wisconsin ohio norwegian minnesota and illinois synods other conservative lutheran bodies in forming the evangelical lutheran synodical conference of north america english transition and mergersedit as one scholar has explained the overwhelming evidence from internal documents of these missouri synod churches and particularly their schools indicates that the germanamerican school was a bilingual one much perhaps a whole generation or more earlier than  and that the majority of the pupils may have been englishdominant bilinguals from the early s on until the united states involvement in the first and second world wars the older members of the synod remained overwhelmingly german in their language but younger members had increasingly switched to english the antigerman sentiment during the wars hastened the americanization of the church and caused many churches to add english services and in some cases drop german services entirely during the years of language transition the synods membership continued to grow until by  the synod had grown to over  million members franz pieper june   – june   in  the church body shortened its name from evangelical lutheran synod of missouri ohio and other states to the present one the lutheran church–missouri synod on january   the national evangelical lutheran church an historically finnishamerican lutheran church merged with the lcms in  the synod of evangelical lutheran churches an historically slovakamerican church also merged with the lcms forming the selc district beginning in the s the lcms became somewhat friendlier to the more liberal lutheran bodies despite the opposition of the other members of the synodical conference this culminated in the break up of the synodical conference in  six years later the lcms formed the lutheran council in the united states of america lcusa with several moderatetoliberal lutheran bodies however with the election of j a o preus ii as its president in  the lcms began a sharp turn towards a more conservative direction a dispute over the use of the historicalcritical method for biblical interpretation led to the suspension of john tietjen as president of concordia seminary in response many of the faculty and students left the seminary and formed seminex concordia seminary in exile which took up residence at the nearby eden theological seminary in suburban st louis in  about  of the congregations supporting seminex left the synod to form the association of evangelical lutheran churches which became part of the evangelical lutheran church in america in  the lcms pulled out of lcusa shortly after the aelc schism only a few years after the organizations formation the entire controversy marked an instance of a conservative religious body resisting theological change rather than incorporating its tenets something relatively rare among american religious bodies with the only other analogous scenario being the fundamentalist resurgence in the southern baptist convention from the late s to the early s the lcms also oversaw an extensive roster of congregations in canada until  when the canadian component became a separate and autonomous organization lutheran churchcanada however this was an administrative and not theological division and the two groups still share close ties a small number of ontario and quebec churches remain within the lcms beliefsedit doctrinal sourcesedit one of the signature teachings of the lutheran reformation is the teaching named sola scriptura—scripture alone the missouri synod believes that the bible is the only standard by which church teachings can be judged it also holds that scripture is explained and interpreted by the book of concord—a series of confessions of faith composed by lutherans in the th century missouri synod pastors and congregations agree to teach in harmony with the book of concord because it teaches and faithfully explains the word of god not based on its own authority alone since the missouri synod is a confessional church body its ordained and commissioned ministers of religion are sworn by their oaths of ordination or installation or both to interpret the sacred scriptures according to the book of concord its ordained and commissioned ministers of religion are asked to honor and uphold other official teachings of the synod meaning to abide by act and teach in accordance with but are not sworn to believe confess and teach them as correct interpretations of the sacred scriptures the missouri synod also teaches biblical inerrancy the teaching that bible is inspired by god and is without error for this reason they reject much—if not all—of modern liberal scholarship franz august otto piepers brief

fellowship charismatic revival alliance of renewal churches  lutheranism portal v t e salvationedit the missouri synod believes that justification comes from god by divine grace alone through faith alone on account of christ alone it teaches that jesus is the focus of the entire bible and that faith in him alone is the way to eternal salvation the synod rejects any attempt to attribute salvation to anything other than christs death and resurrection means of graceedit the synod teaches that the word of god both written and preached and the sacraments are means of grace through which the holy spirit gives the gift of gods grace creates faith in the hearts of individuals forgives sins for the sake of christs death on the cross and grants eternal life and salvation many missouri synod lutherans define a sacrament as an action instituted by jesus that combines a promise in gods word with a physical element although the synod holds no official definition for sacrament this means that some may disagree on the number of sacraments all agree that baptism and communion are sacraments confession and absolution is called a sacrament in the apology of the augsburg confession and so is also considered by many lutherans to be a sacrament because it was instituted by christ and has his promise of grace even though it is not tied to a physical element unlike calvinists lutherans agree that the means of grace are resistible this belief is based on numerous biblical references as discussed in the book of concord sacramental union and the eucharistedit regarding the eucharist the lcms rejects both the roman catholic doctrine of transubstantiation and the reformed teaching that the true body and blood of christ are not consumed with the consecrated bread and wine in the eucharist rather it believes in the doctrine of the sacramental union real presence that the body and blood of christ are truly present in with and under the elements of bread and wine or as the smalcald articles express this mystery of the sacrament of the altar we hold that the bread and wine in the supper are christs true body and blood it is occasionally reported that the lcms and other lutherans teach the doctrine of consubstantiation consubstantiation is generally rejected by lutherans and is explicitly rejected by the lcms as an attempt to define the holy mystery of christs presence eschatologyedit the missouri synod flatly rejects millennialism and considers itself amillennialist this means that they believe there will be no literal year visible earthly kingdom of jesus a view termed as realized millennialism in which the thousand years of rev – is taken figuratively as a reference to the time of christs reign as king from the day of his ascension hence the millennium is a present reality christs heavenly reign not a future hope for a rule of christ on earth after his return the parousia cf mt – mt  eph  col – law and gospeledit the lcms believes that the holy scriptures contain two crucial teachings—the law and the gospel the law is all those demands in the bible which must be obeyed in order to gain salvation however because all people are sinners it is impossible for people to completely obey the law therefore the law implies an inevitable consequence of gods wrath judgment and damnation the gospel on the other hand is the promise of free salvation from god to sinners the law condemns the gospel saves both the law and the gospel are gifts from god both are necessary the function of the law is to show people their sinful nature and drive them to the gospel in which the forgiveness of sin is promised for the sake of the death and resurrection of jesus christ the lcms holds that the old testament and the new testament both contain both law and gospel the old testament therefore is valuable to christians its teachings point forward in time to the cross of christ in the same way that the new testament points backward in time to the cross this lutheran doctrine was summarized by c f w walther in the proper distinction between law and gospel other doctrineedit antichristsedit the lcms holds that all false teachers who teach contrary to christs word are opponents of christ and insofar as they do so are antichrist the lcms does not teach nor has it ever taught that any individual pope as a person is to be identified with the antichrist however to the extent that the papacy continues to claim as official dogma the canons and decrees of the council of trent the lcms position is that the office of the papacy is the antichrist creationismedit the lcms officially supports literal creationism but does not have an official position on the precise age of the earth an official publication of the synod the well known brief statement of  states under the heading of creation we teach that god has created heaven and earth and that in the manner and in the space of time recorded in the holy scriptures especially gen  and  namely by his almighty creative word and in six days according to the recent  lcms synodical resolution a to commend preaching and teaching creation all lcms churches and educational institutions—including preschool through th grade universities and seminaries—are to teach creation from the biblical perspective the lcms website states that an individuals personal views regarding creation do not disqualify a person from being a member of the lcms freemasonryedit the missouri synod is opposed to freemasonry and its pastors and its laypeople are to avoid membership or participation in it baptism and other doctrineedit the lcms practices infant baptism based on acts – and other passages of scripture it also subscribes to the statement of faith found in the apostles creed the ten commandments and the lords prayer to be applicable to daily life these doctrines are emphasized in luthers small catechism practicesedit worship and musicedit the missouri synods original constitution stated that one of its purposes is to strive toward uniformity in practice while more recent changes to those documents also encourage responsible and doctrinally sound diversity the synod requires that hymns songs liturgies and practices be in harmony with the bible and book of concord worship in missouri synod congregations is generally thought of as orthodox and liturgical utilizing a printed order of service and hymnal and is typically accompanied by a pipe organ or piano the contents of lcms hymnals from the past such as the lutheran hymnal and lutheran worship and those of its newest hymnal lutheran service book highlight the synods unwavering stance towards more traditional styles of hymnody and liturgy more traditional lcms lutherans point to the lutheran confessions in their defense of liturgical worship towards the later parts of the twentieth century and up until present day some congregations have adopted a more progressive style of worship employing different styles such as contemporary christian music with guitars and praise bands and often display song lyrics onto screens instead of using hymnals while this shift in style challenges the traditionalism of hymnody that the lcms holds strongly the lcms has released a statement on worship admitting that the best of musical traditions both ancient and modern are embraced by the lutheran church in its worship with an emphasis on congregational singing reinforced by the choir reception of communionedit the lcms endorses the doctrine of close or closed communion—the policy of sharing the eucharist ordinarily only with those who are baptized and confirmed members of one of the congregations of the lutheran church–missouri synod or of a congregation of one of its sister churches with which it has formally declared altar and pulpit fellowship ie agreement in all articles of doctrine missouri synod congregations implement closed communion in various ways requiring conformity to official doctrine in various degrees usually visitors are asked to speak with the pastor before coming to that congregations altar for the first time most congregations invite those uneducated on the subject of the eucharist to join in the fellowship and receive a blessing instead of the body and blood of christ this is because as bonhoeffer emphasizes in his book life together christ comes to us and sustains us through community some congregations however do not implement the synods policy celebrating open communion and welcoming all to their altars the existence of such divergent practice of doctrine challenges the unity of the lcms ordinationedit ordination is seen as a public ceremony of recognition that a man has received and accepted a divine call and hence is considered to be in the office of the public ministry the treatise on the power and primacy of the pope agrees that ordination was nothing else than such a ratification of local elections by the people the lcms does not believe ordination is divinely instituted or an extension of an episcopal form of apostolic succession but sees the office grounded in the word and sacrament ministry of the gospel arguing that scripture makes no distinction between a presbyter priest and a bishop see treatise on the power and primacy of the pope paragraphs  citing st jerome the augsburg confession article xiv holds that no one is to preach teach or administer the sacraments without a regular call lcms pastors are generally required to have a fouryear bachelors degree in any discipline as well as a fouryear master of divinity degree which is usually obtained from one of these institutions concordia seminary in st louis or the concordia theological seminary in fort wayne indiana or at the two seminaries run by the lutheran church–canada candidates may earn their master of divinity degree at other seminaries but may then be required to take colloquy classes at either st louis or ft wayne seminary training includes classwork in historical theology biblical languages biblical greek and hebrew practical application education preaching and mission and doctrine the basic teachings and beliefs of the synod the missouri synod teaches that the ordination of women as clergy is contrary to scripture the issue of womens roles in the church body has continued to be a subject of debate within the synod during the cooperative clergy study project in the year   out of  lcms pastors surveyed stated that all clergy positions should be open to women while  disagreed congregations were permitted to enact female suffrage within missouri synod congregations in  and it was affirmed at the synods  convention that women may also serve in humanly established offices as long as those offices do not include any of the distinctive functions of the pastoral office thus in many congregations of the lcms women now serve as congregation president or chairperson etc this is the cause of contention within the lcms with some congregations utilizing women in public worship to read lessons and assist in the distribution of holy communion other traditional lutherans reject such practices as unbiblical with a minority of congregations continuing the historic practice of male suffrage similar to the wisconsin synod lcms national youth gatheringedit the national youth gathering is held every three years the most recent gathering took place from july –  in new orleans louisiana the theme for the  gathering was in christ alone the previous gathering took place in  in san antonio texas from july –  it was based on the theme live loved the  gathering in new orleans was based on the theme we believe in both  and  the lcms national youth gatherings were held at the orange county convention center in orlando florida the gatherings theme in  was chosen the gathering in  was originally planned to be held in new orleans louisiana but due to hurricane katrina the location was changed to orlando florida around  youth attend each gathering many christian bands and artists perform at gatherings church structureedit the lcms has a modified form of congregational polity this is different from some other lutheran bodies which have maintained episcopal polity however this is not considered to be a point of doctrine as the synod is in fellowship with some lutheran church bodies in europe that have an episcopal structure the corporate lcms is formally constituted of two types of members autonomous local congregations that qualify for membership by mutual agreement to adhere to stated principles and clergymen who qualify by similar means congregations hold legal title to their church buildings and other property and call hire and dismiss their own clergy much of the practical work of the lcms structure is as a free employment brokerage to bring the two together it also allows the congregations to work together on projects far too large for even a local consortium of congregations to accomplish such as foreign mission work synodedit the lcms as a whole is led by an ordained synodical president currently the rev dr matthew c harrison the president is chosen at a synodical convention a gathering of the two membership groups professional clergymen and lay representatives from the member congregations the convention is held every three years discussions of doctrine and policy take place at these events and elections are held to fill various synod positions the next synod convention will be in  local conventions within each circuit and district are held in the intervening years districtsedit main article districts of the lutheran church–missouri synod the entire synod is divided into districts usually corresponding to a specific geographic area as well as two nongeographical districts the english and the selc which were formed when the formerly separate english missouri synod and the slovak synod respectively merged with the formerly germanspeaking missouri synod each district is led by an elected district president who must be an ordained clergyman most district presidencies are fulltime positions but there are a few exceptions in which the district president also serves as a parish pastor the districts are subdivided into circuits each of which is led by a circuit counselor who is an ordained pastor from one of the member congregations districts are roughly analogous to dioceses in other christian communities congregationsedit peace lutheran church built  near baldwin wisconsin congregations are served by fulltime professional clergy the lcms is congregationalist with regard to polity organizationsedit in addition to its two seminaries the lcms operates ten universities known as the concordia university system among the lcmss other auxiliary organizations are the lutheran laymens league now known as lutheran hour ministries which conducts outreach ministries including the lutheran hour radio program and the lutheran womens missionary league the synod also operates concordia publishing house through which it publishes the official periodical of the lcms the lutheran witness relationship with other lutheran bodiesedit maintaining its position as a confessional church body emphasizing the importance of full agreement in the teachings of the bible the lcms is not associated with ecumenical organizations such as the national council of churches the national association of evangelicals the world council of churches or the lutheran world federation it is however a member of the international lutheran council made up of over  lutheran churches worldwide that support the confessional doctrines of the bible and the book of concord at the  convention the delegates voted to establish altar and pulpit fellowship with the american association of lutheran churches aalc although its strongly conservative views on theology and ethics might seem to make the lcms politically compatible with protestant evangelicals and fundamentalists in the us the lcms largely eschews political activity partly out of concerns to keep the denomination untainted with potential heresies and also because of its strict understanding of the lutheran distinction between the two kingdoms see above which repudiates the primarily calvinist presuppositions about the totalizing rule of god that informs much if not most of us evangelical understanding of politics and christianity however both lcms and evangelicals share the common belief that life begins and should be protected by law since conception the lcms is distinguished from the wisconsin evangelical lutheran synod wels by three main theological beliefs the biblical understanding of fellowship the lcms believes in a distinction between the altar pulpit fellowship and other manifestations of christian fellowship ie a prayer fellowship the wels does not the doctrine of the ministry the lcms believes that the pastoral office is divinely established but all other offices are human institutions and hence are not divinely established the wels believes that the ministry of the word is divinely established and that congregations and the synod may choose the forms of public ministry they wish to use the role of women in the church although both the lcms and wels agree that scripture reserves the pastoral office for men the wels also believes that scripture forbids womens suffrage in the congregation respondents to the pew research centers us religious landscape survey of  included members of lcms and the evangelical

lcms often referred to simply as the missouri synod is a traditional confessional lutheran denomination in the united states with  million members it is both the eighthlargest protestant denomination

the missouri synod emerged from several communities of german lutheran immigrants during the s and s in indiana ohio and michigan isolated germans in the dense forests of the american frontier were brought together and ministered to by missionary f c d wyneken a movement of confessional lutherans under martin stephan created a community in perry county missouri and st louis missouri in michigan and ohio missionaries sent by wilhelm löhe ministered to scattered congregations and founded german lutheran communities in frankenmuth michigan and the saginaw valley of michigan the saxon immigrationedit main article saxon lutheran immigration  in the thcentury german kingdom of saxony lutheran pastor martin stephan and many of his followers found themselves increasingly at odds with the rationalism christian ecumenism and the prospect of a forced unionism of the lutheran church with the reformed church in the neighboring kingdom of prussia the prussian union of  put in place what they considered nonlutheran communion and baptismal doctrine and practice in order to freely practice their christian faith in accordance with the lutheran confessions outlined in the book of concord stephan and between  and  other saxon lutherans left for the united states in november  their ships arrived between december   and january   in new orleans with one ship lost at sea most of the remaining immigrants left almost immediately with the first group arriving in st louis on january   the final group led by stephan remained in new orleans for ten days possibly to wait for the passengers of the lost ship amalia the immigrants ultimately settled in perry county missouri and in and around st louis stephan was initially the bishop of the new settlement but he soon became embroiled in charges of corruption and sexual misconduct with members of the congregation and was expelled from the settlement leaving c f w walther as the leader of the colony during this period there was considerable debate within the settlement over the proper status of the church in the new world whether it was a new church or whether it remained within the lutheran hierarchy in germany walthers view that they could consider themselves a new church prevailed foundingedit st pauls in chicago where the first meeting of the missouri synod was held old lutheran free church leader friedrich august brünn sent about  men to serve as pastors in the missouri synod on april   twelve pastors representing  german lutheran congregations met in chicago illinois and founded a new church body the german evangelical lutheran synod of missouri ohio and other states walther became the fledgling denominations first president in its early days the synod was conservative on a number of issues following walthers lead it strongly opposed humanism and religious syncretism he also advocated practicing church fellowship with only those lutheran congregations and synods who were in complete doctrinal agreement with the missouri synod under the leadership of its second president f c d wyneken the missouri synod poured much effort into caring for german immigrants helping them find a home among other germans building churches and parochial schools and providing pastors and teachers to serve in them as a result the new synod grew quickly during the th century reaching  members by its fiftieth anniversary in  in  it joined the wisconsin ohio norwegian minnesota and illinois synods other conservative lutheran bodies in forming the evangelical lutheran synodical conference of north america english transition and mergersedit as one scholar has explained the overwhelming evidence from internal documents of these missouri synod churches and particularly their schools indicates that the germanamerican school was a bilingual one much perhaps a whole generation or more earlier than  and that the majority of the pupils may have been englishdominant bilinguals from the early s on until the united states involvement in the first and second world wars the older members of the synod remained overwhelmingly german in their language but younger members had increasingly switched to english the antigerman sentiment during the wars hastened the americanization of the church and caused many churches to add english services and in some cases drop german services entirely during the years of language transition the synods membership continued to grow until by  the synod had grown to over  million members franz pieper june   – june   in  the church body shortened its name from evangelical lutheran synod of missouri ohio and other states to the present one the lutheran church–missouri synod on january   the national evangelical lutheran church an historically finnishamerican lutheran church merged with the lcms in  the synod of evangelical lutheran churches an historically slovakamerican church also merged with the lcms forming the selc district beginning in the s the lcms became somewhat friendlier to the more liberal lutheran bodies despite the opposition of the other members of the synodical conference this culminated in the break up of the synodical conference in  six years later the lcms formed the lutheran council in the united states of america lcusa with several moderatetoliberal lutheran bodies however with the election of j a o preus ii as its president in  the lcms began a sharp turn towards a more conservative direction a dispute over the use of the historicalcritical method for biblical interpretation led to the suspension of john tietjen as president of concordia seminary in response many of the faculty and students left the seminary and formed seminex concordia seminary in exile which took up residence at the nearby eden theological seminary in suburban st louis in  about  of the congregations supporting seminex left the synod to form the association of evangelical lutheran churches which became part of the evangelical lutheran church in america in  the lcms pulled out of lcusa shortly after the aelc schism only a few years after the organizations formation the entire controversy marked an instance of a conservative religious body resisting theological change rather than incorporating its tenets something relatively rare among american religious bodies with the only other analogous scenario being the fundamentalist resurgence in the southern baptist convention from the late s to the early s the lcms also oversaw an extensive roster of congregations in canada until  when the canadian component became a separate and autonomous organization lutheran churchcanada however this was an administrative and not theological division and the two groups still share close ties a small number of ontario and quebec churches remain within the lcms beliefsedit doctrinal sourcesedit one of the signature teachings of the lutheran reformation is the teaching named sola scriptura—scripture alone the missouri synod believes that the bible is the only standard by which church teachings can be judged it also holds that scripture is explained and interpreted by the book of concord—a series of confessions of faith composed by lutherans in the th century missouri synod pastors and congregations agree to teach in harmony with the book of concord because it teaches and faithfully explains the word of god not based on its own authority alone since the missouri synod is a confessional church body its ordained and commissioned ministers of religion are sworn by their oaths of ordination or installation or both to interpret the sacred scriptures according to the book of concord its ordained and commissioned ministers of religion are asked to honor and uphold other official teachings of the synod meaning to abide by act and teach in accordance with but are not sworn to believe confess and teach them as correct interpretations of the sacred scriptures the missouri synod also teaches biblical inerrancy the teaching that bible is inspired by god and is without error for this reason they reject much—if not all—of modern liberal scholarship franz august otto piepers brief

fellowship charismatic revival alliance of renewal churches  lutheranism portal v t e salvationedit the missouri synod believes that justification comes from god by divine grace alone through faith alone on account of christ alone it teaches that jesus is the focus of the entire bible and that faith in him alone is the way to eternal salvation the synod rejects any attempt to attribute salvation to anything other than christs death and resurrection means of graceedit the synod teaches that the word of god both written and preached and the sacraments are means of grace through which the holy spirit gives the gift of gods grace creates faith in the hearts of individuals forgives sins for the sake of christs death on the cross and grants eternal life and salvation many missouri synod lutherans define a sacrament as an action instituted by jesus that combines a promise in gods word with a physical element although the synod holds no official definition for sacrament this means that some may disagree on the number of sacraments all agree that baptism and communion are sacraments confession and absolution is called a sacrament in the apology of the augsburg confession and so is also considered by many lutherans to be a sacrament because it was instituted by christ and has his promise of grace even though it is not tied to a physical element unlike calvinists lutherans agree that the means of grace are resistible this belief is based on numerous biblical references as discussed in the book of concord sacramental union and the eucharistedit regarding the eucharist the lcms rejects both the roman catholic doctrine of transubstantiation and the reformed teaching that the true body and blood of christ are not consumed with the consecrated bread and wine in the eucharist rather it believes in the doctrine of the sacramental union real presence that the body and blood of christ are truly present in with and under the elements of bread and wine or as the smalcald articles express this mystery of the sacrament of the altar we hold that the bread and wine in the supper are christs true body and blood it is occasionally reported that the lcms and other lutherans teach the doctrine of consubstantiation consubstantiation is generally rejected by lutherans and is explicitly rejected by the lcms as an attempt to define the holy mystery of christs presence eschatologyedit the missouri synod flatly rejects millennialism and considers itself amillennialist this means that they believe there will be no literal year visible earthly kingdom of jesus a view termed as realized millennialism in which the thousand years of rev – is taken figuratively as a reference to the time of christs reign as king from the day of his ascension hence the millennium is a present reality christs heavenly reign not a future hope for a rule of christ on earth after his return the parousia cf mt – mt  eph  col – law and gospeledit the lcms believes that the holy scriptures contain two crucial teachings—the law and the gospel the law is all those demands in the bible which must be obeyed in order to gain salvation however because all people are sinners it is impossible for people to completely obey the law therefore the law implies an inevitable consequence of gods wrath judgment and damnation the gospel on the other hand is the promise of free salvation from god to sinners the law condemns the gospel saves both the law and the gospel are gifts from god both are necessary the function of the law is to show people their sinful nature and drive them to the gospel in which the forgiveness of sin is promised for the sake of the death and resurrection of jesus christ the lcms holds that the old testament and the new testament both contain both law and gospel the old testament therefore is valuable to christians its teachings point forward in time to the cross of christ in the same way that the new testament points backward in time to the cross this lutheran doctrine was summarized by c f w walther in the proper distinction between law and gospel other doctrineedit antichristsedit the lcms holds that all false teachers who teach contrary to christs word are opponents of christ and insofar as they do so are antichrist the lcms does not teach nor has it ever taught that any individual pope as a person is to be identified with the antichrist however to the extent that the papacy continues to claim as official dogma the canons and decrees of the council of trent the lcms position is that the office of the papacy is the antichrist creationismedit the lcms officially supports literal creationism but does not have an official position on the precise age of the earth an official publication of the synod the well known brief statement of  states under the heading of creation we teach that god has created heaven and earth and that in the manner and in the space of time recorded in the holy scriptures especially gen  and  namely by his almighty creative word and in six days according to the recent  lcms synodical resolution a to commend preaching and teaching creation all lcms churches and educational institutions—including preschool through th grade universities and seminaries—are to teach creation from the biblical perspective the lcms website states that an individuals personal views regarding creation do not disqualify a person from being a member of the lcms freemasonryedit the missouri synod is opposed to freemasonry and its pastors and its laypeople are to avoid membership or participation in it baptism and other doctrineedit the lcms practices infant baptism based on acts – and other passages of scripture it also subscribes to the statement of faith found in the apostles creed the ten commandments and the lords prayer to be applicable to daily life these doctrines are emphasized in luthers small catechism practicesedit worship and musicedit the missouri synods original constitution stated that one of its purposes is to strive toward uniformity in practice while more recent changes to those documents also encourage responsible and doctrinally sound diversity the synod requires that hymns songs liturgies and practices be in harmony with the bible and book of concord worship in missouri synod congregations is generally thought of as orthodox and liturgical utilizing a printed order of service and hymnal and is typically accompanied by a pipe organ or piano the contents of lcms hymnals from the past such as the lutheran hymnal and lutheran worship and those of its newest hymnal lutheran service book highlight the synods unwavering stance towards more traditional styles of hymnody and liturgy more traditional lcms lutherans point to the lutheran confessions in their defense of liturgical worship towards the later parts of the twentieth century and up until present day some congregations have adopted a more progressive style of worship employing different styles such as contemporary christian music with guitars and praise bands and often display song lyrics onto screens instead of using hymnals while this shift in style challenges the traditionalism of hymnody that the lcms holds strongly the lcms has released a statement on worship admitting that the best of musical traditions both ancient and modern are embraced by the lutheran church in its worship with an emphasis on congregational singing reinforced by the choir reception of communionedit the lcms endorses the doctrine of close or closed communion—the policy of sharing the eucharist ordinarily only with those who are baptized and confirmed members of one of the congregations of the lutheran church–missouri synod or of a congregation of one of its sister churches with which it has formally declared altar and pulpit fellowship ie agreement in all articles of doctrine missouri synod congregations implement closed communion in various ways requiring conformity to official doctrine in various degrees usually visitors are asked to speak with the pastor before coming to that congregations altar for the first time most congregations invite those uneducated on the subject of the eucharist to join in the fellowship and receive a blessing instead of the body and blood of christ this is because as bonhoeffer emphasizes in his book life together christ comes to us and sustains us through community some congregations however do not implement the synods policy celebrating open communion and welcoming all to their altars the existence of such divergent practice of doctrine challenges the unity of the lcms ordinationedit ordination is seen as a public ceremony of recognition that a man has received and accepted a divine call and hence is considered to be in the office of the public ministry the treatise on the power and primacy of the pope agrees that ordination was nothing else than such a ratification of local elections by the people the lcms does not believe ordination is divinely instituted or an extension of an episcopal form of apostolic succession but sees the office grounded in the word and sacrament ministry of the gospel arguing that scripture makes no distinction between a presbyter priest and a bishop see treatise on the power and primacy of the pope paragraphs  citing st jerome the augsburg confession article xiv holds that no one is to preach teach or administer the sacraments without a regular call lcms pastors are generally required to have a fouryear bachelors degree in any discipline as well as a fouryear master of divinity degree which is usually obtained from one of these institutions concordia seminary in st louis or the concordia theological seminary in fort wayne indiana or at the two seminaries run by the lutheran church–canada candidates may earn their master of divinity degree at other seminaries but may then be required to take colloquy classes at either st louis or ft wayne seminary training includes classwork in historical theology biblical languages biblical greek and hebrew practical application education preaching and mission and doctrine the basic teachings and beliefs of the synod the missouri synod teaches that the ordination of women as clergy is contrary to scripture the issue of womens roles in the church body has continued to be a subject of debate within the synod during the cooperative clergy study project in the year   out of  lcms pastors surveyed stated that all clergy positions should be open to women while  disagreed congregations were permitted to enact female suffrage within missouri synod congregations in  and it was affirmed at the synods  convention that women may also serve in humanly established offices as long as those offices do not include any of the distinctive functions of the pastoral office thus in many congregations of the lcms women now serve as congregation president or chairperson etc this is the cause of contention within the lcms with some congregations utilizing women in public worship to read lessons and assist in the distribution of holy communion other traditional lutherans reject such practices as unbiblical with a minority of congregations continuing the historic practice of male suffrage similar to the wisconsin synod lcms national youth gatheringedit the national youth gathering is held every three years the most recent gathering took place from july –  in new orleans louisiana the theme for the  gathering was in christ alone the previous gathering took place in  in san antonio texas from july –  it was based on the theme live loved the  gathering in new orleans was based on the theme we believe in both  and  the lcms national youth gatherings were held at the orange county convention center in orlando florida the gatherings theme in  was chosen the gathering in  was originally planned to be held in new orleans louisiana but due to hurricane katrina the location was changed to orlando florida around  youth attend each gathering many christian bands and artists perform at gatherings church structureedit the lcms has a modified form of congregational polity this is different from some other lutheran bodies which have maintained episcopal polity however this is not considered to be a point of doctrine as the synod is in fellowship with some lutheran church bodies in europe that have an episcopal structure the corporate lcms is formally constituted of two types of members autonomous local congregations that qualify for membership by mutual agreement to adhere to stated principles and clergymen who qualify by similar means congregations hold legal title to their church buildings and other property and call hire and dismiss their own clergy much of the practical work of the lcms structure is as a free employment brokerage to bring the two together it also allows the congregations to work together on projects far too large for even a local consortium of congregations to accomplish such as foreign mission work synodedit the lcms as a whole is led by an ordained synodical president currently the rev dr matthew c harrison the president is chosen at a synodical convention a gathering of the two membership groups professional clergymen and lay representatives from the member congregations the convention is held every three years discussions of doctrine and policy take place at these events and elections are held to fill various synod positions the next synod convention will be in  local conventions within each circuit and district are held in the intervening years districtsedit main article districts of the lutheran church–missouri synod the entire synod is divided into districts usually corresponding to a specific geographic area as well as two nongeographical districts the english and the selc which were formed when the formerly separate english missouri synod and the slovak synod respectively merged with the formerly germanspeaking missouri synod each district is led by an elected district president who must be an ordained clergyman most district presidencies are fulltime positions but there are a few exceptions in which the district president also serves as a parish pastor the districts are subdivided into circuits each of which is led by a circuit counselor who is an ordained pastor from one of the member congregations districts are roughly analogous to dioceses in other christian communities congregationsedit peace lutheran church built  near baldwin wisconsin congregations are served by fulltime professional clergy the lcms is congregationalist with regard to polity organizationsedit in addition to its two seminaries the lcms operates ten universities known as the concordia university system among the lcmss other auxiliary organizations are the lutheran laymens league now known as lutheran hour ministries which conducts outreach ministries including the lutheran hour radio program and the lutheran womens missionary league the synod also operates concordia publishing house through which it publishes the official periodical of the lcms the lutheran witness relationship with other lutheran bodiesedit maintaining its position as a confessional church body emphasizing the importance of full agreement in the teachings of the bible the lcms is not associated with ecumenical organizations such as the national council of churches the national association of evangelicals the world council of churches or the lutheran world federation it is however a member of the international lutheran council made up of over  lutheran churches worldwide that support the confessional doctrines of the bible and the book of concord at the  convention the delegates voted to establish altar and pulpit fellowship with the american association of lutheran churches aalc although its strongly conservative views on theology and ethics might seem to make the lcms politically compatible with protestant evangelicals and fundamentalists in the us the lcms largely eschews political activity partly out of concerns to keep the denomination untainted with potential heresies and also because of its strict understanding of the lutheran distinction between the two kingdoms see above which repudiates the primarily calvinist presuppositions about the totalizing rule of god that informs much if not most of us evangelical understanding of politics and christianity however both lcms and evangelicals share the common belief that life begins and should be protected by law since conception the lcms is distinguished from the wisconsin evangelical lutheran synod wels by three main theological beliefs the biblical understanding of fellowship the lcms believes in a distinction between the altar pulpit fellowship and other manifestations of christian fellowship ie a prayer fellowship the wels does not the doctrine of the ministry the lcms believes that the pastoral office is divinely established but all other offices are human institutions and hence are not divinely established the wels believes that the ministry of the word is divinely established and that congregations and the synod may choose the forms of public ministry they wish to use the role of women in the church although both the lcms and wels agree that scripture reserves the pastoral office for men the wels also believes that scripture forbids womens suffrage in the congregation respondents to the pew research centers us religious landscape survey of  included members of lcms and the evangelical

the missouri synod emerged from several communities of german lutheran immigrants during the s and s in indiana ohio and michigan isolated germans in the dense forests of the american frontier were brought together and ministered to by missionary f c d wyneken a movement of confessional lutherans under martin stephan created a community in perry county missouri and st louis missouri in michigan and ohio missionaries sent by wilhelm löhe ministered to scattered congregations and founded german lutheran communities in frankenmuth michigan and the saginaw valley of michigan the saxon immigrationedit main article saxon lutheran immigration  in the thcentury german kingdom of saxony lutheran pastor martin stephan and many of his followers found themselves increasingly at odds with the rationalism christian ecumenism and the prospect of a forced unionism of the lutheran church with the reformed church in the neighboring kingdom of prussia the prussian union of  put in place what they considered nonlutheran communion and baptismal doctrine and practice in order to freely practice their christian faith in accordance with the lutheran confessions outlined in the book of concord stephan and between  and  other saxon lutherans left for the united states in november  their ships arrived between december   and january   in new orleans with one ship lost at sea most of the remaining immigrants left almost immediately with the first group arriving in st louis on january   the final group led by stephan remained in new orleans for ten days possibly to wait for the passengers of the lost ship amalia the immigrants ultimately settled in perry county missouri and in and around st louis stephan was initially the bishop of the new settlement but he soon became embroiled in charges of corruption and sexual misconduct with members of the congregation and was expelled from the settlement leaving c f w walther as the leader of the colony during this period there was considerable debate within the settlement over the proper status of the church in the new world whether it was a new church or whether it remained within the lutheran hierarchy in germany walthers view that they could consider themselves a new church prevailed foundingedit st pauls in chicago where the first meeting of the missouri synod was held old lutheran free church leader friedrich august brünn sent about  men to serve as pastors in the missouri synod on april   twelve pastors representing  german lutheran congregations met in chicago illinois and founded a new church body the german evangelical lutheran synod of missouri ohio and other states walther became the fledgling denominations first president in its early days the synod was conservative on a number of issues following walthers lead it strongly opposed humanism and religious syncretism he also advocated practicing church fellowship with only those lutheran congregations and synods who were in complete doctrinal agreement with the missouri synod under the leadership of its second president f c d wyneken the missouri synod poured much effort into caring for german immigrants helping them find a home among other germans building churches and parochial schools and providing pastors and teachers to serve in them as a result the new synod grew quickly during the th century reaching  members by its fiftieth anniversary in  in  it joined the wisconsin ohio norwegian minnesota and illinois synods other conservative lutheran bodies in forming the evangelical lutheran synodical conference of north america english transition and mergersedit as one scholar has explained the overwhelming evidence from internal documents of these missouri synod churches and particularly their schools indicates that the germanamerican school was a bilingual one much perhaps a whole generation or more earlier than  and that the majority of the pupils may have been englishdominant bilinguals from the early s on until the united states involvement in the first and second world wars the older members of the synod remained overwhelmingly german in their language but younger members had increasingly switched to english the antigerman sentiment during the wars hastened the americanization of the church and caused many churches to add english services and in some cases drop german services entirely during the years of language transition the synods membership continued to grow until by  the synod had grown to over  million members franz pieper june   – june   in  the church body shortened its name from evangelical lutheran synod of missouri ohio and other states to the present one the lutheran church–missouri synod on january   the national evangelical lutheran church an historically finnishamerican lutheran church merged with the lcms in  the synod of evangelical lutheran churches an historically slovakamerican church also merged with the lcms forming the selc district beginning in the s the lcms became somewhat friendlier to the more liberal lutheran bodies despite the opposition of the other members of the synodical conference this culminated in the break up of the synodical conference in  six years later the lcms formed the lutheran council in the united states of america lcusa with several moderatetoliberal lutheran bodies however with the election of j a o preus ii as its president in  the lcms began a sharp turn towards a more conservative direction a dispute over the use of the historicalcritical method for biblical interpretation led to the suspension of john tietjen as president of concordia seminary in response many of the faculty and students left the seminary and formed seminex concordia seminary in exile which took up residence at the nearby eden theological seminary in suburban st louis in  about  of the congregations supporting seminex left the synod to form the association of evangelical lutheran churches which became part of the evangelical lutheran church in america in  the lcms pulled out of lcusa shortly after the aelc schism only a few years after the organizations formation the entire controversy marked an instance of a conservative religious body resisting theological change rather than incorporating its tenets something relatively rare among american religious bodies with the only other analogous scenario being the fundamentalist resurgence in the southern baptist convention from the late s to the early s the lcms also oversaw an extensive roster of congregations in canada until  when the canadian component became a separate and autonomous organization lutheran churchcanada however this was an administrative and not theological division and the two groups still share close ties a small number of ontario and quebec churches remain within the lcms beliefsedit doctrinal sourcesedit one of the signature teachings of the lutheran reformation is the teaching named sola scriptura—scripture alone the missouri synod believes that the bible is the only standard by which church teachings can be judged it also holds that scripture is explained and interpreted by the book of concord—a series of confessions of faith composed by lutherans in the th century missouri synod pastors and congregations agree to teach in harmony with the book of concord because it teaches and faithfully explains the word of god not based on its own authority alone since the missouri synod is a confessional church body its ordained and commissioned ministers of religion are sworn by their oaths of ordination or installation or both to interpret the sacred scriptures according to the book of concord its ordained and commissioned ministers of religion are asked to honor and uphold other official teachings of the synod meaning to abide by act and teach in accordance with but are not sworn to believe confess and teach them as correct interpretations of the sacred scriptures the missouri synod also teaches biblical inerrancy the teaching that bible is inspired by god and is without error for this reason they reject much—if not all—of modern liberal scholarship franz august otto piepers brief

fellowship charismatic revival alliance of renewal churches  lutheranism portal v t e salvationedit the missouri synod believes that justification comes from god by divine grace alone through faith alone on account of christ alone it teaches that jesus is the focus of the entire bible and that faith in him alone is the way to eternal salvation the synod rejects any attempt to attribute salvation to anything other than christs death and resurrection means of graceedit the synod teaches that the word of god both written and preached and the sacraments are means of grace through which the holy spirit gives the gift of gods grace creates faith in the hearts of individuals forgives sins for the sake of christs death on the cross and grants eternal life and salvation many missouri synod lutherans define a sacrament as an action instituted by jesus that combines a promise in gods word with a physical element although the synod holds no official definition for sacrament this means that some may disagree on the number of sacraments all agree that baptism and communion are sacraments confession and absolution is called a sacrament in the apology of the augsburg confession and so is also considered by many lutherans to be a sacrament because it was instituted by christ and has his promise of grace even though it is not tied to a physical element unlike calvinists lutherans agree that the means of grace are resistible this belief is based on numerous biblical references as discussed in the book of concord sacramental union and the eucharistedit regarding the eucharist the lcms rejects both the roman catholic doctrine of transubstantiation and the reformed teaching that the true body and blood of christ are not consumed with the consecrated bread and wine in the eucharist rather it believes in the doctrine of the sacramental union real presence that the body and blood of christ are truly present in with and under the elements of bread and wine or as the smalcald articles express this mystery of the sacrament of the altar we hold that the bread and wine in the supper are christs true body and blood it is occasionally reported that the lcms and other lutherans teach the doctrine of consubstantiation consubstantiation is generally rejected by lutherans and is explicitly rejected by the lcms as an attempt to define the holy mystery of christs presence eschatologyedit the missouri synod flatly rejects millennialism and considers itself amillennialist this means that they believe there will be no literal year visible earthly kingdom of jesus a view termed as realized millennialism in which the thousand years of rev – is taken figuratively as a reference to the time of christs reign as king from the day of his ascension hence the millennium is a present reality christs heavenly reign not a future hope for a rule of christ on earth after his return the parousia cf mt – mt  eph  col – law and gospeledit the lcms believes that the holy scriptures contain two crucial teachings—the law and the gospel the law is all those demands in the bible which must be obeyed in order to gain salvation however because all people are sinners it is impossible for people to completely obey the law therefore the law implies an inevitable consequence of gods wrath judgment and damnation the gospel on the other hand is the promise of free salvation from god to sinners the law condemns the gospel saves both the law and the gospel are gifts from god both are necessary the function of the law is to show people their sinful nature and drive them to the gospel in which the forgiveness of sin is promised for the sake of the death and resurrection of jesus christ the lcms holds that the old testament and the new testament both contain both law and gospel the old testament therefore is valuable to christians its teachings point forward in time to the cross of christ in the same way that the new testament points backward in time to the cross this lutheran doctrine was summarized by c f w walther in the proper distinction between law and gospel other doctrineedit antichristsedit the lcms holds that all false teachers who teach contrary to christs word are opponents of christ and insofar as they do so are antichrist the lcms does not teach nor has it ever taught that any individual pope as a person is to be identified with the antichrist however to the extent that the papacy continues to claim as official dogma the canons and decrees of the council of trent the lcms position is that the office of the papacy is the antichrist creationismedit the lcms officially supports literal creationism but does not have an official position on the precise age of the earth an official publication of the synod the well known brief statement of  states under the heading of creation we teach that god has created heaven and earth and that in the manner and in the space of time recorded in the holy scriptures especially gen  and  namely by his almighty creative word and in six days according to the recent  lcms synodical resolution a to commend preaching and teaching creation all lcms churches and educational institutions—including preschool through th grade universities and seminaries—are to teach creation from the biblical perspective the lcms website states that an individuals personal views regarding creation do not disqualify a person from being a member of the lcms freemasonryedit the missouri synod is opposed to freemasonry and its pastors and its laypeople are to avoid membership or participation in it baptism and other doctrineedit the lcms practices infant baptism based on acts – and other passages of scripture it also subscribes to the statement of faith found in the apostles creed the ten commandments and the lords prayer to be applicable to daily life these doctrines are emphasized in luthers small catechism practicesedit worship and musicedit the missouri synods original constitution stated that one of its purposes is to strive toward uniformity in practice while more recent changes to those documents also encourage responsible and doctrinally sound diversity the synod requires that hymns songs liturgies and practices be in harmony with the bible and book of concord worship in missouri synod congregations is generally thought of as orthodox and liturgical utilizing a printed order of service and hymnal and is typically accompanied by a pipe organ or piano the contents of lcms hymnals from the past such as the lutheran hymnal and lutheran worship and those of its newest hymnal lutheran service book highlight the synods unwavering stance towards more traditional styles of hymnody and liturgy more traditional lcms lutherans point to the lutheran confessions in their defense of liturgical worship towards the later parts of the twentieth century and up until present day some congregations have adopted a more progressive style of worship employing different styles such as contemporary christian music with guitars and praise bands and often display song lyrics onto screens instead of using hymnals while this shift in style challenges the traditionalism of hymnody that the lcms holds strongly the lcms has released a statement on worship admitting that the best of musical traditions both ancient and modern are embraced by the lutheran church in its worship with an emphasis on congregational singing reinforced by the choir reception of communionedit the lcms endorses the doctrine of close or closed communion—the policy of sharing the eucharist ordinarily only with those who are baptized and confirmed members of one of the congregations of the lutheran church–missouri synod or of a congregation of one of its sister churches with which it has formally declared altar and pulpit fellowship ie agreement in all articles of doctrine missouri synod congregations implement closed communion in various ways requiring conformity to official doctrine in various degrees usually visitors are asked to speak with the pastor before coming to that congregations altar for the first time most congregations invite those uneducated on the subject of the eucharist to join in the fellowship and receive a blessing instead of the body and blood of christ this is because as bonhoeffer emphasizes in his book life together christ comes to us and sustains us through community some congregations however do not implement the synods policy celebrating open communion and welcoming all to their altars the existence of such divergent practice of doctrine challenges the unity of the lcms ordinationedit ordination is seen as a public ceremony of recognition that a man has received and accepted a divine call and hence is considered to be in the office of the public ministry the treatise on the power and primacy of the pope agrees that ordination was nothing else than such a ratification of local elections by the people the lcms does not believe ordination is divinely instituted or an extension of an episcopal form of apostolic succession but sees the office grounded in the word and sacrament ministry of the gospel arguing that scripture makes no distinction between a presbyter priest and a bishop see treatise on the power and primacy of the pope paragraphs  citing st jerome the augsburg confession article xiv holds that no one is to preach teach or administer the sacraments without a regular call lcms pastors are generally required to have a fouryear bachelors degree in any discipline as well as a fouryear master of divinity degree which is usually obtained from one of these institutions concordia seminary in st louis or the concordia theological seminary in fort wayne indiana or at the two seminaries run by the lutheran church–canada candidates may earn their master of divinity degree at other seminaries but may then be required to take colloquy classes at either st louis or ft wayne seminary training includes classwork in historical theology biblical languages biblical greek and hebrew practical application education preaching and mission and doctrine the basic teachings and beliefs of the synod the missouri synod teaches that the ordination of women as clergy is contrary to scripture the issue of womens roles in the church body has continued to be a subject of debate within the synod during the cooperative clergy study project in the year   out of  lcms pastors surveyed stated that all clergy positions should be open to women while  disagreed congregations were permitted to enact female suffrage within missouri synod congregations in  and it was affirmed at the synods  convention that women may also serve in humanly established offices as long as those offices do not include any of the distinctive functions of the pastoral office thus in many congregations of the lcms women now serve as congregation president or chairperson etc this is the cause of contention within the lcms with some congregations utilizing women in public worship to read lessons and assist in the distribution of holy communion other traditional lutherans reject such practices as unbiblical with a minority of congregations continuing the historic practice of male suffrage similar to the wisconsin synod lcms national youth gatheringedit the national youth gathering is held every three years the most recent gathering took place from july –  in new orleans louisiana the theme for the  gathering was in christ alone the previous gathering took place in  in san antonio texas from july –  it was based on the theme live loved the  gathering in new orleans was based on the theme we believe in both  and  the lcms national youth gatherings were held at the orange county convention center in orlando florida the gatherings theme in  was chosen the gathering in  was originally planned to be held in new orleans louisiana but due to hurricane katrina the location was changed to orlando florida around  youth attend each gathering many christian bands and artists perform at gatherings church structureedit the lcms has a modified form of congregational polity this is different from some other lutheran bodies which have maintained episcopal polity however this is not considered to be a point of doctrine as the synod is in fellowship with some lutheran church bodies in europe that have an episcopal structure the corporate lcms is formally constituted of two types of members autonomous local congregations that qualify for membership by mutual agreement to adhere to stated principles and clergymen who qualify by similar means congregations hold legal title to their church buildings and other property and call hire and dismiss their own clergy much of the practical work of the lcms structure is as a free employment brokerage to bring the two together it also allows the congregations to work together on projects far too large for even a local consortium of congregations to accomplish such as foreign mission work synodedit the lcms as a whole is led by an ordained synodical president currently the rev dr matthew c harrison the president is chosen at a synodical convention a gathering of the two membership groups professional clergymen and lay representatives from the member congregations the convention is held every three years discussions of doctrine and policy take place at these events and elections are held to fill various synod positions the next synod convention will be in  local conventions within each circuit and district are held in the intervening years districtsedit main article districts of the lutheran church–missouri synod the entire synod is divided into districts usually corresponding to a specific geographic area as well as two nongeographical districts the english and the selc which were formed when the formerly separate english missouri synod and the slovak synod respectively merged with the formerly germanspeaking missouri synod each district is led by an elected district president who must be an ordained clergyman most district presidencies are fulltime positions but there are a few exceptions in which the district president also serves as a parish pastor the districts are subdivided into circuits each of which is led by a circuit counselor who is an ordained pastor from one of the member congregations districts are roughly analogous to dioceses in other christian communities congregationsedit peace lutheran church built  near baldwin wisconsin congregations are served by fulltime professional clergy the lcms is congregationalist with regard to polity organizationsedit in addition to its two seminaries the lcms operates ten universities known as the concordia university system among the lcmss other auxiliary organizations are the lutheran laymens league now known as lutheran hour ministries which conducts outreach ministries including the lutheran hour radio program and the lutheran womens missionary league the synod also operates concordia publishing house through which it publishes the official periodical of the lcms the lutheran witness relationship with other lutheran bodiesedit maintaining its position as a confessional church body emphasizing the importance of full agreement in the teachings of the bible the lcms is not associated with ecumenical organizations such as the national council of churches the national association of evangelicals the world council of churches or the lutheran world federation it is however a member of the international lutheran council made up of over  lutheran churches worldwide that support the confessional doctrines of the bible and the book of concord at the  convention the delegates voted to establish altar and pulpit fellowship with the american association of lutheran churches aalc although its strongly conservative views on theology and ethics might seem to make the lcms politically compatible with protestant evangelicals and fundamentalists in the us the lcms largely eschews political activity partly out of concerns to keep the denomination untainted with potential heresies and also because of its strict understanding of the lutheran distinction between the two kingdoms see above which repudiates the primarily calvinist presuppositions about the totalizing rule of god that informs much if not most of us evangelical understanding of politics and christianity however both lcms and evangelicals share the common belief that life begins and should be protected by law since conception the lcms is distinguished from the wisconsin evangelical lutheran synod wels by three main theological beliefs the biblical understanding of fellowship the lcms believes in a distinction between the altar pulpit fellowship and other manifestations of christian fellowship ie a prayer fellowship the wels does not the doctrine of the ministry the lcms believes that the pastoral office is divinely established but all other offices are human institutions and hence are not divinely established the wels believes that the ministry of the word is divinely established and that congregations and the synod may choose the forms of public ministry they wish to use the role of women in the church although both the lcms and wels agree that scripture reserves the pastoral office for men the wels also believes that scripture forbids womens suffrage in the congregation respondents to the pew research centers us religious landscape survey of  included members of lcms and the evangelical

the missouri synod emerged from several communities of german lutheran immigrants during the s and s in indiana ohio and michigan isolated germans in the dense forests of the american frontier were brought together and ministered to by missionary f c d wyneken a movement of confessional lutherans under martin stephan created a community in perry county missouri and st louis missouri in michigan and ohio missionaries sent by wilhelm löhe ministered to scattered congregations and founded german lutheran communities in frankenmuth michigan and the saginaw valley of michigan the saxon immigrationedit main article saxon lutheran immigration  in the thcentury german kingdom of saxony lutheran pastor martin stephan and many of his followers found themselves increasingly at odds with the rationalism christian ecumenism and the prospect of a forced unionism of the lutheran church with the reformed church in the neighboring kingdom of prussia the prussian union of  put in place what they considered nonlutheran communion and baptismal doctrine and practice in order to freely practice their christian faith in accordance with the lutheran confessions outlined in the book of concord stephan and between  and  other saxon lutherans left for the united states in november  their ships arrived between december   and january   in new orleans with one ship lost at sea most of the remaining immigrants left almost immediately with the first group arriving in st louis on january   the final group led by stephan remained in new orleans for ten days possibly to wait for the passengers of the lost ship amalia the immigrants ultimately settled in perry county missouri and in and around st louis stephan was initially the bishop of the new settlement but he soon became embroiled in charges of corruption and sexual misconduct with members of the congregation and was expelled from the settlement leaving c f w walther as the leader of the colony during this period there was considerable debate within the settlement over the proper status of the church in the new world whether it was a new church or whether it remained within the lutheran hierarchy in germany walthers view that they could consider themselves a new church prevailed foundingedit st pauls in chicago where the first meeting of the missouri synod was held old lutheran free church leader friedrich august brünn sent about  men to serve as pastors in the missouri synod on april   twelve pastors representing  german lutheran congregations met in chicago illinois and founded a new church body the german evangelical lutheran synod of missouri ohio and other states walther became the fledgling denominations first president in its early days the synod was conservative on a number of issues following walthers lead it strongly opposed humanism and religious syncretism he also advocated practicing church fellowship with only those lutheran congregations and synods who were in complete doctrinal agreement with the missouri synod under the leadership of its second president f c d wyneken the missouri synod poured much effort into caring for german immigrants helping them find a home among other germans building churches and parochial schools and providing pastors and teachers to serve in them as a result the new synod grew quickly during the th century reaching  members by its fiftieth anniversary in  in  it joined the wisconsin ohio norwegian minnesota and illinois synods other conservative lutheran bodies in forming the evangelical lutheran synodical conference of north america english transition and mergersedit as one scholar has explained the overwhelming evidence from internal documents of these missouri synod churches and particularly their schools indicates that the germanamerican school was a bilingual one much perhaps a whole generation or more earlier than  and that the majority of the pupils may have been englishdominant bilinguals from the early s on until the united states involvement in the first and second world wars the older members of the synod remained overwhelmingly german in their language but younger members had increasingly switched to english the antigerman sentiment during the wars hastened the americanization of the church and caused many churches to add english services and in some cases drop german services entirely during the years of language transition the synods membership continued to grow until by  the synod had grown to over  million members franz pieper june   – june   in  the church body shortened its name from evangelical lutheran synod of missouri ohio and other states to the present one the lutheran church–missouri synod on january   the national evangelical lutheran church an historically finnishamerican lutheran church merged with the lcms in  the synod of evangelical lutheran churches an historically slovakamerican church also merged with the lcms forming the selc district beginning in the s the lcms became somewhat friendlier to the more liberal lutheran bodies despite the opposition of the other members of the synodical conference this culminated in the break up of the synodical conference in  six years later the lcms formed the lutheran council in the united states of america lcusa with several moderatetoliberal lutheran bodies however with the election of j a o preus ii as its president in  the lcms began a sharp turn towards a more conservative direction a dispute over the use of the historicalcritical method for biblical interpretation led to the suspension of john tietjen as president of concordia seminary in response many of the faculty and students left the seminary and formed seminex concordia seminary in exile which took up residence at the nearby eden theological seminary in suburban st louis in  about  of the congregations supporting seminex left the synod to form the association of evangelical lutheran churches which became part of the evangelical lutheran church in america in  the lcms pulled out of lcusa shortly after the aelc schism only a few years after the organizations formation the entire controversy marked an instance of a conservative religious body resisting theological change rather than incorporating its tenets something relatively rare among american religious bodies with the only other analogous scenario being the fundamentalist resurgence in the southern baptist convention from the late s to the early s the lcms also oversaw an extensive roster of congregations in canada until  when the canadian component became a separate and autonomous organization lutheran churchcanada however this was an administrative and not theological division and the two groups still share close ties a small number of ontario and quebec churches remain within the lcms beliefsedit doctrinal sourcesedit one of the signature teachings of the lutheran reformation is the teaching named sola scriptura—scripture alone the missouri synod believes that the bible is the only standard by which church teachings can be judged it also holds that scripture is explained and interpreted by the book of concord—a series of confessions of faith composed by lutherans in the th century missouri synod pastors and congregations agree to teach in harmony with the book of concord because it teaches and faithfully explains the word of god not based on its own authority alone since the missouri synod is a confessional church body its ordained and commissioned ministers of religion are sworn by their oaths of ordination or installation or both to interpret the sacred scriptures according to the book of concord its ordained and commissioned ministers of religion are asked to honor and uphold other official teachings of the synod meaning to abide by act and teach in accordance with but are not sworn to believe confess and teach them as correct interpretations of the sacred scriptures the missouri synod also teaches biblical inerrancy the teaching that bible is inspired by god and is without error for this reason they reject much—if not all—of modern liberal scholarship franz august otto piepers brief

fellowship charismatic revival alliance of renewal churches  lutheranism portal v t e salvationedit the missouri synod believes that justification comes from god by divine grace alone through faith alone on account of christ alone it teaches that jesus is the focus of the entire bible and that faith in him alone is the way to eternal salvation the synod rejects any attempt to attribute salvation to anything other than christs death and resurrection means of graceedit the synod teaches that the word of god both written and preached and the sacraments are means of grace through which the holy spirit gives the gift of gods grace creates faith in the hearts of individuals forgives sins for the sake of christs death on the cross and grants eternal life and salvation many missouri synod lutherans define a sacrament as an action instituted by jesus that combines a promise in gods word with a physical element although the synod holds no official definition for sacrament this means that some may disagree on the number of sacraments all agree that baptism and communion are sacraments confession and absolution is called a sacrament in the apology of the augsburg confession and so is also considered by many lutherans to be a sacrament because it was instituted by christ and has his promise of grace even though it is not tied to a physical element unlike calvinists lutherans agree that the means of grace are resistible this belief is based on numerous biblical references as discussed in the book of concord sacramental union and the eucharistedit regarding the eucharist the lcms rejects both the roman catholic doctrine of transubstantiation and the reformed teaching that the true body and blood of christ are not consumed with the consecrated bread and wine in the eucharist rather it believes in the doctrine of the sacramental union real presence that the body and blood of christ are truly present in with and under the elements of bread and wine or as the smalcald articles express this mystery of the sacrament of the altar we hold that the bread and wine in the supper are christs true body and blood it is occasionally reported that the lcms and other lutherans teach the doctrine of consubstantiation consubstantiation is generally rejected by lutherans and is explicitly rejected by the lcms as an attempt to define the holy mystery of christs presence eschatologyedit the missouri synod flatly rejects millennialism and considers itself amillennialist this means that they believe there will be no literal year visible earthly kingdom of jesus a view termed as realized millennialism in which the thousand years of rev – is taken figuratively as a reference to the time of christs reign as king from the day of his ascension hence the millennium is a present reality christs heavenly reign not a future hope for a rule of christ on earth after his return the parousia cf mt – mt  eph  col – law and gospeledit the lcms believes that the holy scriptures contain two crucial teachings—the law and the gospel the law is all those demands in the bible which must be obeyed in order to gain salvation however because all people are sinners it is impossible for people to completely obey the law therefore the law implies an inevitable consequence of gods wrath judgment and damnation the gospel on the other hand is the promise of free salvation from god to sinners the law condemns the gospel saves both the law and the gospel are gifts from god both are necessary the function of the law is to show people their sinful nature and drive them to the gospel in which the forgiveness of sin is promised for the sake of the death and resurrection of jesus christ the lcms holds that the old testament and the new testament both contain both law and gospel the old testament therefore is valuable to christians its teachings point forward in time to the cross of christ in the same way that the new testament points backward in time to the cross this lutheran doctrine was summarized by c f w walther in the proper distinction between law and gospel other doctrineedit antichristsedit the lcms holds that all false teachers who teach contrary to christs word are opponents of christ and insofar as they do so are antichrist the lcms does not teach nor has it ever taught that any individual pope as a person is to be identified with the antichrist however to the extent that the papacy continues to claim as official dogma the canons and decrees of the council of trent the lcms position is that the office of the papacy is the antichrist creationismedit the lcms officially supports literal creationism but does not have an official position on the precise age of the earth an official publication of the synod the well known brief statement of  states under the heading of creation we teach that god has created heaven and earth and that in the manner and in the space of time recorded in the holy scriptures especially gen  and  namely by his almighty creative word and in six days according to the recent  lcms synodical resolution a to commend preaching and teaching creation all lcms churches and educational institutions—including preschool through th grade universities and seminaries—are to teach creation from the biblical perspective the lcms website states that an individuals personal views regarding creation do not disqualify a person from being a member of the lcms freemasonryedit the missouri synod is opposed to freemasonry and its pastors and its laypeople are to avoid membership or participation in it baptism and other doctrineedit the lcms practices infant baptism based on acts – and other passages of scripture it also subscribes to the statement of faith found in the apostles creed the ten commandments and the lords prayer to be applicable to daily life these doctrines are emphasized in luthers small catechism practicesedit worship and musicedit the missouri synods original constitution stated that one of its purposes is to strive toward uniformity in practice while more recent changes to those documents also encourage responsible and doctrinally sound diversity the synod requires that hymns songs liturgies and practices be in harmony with the bible and book of concord worship in missouri synod congregations is generally thought of as orthodox and liturgical utilizing a printed order of service and hymnal and is typically accompanied by a pipe organ or piano the contents of lcms hymnals from the past such as the lutheran hymnal and lutheran worship and those of its newest hymnal lutheran service book highlight the synods unwavering stance towards more traditional styles of hymnody and liturgy more traditional lcms lutherans point to the lutheran confessions in their defense of liturgical worship towards the later parts of the twentieth century and up until present day some congregations have adopted a more progressive style of worship employing different styles such as contemporary christian music with guitars and praise bands and often display song lyrics onto screens instead of using hymnals while this shift in style challenges the traditionalism of hymnody that the lcms holds strongly the lcms has released a statement on worship admitting that the best of musical traditions both ancient and modern are embraced by the lutheran church in its worship with an emphasis on congregational singing reinforced by the choir reception of communionedit the lcms endorses the doctrine of close or closed communion—the policy of sharing the eucharist ordinarily only with those who are baptized and confirmed members of one of the congregations of the lutheran church–missouri synod or of a congregation of one of its sister churches with which it has formally declared altar and pulpit fellowship ie agreement in all articles of doctrine missouri synod congregations implement closed communion in various ways requiring conformity to official doctrine in various degrees usually visitors are asked to speak with the pastor before coming to that congregations altar for the first time most congregations invite those uneducated on the subject of the eucharist to join in the fellowship and receive a blessing instead of the body and blood of christ this is because as bonhoeffer emphasizes in his book life together christ comes to us and sustains us through community some congregations however do not implement the synods policy celebrating open communion and welcoming all to their altars the existence of such divergent practice of doctrine challenges the unity of the lcms ordinationedit ordination is seen as a public ceremony of recognition that a man has received and accepted a divine call and hence is considered to be in the office of the public ministry the treatise on the power and primacy of the pope agrees that ordination was nothing else than such a ratification of local elections by the people the lcms does not believe ordination is divinely instituted or an extension of an episcopal form of apostolic succession but sees the office grounded in the word and sacrament ministry of the gospel arguing that scripture makes no distinction between a presbyter priest and a bishop see treatise on the power and primacy of the pope paragraphs  citing st jerome the augsburg confession article xiv holds that no one is to preach teach or administer the sacraments without a regular call lcms pastors are generally required to have a fouryear bachelors degree in any discipline as well as a fouryear master of divinity degree which is usually obtained from one of these institutions concordia seminary in st louis or the concordia theological seminary in fort wayne indiana or at the two seminaries run by the lutheran church–canada candidates may earn their master of divinity degree at other seminaries but may then be required to take colloquy classes at either st louis or ft wayne seminary training includes classwork in historical theology biblical languages biblical greek and hebrew practical application education preaching and mission and doctrine the basic teachings and beliefs of the synod the missouri synod teaches that the ordination of women as clergy is contrary to scripture the issue of womens roles in the church body has continued to be a subject of debate within the synod during the cooperative clergy study project in the year   out of  lcms pastors surveyed stated that all clergy positions should be open to women while  disagreed congregations were permitted to enact female suffrage within missouri synod congregations in  and it was affirmed at the synods  convention that women may also serve in humanly established offices as long as those offices do not include any of the distinctive functions of the pastoral office thus in many congregations of the lcms women now serve as congregation president or chairperson etc this is the cause of contention within the lcms with some congregations utilizing women in public worship to read lessons and assist in the distribution of holy communion other traditional lutherans reject such practices as unbiblical with a minority of congregations continuing the historic practice of male suffrage similar to the wisconsin synod lcms national youth gatheringedit the national youth gathering is held every three years the most recent gathering took place from july –  in new orleans louisiana the theme for the  gathering was in christ alone the previous gathering took place in  in san antonio texas from july –  it was based on the theme live loved the  gathering in new orleans was based on the theme we believe in both  and  the lcms national youth gatherings were held at the orange county convention center in orlando florida the gatherings theme in  was chosen the gathering in  was originally planned to be held in new orleans louisiana but due to hurricane katrina the location was changed to orlando florida around  youth attend each gathering many christian bands and artists perform at gatherings church structureedit the lcms has a modified form of congregational polity this is different from some other lutheran bodies which have maintained episcopal polity however this is not considered to be a point of doctrine as the synod is in fellowship with some lutheran church bodies in europe that have an episcopal structure the corporate lcms is formally constituted of two types of members autonomous local congregations that qualify for membership by mutual agreement to adhere to stated principles and clergymen who qualify by similar means congregations hold legal title to their church buildings and other property and call hire and dismiss their own clergy much of the practical work of the lcms structure is as a free employment brokerage to bring the two together it also allows the congregations to work together on projects far too large for even a local consortium of congregations to accomplish such as foreign mission work synodedit the lcms as a whole is led by an ordained synodical president currently the rev dr matthew c harrison the president is chosen at a synodical convention a gathering of the two membership groups professional clergymen and lay representatives from the member congregations the convention is held every three years discussions of doctrine and policy take place at these events and elections are held to fill various synod positions the next synod convention will be in  local conventions within each circuit and district are held in the intervening years districtsedit main article districts of the lutheran church–missouri synod the entire synod is divided into districts usually corresponding to a specific geographic area as well as two nongeographical districts the english and the selc which were formed when the formerly separate english missouri synod and the slovak synod respectively merged with the formerly germanspeaking missouri synod each district is led by an elected district president who must be an ordained clergyman most district presidencies are fulltime positions but there are a few exceptions in which the district president also serves as a parish pastor the districts are subdivided into circuits each of which is led by a circuit counselor who is an ordained pastor from one of the member congregations districts are roughly analogous to dioceses in other christian communities congregationsedit peace lutheran church built  near baldwin wisconsin congregations are served by fulltime professional clergy the lcms is congregationalist with regard to polity organizationsedit in addition to its two seminaries the lcms operates ten universities known as the concordia university system among the lcmss other auxiliary organizations are the lutheran laymens league now known as lutheran hour ministries which conducts outreach ministries including the lutheran hour radio program and the lutheran womens missionary league the synod also operates concordia publishing house through which it publishes the official periodical of the lcms the lutheran witness relationship with other lutheran bodiesedit maintaining its position as a confessional church body emphasizing the importance of full agreement in the teachings of the bible the lcms is not associated with ecumenical organizations such as the national council of churches the national association of evangelicals the world council of churches or the lutheran world federation it is however a member of the international lutheran council made up of over  lutheran churches worldwide that support the confessional doctrines of the bible and the book of concord at the  convention the delegates voted to establish altar and pulpit fellowship with the american association of lutheran churches aalc although its strongly conservative views on theology and ethics might seem to make the lcms politically compatible with protestant evangelicals and fundamentalists in the us the lcms largely eschews political activity partly out of concerns to keep the denomination untainted with potential heresies and also because of its strict understanding of the lutheran distinction between the two kingdoms see above which repudiates the primarily calvinist presuppositions about the totalizing rule of god that informs much if not most of us evangelical understanding of politics and christianity however both lcms and evangelicals share the common belief that life begins and should be protected by law since conception the lcms is distinguished from the wisconsin evangelical lutheran synod wels by three main theological beliefs the biblical understanding of fellowship the lcms believes in a distinction between the altar pulpit fellowship and other manifestations of christian fellowship ie a prayer fellowship the wels does not the doctrine of the ministry the lcms believes that the pastoral office is divinely established but all other offices are human institutions and hence are not divinely established the wels believes that the ministry of the word is divinely established and that congregations and the synod may choose the forms of public ministry they wish to use the role of women in the church although both the lcms and wels agree that scripture reserves the pastoral office for men the wels also believes that scripture forbids womens suffrage in the congregation respondents to the pew research centers us religious landscape survey of  included members of lcms and the evangelical

the missouri synod emerged from several communities of german lutheran immigrants during the s and s in indiana ohio and michigan isolated germans in the dense forests of the american frontier were brought together and ministered to by missionary f c d wyneken a movement of confessional lutherans under martin stephan created a community in perry county missouri and st louis missouri in michigan and ohio missionaries sent by wilhelm löhe ministered to scattered congregations and founded german lutheran communities in frankenmuth michigan and the saginaw valley of michigan the saxon immigrationedit main article saxon lutheran immigration  in the thcentury german kingdom of saxony lutheran pastor martin stephan and many of his followers found themselves increasingly at odds with the rationalism christian ecumenism and the prospect of a forced unionism of the lutheran church with the reformed church in the neighboring kingdom of prussia the prussian union of  put in place what they considered nonlutheran communion and baptismal doctrine and practice in order to freely practice their christian faith in accordance with the lutheran confessions outlined in the book of concord stephan and between  and  other saxon lutherans left for the united states in november  their ships arrived between december   and january   in new orleans with one ship lost at sea most of the remaining immigrants left almost immediately with the first group arriving in st louis on january   the final group led by stephan remained in new orleans for ten days possibly to wait for the passengers of the lost ship amalia the immigrants ultimately settled in perry county missouri and in and around st louis stephan was initially the bishop of the new settlement but he soon became embroiled in charges of corruption and sexual misconduct with members of the congregation and was expelled from the settlement leaving c f w walther as the leader of the colony during this period there was considerable debate within the settlement over the proper status of the church in the new world whether it was a new church or whether it remained within the lutheran hierarchy in germany walthers view that they could consider themselves a new church prevailed foundingedit st pauls in chicago where the first meeting of the missouri synod was held old lutheran free church leader friedrich august brünn sent about  men to serve as pastors in the missouri synod on april   twelve pastors representing  german lutheran congregations met in chicago illinois and founded a new church body the german evangelical lutheran synod of missouri ohio and other states walther became the fledgling denominations first president in its early days the synod was conservative on a number of issues following walthers lead it strongly opposed humanism and religious syncretism he also advocated practicing church fellowship with only those lutheran congregations and synods who were in complete doctrinal agreement with the missouri synod under the leadership of its second president f c d wyneken the missouri synod poured much effort into caring for german immigrants helping them find a home among other germans building churches and parochial schools and providing pastors and teachers to serve in them as a result the new synod grew quickly during the th century reaching  members by its fiftieth anniversary in  in  it joined the wisconsin ohio norwegian minnesota and illinois synods other conservative lutheran bodies in forming the evangelical lutheran synodical conference of north america english transition and mergersedit as one scholar has explained the overwhelming evidence from internal documents of these missouri synod churches and particularly their schools indicates that the germanamerican school was a bilingual one much perhaps a whole generation or more earlier than  and that the majority of the pupils may have been englishdominant bilinguals from the early s on until the united states involvement in the first and second world wars the older members of the synod remained overwhelmingly german in their language but younger members had increasingly switched to english the antigerman sentiment during the wars hastened the americanization of the church and caused many churches to add english services and in some cases drop german services entirely during the years of language transition the synods membership continued to grow until by  the synod had grown to over  million members franz pieper june   – june   in  the church body shortened its name from evangelical lutheran synod of missouri ohio and other states to the present one the lutheran church–missouri synod on january   the national evangelical lutheran church an historically finnishamerican lutheran church merged with the lcms in  the synod of evangelical lutheran churches an historically slovakamerican church also merged with the lcms forming the selc district beginning in the s the lcms became somewhat friendlier to the more liberal lutheran bodies despite the opposition of the other members of the synodical conference this culminated in the break up of the synodical conference in  six years later the lcms formed the lutheran council in the united states of america lcusa with several moderatetoliberal lutheran bodies however with the election of j a o preus ii as its president in  the lcms began a sharp turn towards a more conservative direction a dispute over the use of the historicalcritical method for biblical interpretation led to the suspension of john tietjen as president of concordia seminary in response many of the faculty and students left the seminary and formed seminex concordia seminary in exile which took up residence at the nearby eden theological seminary in suburban st louis in  about  of the congregations supporting seminex left the synod to form the association of evangelical lutheran churches which became part of the evangelical lutheran church in america in  the lcms pulled out of lcusa shortly after the aelc schism only a few years after the organizations formation the entire controversy marked an instance of a conservative religious body resisting theological change rather than incorporating its tenets something relatively rare among american religious bodies with the only other analogous scenario being the fundamentalist resurgence in the southern baptist convention from the late s to the early s the lcms also oversaw an extensive roster of congregations in canada until  when the canadian component became a separate and autonomous organization lutheran churchcanada however this was an administrative and not theological division and the two groups still share close ties a small number of ontario and quebec churches remain within the lcms beliefsedit doctrinal sourcesedit one of the signature teachings of the lutheran reformation is the teaching named sola scriptura—scripture alone the missouri synod believes that the bible is the only standard by which church teachings can be judged it also holds that scripture is explained and interpreted by the book of concord—a series of confessions of faith composed by lutherans in the th century missouri synod pastors and congregations agree to teach in harmony with the book of concord because it teaches and faithfully explains the word of god not based on its own authority alone since the missouri synod is a confessional church body its ordained and commissioned ministers of religion are sworn by their oaths of ordination or installation or both to interpret the sacred scriptures according to the book of concord its ordained and commissioned ministers of religion are asked to honor and uphold other official teachings of the synod meaning to abide by act and teach in accordance with but are not sworn to believe confess and teach them as correct interpretations of the sacred scriptures the missouri synod also teaches biblical inerrancy the teaching that bible is inspired by god and is without error for this reason they reject much—if not all—of modern liberal scholarship franz august otto piepers brief

fellowship charismatic revival alliance of renewal churches  lutheranism portal v t e salvationedit the missouri synod believes that justification comes from god by divine grace alone through faith alone on account of christ alone it teaches that jesus is the focus of the entire bible and that faith in him alone is the way to eternal salvation the synod rejects any attempt to attribute salvation to anything other than christs death and resurrection means of graceedit the synod teaches that the word of god both written and preached and the sacraments are means of grace through which the holy spirit gives the gift of gods grace creates faith in the hearts of individuals forgives sins for the sake of christs death on the cross and grants eternal life and salvation many missouri synod lutherans define a sacrament as an action instituted by jesus that combines a promise in gods word with a physical element although the synod holds no official definition for sacrament this means that some may disagree on the number of sacraments all agree that baptism and communion are sacraments confession and absolution is called a sacrament in the apology of the augsburg confession and so is also considered by many lutherans to be a sacrament because it was instituted by christ and has his promise of grace even though it is not tied to a physical element unlike calvinists lutherans agree that the means of grace are resistible this belief is based on numerous biblical references as discussed in the book of concord sacramental union and the eucharistedit regarding the eucharist the lcms rejects both the roman catholic doctrine of transubstantiation and the reformed teaching that the true body and blood of christ are not consumed with the consecrated bread and wine in the eucharist rather it believes in the doctrine of the sacramental union real presence that the body and blood of christ are truly present in with and under the elements of bread and wine or as the smalcald articles express this mystery of the sacrament of the altar we hold that the bread and wine in the supper are christs true body and blood it is occasionally reported that the lcms and other lutherans teach the doctrine of consubstantiation consubstantiation is generally rejected by lutherans and is explicitly rejected by the lcms as an attempt to define the holy mystery of christs presence eschatologyedit the missouri synod flatly rejects millennialism and considers itself amillennialist this means that they believe there will be no literal year visible earthly kingdom of jesus a view termed as realized millennialism in which the thousand years of rev – is taken figuratively as a reference to the time of christs reign as king from the day of his ascension hence the millennium is a present reality christs heavenly reign not a future hope for a rule of christ on earth after his return the parousia cf mt – mt  eph  col – law and gospeledit the lcms believes that the holy scriptures contain two crucial teachings—the law and the gospel the law is all those demands in the bible which must be obeyed in order to gain salvation however because all people are sinners it is impossible for people to completely obey the law therefore the law implies an inevitable consequence of gods wrath judgment and damnation the gospel on the other hand is the promise of free salvation from god to sinners the law condemns the gospel saves both the law and the gospel are gifts from god both are necessary the function of the law is to show people their sinful nature and drive them to the gospel in which the forgiveness of sin is promised for the sake of the death and resurrection of jesus christ the lcms holds that the old testament and the new testament both contain both law and gospel the old testament therefore is valuable to christians its teachings point forward in time to the cross of christ in the same way that the new testament points backward in time to the cross this lutheran doctrine was summarized by c f w walther in the proper distinction between law and gospel other doctrineedit antichristsedit the lcms holds that all false teachers who teach contrary to christs word are opponents of christ and insofar as they do so are antichrist the lcms does not teach nor has it ever taught that any individual pope as a person is to be identified with the antichrist however to the extent that the papacy continues to claim as official dogma the canons and decrees of the council of trent the lcms position is that the office of the papacy is the antichrist creationismedit the lcms officially supports literal creationism but does not have an official position on the precise age of the earth an official publication of the synod the well known brief statement of  states under the heading of creation we teach that god has created heaven and earth and that in the manner and in the space of time recorded in the holy scriptures especially gen  and  namely by his almighty creative word and in six days according to the recent  lcms synodical resolution a to commend preaching and teaching creation all lcms churches and educational institutions—including preschool through th grade universities and seminaries—are to teach creation from the biblical perspective the lcms website states that an individuals personal views regarding creation do not disqualify a person from being a member of the lcms freemasonryedit the missouri synod is opposed to freemasonry and its pastors and its laypeople are to avoid membership or participation in it baptism and other doctrineedit the lcms practices infant baptism based on acts – and other passages of scripture it also subscribes to the statement of faith found in the apostles creed the ten commandments and the lords prayer to be applicable to daily life these doctrines are emphasized in luthers small catechism practicesedit worship and musicedit the missouri synods original constitution stated that one of its purposes is to strive toward uniformity in practice while more recent changes to those documents also encourage responsible and doctrinally sound diversity the synod requires that hymns songs liturgies and practices be in harmony with the bible and book of concord worship in missouri synod congregations is generally thought of as orthodox and liturgical utilizing a printed order of service and hymnal and is typically accompanied by a pipe organ or piano the contents of lcms hymnals from the past such as the lutheran hymnal and lutheran worship and those of its newest hymnal lutheran service book highlight the synods unwavering stance towards more traditional styles of hymnody and liturgy more traditional lcms lutherans point to the lutheran confessions in their defense of liturgical worship towards the later parts of the twentieth century and up until present day some congregations have adopted a more progressive style of worship employing different styles such as contemporary christian music with guitars and praise bands and often display song lyrics onto screens instead of using hymnals while this shift in style challenges the traditionalism of hymnody that the lcms holds strongly the lcms has released a statement on worship admitting that the best of musical traditions both ancient and modern are embraced by the lutheran church in its worship with an emphasis on congregational singing reinforced by the choir reception of communionedit the lcms endorses the doctrine of close or closed communion—the policy of sharing the eucharist ordinarily only with those who are baptized and confirmed members of one of the congregations of the lutheran church–missouri synod or of a congregation of one of its sister churches with which it has formally declared altar and pulpit fellowship ie agreement in all articles of doctrine missouri synod congregations implement closed communion in various ways requiring conformity to official doctrine in various degrees usually visitors are asked to speak with the pastor before coming to that congregations altar for the first time most congregations invite those uneducated on the subject of the eucharist to join in the fellowship and receive a blessing instead of the body and blood of christ this is because as bonhoeffer emphasizes in his book life together christ comes to us and sustains us through community some congregations however do not implement the synods policy celebrating open communion and welcoming all to their altars the existence of such divergent practice of doctrine challenges the unity of the lcms ordinationedit ordination is seen as a public ceremony of recognition that a man has received and accepted a divine call and hence is considered to be in the office of the public ministry the treatise on the power and primacy of the pope agrees that ordination was nothing else than such a ratification of local elections by the people the lcms does not believe ordination is divinely instituted or an extension of an episcopal form of apostolic succession but sees the office grounded in the word and sacrament ministry of the gospel arguing that scripture makes no distinction between a presbyter priest and a bishop see treatise on the power and primacy of the pope paragraphs  citing st jerome the augsburg confession article xiv holds that no one is to preach teach or administer the sacraments without a regular call lcms pastors are generally required to have a fouryear bachelors degree in any discipline as well as a fouryear master of divinity degree which is usually obtained from one of these institutions concordia seminary in st louis or the concordia theological seminary in fort wayne indiana or at the two seminaries run by the lutheran church–canada candidates may earn their master of divinity degree at other seminaries but may then be required to take colloquy classes at either st louis or ft wayne seminary training includes classwork in historical theology biblical languages biblical greek and hebrew practical application education preaching and mission and doctrine the basic teachings and beliefs of the synod the missouri synod teaches that the ordination of women as clergy is contrary to scripture the issue of womens roles in the church body has continued to be a subject of debate within the synod during the cooperative clergy study project in the year   out of  lcms pastors surveyed stated that all clergy positions should be open to women while  disagreed congregations were permitted to enact female suffrage within missouri synod congregations in  and it was affirmed at the synods  convention that women may also serve in humanly established offices as long as those offices do not include any of the distinctive functions of the pastoral office thus in many congregations of the lcms women now serve as congregation president or chairperson etc this is the cause of contention within the lcms with some congregations utilizing women in public worship to read lessons and assist in the distribution of holy communion other traditional lutherans reject such practices as unbiblical with a minority of congregations continuing the historic practice of male suffrage similar to the wisconsin synod lcms national youth gatheringedit the national youth gathering is held every three years the most recent gathering took place from july –  in new orleans louisiana the theme for the  gathering was in christ alone the previous gathering took place in  in san antonio texas from july –  it was based on the theme live loved the  gathering in new orleans was based on the theme we believe in both  and  the lcms national youth gatherings were held at the orange county convention center in orlando florida the gatherings theme in  was chosen the gathering in  was originally planned to be held in new orleans louisiana but due to hurricane katrina the location was changed to orlando florida around  youth attend each gathering many christian bands and artists perform at gatherings church structureedit the lcms has a modified form of congregational polity this is different from some other lutheran bodies which have maintained episcopal polity however this is not considered to be a point of doctrine as the synod is in fellowship with some lutheran church bodies in europe that have an episcopal structure the corporate lcms is formally constituted of two types of members autonomous local congregations that qualify for membership by mutual agreement to adhere to stated principles and clergymen who qualify by similar means congregations hold legal title to their church buildings and other property and call hire and dismiss their own clergy much of the practical work of the lcms structure is as a free employment brokerage to bring the two together it also allows the congregations to work together on projects far too large for even a local consortium of congregations to accomplish such as foreign mission work synodedit the lcms as a whole is led by an ordained synodical president currently the rev dr matthew c harrison the president is chosen at a synodical convention a gathering of the two membership groups professional clergymen and lay representatives from the member congregations the convention is held every three years discussions of doctrine and policy take place at these events and elections are held to fill various synod positions the next synod convention will be in  local conventions within each circuit and district are held in the intervening years districtsedit main article districts of the lutheran church–missouri synod the entire synod is divided into districts usually corresponding to a specific geographic area as well as two nongeographical districts the english and the selc which were formed when the formerly separate english missouri synod and the slovak synod respectively merged with the formerly germanspeaking missouri synod each district is led by an elected district president who must be an ordained clergyman most district presidencies are fulltime positions but there are a few exceptions in which the district president also serves as a parish pastor the districts are subdivided into circuits each of which is led by a circuit counselor who is an ordained pastor from one of the member congregations districts are roughly analogous to dioceses in other christian communities congregationsedit peace lutheran church built  near baldwin wisconsin congregations are served by fulltime professional clergy the lcms is congregationalist with regard to polity organizationsedit in addition to its two seminaries the lcms operates ten universities known as the concordia university system among the lcmss other auxiliary organizations are the lutheran laymens league now known as lutheran hour ministries which conducts outreach ministries including the lutheran hour radio program and the lutheran womens missionary league the synod also operates concordia publishing house through which it publishes the official periodical of the lcms the lutheran witness relationship with other lutheran bodiesedit maintaining its position as a confessional church body emphasizing the importance of full agreement in the teachings of the bible the lcms is not associated with ecumenical organizations such as the national council of churches the national association of evangelicals the world council of churches or the lutheran world federation it is however a member of the international lutheran council made up of over  lutheran churches worldwide that support the confessional doctrines of the bible and the book of concord at the  convention the delegates voted to establish altar and pulpit fellowship with the american association of lutheran churches aalc although its strongly conservative views on theology and ethics might seem to make the lcms politically compatible with protestant evangelicals and fundamentalists in the us the lcms largely eschews political activity partly out of concerns to keep the denomination untainted with potential heresies and also because of its strict understanding of the lutheran distinction between the two kingdoms see above which repudiates the primarily calvinist presuppositions about the totalizing rule of god that informs much if not most of us evangelical understanding of politics and christianity however both lcms and evangelicals share the common belief that life begins and should be protected by law since conception the lcms is distinguished from the wisconsin evangelical lutheran synod wels by three main theological beliefs the biblical understanding of fellowship the lcms believes in a distinction between the altar pulpit fellowship and other manifestations of christian fellowship ie a prayer fellowship the wels does not the doctrine of the ministry the lcms believes that the pastoral office is divinely established but all other offices are human institutions and hence are not divinely established the wels believes that the ministry of the word is divinely established and that congregations and the synod may choose the forms of public ministry they wish to use the role of women in the church although both the lcms and wels agree that scripture reserves the pastoral office for men the wels also believes that scripture forbids womens suffrage in the congregation respondents to the pew research centers us religious landscape survey of  included members of lcms and the evangelical
