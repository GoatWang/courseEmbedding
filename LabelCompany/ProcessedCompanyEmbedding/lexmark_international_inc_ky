recipe for her orgasm featured when it comes to the female orgasm women want them men want to provide them and yet surprisingly few are sure on how to achieve them although technique is part of it there are many other factors that come into play when it comes to achieving an orgasm find out how you and your partner can get the most out of your intimate moments as you both relax and ease your way into orgasmic bliss  it all starts with presexcontrary to popular belief the female orgasm isn’t mechanical able to be programmed at the drop of a dime while sex for men are usually able to disassociate sexual desires from their feelings whereas most women are more likely to be aroused by her partner’s desire for her surroundings and a relaxing atmosphere that encourages affection  for most women feeling wanted and appreciated by their partners can have a positive reaction on their sex life and allow them to become more respondent to their partner’s advances some experts also suggest that the presex preparation can begin long before the clothes come off taking her on a date cooking her dinner or helping her around the house for example all help her unwind and feel cared for which will then spill over in to the bedroom think of it as ‘subconscious foreplay’ add foreplaymany women like much longer foreplay than their partners realize this may therefore be linked to a subconscious feeling by the woman that she wants to feel affection and pleasure by her partner rather than just feeling that he is in a hurry to reach his own climax women like to experience different things when it comes to foreplay so try to mix it up with your partner and don’t be afraid to ask her what she wants and what feels good for her many studies suggest that oral sex is the most effective for women to climax so perhaps start with your fingers and then move down with your lips the closer you think she is getting to orgasm do try other things too if oral sex doesn’t do it for her gently touching and kissing all the female erogenous zones – legs breasts neck and ears – can really heat things up too be sensitive and responsive when you get a good reaction to something  keep going go longer according to the kinsey institute while  of men believe that their partners had an orgasm during their last sexual encounter only  women reported actually experiencing one to combat this when you are having sex opt for positions that are less stimulating for him and more effective for her spooning for example is a very romantic position meaning that the woman can feel her partner’s arms around her feeling safe and comfortable which should help her relax into it and bring her closer to orgasm this position also has a far gentler pace and shallower penetration than say the missionary which means he is less likely to get aroused too quickly – so will hopefully be more in sync with her in addition to incorporating sex positions that help focus on slowing things down add ky duration™ lubricant to help prolong the time until ejaculation while giving you the control to stay in the moment longer mix it upa lot of couples tend to have the same routine when it comes to foreplay and sex therefore sometimes orgasms are harder to achieve as the woman generally knows what’s going to happen next if however you try to vary from your routine perhaps trying a new position or introducing a sex toy then both partners will feel a heightened sense of excitement thus making climax easier also switching the location of your embrace can be helpful too  if you normally only have sex in the bedroom try moving to the kitchen or the bathroom for a change and enjoy the sensation of doing something a little different together sexual performance anxiety how to overcome in the bedroom featured sexual performance anxiety affects almost all men at some point in their sex lives however that should come as no surprise for most sex is both an emotional and physical act however stress on the body can heavily impact the way the body responds to intimacy with the help of  tips you can learn how to reduce performance anxieties for a calmer more fulfilling sex life stop thinking of sex as a ‘performance’some men view sex as a demonstration of their manhood  they think its all about how ‘big’ they should be and how well they perform this preoccupation with performance can be a problem when it comes to anxiety rather than a romantic encounter sex becomes goal orientated by changing the psyche you can improve the situation and reduce the need to panic sex should be based on connecting with your partner and providing an atmosphere where you two can physically and mentally connect address any anxietieswhen experiencing anxiety the body goes into a heightened state of alert causing difficulty for your partner to maintain an erection however sexual anxiety can be addressed through a number of relaxation techniques whether you decide to partake in regular workouts or want to improve your breathing through yoga these activities can help decrease blood pressure and muscle tension in the body making for a better and more improved performance in the bedroom communicationcommunication is vital in any relationship but all the more so to address sexual anxieties talking with your partner can improve your connection while allowing you both the opportunity to discuss your fears and concerns dont be afraid to reveal your desires and fantasies while remaining open to your partners feedback and suggestions being clear on what you both need want and expect can prevent you from making it a bigger issue than it needs to be clear your mindsex is undoubtedly important in a loving relationship however worrying or over thinking about outside problems can inhibit your performance instead focus on kissing cuddling and holding your partner by relaxing and staying in the moment you are able to enjoy each more making it a more pleasurable experience for a better time with your partner let sex happen spontaneously preferably without any forward planning as this can help clear your mind and increase passion ky ® duration  is another great addition to add to your bedroom routine for a longer more pleasurable connection with your partner  lifestyle changescertain lifestyle changes can help to address anxiety issues for example eating a balanced diet getting more sleep and partaking in regular exercise can help to combat sexual concerns however the abuse of drugs and alcohol can also have longterm detrimental physiological impacts on performance and should be avoided for some these can be a short term fix for relaxation but over time they can in fact lead to greater anxiety and further complicate problems by eliminating these substances it can help improve your general health for a more substantial and better sex life  ways to get more sleep featured researchers have uncovered that inefficient sleep quantity is associated with increased risk of obesity cardiovascular disease and diabetes to help maximize the amount of sleep you get each night incorporate a healthy sleep routine this can make the difference between a restlessness night and a peaceful slumber here are  simple tips to get the most out of your sleep routine remove any distractionsa study published in the journal nature revealed that artificial blue light emitted from electronic devices such as your smart phone or tablet can activate neurons within the brain that can prevent you from feeling tired light can trigger an increase in heart rate body temperature and brain activity level therefore blue light that is emitted by electronic gadgets can disrupt your melatonin levels to get the most restful sleep shut off your devices an hour before sleep if you are not tired or struggle with sleeping read a book or spend time with your partner avoid caffeinewhile caffeine cannot replace sleep it can temporarily make one feel more alert by blocking sleepinducing chemicals in the brain and increasing adrenaline production most people consume coffee or soda during the day and caffeine can stay in the body for several hours long after a drink was had therefore it is best to limit the amount of caffeine you drink for a minimum of six hours prior to bedtime create a sleepinducing environmentif you toss and turn most nights a dark quiet and cool environment can help improve sleep any source of light be it an overhead lamp or something as small as a digital clock can inhibit the secretion of melatonin which is the hormone that promotes sleep your body temperature naturally drops while you sleep so cooling down your bedroom can help speed up the process and allow you to doze off quicker however as your body transitions through different stages of sleep any unexpected noise can disrupt your sleep causing you to have more shallow cycles to prevent this limit any outside noises by playing soft calming music have a patternkeep your mealtime and bedtime consistent even on the weekends as your body establishes a routine whether it’s getting to bed at  pm or listening to relaxing music before you fall asleep keeping a regular schedule not only increases the amount of sleep you can receive each night it can also improve the quality ensuring you feel alert and refreshed the next morning become more

the total relevant market opportunity of these markets combined in  was approximately  billion lexmark management believes that the total relevant distributed laser printing and imaging market opportunity was table of contents approximately  billion in  including printing hardware supplies and related services this opportunity includes printers and multifunction devices as well as a declining base of copiers and fax machines that are increasingly being integrated into multifunction devices based on industry information lexmark management believes that the overall distributed printing market declined in the low single digit percentage points in  the distributed printing industry is expected to experience low single digit declining revenue overall over the next few years but continued growth is expected in mps smart mfps and workgroup color laser printing products which are all areas of focus for lexmark based on industry analysts forecasts mps and fleet solutions are projected to continue to experience approximately  annual revenue growth rates over the next several years and the relevant content and process management software markets that lexmark participates in are projected to grow in high single digit percentage points annually over the next several years in  the total relevant content and process management software market was approximately  billion excluding related professional services however management believes the total addressable market is significantly larger due to relatively low penetration of content and process management software solutions worldwide market trends driving longterm growth include continued penetration of color and graphics output in businesses advancements in electronic movement of information driving a continued shift in pages away from centralized commercial printing and document scanning to distributed printing and multichannel capture by end users when and where it is convenient to do so including via smart mfps mobile devices and web portals continued convergence between printers scanners copiers and fax machines into single integrated multifunction and allinone devices increasing ability of multifunction printing devices and mobile devices to integrate into business process workflow solutions and enterprise content management systems continued digitization of information and the ability to electronically store and distribute this information driving the explosive growth of unstructured digital information such as office documents emails photographs audio and video files customer desire to have a third party expert manage their printing and document output environment ongoing emphasis on improving business process efficiency and driving costs out of business organizations by better managing enterprise content and associated processes increasing need to capture manage and access content from any location via any webenabled device including mobile devices and smart mfps to streamline and optimize process workflows while ensuring information security growing desire to unify structured data in business systems with unstructured paper and digital content to make the unstructured content more valuable and actionable within business processes and increasing need in the healthcare industry to unify structured patient data that is now typically stored in an emr system with unstructured content that includes medical imaging studies and other patient documents and content such as lab reports and physicians notes to enable easy unified access by clinical staff and referring physicians across the healthcare continuum to improve clinical and business outcomes as a result of these market trends lexmark has growth opportunities in monochrome and color laser printers and mfps mps as well as fleet management solutions ecm bpm domccm that includes case management electronic signature process analytics information and application integration intelligent content capture and data extraction enterprise search software and medical imaging vna software products and solutions color and mfp devices continue to represent a more significant portion of the laser printing market the companys management believes that these trends will continue industry pricing pressure is partially offset by the tendency of customers to purchase higher value color and mfp devices and optional paper handling and finishing features customers are also purchasing connected smart mfps and content and process management software solutions and services to optimize their documentrelated processes and infrastructure in order to improve productivity and cost this includes solutions to enable mobile printing and content captureaccess while profit margins on printers and mfps have been negatively affected by competitive pricing pressure supplies sales are higher margin and recurring in general as the printing and imaging market matures and traditional printer and copierbased product markets continue to converge the companys management expects competitive pressures to continue table of contents lexmarks dot matrix printers include mature products that require little ongoing investment the company expects that the market for these products will continue to decline and has implemented a strategy to continue to offer highquality products while managing cost to maximize cash flow and profit the content and process management software and services markets serve business customers these markets include solutions for capturing all types of unstructured information such as hardcopy documents and forms photographs emails images video audio and faxes and then intelligently indexing archiving and routing this information to streamline and

processes and enable the assembly of content into meaningful communications internally and with their customers and partners management sees growth opportunities in largeglobal enterprises with a distributed workforce in organizations that are seeking to optimize their contentrelated infrastructure and reduce costs and in functional areas where workers rely on mobile devices for productivity the demand for content process management and domccm solutions is strong in developed and emerging markets alike representing a considerable growth opportunity for enterprise software lexmarks products are already installed in geographies around the world and management believes this global customer base serves as an impetus for additional installations for enterprise software outside of north america customers continue to purchase solutions that result in greater efficiency and productivity in their various lines of business and back office operations business systems such as enterprise resource planning erp electronic medical records emr and customer relationship management crm represent a mature market and remain vital applications but do not satisfy an organizations enterprise content and process management needs the company expects organizations to continue to look to ecm bpm and domccm solutions to complete their enterprise information infrastructure increasing the value of their core business system investments and leading to gains in efficiency challenges and risks in recent years lexmark and its principal competitors many of which have significantly greater financial marketing andor technological resources than the company have regularly lowered prices on printers and are expected to continue to do so other challenges and risks faced by lexmark include new product announcements by iss principal competitors can have and in the past have had a material impact on the companys financial results with the convergence of traditional printer and copier markets major laser competitors now include traditional copier companies the company expects competition will continue to intensify as the ecm and bpm markets consolidate the company sees other competitors and the potential for new entrants into the ecm and bpm markets possibly having an impact on the companys strategy to expand in these markets lexmark expects that as it competes with larger competitors the company may attract more frequent challenges both legal and commercial including claims of possible intellectual property infringement refill remanufactured clones counterfeits and other compatible alternatives for some of iss toner and ink cartridges are available and compete with iss supplies business however these alternatives may result in inconsistent quality and reliability as the installed base of laser and inkjet products matures the company expects competitive supplies activity to increase historically the company has not experienced significant supplies pricing pressure but if supplies pricing was to come under significant pressure the companys financial results could be materially adversely affected global economic uncertainty difficulties in the financial markets and unfavorable movements in currency exchange rates could impact the companys future operating results changes in printing behavior driven by adoption of electronic processes andor use of mobile devices such as tablets and smart phones by businesses could result in a reduction in printing which could adversely impact consumption of supplies table of contents refer to the

the company additionally refer to the section entitled risk factors in item a which is incorporated herein by reference for a further discussion of factors that could impact the companys operating

advancing and growing the companys content and process management solutions business internationally refer to the section entitled strategy in item  which is incorporated herein by reference for a further discussion of the companys strategies and initiatives critical accounting policies and estimates lexmarks discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the companys consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses as well as disclosures regarding contingencies lexmark bases its estimates on historical experience market conditions and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions refer to part ii item  note  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for the summary of significant accounting policies an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially impact the financial statements the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition revenue recognition may be impacted by the companys ability to estimate sales incentives and expected returns table of contents lexmark records reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including special pricing agreements promotions and other volumebased incentives at the later of the date of revenue recognition or the date the sales incentive is offered estimated reductions in revenue are based upon historical trends and other known factors at the time of sale lexmark also records estimated reductions to revenue for price protection which it provides to substantially all of its distributor and reseller customers the amount of price protection is limited based on the amount of dealers and resellers inventory on hand including intransit inventory as of the date of the price change if market conditions were to decline lexmark may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings or reduce prices possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered the company also records estimated reductions to revenue at the time of sale related to its customers right to return product estimated reductions in revenue are based upon historical trends of actual product returns as well as the companys assessment of its products in the channel provisions for specific returns from large customers are also recorded as necessary multiple element arrangements the company enters into multiple element agreements with customers which may involve the provisions of hardware supplies separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance services and other professional services installation maintenance and enhanced warranty services these arrangements may involve upfront purchase or lease of hardware products with services and supplies provided per contract terms or as needed lexmark also enters into multiple element agreements with customers that contain software and related services as well as contracts that include a combination of printing products and related services and software licenses and related services furthermore some contracts may include nonstandard terms and conditions as such significant contract interpretation can be required to determine the appropriate accounting for some arrangements the company uses its best estimate of selling price besp when allocating the transaction price for many of its product and service deliverables as permitted under the accounting guidance for multiple element arrangements when sufficient    feb   c  cybernet data systems inc all rights reserved more from marketwatch more coverage the dark side of cruises if you’re reading this you have a  chance of

our expert instruction to the test… latest articles beyond intercourse a recipe for her orgasm featured when it comes to the female orgasm women want them men want to provide them and yet surprisingly few are sure on how to achieve them although technique is part of it there are many other factors that come into play when it comes to achieving an orgasm find out how you and your partner can get the most out of your intimate moments as you both relax and ease your way into orgasmic bliss  it all starts with presexcontrary to popular belief the female orgasm isn’t mechanical able to be programmed at the drop of a dime while sex for men are usually able to disassociate sexual desires from their feelings whereas most women are more likely to be aroused by her partner’s desire for her surroundings and a relaxing atmosphere that encourages affection  for most women feeling wanted and appreciated by their partners can have a positive reaction on their sex life and allow them to become more respondent to their partner’s advances some experts also suggest that the presex preparation can begin long before the clothes come off taking her on a date cooking her dinner or helping her around the house for example all help her unwind and feel cared for which will then spill over in to the bedroom think of it as ‘subconscious foreplay’ add foreplaymany women like much longer foreplay than their partners realize this may therefore be linked to a subconscious feeling by the woman that she wants to feel affection and pleasure by her partner rather than just feeling that he is in a hurry to reach his own climax women like to experience different things when it comes to foreplay so try to mix it up with your partner and don’t be afraid to ask her what she wants and what feels good for her many studies suggest that oral sex is the most effective for women to climax so perhaps start with your fingers and then move down with your lips the closer you think she is getting to orgasm do try other things too if oral sex doesn’t do it for her gently touching and kissing all the female erogenous zones – legs breasts neck and ears – can really heat things up too be sensitive and responsive when you get a good reaction to something  keep going go longer according to the kinsey institute while  of men believe that their partners had an orgasm during their last sexual encounter only  women reported actually experiencing one to combat this when you are having sex opt for positions that are less stimulating for him and more effective for her spooning for example is a very romantic position meaning that the woman can feel her partner’s arms around her feeling safe and comfortable which should help her relax into it and bring her closer to orgasm this position also has a far gentler pace and shallower penetration than say the missionary which means he is less likely to get aroused too quickly – so will hopefully be more in sync with her in addition to incorporating sex positions that help focus on slowing things down add ky duration™ lubricant to help prolong the time until ejaculation while giving you the control to stay in the moment longer mix it upa lot of couples tend to have the same routine when it comes to foreplay and sex therefore sometimes orgasms are harder to achieve as the woman generally knows what’s going to happen next if however you try to vary from your routine perhaps trying a new position or introducing a sex toy then both partners will feel a heightened sense of excitement thus making climax easier also switching the location of your embrace can be helpful too  if you normally only have sex in the bedroom try moving to the kitchen or the bathroom for a change and enjoy the sensation of doing something a little different together sexual performance anxiety how to overcome in the bedroom featured sexual performance anxiety affects almost all men at some point in their sex lives however that should come as no surprise for most sex is both an emotional and physical act however stress on the body can heavily impact the way the body responds to intimacy with the help of  tips you can learn how to reduce performance anxieties for a calmer more fulfilling sex life stop thinking of sex as a ‘performance’some men view sex as a demonstration of their manhood  they think its all about how ‘big’ they should be and how well they perform this preoccupation with performance can be a problem when it comes to anxiety rather than a romantic encounter sex becomes goal orientated by changing the psyche you can improve the situation and reduce the need to panic sex should be based on connecting with your partner and providing an atmosphere where you two can physically and mentally connect address any anxietieswhen experiencing anxiety the body goes into a heightened state of alert causing difficulty for your partner to maintain an erection however sexual anxiety can be addressed through a number of relaxation techniques whether you decide to partake in regular workouts or want to improve your breathing through yoga these activities can help decrease blood pressure and muscle tension in the body making for a better and more improved performance in the bedroom communicationcommunication is vital in any relationship but all the more so to address sexual anxieties talking with your partner can improve your connection while allowing you both the opportunity to discuss your fears and concerns dont be afraid to reveal your desires and fantasies while remaining open to your partners feedback and suggestions being clear on what you both need want and expect can prevent you from making it a bigger issue than it needs to be clear your mindsex is undoubtedly important in a loving relationship however worrying or over thinking about outside problems can inhibit your performance instead focus on kissing cuddling and holding your partner by relaxing and staying in the moment you are able to enjoy each more making it a more pleasurable experience for a better time with your partner let sex happen spontaneously preferably without any forward planning as this can help clear your mind and increase passion ky ® duration  is another great addition to add to your bedroom routine for a longer more pleasurable connection with your partner  lifestyle changescertain lifestyle changes can help to address anxiety issues for example eating a balanced diet getting more sleep and partaking in regular exercise can help to combat sexual concerns however the abuse of drugs and alcohol can also have longterm detrimental physiological impacts on performance and should be avoided for some these can be a short term fix for relaxation but over time they can in fact lead to greater anxiety and further complicate problems by eliminating these substances it can help improve your general health for a more substantial and better sex life  ways to get more sleep featured researchers have uncovered that inefficient sleep quantity is associated with increased risk of obesity cardiovascular disease and diabetes to help maximize the amount of sleep you get each night incorporate a healthy sleep routine this can make the difference between a restlessness night and a peaceful slumber here are  simple tips to get the most out of your sleep routine remove any distractionsa study published in the journal nature revealed that artificial blue light emitted from electronic devices such as your smart phone or tablet can activate neurons within the brain that can prevent you from feeling tired light can trigger an increase in heart rate body temperature and brain activity level therefore blue light that is emitted by electronic gadgets can disrupt your melatonin levels to get the most restful sleep shut off your devices an hour before sleep if you are not tired or struggle with sleeping read a book or spend time with your partner avoid caffeinewhile caffeine cannot replace sleep it can temporarily make one feel more alert by blocking sleepinducing chemicals in the brain and increasing adrenaline production most people consume coffee or soda during the day and caffeine can stay in the body for several hours long after a drink was had therefore it is best to limit the amount of caffeine you drink for a minimum of six hours prior to bedtime create a sleepinducing environmentif you toss and turn most nights a dark quiet and cool environment can help improve sleep any source of light be it an overhead lamp or something as small as a digital clock can inhibit the secretion of melatonin which is the hormone that promotes sleep your body temperature naturally drops while you sleep so cooling down your bedroom can help speed up the process and allow you to doze off quicker however as your body transitions through different stages of sleep any unexpected noise can disrupt your sleep causing you to have more shallow cycles to prevent this limit any outside noises by playing soft calming music have a patternkeep your mealtime and bedtime consistent even on the weekends as your body establishes a routine whether it’s getting to bed at  pm or listening to relaxing music before you fall asleep keeping a regular schedule not only increases the amount of sleep you can receive each night it can also improve the quality ensuring you feel alert and refreshed the next morning become more activeexercising three times a week for  minutes can have a noticeable impact on the quality of your sleep while also improving your overall fitness exercise is a great way to get your heart pumping while arousing the nervous system to help achieve and maintain sleep however try to avoid strenuous exercise in the evening and before bedtime as this can disrupt your sleep tips

than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this

may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be

original cartridges remanufactured cartridges compatible cartridges description oem stands for original equipment manufacturer meaning the cartridge was made by the same company that made your printer original brand cartridges are very reliable and sometimes the only option if your printer is new to market or uncommon remanufactured ink is a genuine brand cartridge that has gone through one cycle of use after use the cartridge is recycled acquired by a remanufacturing facility and put through a rigorous professional refurbishing process during the refurbishing process the cartridge is disassembled thoroughly cleaned and tested for quality its then carefully refilled tested again and brought back to life buying remanufactured prevents one less cartridge from ending up in a landfill a compatible cartridge is a brand new ink cartridge built by a manufacturer other than your printer its like buying the generic version of the genuine brand most are uniquely designed to differentiate from genuine cartridges despite any structural difference you may notice the cartridge will still fit in your machine and print a full yield just like the original brand price factors many printer manufacturers follow the razorandblades business model which may result in higher priced genuine cartridges remanufactured ink is much cheaper than the original brand ink its far more cost effective to refurbish a previously used cartridge than create a new oem from scratch compatible ink is much cheaper than the original brand compatible suppliers dont have to worry about the additional costs that hinder oems like new printers or firmware which lets them keep prices low quality original cartridges work extremely well and are covered under a warranty by the printer manufacturer high quality remanufactured ink will match the quality of the original but not all remanufactured ink is created equal make sure you buy from a reputable supplier in order to get the absolute best results high quality compatible ink will match the quality of the original but not all compatible ink is created equal make sure you buy from a reputable supplier in order to get the absolute best results whats the difference between ink and toner cartridges ink cartridges toner cartridges printer type work with inkjet printers work with laser printers material liquid ink dry powder how it works inkjet printers use a series of nozzles that spray tiny drops of ink directly on the print suface laser toner printers use static electricity and heat to bond dry toner powder to a page commonly used by casual home users small business and photographers large businesses and schools number of pages you can print a cartridges page yield is the estimated number of pages you can print page yield is based on  page coverage this means that the quoted page yield is based upon printed pages where only  of the page has been imprinted with ink for example a short memo has approximately  coverage if you have a cartridge that has a yield of  pages it can print  pages of that short memo if you are printing letters photos or graphics your coverage will vary greatly and your page yield will drop significantly cartridge warranty and shelf life most ink and toner cartridges include a warranty or best by date on their box remanufactured and compatible ink cartridges can last  months unopened and toner cartridges can last up to  years cartridge care and storage only open a cartridge when you need it opened cartridges will eventually dry out especially if the protective tape or clip has been removed if you have an open ink cartridge around and would like to try and prevent it from drying out place it nozzle side up in a plastic airtight tub if your cartridge came with protective tape or a clip reapply both before storing place a damp cloth or paper towel in the tub next to the cartridge and keep it stored in a cool dark place remanufactured lexmark inkjet cartridge c   black ink  recommend
