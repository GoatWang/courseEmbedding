milbury wang “assumed that nobody could put a goal past a sumo wrestler” milbury said that “he was a man of his word a guy who desperately wanted to keep the team on the island” wang initially had a willingness to spend money with the goal of making the islanders competitive however recent team payrolls have decreased as the islanders failed to reach the playoffs between the – and – seasons wang hired neil smith as the islanders general manager during the  stanley cup finals but  days later smith was fired due to his unwillingness to adhere to the management by committee style of wang wang then gave the job to garth snow who subsequently retired from his playing position as the teams backup goaltender wang said that philosophical differences were the basis for firing smith this series

it himself as part of the lighthouse project in may  wang along with nassau county started an day campaign for a  million bond to fund a new arena for the islanders on august   the proposal was

first enterprise software company to provide multiplatform products foreshadowing its ongoing emphasis on compatibility and integration by  computer associates became the first software company to reach  billion in revenues wang’s tenure as ceo of computer associates was marked by rapid growth frequently as a result of strict hiring practices and high expectations for executives of acquired companies nearly all of cas managers were promoted from within so very few acquired managers were kept newly hired salespeople had some sales experience but not in software it was unusual for a technician to be considered for sales because cas training program was geared toward products instead of professional selling the passfail demarcation was sharp so perceived inadequate sales performance meant termination all told wang engaged in several dozen acquisitions and those acquired facilities were repopulated with ca employees he was also known for his commitment to a familyoriented management style and for promoting several women to management positions in  three years after cas founding wang had installed his older brother tony a onetime corporate lawyer as

refusal to override his sense of familial loyalty to avoid the appearance of nepotism in  wang had initiated a  billion hostile takeover for the shares of computer sciences corporation csc the washington post reported csc management’s “concern” about the tender offer by alluding to cas ties to foreigners it was a pointed reference to wangs origin and that certain chinese government institutions as well as those in the us europe and elsewhere were ca clients the suggestion was that becoming linked with ca would jeopardize cscs contracts with us government agencies blaming what in his view was a witchhunt with racial motivations wang dropped the tender offer in  a classaction lawsuit accused wang then president kumar and cofounder artzt of wrongly reporting more than  billion in revenue in its    and  fiscal april through march years in order to artificially inflate the stock price a previous stock option set in  specified that a certain number of shares would vest when computer associates shares sustained a target price the benchmark was met in  and the three executives combined received nearly  billion in computer associates stock with wang himself netting  million he had already been the highest paid ceo in the us for the past four years since then at least four other classaction suits were filed against computer associates all of which have named wang

reijane huai the cofounder and former president and ceo of falconstor software committed suicide by shooting himself in the chest in front of his long island home the suicide came the day before huai was to plead guilty to charges related to a bribery scheme that led to his ouster from falconstor a year ago that story has gotten fairly extensive coverage in the long island press what hasnt gotten the coverage it deserves is the fact that huai was a crony of charles wang the cofounder and former ceo of computer associates now ca and that wang and another of his cronies showed up at huais home sometime later on the day of the suicide  huai and wang had been close friends for years dating back to  when ca acquired cheyenne software where huai worked as the chief architect of cheyennes flagship arcserve backup software product huai went on to become cas executive vice president and general manager for asia he left ca in  to start falconstor where he served as ceo until the bribery scheme caught up with him that scheme involved  in payments to an employee of jpmorgan chase to secure millions of dollars worth of business for falconstor what followed were an sec investigation of falconstors accounting practices a criminal proceeding by the us attorneys office and classaction lawsuits brought by falconstor shareholders that brings us to this excerpt from the new york posts coverage of the suicidehis friends  billionaire new york islanders owner charles wang and huais longtime legal adviser roy reichbach  arrived at the scene of the gruesome suicide on monday  they had a close working relationship for years said a source close to wang these men were very close both professionally and personally mr wang is shocked wang whose computer associates in  paid  billion for cheyenne software inc one of huais former companies surveyed the scene from behind the tinted windows of a black bmw while reichbach went into the mansion  reichbach huais longtime legal adviser is also wangs longtime legal adviser reichbach was vice president legal at computer associates from  to  and he currently serves as corporate secretary and general counsel at neulion wangs struggling iptv services provider that i wrote about in december in my post as charles wangs world crumbles justice is served neulion has been hemorrhaging money that wangs crumbling financial empire can ill affordit lost over  million in  over  million in  and another  million in the first six months of this year according to the new york post report huai lived in the home with his wife but it wasnt known if she was home at the time of the suicide which occurred around  am its unclear who if anyone was home by the time wang and reichbach arrived in any event it was a peculiar scene if huais wife was home why didnt wang go in to console her if she wasnt why did reichbach go into the home while wang stayed in his car peering out of the tinted windows it just seems odd its worth reiterating here for the benefit of anyone whos unfamiliar with the wang saga that wangs history at computer associates was a seedy one although he managed to dodge criminal prosecution in the accounting fraud scandal that landed his successor sanjay kumar in prison cas board of directors determined that wang was the mastermind behind it all the new york times encapsulated the boards findings in a  reportcharles b wang the founder and former chairman of computer associates oversaw an accounting fraud lasting more than a decade at the software company according to a scathing report released on april   by the companys board  mr wang who owns the new york islanders and is among the most politically influential people on long island masterminded accounting gimmicks that led his company to report inflated sales and profits the report states as a result of the fraud the company has been forced to spend over  million on fines and internal investigations it is still struggling to rebuild the trust of employees and shareholders the report says in a statement mr wang said he sharply disagreed with the reports conclusions and blamed sanjay kumar his handpicked successor for the fraud mr wang created a culture of fear at computer associates  now called ca  and deliberately put inexperienced executives in senior positions so that he would have more control according to the report he discouraged executives from meeting with each other and arbitrarily fired managers or employees who disagreed with him fraud pervaded the entire ca organization at every level and was embedded in cas culture as instilled by mr wang almost from the companys inception the report said before huai became one of wangs long island cronies he epitomized the american dream he came to this country from taiwan on a college scholarship worked relentlessly and made what would be farreaching contributions to the software industry here he raised a family enjoyed hardearned financial success and was widely admired as a software visionary so what happened what were the drivers of his downfall was he influenced by others whose skewed sense of ethics and morality made the path he ultimately chose seem acceptable those questions raise the one that ultimately needs to be asked if huai had not fallen in with the wang crowd would he still be alive today subscribe to our newsletters sign up now and get the best

this blog post oct    am roy lawson  says mr wang created a culture of fear at computer associates  now called ca  and deliberately put inexperienced executives in senior positions so that he would have more control this may explain some quality issues with ca products i used in the early s leaving a bad taste in my mouth since thenhuai committed suicide by shooting himself in the chestim no expert on suicide but a shot to the chest seems odd  this world health organization study took on the morbid task of researching average methods of suicide httpwwwwhointbulletinvolumesen  the factors supporting this as a suicide are the weapon of choice shotgun is least likely to be used in a suicide gender male location on his property the number of bullets fired  and studies suggest that asianamericans are more likely to attempt suicide because of pressures to succeed shots to the chest arent unheard of just not the most popular method  i think that his shady past naturally makes people wonder if he was dispatched by someone else who perhaps held a grudge  or perhaps who didnt want information to come to light in a trial  my guess is that a professional would have also read the same who report and could easily stage a suicide  this is all just speculation on my part but there was certainly motive  sanjay kumar is doing time for a crime that huai was the mastermind  that would make me just a tad bit angry  then again maybe kumar is the wrong angle  this guy left behind a trail of fraud involving major corporations and powerful players across the world  there are probably more than a few people breathing a sigh of relief right now and more than a few people with motivethis has all the makings of a murder mystery  youve just got to look over the mound of evidence screaming suicide  are the police quietly exploring other angleshttplibncomexfalconstorceodiesinapparentsuicidedetective vincent garcia a spokesman for the nassau county police said we dont comment on a suicide unless it was in a public place this was at a private residencethe police have motive to publicly call this a suicide and buy time  conveniently they dont need to discuss this with the media since it occurred at a private residence  so i wonder if it is really case closed reply oct    pm don tennant  says in response to roy lawson sanjay kumar is doing time for a crime that huai was the mastermindjust to get the players straight wang was the mastermind behind what happened at ca not huai reply oct    am roy lawson  says in response to don tennant i guess i got my criminals mixed up  theyve weaved quite a web  in any case this is certainly an interesting story  reply oct    am wakjob  says looks like wang had him bumped off to me asian cultures are cutthroat and corrupt to the core reply oct    am nyifc  says in response to wakjob all due respect i am not a legal expert only a hockey fan but writing an article claiming would someone be dead if they had not met charles wang or another individual is over the top we all get you hate wang do you work for sam wyly also investigated by the government who despises cw like you but at some point you have to produce documented evidence that cw caused this man to kill himself or give it a rest or you are only a man with a vendetta lets just say for a minute all you are claiming is true how come you did not include sam wyly and ca board agreeing to leave wang alone then months later wyly leading the charge again to sue him and breaking his agreement where are the links to the articles of wyly being investigated by the government himself for his own business dealings who forced kumar or any of these people to not call the police and resign as soon as wang told them to do something illegal every december i see this article mr tennant and now we get one early because one of his friends tragically took his own life meanwhile the governor county execs and politicians everywhere seem to speak with cw who despite losing on manganos referendum got  people to agree to have their taxes raised for thirty years whats next you going to tell us kate murray joe mondello mangano suozzi tom gulotta are solid honest citizens did you hear democratic party chairman jay jacobs come off like a complete moron discussing coliseum financing i guess i missed the part where you included al damato in this somewhere because there is no one anywhere on long island with his hands in more deals with his own past scandals not even mondello and his mouthpiece kate murray btw if wang is such a horrible person why would someone with scott rechlers background agree to do the lighthouse project with him and invest  billion of likely recksons money by  when they combined and given the project all this information was common knowledge how come not one elected official in the last decade has simply made these charges and outright said we will do nothing with the islanders as long as wang owns them because of them many people would support those politicians for taking such a stance reply dec    am oldguy  says now i can double down on my bet that sanjay kumar will simply do his  years and not commit suicide when he gets out of jail  that means he got the message to keep his mouth shut  reply sep    am paul merrick  says thank you for your article mr tennant well written and informative i know you have posted several scathing articles about mr wangs shaddy buisness dealings involving ca and smile train charity i pary and thrust with several wang apologists on other sites and its amazing how people are either blind or unwilling to accept the gross misdeeds and corruption involving charles wang once again thank you for your efforting reply please enable javascript in your

by wang charles b read preview article excerpt we are witness to an immense shakeup transforming corporate north america organizations in the s are refocusing their efforts around access to information until a few years ago most centralized organizations relied on research and development and marketing to stimulate growth today with the increasing emphasis on decentralized business units and the rate of technological change in our global economy technology and information have become as critical as rd and marketing as keys to future success companies that thrive and survive in our global marketplace will be informationbased millions of dollars including the survival of the company are on the line to a much more intense degree than ever before without accurate data companies are more at risk for every decision that must be made for at least the last  years senior business and information systems executives have struggled with how to bring information technology and business into closer alignment to bridge the disconnect as business needs multiplied and the gap widened between the solutions information technology offered and the business challenges managers faced enlightened representatives of both camps redoubled their commitment to ending the disconnect the ideal they have been striving toward is an alignment that will optimize the provision of information technology and service to the user community the focus of information systems has changed from automating internal back room processes to enabling multifaceted mechanisms for directly delivering products or services to the customer the increased complexity of these systems is compounded by the fact that many are used for competitive advantage giving them lifeordeath urgency the central argument now becomes how to organize information technology to achieve higher levels of competitive advantage with todays shorter product cycles the old information technology culture leads inevitably to large development backlogs and missed delivery targets corporate efforts to hold down total information technology costs also are symptoms of the old mentality and can be problematic given strenuous business unit competition for available sometimes even scarce information technology resources notwithstanding a greater melding of information technology and business units alignment efforts must maintain standards for professional information technology work and systems and allow information technology professionals practical career options if you can get opportunity and technology together you have a better chance to identify competitiveadvantage systems companies that have internalized these new realities have substantially eliminated the disconnect sometimes they are termed learning organizations others call them virtual organizations by whatever name they are called these companies have the ability to access and process information on global competitive intelligence new product information research and development market trends and environmental and regulatory impacts having done so they can quickly act and then move on to the next challenge eliminating the disconnect removes many of the obstacles that keep todays organizations paralyzed many methods for aligning information technology resources and business goals are already in use at many companies i am privileged to visit hundreds of companies every year and i have observed many methods and strategies for aligning business and technology my conclusion is that there are as many strategies as there are companies every organization presents a unique set of constraints and opportunities yet in the course of visits to companies large and small i have found that a core set of business strategies is common to the most successful companies i have identified five key strategies that learning organizations can take to eliminate the disconnect a combination of these methods is probably the best guarantee of acrosstheboard success because each of these strategies has its own inherent risks … subscribe today subscribe to questia and enjoy full access to this article and over
