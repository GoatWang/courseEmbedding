to be in the best interest of the funds risk considerations investors should consider the following risk factors and special considerations associated with investing in the funds which may cause you to lose money including the entire principal amount that you invest interest rate risk as interest rates rise the value of fixedincome securities held by the funds are likely to decrease securities with longer durations tend to be more sensitive to interest rate changes making them more volatile than securities with shorter durations creditdefault risk the risk that issuers or guarantors of debt instruments or the counterparty to a derivatives contract bulletshares corporate bond etfs only repurchase agreement or loan of portfolio securities is unable or unwilling to make timely interest andor principal payments or otherwise honor its obligations debt instruments are subject to varying degrees of credit risk which may be reflected in credit ratings securities issued by the us government have limited credit risk credit rating downgrades and defaults failure to make interest or principal payment may potentially reduce the funds’ income and share prices asset class risk the bonds in the funds’ portfolio may underperform the returns of other bonds or indexes that track other industries markets asset classes or sectors call riskprepayment risk during periods of falling interest rates an issuer of a callable bond may exercise its right to pay principal on an obligation earlier than expected this may result in the funds having to reinvest proceeds at lower interest rates resulting in a decline in the funds’ income extension risk the risk that an issuer will exercise its right to pay principal on an obligation later than expected this may happen when there is a rise in interest rates under these circumstances the value of the obligation will decrease and the funds’ performance may suffer from its inability to invest in higher yielding securities income risk the risk that falling interest rates will cause the funds’ income to declineliquidity risk if the funds invest in illiquid securities or securities that become illiquid fund returns may be reduced because the funds may be unable to sell the illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price declining yield risk during the final year of the funds’ operations as the bonds held by the funds mature and the funds’ portfolio transitions to cash and cash equivalents the funds’ yield will generally tend to move toward the yield of cash and cash equivalents and thus may be lower than the yields of the bonds previously held by the funds andor prevailing yields for bonds in the market fluctuation of yield and liquidation amount risk the funds unlike a direct investment in a bond that has a level coupon payment and a fixed payment at maturity will make distributions of income that vary over time unlike a direct investment in bonds the breakdown of returns between fund distributions and liquidation proceeds are not predictable at the time of your investment for example at times during the funds’ existence it may make distributions at a greater or lesser rate than the coupon payments received on the funds’ portfolio which will result in the funds returning a lesser or greater amount on liquidation than would otherwise be the case the rate of fund distribution payments may adversely affect the tax characterization of your returns from an investment in the funds relative to a direct investment in corporate bonds if the amount you receive as liquidation proceeds upon the funds’ termination is higher or lower than your cost basis you may experience a gain or loss for tax purposes in addition the funds are subject to noncorrelation risk replication management risk issuerspecific changes and nondiversified fund risk the investmentgrade corporate bond etfs also entail the following risks foreign issuers risk investing in us registered dollardenominated bonds of foreign corporations which have different risks than investing in us companies these include currency political and economic risk as well as less market liquidity generally greater market volatility and less complete financial information than for us issuers derivatives risk the funds may invest in certain types of derivatives contracts including futures options and swaps which increases the risk of loss for the funds the highyield corporate bond etfs also entail the following risks highyield securities risk the funds invest in bonds that are rated below investmentgrade and are considered to be “junk” securities while these securities generally offer a higher current yield than that available from higher grade issues they typically involve greater risk the ability of issuers of highyield securities to make timely payments of interest and principal may be adversely impacted by adverse changes in general economic conditions changes in the financial condition of the issuers and price fluctuations in response to changes in interest rates highyield securities are less liquid than investmentgrade securities and may be difficult to price or sell particularly in times of negative sentiment toward highyield securities concentration risk if the index concentrates in an industry or group of industries the fund’s investments will be concentrated accordingly in such event the value of the fund’s shares may rise and fall more than the value of shares of a fund that invests in securities of companies in a broader range of industries in addition the highyield corporate bond etfs may entail some or all of the following sector risks financial services sector risk consumer staples sector risk telecommunications sector risk and consumer discretionary sector risk please read each
