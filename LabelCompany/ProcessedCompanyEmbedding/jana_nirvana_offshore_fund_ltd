new investors january     barry rosenstein’s jana partners has identified a new activist target—juniper networks a provider of telecom networking infrastructure products and services   the new york citybased hedge fund firm says in its yearend letter sent to clients that it has already engaged the company on the multiple avenues it believes could unlock shareholder value the firm says it is attracted to the company’s undemanding valuation the tailwind of a favorable telecom spending cycle on required network upgrades a frustrated shareholder base and the potential for a change of perspective and sense of urgency from new ceo  shaygan  khereadpir   in the letter jana also told clients it plans to close its nirvana fund to new investors on or around april  in addition it said it may close jana partners to new investors sometime in the future depending on the opportunity set   jana is not the first activist to move in on juniper   we reported on january  that paul singer’s elliott management disclosed a  percent stake in the company and sent a page presentation to the board of directors laying out how it would unlock value the plan includes cutting costs buying back

percent gain compared with  percent for the sp    in the letter rosenstein laments a number of missed opportunities amid a bull market whose ferocity he admits took him by surprise he admits he undersized some large winners so he could wait for lower prices that never came exited too early from other  winners that overshot jana’s target price and passed on some activist situations that were on its radar because management took actions to drive returns or other activists beat jana to the opportunity   its largest gains came from  groupon energy transfer equity and liberty ventures as we reported several weeks ago all five of its new activist positions in  were successful—ashland oil states international safeway qep resources andouterwall jana nirvana fund lp generated a  percent
