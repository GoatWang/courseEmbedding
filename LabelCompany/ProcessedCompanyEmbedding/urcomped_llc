beautiful the strategy you should occasionallylook at the results” winston churchill  casino marketingoften referred to as the heartbeat of a casinos operationsmarketing affects almost every single function at a modern casinoproperty yet it is often taken for granted casino marketinginvolves not only providing the right offer to the right patron at theright time but also includes retaining existing patrons as well asacquiring new ones to perform these marketing tasks the casinomarketer needs to not only fully understand the patrons in itsdatabase but also figure out how to get new patrons onto itsproperty and into its databases as well  to both allocate resources properly and attract and retain the mostprofitable customer segments the casino marketing department needs tounderstand which segments “pay the bills” some of the questions theymust ask are who are the casinos current customers which customer segments contribute the most or the least to theproperty’s revenue does it make more sense to design promotions that attract playersegments with low theoretical win levels but high frequency of visitation orshould the casino allocate promotional dollars to player segments withhigher theoretical win rates but less frequent visitations where do the casino’s customers live what is the overall contribution of each zip code country or province  market segmentationin their article how a professional casino consultant canhelp ‘optimize’ your casino’s marketing steve karoul anddean macomber advise casino marketers to think of theirpotential market as a series of interconnecting circles ofdiffering categories within which there is an endlessvariety of options they state that the segments caninclude but are not limited to the following• geographic• demographic• psychological• cultural• age• activities  when broken down this way one person would obviouslybe included in many different categories and eachsegment could be broken down into smaller segmentsfor geography there would be three segments nearby or“convenience” gaming customers to whom distancematters a lot middle distances or “excursion” gamingcustomers to whom distance is somewhat of an issueand large distances or the “destination” gamingcustomers to whom distance matters little karoul andmacomber  when creating their marketing strategies casinooperators must think in terms of the market cycle ofdemand creation which contains the following threephases• awareness• trial offer and• repeated visitation  for starters consumers must know that the product – thecasino – exists once patrons arrive they must be turnedinto loyal customers who will repeatedly return soattempts must be made to have then enroll into a playerclub once enrolled the casino marketers can track thepatrons spend very accurately armed with this importantinformation a casino marketer can determine the patronslikes and dislikes and then target market to themspecifically at this point casino marketers should developa range of programs and offers that will generaterepeated visitations karoul and macomber  marketing campaigns are where the rubber meetsthe road whether the campaigns are

to return  predictive analyticsin their article “knowing what to sell when and to whom”authors v kumar r venkatesan and w reinartz showed how by simply understanding and tweaking behavioralpatterns they could increase the hit rate for offers andpromotions to consumers which then had an immediate – andsubstantial – impact on revenuesby applying statistical models based on the work of nobel prizewinning economist daniel mcfadden researchers accuratelypredicted not only a specific person’s purchasing habits but alsothe specific time of the purchase to an accuracy of venkatesan and reinartz   predictive analyticsthe potential to market to an individual when he or she isprimed to accept the advertising is advantageous for bothparties involved marketers don’t waste time advertising toconsumers when they aren’t primed to accept theadvertisements but do market to consumers when andwhere they might want to use the advertisements  manipulating customer behaviorsuccessful marketing is about reaching a consumer with aninteresting offer when he or she is primed to accept itknowing what might interest a patron is half the battle to makinga sale and this is where customer intelligence and predictiveanalytics comes incustomer analytics has evolved from simply reporting customerbehavior to segmenting customers based on their profitability topredicting that profitability to improving those predictions toactually manipulating customer behavior with targetspecificpromotional offers and marketing campaigns  campaign effectiveness capturing response data to truly understand the success or failure of a marketing campaign casino and hotel operators must have an effective response tracking system costs and revenues can be combined with promotional contact and
