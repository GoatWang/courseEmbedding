on my right knee im to have  and ive had seven so farthree the first visit four the second the earlier reviewer described the procedure accurately im scheduled for four more this week i have experienced a remarkable change in my knee as well as in my ability to walk without any pain much of the time dr ellis stated on my last visit that such a quick improvement was not usual but he was pleased i was feeling so much better while im not yet  i would easily be able to live with what i now have if this is as good as it gets and if improvement continues to happen i will be very satisfied i read all the comments about the legal situation hes had in the pastthis was after my first round of treatmentsand it did give me pause before i returned but so far things are going very well ill continue with treatment to completion if i need it he had indicated that should i feel the knee was up to the level of comfort i needed before finishing the  treatments i could choose to stop with no penalty and without having to pay for treatments not received dr ellis now uses a payment program called care credit which is interestfree for up to  months after that interest goes up to over  so its best to pay it off as quickly as possiblewright michael drariusangel ratedi had my spine fused by anothei had my spine fused by another surgeon in  due to a very severe scoliosis curve i currently

an appointment for this morning saturday appointments are kind of rare with orthos we looked over the imaging again  discussed the game plan  i should be having the surgery at the end of augustearly september needless to say ill be posting a review after i have recovered from everything he may come off as arrogant or cocky to some but its mainly because he is very experienced  knowledgeable  knows what he is doing he talked to my husband  i for  min  we never felt rushed at all maybe appointments during the week are different but we really did have a positive experiencefong winston mdmichael m ratedi have been cared for by dr fong for  years and found him to be very knowledgeable and understanding i have chronic neck pain due to a car accident over  years ago i saw dr fong after many years of pain and worsened shoulder pain and numbness in my fingers on the left hand i had an mri and xrays that revealed multiple levels of disc damage and mild compression of the spinal cord at cc dr fong was conservative in his recommendation and i received tx at pain management x years with good management of my symptoms with steroid injections just recently my symptoms have worsened and an updated mri was performed with xrays too dr fong reviewed the findings and after a through physical exam and long discussion in his office we have decided to proceed with a  level fusion in the cspine using my own bone for the procedure i feel confident that dr fong did not rush into cutting me open and only advised it now because we have exhausted all conservative treatmentsabbas toughanipour mdyancy b ratedat  i had a stroke four years later i had a heart attack i had marfan syndrome dr toughanipour had to perform the bentall procedure which is a replacement of the aortic valve aortic root and ascending aorta with reimplantation of the coronary arteries into the graft this operation is used to treat combined aortic valve and ascending aorta disease including lesions

i owe my life to dr toughanipour i feel great and have not had any complications dr toughanipour has to be one of the top cardiac surgeons in the nationmatthews rex r mdmostlyharmless ratedtook wonderful care of my twohe took care of my daughter who is now  years old from the time she was  she adored him and called him dr pawpaw my son never warmed up to him quite like that but he did okay dr matthews had some rude staff back then and probably still does but the doctor himself was exceptional if you took the time to research whatever problem your child was having he would listen and respect you for it that is very hard to find i cant imagine that being aged out of him but it has been a number of years since weve seen him my first grandchild was born this last friday and i will recommend dr matthews in spite of his age now as a starting point i dont know what problems the other reviewer had with ampquotoffice policiesampquot being ridiculous but you cant judge a doctor based on your inability to follow whatever silly rules are laid outwright michael draisha r ratedexceptionalcant stop smilingi have been a patient under dr wright for several years i have to say the man is truly gifteddr wright put in an amazingly beautiful bridge i was preparing for my wedding as such i was very nervous about the procedure and how it would turn out after all they were going to remove my six top front teeth to put in the bridge he took the time to explain every procedure and was very supportive they look so natural and i cannot stop smiling i get complements regularly from strangers on how beautiful my smile is dr wright is truly a perfectionist to my benefit and won’t stop until he has achieved it i have benefitted from his extraordinary talents professionalism and humanity his staff is outstanding and supper supportive i cannot recommend him and his staff more highly thank you dr wright  wright michael drrebeccasummers rateddr wright got my husband outdr wright got my husband out of his wheelchair the original neurosurgeon had performed a lumbar fusion which led to a bone infection the infection deteriorated his entire lumbar region and required a hickman port for the antibiotics the port caused several blood clots to form and that delayed the repairative surgery for  months during that time his spine collapsed and he was confined to a wheel chair the original surgeon told us that it was too risky and basically over his head he referred us to another orthopedic surgeon who took one look at the mri and sent us straight to dr wright after an   hour surgery my husband was able to stand up for the first time in over a year that was  years ago i would highly recommend him to anyone and everyonepic med of okokclisapa ratedof of all of the

examinations and they can end up missing certain problem indicators while some problems like a cold or flu can be diagnosed in this time more complex ailments require attention which takes up time reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demandsurgery has some more dire risks attached to it so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure if a patient has a reaction to anesthesia it can cause very serious complications but this is an uncommon occurrence blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery often caused by inactivity during recovery infections numbness scarring swelling and death are all possible but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery youre undergoing talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potentialaftercaresurgery affects people in different ways but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia youll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have the nurse will tell you how the procedure went what effect it will have on your condition what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal if you start feeling pain the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse when possible its also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs this can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot some surgeries are outpatient procedures where people are released the same day for major surgeries patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bringrecovery and followupyour recovery time and followup expectations will vary depending on your procedure for example you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heartvalve surgery your surgeon will give you a list of things that youll need to do during this time including what medications to take and when youll be able to get back to work and other activitiesevery surgery will have a followup call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health if you have a major operation like heart surgery its important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected these appointments will give
