chief executives club in the wharf room at the boston harbor hotel view of the telecom industry six months after it resumed offering local phone service in massachusetts att corp has garnered  percent of the state market and expects to reach double digits in  said company chief executive david w dorman in an appearance at boston colleges chief executives club of boston dorman indicated that ma bell is taking a serious look at offering a lowpriced unlimited phone calling service over the internet through devices that would be attached to broadband internet connections a market now controlled mainly by tiny startups atts push into local services including its launch in june  of amonth unlimited local and long distance service in massachusetts has attracted over  million customers nationally selling local service over lines rented from baby bells like verizon communications inc and bellsouth is a key att strategy to offset its steadily declining core longdistance business a whoswho of boston gathered to hear the address but dorman said even cheaper voiceover internet protocol services are destined to grow explosively and att recognizes it needs to get in the game resistance is futile dorman said this is one of those things that is like a tidal wave coming its going to be the method of choice for anyone who has a broadband connection to make phone calls whether they have a cable modem a telephonebased digital subscriber line or some other highspeed internet access dorman gave no details of when att might launch service or the price its becoming technologically feasible and at a quality level thats worthy of our brand dorman said asked in a later interview with the boston globe whether att is concerned about eating into its own longdistance business which has  million residential customers he said its being cannibalized anyway mr dorman speaks with chad gifford of fleetboston in other comments dorman said he believes consolidation in the telecom industry is inevitable although he had no comment on reports att and bellsouth discussed merging last month referring to fleetboston chief executive chad giffords planned  billion merger with bank of america dorman said if i could do a deal just like chad gifford did itd be damned important hes my new hero dorman called unsustainable the current lineup of seven large us landline phone companies and seven major wireless carriers if we maintain that market structure it will be very difficult for anyone to make any money dorman said and on the issue of scandaltarred mci potentially emerging from chapter  bankruptcy protection this winter with a deeply reduced debt load and ability to start a new price war dorman said we welcome them back as an honest competitor     measured by revenue per employee cash flow and net debt load att can still compete strongly dorman said and mci chief executive michael d capellas seems to be really committed to playing at the highest level of ethics and governance that couldnt be better for att because that is not the company we were competing with when it was known as worldcom and was committing over  billion in accounting fraud adapted
