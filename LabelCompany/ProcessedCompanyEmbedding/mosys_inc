persons because they are one of the primary indicators that mosys’ management uses for planning and forecasting future performance mosys’ management believes that the presentation of nongaap financial measures that exclude these items is useful to investors because management does not consider these charges part of the daytoday business or reflective of the core operational activities of the

measures to the comparable gaap results which is provided in a table below the condensed consolidated statements of operations the nongaap financial measures disclosed by the company should not be
