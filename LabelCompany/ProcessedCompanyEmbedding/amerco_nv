an honest mechanic is over finally i have found an auto repair place with honest automotive technicians as a woman and a car owner for over  years i have been ripped off by numerous mechanics all over america at val halla automotive service i receive quality service at a reasonable price they have never tacked on additional costs and rather than suggesting repairs dan olsen just tells me what he can do and lets me decidethey do a great job right the first time and usually it was done expeditiously dan runs a honest business his dad was an honest logger and he is always concerned about his customers needs i simply would not go anywhere else to have my pt cruiser servicedval hallas not much to look at  a one chair waiting room and a framed photo of clark gable circa  on the wall  because dan and his crew care more about cars than decor dan has always been honest about what needs to be done what could wait until later and he has given me a fair price after stopping in just once looking for a place that would service my  chrysler pt cruiser i left feeling that my car was in great hands and i wasnt disappointed overall val halla provides high quality service for a reasonable price and theyre really nice too for those reasons i will continue to bring all of my car repair business to them“an auto repair facility you can trust” i never thought i would utter that phrase what i love most about val halla is that i can trust them they dont sell parts in fact with my older vehicle there are times when dan has advised me to skip a repair because it’s too expensive i have always been kept informed during the course of repairs and have always been happy with their service its nice to know that there is an auto repair business on gentry way in reno that provides honest service his technicians are all highly qualified they know what they are doing if you love your car its in good hands hereif you want it done right the first time val halla is your place i had an air conditioning problem with my car and spoke to three local repair shops i said i wanted a freon recharge but wanted no air conditioning check that’s because i have a failed  fan and i can’t afford the repair one place quoted me  the other quote was  and val hall quoted me  it ended up costing  but dan blew off the cents val halla diagnosed the problem quickly did the repairs for exactly what i was quoted pus  cents and i am now able to drive around reno with blessed air great service when the chrysler dealership closed its doors i was very pleased to learn that val halla had a mechanic whose family owns three pt cruisers i am a female who drives a lot i need reliable transportation and cant afford to have my car tied up for long periods of time dan olsen is an honest businessman who treats his customers well i would not go anywhere else as i have found a gem in val halla auto repairdeanos automotiveron c ratedmy wife and i were visiting reno for a few days from san jose on day  of our trip the starter went out on my gmc envoy and i was stranded in a casino parking lot on the recommendation of our cabbie that night i had the car towed the next morning to deanos and told them we were planning to drive back home that day and hoped it could be fixed in time i then asked for the number of a cab company so i could get a ride back to the hotel the young man who helped me dusty promptly said hed give me a ride really i gratefully accepted when he dropped me off he said he would call after lunch and give me an updatesure enough just about pm i received a call from the shop i was a little anxious about what dusty was going to say to my pleasant surprise he said the car was finished he then said to meet him at the valet entry with our bags as he was coming to pick us up againreally we went back to the shop paid what i thought was a very fair bill and we were on our way homei was truly amazed at the extra care and concern we recieved they all went out of their way to make sure our needs were met this is truly a rare quality found in the auto repair business today i will make sure that all those i know who are traveling to reno are aware of this family owned business if they are ever in need of an auto repair special kudos to dusty who was our personal chauffer a bad day was brightened by your kind acts rays tire exchangesomeone ratedi had  old tires on my car from les schawb les schawb is a great tire store but i didnt have the money at the time to replace all the tires i had  decent tires and one worn tire that was about to blow and was a safety hazzard so i checked around and the best deal around was at rays tire exchange for less than  i could get one used tire installed and balanced on my car so i went for that deal the problem was that they accidently installed the wrong size tire the tire was the same rim size but it was larger in circumferance than the rest of the tires i had on the car if you do that on a drive wheel you can mess up your transmission or differential luckly it was not on a drive wheel i went back the next day anyway and asked for an exchange they gave me some hassel for a while and suggested that i had come in with a different tire than the one they had installed yesterday i explained that it was no big deal and i just wanted to exchange the tire for one that is the same size as the rest of the tires on my car eventually they did exchange the wrong sized tire for one that was the right size although they did it kind of reluctantlyso my advice is if your looking for a cheap tire inbetween full replacements try rays tire keep an eye on them though inspect the tire before they put it on and make sure that it is the right size and a tire that will work for you it will save you hassel laterall about carselise c ratedmy experience started with a call answered by angel about a coupon for my daughters oil changes his customer service skills were amazing and boommy daughter was scheduled for a service wow my daughter was really pleased with the shop and all the staffwhen my ac went out on my almost  year old car i got talked into going to another local shop after hearing great spiels and waiting for almost two hours the price was crazy my daughter said call angel i ended up at the all about cars for an estimate the price was very reasonable especially for original honda parts jason and angel were really patient with all my questions and were happy to provide clear explanations of the parts process and costs involvedall about cars was so nice and gave me a card with several free services to say thanks for being a new customer wow yet againmy car is so grateful for all about cars quality professional careall about carssydney g ratedi could not wait to come on here and say how much i absolutely adore this place i bought a  jetta from a car lot  months later i find out it needs a transmission and just the transmission is  and my warrantee covered only  i could not find a shop in town to replace it without costing me thousands of dollars out of pocket plus it needed new breaks too i brought it to all about cars and told them my situation crying at the time by the way joe said he would personally take care of the situation and let me know he called me  days later and told me he was going to make it work for the budget i had and that the most he would go over was  and he would replace the breaks included in that price i was so relieved and he said he would have it all done and ready by saturday and today is thursday these guys are the best total life savor i will never ever go anywhere elsesierra automotive repairrandyralston ratedi have no idea whowhywhathow these other two reviewers had a bad experience i am not even sure of the truth of it this shop is one of the best repair shops i have been to in over  years they have helped some of my employees get affordable repairs on clunkers  on two occasions allowing them to keep the car rather than junking and in one case still have a car they do excellent repair work and cost less than many others and always less than a dealer these guys are great now for these two other reviewers  they are the bozos and their complaints make them look foolish at best so try sierra automotive they do superior work always on second thought they are only ok no need to keep them too busy i do not want to delay my repairs and auto work i like their fast service perhaps only go their occasionally  so they have enough business but can still give me fast service  north valley automotivec j ratedoutstanding group

assess the problems and determine the best course of action for repairs as well as evaluate how much they will costbeyond that regular checkups are recommended tires must be rotated fluids needs to be replaced and the engine must be evaluated after driving  miles most auto dealers suggest having the vehicle checked out to ensure everything is running smoothly taking the car into the auto repair professional you trust will protect you from further problems down the roaddoing your own auto repairnot every type of auto repair work needs to be done by a certified mechanic you can fix some of a

a better understanding for how your car operates and save time and moneyalong with understanding how to fix manageable vehicle issues that may arise taking preventative measures to avoid future problems is a valuable time saver many problemsolving best practices are related to the seasons your vehicle will be in different conditions in the winter than in the summer meaning it requires a different type of preparationin the spring and summer you want to be sure your air conditioner and cooling systems work correctly given the high temperatures the vehicle will be exposed to overheating is a common problem look over the system by ensuring there is enough coolant available if it needs to be refilled it is best to open the hood and add more to the car before it gets too warm out also clean out fan ducts and other ventilation sources necessary for summertime drivingfor winter driving features such as the defroster heater and exhaust system are paramount look in your owners manual for specific directions on how features should be checked and repaired many newer cars have a cabin air filter that can be replaced when needed allowing warm air to continue to flow in also check your tires before winter driving as they need to be at the proper pressure to perform well on snow and iceavoiding scams there is a common worry among many people that auto repair professionals take advantage of the general public because so many people are unaware of how to fix the problems in their vehicle they are nervous of being overcharged by mechanics or worried that the improper work is being donewhile the great majority of professionals in the industry are honest hardworking people a few bad apples can ruin everything you should be extra careful when first visiting a mechanic to guarantee that the price youre charged and maintenance the vehicle receives are fairamong the common scams pulled are needless repairs where a garage charges you for work that isnt necessary another popular one is attracting customers through a cheap oil change or tire pressure check then when you are in the shop and your car is being repaired they give you a long list of other corrections theyd like to make therefore boosting the total cost of your billthe best way to combat these types of problems is getting a written estimate before work is done that way you can see how much repairs are expected to cost if the final bill is higher than the estimate projected ask to specifically see the work make sure information is put in writing as well if a problem remains you can have proof that work was not done to your satisfactionby working closely with an auto repair professional and doing some of the tuneup work on your own you will be less likely to fall for these scams at the same time

insurance products primarily to the senior market through the direct writing and reinsuring of life insurance medicare supplement and annuity policies critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap in the united states the methods estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies can have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements certain accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments and assumptions often as a result of the need to estimate matters that are inherently uncertain in the following pages we have set forth with a detailed description the accounting policies that we deem most critical to us and that require managements most difficult and subjective judgments these estimates are based on historical experience observance of trends in particular areas information and valuations available from outside sources and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual amounts may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions such differences may be material we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies such as revenue recognition however these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective the accounting policies that we deem most critical to us and involve the most difficult subjective or complex judgments include the following principles of consolidation we apply asc   consolidation asc  in our principles of consolidation asc  addresses arrangements where a company does not hold a majority of the voting or similar interests of a variable interest entity vie a company is required to consolidate a vie if it has determined it is the primary beneficiary asc  also addresses the policy when a company owns a majority of the voting or similar rights and exercises effective control as promulgated by asc  a vie is not selfsupportive due to having one or both of the following conditions i it has an insufficient amount of equity for it to finance its activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support or ii its owners do not hold the typical risks and rights of equity owners this determination is made upon the creation of a variable interest and is reassessed on an ongoing basis should certain changes in the operations of a vie or its relationship with the primary beneficiary trigger a reconsideration under the provisions of asc  after a triggering event occurs the facts and circumstances are utilized in determining whether or not a company is a vie which other companys have a variable interest in the entity and whether or not the companys interest is such that it is the primary beneficiary we will continue to monitor our relationships with the other entities regarding who is the primary beneficiary which could change based on facts and circumstances of any reconsideration events recoverability of property plant and equipment our property plant and equipment is stated at cost interest expenseif any incurred during the initial construction of buildings and rental equipment is considered part of cost depreciation is computed for financial reporting purposes using the straightline or an accelerated method based on a declining balance formula over the following estimated useful lives rental equipment  years and buildings and nonrental equipment  years we follow the deferral method of accounting based on asc   airlines for major overhauls in which engine and transmission overhauls are currently capitalized and amortized over three years routine maintenance costs are charged to operating expense as they are incurred gains and losses on dispositions of property plant and equipment are netted against depreciation expense when realized equipment depreciation is recognized in amounts expected to result in the recovery of estimated residual values upon disposal ie minimize gains or losses in determining the depreciation rate historical disposal experience holding periods and trends in the market for vehicles are reviewed we regularly perform reviews to determine whether facts and circumstances exist which indicate that the carrying amount of assets including estimates of residual value may not be recoverable or that the useful life of assets are shorter or longer than originally estimated reductions in residual values ie the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment reviews are performed based on vehicle class generally subcategories of trucks and trailers we assess the recoverability of our assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their estimated remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts we consider factors such as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles and the expected life of vehicles included in the fleet impairment if any is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets if asset residual values are determined to be recoverable but the useful lives are shorter or longer than originally estimated the net book value of the assets is depreciated over the newly determined remaining useful lives management determined that additions to the fleet resulting from purchases should be depreciated on an accelerated method based upon a declining formula under the declining balances method  times declining balance the book value of a rental truck is reduced approximately       and  during years one through seven respectively and then reduced on a straight line basis to a salvage value of  by the end of year fifteen beginning in october  rental equipment subject to this depreciation schedule will be depreciated to a salvage value of  comparatively a standard straight line approach would reduce the book value by approximately  per year over the life of the truck although we intend to sell our used vehicles for prices approximating book value the extent to which we realize a gain or loss on the sale of used vehicles is dependent upon various factors including but not limited to the general state of the used vehicle market the age and condition of the vehicle at the time of its disposal and the depreciation rates with respect to the vehicle we typically sell our used vehicles at our sales centers throughout north america on our web site at uhaulcomtrucksales or by phone at  additionally we sell a large portion of our pickup and cargo van fleet at automobile dealer auctions insurance reserves liabilities for life insurance and certain annuity and health policies are established to meet the estimated future obligations of policies in force and are based on mortality morbidity and withdrawal assumptions from recognized actuarial tables which contain margins for adverse deviation in addition liabilities for health disability and other policies include estimates of payments to be made on insurance claims for reported losses and estimates of losses incurred but not yet reported liabilities for annuity contracts consist of contract account balances that accrue to the benefit of the policyholders insurance reserves for property and casualty insurance and uhaul take into account losses incurred based upon actuarial estimates and are managements best approximation of future payments these estimates are based upon past claims experience and current claim trends as well as social and economic conditions such as changes in legal theories and inflation these reserves consist of case reserves for reported losses and a provision for losses incurred but not reported ibnr both reduced by applicable reinsurance recoverables resulting in a net liability due to the nature of the underlying risks and high degree of uncertainty associated with the determination of the liability for future policy benefits and claims the amounts to be ultimately paid to settle these liabilities cannot be precisely determined and may vary significantly from the estimated liability especially for longtailed casualty lines of business such as excess workers compensation as a result of the longtailed nature of the excess workers compensation policies written by repwest during  through  it may take a number of years for claims to be fully reported and finally settled insurance reserve adequacy is reviewed on a regular basis by management to determine if existing assumptions need to be updated in determining the assumptions for calculating workers compensation reserves management considers multiple factors including the following claimant longevity changes in environmental factors including legal and regulatory we have reserved each claim based upon the accumulation of current claim costs projected through each claimants life expectancy and then adjusted for applicable reinsurance arrangements management reviews each claim biannually to determine if the estimated lifetime claim costs have increased and then adjusts the reserve estimate accordingly at that time we have factored in an estimate of what the potential cost increases could be in our ibnr liability we have not assumed settlement of the existing claims in calculating the reserve amount unless it is in the final stages of completion continued increases in claim costs including medical inflation and new treatments and medications could lead to future adverse development resulting in additional reserve strengthening conversely settlement of existing claims or if injured workers return to work or expire prematurely could lead to future positive development impairment of investments investments are evaluated pursuant to guidance contained in asc   investments  debt and equity securities to determine if and when a decline in market value below amortized cost is otherthantemporary management makes certain assumptions or judgments in its assessment including but not limited to income taxes we file a consolidated tax return with all of our legal subsidiaries our tax returns are periodically reviewed by various taxing authorities the final outcome of these audits may cause changes that could materially impact our financial results fair values fair values of cash equivalents approximate carrying value due to the short period of time to maturity fair values of short term investments investments availableforsale long term investments mortgage loans and notes on real estate and interest rate swap contracts are based on quoted market prices dealer quotes or discounted cash flows fair values of trade receivables approximate their recorded value our financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of temporary cash investments trade receivables reinsurance recoverables and notes receivable limited credit risk exists on trade receivables due to the diversity of our customer base and their dispersion across broad geographic markets we place our temporary cash investments with financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution we have mortgage receivables which potentially expose us to credit risk the portfolio of notes is principally collateralized by selfstorage facilities and commercial properties we have not experienced any material losses related to the notes from individual or groups of notes in any particular industry or geographic area the estimated fair values were determined using the discounted cash flow method and using interest rates currently offered for similar loans to borrowers with similar credit ratings the carrying amount of long term debt and short term borrowings are estimated to approximate fair value as the actual interest rate is consistent with the rate estimated to be currently available for debt of similar term and remaining maturity other investments including short term investments are substantially current or bear reasonable interest rates as a result the carrying values of these financial instruments approximate fair value subsequent events our management has evaluated subsequent events occurring after december   the date of our most recent balance sheet through the date our financial statements were issued we do not believe any subsequent events have occurred that would require further disclosure or adjustment to our financial statements recent accounting pronouncements in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs the amendments in this update require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability consistent with debt discounts the recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this update the guidance is effective for interim periods and annual period beginning after december   however early adoption is permitted the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements in august  the fasb issued asu  revenue from contracts with customers topic  deferral of the effective date the amendment in this update extends the effective date of asu  revenue from contracts with customers to fiscal periods beginning after december   from december   in january  the fasb issued asu  financial instrumentsoverall subtopic  recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities the amendments in asu  among other things requires equity investments except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income requires public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset ie securities or loans and receivables eliminates the requirement for public business entities to disclose the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost the amendments in this asu are effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after december   including interim periods within those fiscal years the company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its consolidated financial statements from time to time new accounting pronouncements are issued by the fasb or the sec that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date unless otherwise discussed these asus entail technical corrections to existing guidance or affect guidance related to specialized industries or entities and therefore will have minimal if any impact on our financial position or
