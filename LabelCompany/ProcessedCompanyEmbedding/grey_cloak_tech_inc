comments credit getty images “this is the biggest advertising story of the decade and it’s being buried says ad contrarian bob hoffmanin december  a problem that advertising insiders kept close to their vests was thrust into the public domain after the ana conducted the first largescale study on digital advertising fraud – an offense that they determined would cost unsuspecting advertisers a projected  billion dollars this yearin the aftermath of the study findings a few things happened savvy tech entrepreneurs saw an opportunity to raise capital for an apparent gap in the industry and fraudsters have gotten smartersays mathew ingram in his recent fortune article half of all online ads are never seen by a human being huge amounts of traffic and clicks come from bot networks and fraud is rampantand sam scott lists the three main allegations in his recent moz articlehalf or more of the paid online display advertisements that ad networks media buyers and ad agencies have knowingly been selling to clients over the years have never appeared in front of live human beingsagencies have been receiving kickbacks and indirect payments from ad networks under the guise of “volume discounts” for serving as the middlemen between the networks and the clients who were knowingly sold the fraudulent ad impressionsad networks knowingly sell bot traffic to publishers and publishers knowingly buy the bot traffic because the resulting ad impressions earn both of them moneyat the expense of the clients who are paying for the impressionsdefusing the ticking time bombone digital advertising fraud detection company grey cloak tech invested over  and a half years – including documentation of thousands of marketing campaigns – to overcome the multibilliondollar problem now in business they noticed a curious trend in their fraud detection analyseson first analysis virtually all of our clients show varying degrees of bot fraud – depending on the industry and their traffic sources the fraudulent traffic is between  but sometimes something peculiar happens – the same metrics show a dramatic and unprecedented decline in fraud rates whats happening is that our clients are passing our data along to their agencies some of which then look for ways to bypass the systemsays joshua silver vp of sales and marketing of grey cloakoutsourcing ad fraudaccording to silver one tactic offenders pursue is to hire real people often in other countries for very little money to click on campaignsits a sort of fraud outsourcing when real people click on ads its harder for software programs to detect because it follows a trajectory of authentic human behavior but its still damaging because these people have no intention of purchasing the advertised productssilver who has been in the digital advertising space for several years drew from his history in the space to create a software that stays ahead of this evolving click fraudfortunately having roots in digital advertising gave me insight on this problem i know what traffic companies do when theyre being watched and we built our system to evolve as fraudsters evolvenot only does the subscriptionbased service engage an advanced set of metrics to measure subtle indicators of more than  permutations of digital advertising fraud but the company also employs a team to analyze the data and look for troubling nuances and they update their database regularly to stay ahead of the curveunlike google filters and other nocost analytics software grey cloaks technology is laser focused on removing fraudulent activity from campaigns an important distinction when considering the high percentage of fraudulent traffic that appears across virtually all types of campaignssilver notes because fraud is evolving so rapidly and perpetrators are engaging both real people and technology to beat software there was a need to create a sophisticated fraud detection technology on behalf of our customers to give our clients back control of their marketing campaignscoming to your mobile phone more ad fraudwhats worse the problem of digital ad fraud continues to evolve according to robert hof in his recent forbes
