letter to new york  company board and kanen wealth management llc  the philotimo fund sends letter to new york  company board and management news provided by kanen wealth management llc dec    et share this article coral springs fla dec   prnewswire  the following letter was delivered to new york  company board and management from kanen wealth management llc  the philotimo fund dear nwy board of directors and executive management we have been patient passive shareholders for several years we currently own over  million shares the reason we invested was based on managements communication of cost savings initiatives project excellence net savings of  million annually and a longterm target of a high single digit operating margin all of the above dating back to  the sad reality is that our stock has declined dating back to june of  from  to  representing a  decline simultaneously during the same period xrt the benchmark for retail stocks has appreciated approximately  with dividends when we compare the actual results with managements stated objectives under project excellence of  million in total savings and  million in net savings coming from a combination of cogs and sga we are left perplexed adjusted ebitda has declined from fy  of  million to  million over the last  months ended  essentially the impact of project excellence to the financial results has been nonexistent management has paid lip service to improving operating results with nothing to show for it nwy has been generous to its executives at the top annual raises while not being very kind to us people at the bottom shareholders project excellence as well as the  cost savings initiatives have been merely token gestures that as stated in the above referenced financials have not only failed in generating net cost savings but adjusted ebitda has actually declined we are calling on the board and management to uphold their fiduciary responsibility and take aggressive actions with a sense of urgency we are calling for the following   a detailed review of all expenses some of which are but not limited to travel and entertainment rationalization of real estateleases unnecessary overtime optimization of matching labor hours with peak times cost of internet and telephones in every location rebidding cleaning services rebidding and negotiating shipping expenses communication with every store manager to have a goal of saving  per month per store  million cumulative annual impact at stores alone we are calling on top executives to voluntarily agree to salary reductions that result in a cumulative annual savings of  million with an offsetting increase in stock based compensation aligning interests with shareholders the goal of this expense reduction initiative will be a minimum of  million annually which is only half of the original project excellence goal  a  million stock buyback it is time that nwy return cash to shareholders we estimate that by the end of q january st  nwy will have approximately  million in gross cash and  million in net cash our math is as follows nwy will collect  million under their new private label credit card agreement on january th plus a minimum of  million in q free cash flow generation the past four years q fcf has ranged between  million we estimate the pro forma enterprise value at  million furthermore under the substantially improved royalty agreement with their plcc as per the companys q we conservatively estimate in excess of  million in incremental royalties when combined with  million in net expense savings we estimate forward ebitda to be greater than  million also worth noting over the past  years nwy has run the business with net cash ranging from  million and will clearly be overcapitalized by january st  it is worth reiterating that excess cash be returned to shareholders in the form of a stock buyback for example assuming a pro forma run rate of  million in ebitda our stock will be trading at approximately x evebitda we can hardly imagine a better use of cash than our own shares  new board member – with a track record of operational excellence and creation of shareholder value we thank all of the hardworking nwy employees we wish them and their families a blessed and safe holiday season we look forward to a constructive and amicable dialogue with nwy management and the board lastly a prosperous  that is inclusive of the shareholders not just a few at the top sincerely david kanenpresident kanen wealth management llcphilotimo fund lpdkanenkanenadvisorycom   to view the original

 coral springs fl  p   f   april   new york  company  w th st th floor new york ny  dear nwy board of directors and executive management we are writing to highlight the losing record of the board of directors and company management we want to formally express our view that the results of the company and the share price have been awful the status quo is unacceptable only a few people at the top are benefiting from representation while minority shareholders are suffering at the bottom over the last five months through private discussions with company management and the board we have attempted to amicably effect positive change at new york and company and are deeply frustrated with managements lack of action and results to date maybe you view our  stake as well as other larger shareholders ownership less significant than irving place capitals ownership and not worthy of a seat at the table we intend to vigorously represent ourselves and perhaps other nonirving place shareholders feel the same way let us summarize the scorecard of events over the past  years  stock performance on a relative basis  in july of  our stock was approximately  a share currently the stock trades at approximately  a share this represents approximately a  decline in value during the same timeframe our benchmark xrt sp retail etf is up  before dividends over this period of  decline in stock price executive management has received modest base salary increases  four years ago in calendar  fy our gross margin gm was  our selling general and administration expenses sga as a percentage of total sales were  leaving us with an operating margin of   if we fast forward  years to calendar year  fy our gm was  and sga as a percentage of total sales was  leaving us with a negative operating margin of   during the aforementioned year period management has guided for an engagement in cost saving initiatives in sga and cogs to maximize profits and expand margins these initiatives however have failed to translate to the companys earnings performance during this period the companies operating margins declined from  bps to negative  bps unfortunately the numbers speak for themselves  below are some quotes from earnings calls dating back  years that demonstrate management and the boards failure to execute a march  in addition buying and occupancy costs decreased by  basis points as a percentage of net sales largely due to the companys continued focus on cost savings and reduced rent expenses so its really a combination of the  channels of our business that will get us back to that peak operating margin in the high single digits b december   in connection with our analysis we recently initiated an organizational realignment which included the elimination of numerous positions in our corporate offices as a result of the organizational changes made we expect to save  million to  million in expenses  million of which will be realized in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  c august   turning to project excellence our productivity initiative as you know our goal of project excellence is to improve our overall operational efficiency and productivity at the same time increase gross margin and mitigate expense increases and investments and growth areas of our business as previously announced we launched a comprehensive business reengineering project in late  and we now expect project excellence to produce savings of approximately  million on an annualized basis which has been revised upward from our prior estimate of  million to  million d december   so ultimately our target goal over a longer period of time is to get back to the high single digit operating margins e march   from a bottom line benefit we continue to expect project excellence to produce an estimated  million in savings in  on top of the savings already achieved in  f may   we continue to be pleased with the success of project excellence to date and while we are excited that these savings begin flowing through directly to our bottom line in  we still remain very focused on identifying new opportunities to reduce costs increase our speed to market increase efficiency and improve profitability gross margins are unacceptable here are gross margins for some of new york  cos peers  asna   fran   cato   chs   nwy at the bottom with a gm of  unacceptable recommended actions  one new independent board member  the formation of a special committee of independent directors that represents minority shareholders nonmanagement nonirving place or have never worked at irving place whos responsibility will be to conduct an indepth comprehensive review of nwys operations for the purpose of maximizing gross profit and saving on sga currently there are  board members that work or have worked at irving place capital we believe this would be an exercise of best practices for corporate governance this indepth review would satisfy and alleviate any concerns minority shareholders have regarding their representation it will also show us the company is doing everything in its power to achieve its operating margin targets  an enhanced capital allocation strategy that returns more cash to shareholders we would like to highlight the many positives nwy has potential to build upon  our enterprise value is only  million  our enterprise value is only  of revenue  the growth potential of eva mendes and gabrielle union  the balance sheet has over  million in net cash   per share  our revised private label credit card deal which should generate  million in incremental high margin royalties this year  a solid brand  a majority of the leases are less than  years  tailwinds and opportunities from competitors closing stores  the potential to drive gross margins higher currently well below peer group   loyal customer base with over  of sales coming from private label credit card  dedicated employees at the store level in summary we are calling for board representation that gives nonirving place capital shareholders a true seat at the table formation of a special committee which is truly independent that will conduct an indepth review of operations to drive gms up and sga expenses down and an enhanced capital allocation strategy a very wealthy shareholder at the top has been amply represented for years we believe minority shareholders

and executive management we have been patient passive shareholders for several years we currently own over  million shares the reason we invested was based on managements communication of cost savings initiatives project excellence net savings of  million annually and a longterm target of a high single digit operating margin all of the above dating back to  the sad reality is that our stock has declined dating back to june of  from  to  representing a  decline simultaneously during the same period xrt the benchmark for retail stocks has appreciated approximately  with dividends when we compare the actual results with managements stated objectives under project excellence of  million in total savings and  million in net savings coming from a combination of cogs and sga we are left perplexed adjusted ebitda has declined from fy  of  million to  million over the last  months ended  essentially the impact of project excellence to the financial results has been nonexistent management has paid lip service to improving operating results with nothing to show for it nwy quoteszigmancomposite nwy  has been generous to its executives at the top annual raises while not being very kind to us people at the bottom shareholders project excellence as well as the  cost savings initiatives have been merely token gestures that as stated in the above referenced financials have not only failed in generating net cost savings but adjusted ebitda has actually declined we are calling on the board and management to uphold their fiduciary responsibility and take aggressive actions with a sense of urgency we are calling for the following  a detailed review of all expenses some of which are but not limited to travel and entertainment rationalization of real estateleases unnecessary overtime optimization of matching labor hours with peak times cost of internet and telephones in every location rebidding cleaning services rebidding and negotiating shipping expenses communication with every store manager to have a goal of saving  per month per store  million cumulative annual impact at stores alone we are calling on top executives to voluntarily agree to salary reductions that result in a cumulative annual savings of  million with an offsetting increase in stock based compensation aligning interests with shareholders the goal of this expense reduction initiative will be a minimum of  million annually which is only half of the original project excellence goal  a  million stock buyback it is time that nwy return cash to shareholders we estimate that by the end of q january st  nwy will have approximately  million in gross cash and  million in net cash our math is as follows nwy will collect  million under their new private label credit card agreement on january th plus a minimum of  million in q free cash flow generation the past four years q fcf has ranged between  million we estimate the pro forma enterprise value at  new board member  with a track record of operational excellence and creation of shareholder value we thank all of the hardworking nwy employees we wish them and their families a blessed and safe holiday season we look forward to a constructive and amicable dialogue with nwy management and the board lastly a prosperous  that is inclusive of the shareholders not just a few at the top sincerely david kanen president
