your email address subject message send message company summary promentis pharmaceuticals inc is a pharmaceutical company developing novel compounds for the treatment of schizophrenia and other central nervous system disorders promentis drug development efforts are focused on the neurotransmitter glutamate and its critical role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and other diseases impaired cortical function due at least in part to altered glutamate signaling and oxidative stress is a key event that likely contributes to a number of central nervous system cns disorders as a result molecular mechanisms capable of regulating levels of either glutamate or glutathione or both represent novel and potentially promising treatment targets promentis believes that its approach takes broader account of the components within the glutamatergic system and possesses the potential to restore imbalances thought to be responsible for many cns disorders including schizophrenia autism and parkinsons disease thus promentis is aggressively embarking on an effort to develop molecules that will redefine what is possible in the treatment of these conditions verified status
