on right scentcarcasses valley proteins has reduced odors at its va plant and says it will in curtis bay toomarch  by rona kobell  rona kobellsun staffwinchester va  valley proteins vice president michael smith stands next to the animalrendering business his grandfather built among the apple orchards and inhales deeplythere is no hint of the rottengarbage smell that baltimore residents say they endured for decades  until a fire destroyed the companys curtis bay cooker two years ago and forced it to stop rendering animals there though the winchester plant renders several truckloads of carcasses a day the main odor outside the plant is the pine tinge of smiths colognesmith credits the lack of odors to a yearold renovation that upgraded the winchester plants wastewater treatment systems and added scrubbers to control emissionswe think weve done a great job in winchester smith said but weve got an even better plan for baltimorethat plan is a  million expansion of the curtis bay plant including a rebuilt cooker that will turn animal byproducts into livestock feed fuels lubricants and other products currently valley proteins is recycling only restaurant grease in curtis baythe company is waiting for the maryland department of the environment to grant it an airquality permit so rendering can resume meanwhile residents are rallying the oppositiona local developer planning  homes near the plant is challenging valley proteins building permits before the anne arundel county board of appeals and two maryland state senators introduced a bill  unanimously voted down last week  to forbid rendering plants from operating near homessmith said he understands the concerns but that those problems are in the past he said the benefits of rendering  keeping animal parts out of landfills and recycling them into useful products  should far outweigh any concernsthis is not something that can be driven off to mexico or some other foreign country smith said this is an essential business to protect our environment and our citizensnot glamorousrendering plants may not be the most popular neighbors but the service they provide keeps the livestock industry humming the national renderers association an alexandriabased trade group representing  companies estimates the plants recycle about  billion pounds of raw material each year  about  tons a dayrendering plants also establish a trail for addressing ills such as mad cow disease and the avian flu computerized systems ensure that cow remnants dont go for bovine consumptionif bird flu strikes renderers can quarantine plants to process infected chickensits not the glamorous side of the livestock industry said association president tom cook but if you didnt render you probably wouldnt have a livestock industrythe processat the winchester plant drivers back up their trucks to a garage and unload the animal byproducts collected from supermarkets and slaughterhouses the meat then enters a cooker which looks like a petroleum tank and operates like a deepfryer and is heated to between  and  degrees the substance then is drained and separatedthe solid meat goes through a press then a hammermill to become a granulated protein meal for animals the meats fat is pumped out centrifuged and transformed into fats that can be used for cosmetics and lubricants the fats fuel also occasionally heats the plantthe winchester plant also recycles restaurant grease which comes in gallon or gallon drums  an amount smith says could clog any sewer system if it werent renderedan old fryingoil smell is unmistakable inside the plant where signs warn danger  high voltage and the yellow railings are coated in a brownish greasesanitizing stepsbut aside from the occasional government regulator few visitors venture inside far more important to community relations is whats outside where a geyserlike pump pushes wastewater through a series of sanitizing stepswhen the water runs its course smith said its clean enough for the plant to use as a floor scrubthe water goes back through the treatment system and eventually lands in a storage pond where its sprayed on hay crops and grassthough the plants neighbors in winchester occasionally complained of odors before the renovation smith said he hardly hears anything now one of the most frequent complainers wrote smith to say recent odor controls have made life more enjoyablethe rendering business has changed since clyde a smith founded the winchester operation in  at that time conditions were so difficult that he nearly lost the company twice when he died in  gerald f smith michaels father took over the employee companyby the time gerald smith died last year valley proteins had swelled to one of the nations largest rendering
