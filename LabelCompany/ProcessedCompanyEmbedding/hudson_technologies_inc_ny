january   is a refrigerant services company providing innovative solutions to recurring problems within the refrigeration industry the company’s operations consist of one reportable segment the companys products and services are primarily used in commercial air conditioning industrial processing and refrigeration systems and include refrigerant and industrial gas sales refrigerant management services consisting primarily of reclamation of refrigerants and refrigerantside® services performed at a customers site consisting of system decontamination to remove moisture oils and other contaminants in addition the company’s smartenergy ops tm service is a webbased real time continuous monitoring service applicable to a facility’s refrigeration systems and other energy systems the company’s chiller chemistry® and chill smart® services are also predictive and diagnostic service offerings as a component of the company’s products and services the company also participates in the generation of carbon offset projects the company operates principally through its whollyowned subsidiary hudson technologies company unless the context requires otherwise references to the “company” “hudson” “we “us” “our” or similar pronouns refer to hudson technologies inc and its subsidiaries   the companys executive offices are located at one blue hill plaza pearl river new york and its telephone number is   the company maintains a website at wwwhudsontechcom  the contents of which are not incorporated into this filing   industry background   the company participates in an industry that is highly regulated and changes in the regulations affecting our business could affect our operating results currently the company purchases virgin hydro chlorofluorocarbon “hcfc” and hydro fluorocarbon “hfc” refrigerants and reclaimable primarily hcfc hfc and chlorofluorocarbon “cfc” refrigerants from suppliers and its customers effective january   the clean air act as amended the “act” prohibited the production of virgin cfc refrigerants and limited the production of virgin hcfc refrigerants effective january  the act further limited the production of virgin hcfc refrigerants and federal regulations were enacted which established production and consumption allowances for hcfc refrigerants and which imposed limitations on the importation of certain virgin hcfc refrigerants under the act production of certain virgin hcfc refrigerants is scheduled to be phased out during the period  through  and production of all virgin hcfc refrigerants is scheduled to be phased out by  in october  the epa published a final rule providing further reductions in the production and consumption allowances for virgin hcfc refrigerants for the years  through  the “final rule” in the final rule the epa has established a linear annual phase down schedule for the production or importation of virgin hcfc that started at approximately  million pounds in  and reduces by approximately  million pounds each year and ends at zero in    hfc refrigerants are used as substitutes for cfc and hcfc refrigerants in certain applications as a result of the increasing restrictions and limitations on the production and use of cfc and hcfc refrigerants various segments of the air conditioning and refrigeration industry have been replacing or modifying equipment that utilize cfc and hcfc refrigerants and have been transitioning to equipment that utilize hfc refrigerants and hydrofluoroolefins “hfo” hfc refrigerants are not ozone depleting chemicals and are not currently regulated under the act however certain hfc refrigerants are highly weighted greenhouse gases that are believed to contribute to global warming and climate change and as a result are now subject to various state and federal regulations relating to the sale use and emissions of hfc refrigerants the company expects that hfc refrigerants eventually will be replaced by hfos or other types of products with lower global warming potentials   in october  more than  countries including the united states agreed to amend the montreal protocol to phase down production of hfcs by  between now and  the amendment establishes timetables for all developed and developing countries to freeze and then reduce production and use of hfcs with the first reductions by developed countries starting in  the amendment becomes effective january   if twenty countries ratify the amendment to date the amendment has not been ratified by the united states   the act and the federal regulations enacted under authority of the act have mandated andor promoted responsible use practices in the air conditioning and refrigeration industry which are intended to minimize the release of refrigerants into the atmosphere and encourage the recovery and reuse of refrigerants the act prohibits the venting of cfc hfc and hcfc refrigerants and prohibits andor phases down the production of cfc and hcfc refrigerants   the act also mandates the recovery of cfc and hcfc refrigerants and also promotes and encourages reuse and reclamation of cfc and hcfc refrigerants under the act owners operators and companies servicing cooling equipment utilizing cfc and hcfc refrigerants are responsible for the integrity of the systems regardless of the refrigerant being used in november  the epa issued a final rule extending these requirements to hfcs and to certain other refrigerants that are approved by the epa as alternatives for cfc and hcfc refrigerants             products and services   from its inception the company has sold refrigerants and has provided refrigerant reclamation and refrigerant management services that are designed to recover and reuse refrigerants thereby protecting the environment from release to the atmosphere and the corresponding ozone depletion and global warming impact the reclamation process allows the refrigerant to be reused thereby eliminating the need to destroy or manufacture additional refrigerant and eliminating the corresponding impact to the environment associated with the destruction and manufacturing  the company believes it is the largest refrigerant reclaimer in the united states  additionally the company has created alternative solutions to reactive and preventative maintenance procedures that are performed on commercial and industrial refrigeration systems  these services known as refrigerantside® services complement the company’s refrigerant sales and refrigerant reclamation and management services  the company has also developed smartenergy ops tm that identify inefficiencies in the operation of air conditioning and refrigeration systems and assists companies to improve the energy efficiency of their systems and save operating costs and improve system reliability  in addition the company is pursuing potential opportunities for the creation and monetization of verified emission reductions   refrigerant and industrial gas sales   the company sells reclaimed and virgin new refrigerants to a variety of customers in various segments of the air conditioning and refrigeration industry and sells industrial gases to a variety of industry segments the company continues to sell reclaimed cfc based refrigerants which are no longer manufactured virgin noncfc refrigerants including hcfc and hfc refrigerants are purchased by the company from several suppliers and resold by the company typically at wholesale additionally the company regularly purchases used or contaminated refrigerants some of which are cfc based from many different sources which refrigerants are then reclaimed using the companys high speed proprietary reclamation equipment its proprietary zugibeast® system and then are resold by the company   refrigerant management services   the company provides a complete offering of refrigerant management services which primarily include reclamation of refrigerants laboratory testing through the company’s laboratory which has been certified by the air conditioning heating and refrigeration institute “ahri” and banking storage services tailored to individual customer requirements hudson also separates “crossed” ie commingled refrigerants and provides reusable cylinder refurbishment and hydrostatic testing services   refrigerantside® services   the company provides decontamination and recovery services that are performed at a customers site through the use of portable high volume highspeed proprietary equipment including the patented zugibeast® system  certain of these refrigerantside® services which encompass system decontamination and refrigerant recovery and reclamation are also proprietary and are covered by process patents   in addition to the decontamination and recovery services previously described the company also provides predictive and diagnostic services for its customers  the company offers diagnostic services that are intended to predict potential problems in air conditioning and refrigeration systems before they occur  the company’s chiller chemistry® offering integrates several fluid tests of an operating system and the corresponding laboratory results into an engineering report providing its customers with an understanding of the current condition of the fluids the cause for any abnormal findings and the potential consequences if the abnormal findings are not remediated  fluid chemistry® an abbreviated version of the company’s chiller chemistry® offering is designed to quickly identify systems that require further examination   the company has also been awarded several us patents for its smartenergy ops tm  which is a system for measuring modifying and improving the efficiency of energy systems including air conditioning and refrigeration systems in industrial and commercial applications this service is a webbased real time continuous monitoring service applicable to a facility’s chiller plant systems the smartenergy ops tm offering enables customers to monitor and improve their chiller plant performance and proactively identify and correct system inefficiencies smartenergy ops tm is able to identify specific inefficiencies in the operation of chiller plant systems and when used with hudson’s refrigerantside ® services can increase the efficiency of the operating systems thereby reducing energy usage and costs improving the system efficiency reduces power consumption thereby directly reducing co  emissions at the power plants or onsite   lastly the company’s chillsmart ® offering which combines the system optimization with the company’s chiller chemistry ® offering provides a snapshot of a packaged chiller’s operating efficiency and health chillsmart® provides a very effective predictive maintenance tool and helps our customers to identify the operating chillers that cause higher operating costs   the company’s engineers who developed and support smart energy ops tm are recognized as energy experts and qualified best practices specialists by the united states department of energy “doe” in the areas of steam and process heating under the doe “best practices” program and are the lead international energy experts for steam chillers and refrigeration systems for the united nations industrial development organization “unido”  the company’s staff have trained more than  industrial plant personnel in the us and internationally and have developed and are currently delivering training curriculums in  different countries  the company’s staff have completed more than  industrial esas in the us and internationally             carbon offset projects   cfc refrigerants are ozone depleting substances and are also highly weighted greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming and climate change the destruction of cfc refrigerants may be eligible for verified emission reductions that can be converted and monetized into carbon offset credits that may be traded in the emerging carbon offset markets the company is pursuing opportunities to acquire cfc refrigerants and is developing relationships within the emerging environmental markets in order to develop opportunities for the creation and monetization of verified emission reductions from the destruction of cfc refrigerants   in october  the american carbon registry “acr” established a methodology to provide among other things a quantification framework for the creation of carbon offset credits for the use of certified reclaimed hfc refrigerants the company is pursuing opportunities to acquire hfc refrigerants and is developing relationships within the emerging environmental markets in order to develop opportunities for the creation and monetization of verified emission reductions from the reclamation of hfc refrigerants   the following is a summary of revenues over the last three years   years ended december                 in thousands                         product and related sales

pottsboro texas —telemarketing office   strategic alliances   the company believes that the international market for refrigerant reclamation sales and services is equal in size to the united states market for those sales and services the company has alliances in europe and south africa and over time the company expects to introduce its technology and offerings to several other markets around the world   suppliers   the companys financial performance and its ability to sell refrigerants is in part dependent on its ability to obtain sufficient quantities of virgin noncfc based refrigerants and of reclaimable cfc and noncfc based refrigerants from manufacturers wholesalers distributors bulk gas brokers and from other sources within the air conditioning refrigeration and automotive aftermarket industries and on corresponding demand for refrigerants the companys refrigerant sales include cfc based refrigerants which are no longer manufactured additionally the companys refrigerant sales include noncfc based refrigerants including hcfc and hfc refrigerants which are the mostwidely used refrigerants effective january   the act limited the production of virgin hcfc refrigerants which production was further limited in january  federal regulations enacted in january  established production and consumption allowances for hcfcs and imposed limitations on the importation of certain virgin hcfc refrigerants under the act production of certain virgin hcfc refrigerants is scheduled to be phased out during the period  through  and production of all virgin hcfc refrigerants is scheduled to be phased out by  in october  the epa published the final rule providing further reductions in the production and consumption allowances for virgin hcfc refrigerants for the years  through  in the final rule the epa has established a linear annual phase down schedule for the production or importation of virgin hcfc that will start at approximately  million pounds in  and reduce by approximately  million pounds each year and end at zero in    in october  more than  countries including the united states agreed to amend the montreal protocol to phase down production of hfcs by  between now and  the amendment establishes timetables for all developed and developing countries to freeze and then reduce production and use of hfcs with the first reductions by developed countries starting in  the amendment becomes effective january   if twenty countries ratify the amendment to date the amendment has not been ratified by the united states             customers   the company provides its services to commercial industrial and governmental customers as well as to refrigerant wholesalers distributors contractors and to refrigeration equipment manufacturers agreements with larger customers generally provide for standardized pricing for specified services the company generates sales by purchase order on a realtime basis and therefore does not carry a backlog of sales   for the year ended december   two customers each accounted for  or more of the company’s revenues and in the aggregate these two customers accounted for  of the company’s revenues at december   there were no outstanding receivables from these customers   for the year ended december   two customers each accounted for  or more of the company’s revenues and in the aggregate these two customers accounted for  of the company’s revenues at december   there were no outstanding receivables from these customers   for the year ended december   two customers each accounted for  or more of the company’s revenues and in the aggregate these two customers accounted for  of the company’s revenues at december   there were  million in outstanding receivables from these customers   marketing   marketing programs are conducted through the efforts of the companys executive officers company sales personnel and third parties hudson employs various marketing methods including direct mailings technical bulletins inperson solicitation print advertising response to quotation requests and the internet through the company’s website  wwwhudsontechcom  information on the companys website is not part of this report   the companys sales personnel are compensated on a combination of a base salary and commission the companys executive officers devote significant time and effort to customer relationships   competition   the company competes primarily on the basis of the performance of its proprietary high volume highspeed equipment used in its operations the breadth of services offered by the company including proprietary refrigerantside® services and other onsite services and price particularly with respect to refrigerant sales   the company competes with numerous regional and national companies that market reclaimed and virgin refrigerants and provide refrigerant reclamation services certain of these competitors possess greater financial marketing distribution and other resources for the sale and distribution of refrigerants than the company and in some instances serve a more extensive geographic area than the company   hudsons refrigerantside® services provide new and innovative solutions to certain problems within the refrigeration industry and as such the demand and market acceptance for these services are subject to uncertainty competition for these services primarily consists of traditional methods of solving the industrys problems the company’s marketing strategy is to educate the marketplace that its alternative solutions are available and that refrigerantside® services are superior to traditional methods   insurance   the company carries insurance coverage that it considers sufficient to protect the companys assets and operations the company currently maintains general commercial liability insurance and excess liability coverage for claims up to  per occurrence and  in the aggregate the company attempts to operate in a professional and prudent manner and to reduce potential liability risks through specific risk management efforts including ongoing employee training   the refrigerant industry involves potentially significant risks of statutory and common law liability for environmental damage and personal injury the company and in certain instances its officers directors and employees may be subject to claims arising from the companys onsite or offsite services including the improper release spillage misuse or mishandling of refrigerants classified as hazardous or nonhazardous substances or materials the company may be held strictly liable for damages which could be substantial regardless of whether it exercised due care and complied with all relevant laws and regulations   hudson maintains environmental impairment insurance of  per occurrence and  annual aggregate for events occurring subsequent to november              government regulation   the business of refrigerant sales reclamation and management is subject to extensive stringent and frequently changing federal state and local laws and substantial regulation under these laws by governmental agencies including the epa the united states occupational safety and health administration “osha” and the united states department of transportation “dot”   among other things these regulatory authorities impose requirements which regulate the handling packaging labeling transportation and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous materials and the health and safety of workers and require the company and in certain instances its employees to obtain and maintain licenses in connection with its operations this extensive regulatory framework imposes significant compliance burdens and risks on the company   hudson and its customers are subject to the requirements of the act and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the epa which make it unlawful for any person in the course of maintaining servicing repairing and disposing of air conditioning or refrigeration equipment to knowingly vent or otherwise release or dispose of ozone depleting substances and nonozone depleting substitutes used as refrigerants   pursuant to the act reclaimed refrigerant must satisfy the same purity standards as newly manufactured virgin refrigerants in accordance with standards established by ahri prior to resale to a person other than the owner of the equipment from which it was recovered the epa administers a certification program pursuant to which applicants certify to reclaim refrigerants in compliance with ahri standards the company is one of only four certified refrigerant testing laboratories in the united states under ahri’s laboratory certification program which is a voluntary program that certifies the ability of a laboratory to test refrigerant in accordance with the ahri  standard   in addition the epa has established a mandatory certification program for air conditioning and refrigeration technicians hudsons technicians have applied for or obtained such certification   the company may also be subject to regulations adopted by the epa which impose reporting requirements arising out of the importation of certain hcfcs and arising out of the importation purchase production use andor emissions of certain greenhouse gases including hfcs   the company is also subject to regulations adopted by the dot which classify most refrigerants handled by the company as hazardous materials or substances and imposes requirements for handling packaging labeling and transporting refrigerants and which regulate the use and operation of the company’s commercial motor vehicles used in the company’s business   the resource conservation and recovery act of  as amended rcra requires facilities that treat store or dispose of hazardous wastes to comply with certain operating standards before transportation and disposal of hazardous wastes offsite generators of such waste must package and label their shipments consistent with detailed regulations and prepare a manifest identifying the material and stating its destination the transporter must deliver the hazardous waste in accordance with the manifest to a facility with an appropriate rcra permit under rcra impurities removed from refrigerants consisting of oils mixed with water and other contaminants are not presumed to be hazardous waste   the emergency planning and community righttoknow act of  as amended requires the annual reporting by the company of emergency and hazardous chemical inventories tier ii reports to the various states in which the company operates and requires the company to file annual toxic chemical release inventory forms with the epa   the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of  “cercla” establishes liability for cleanup costs and environmental damages to current and former facility owners and operators as well as persons who transport or arrange for transportation of hazardous substances almost all states have similar statutes regulating the handling and storage of hazardous substances hazardous wastes and nonhazardous wastes many such statutes impose requirements that are more stringent than their federal counterparts the company could be subject to substantial liability under these statutes to private parties and government entities in some instances without any fault for fines remediation costs and environmental damage as a result of the mishandling release or existence of any hazardous substances at any of its facilities   the occupational safety and health act of  as amended mandates requirements for a safe work place for employees and special procedures and measures for the handling of certain hazardous and toxic substances state laws in certain circumstances mandate additional measures for facilities handling specified materials   the company is also subject to regulations adopted by the california air resources board which impose certain reporting requirements arising out of the reclamation and sale of refrigerants that takes place within the state of california             the company believes that it is in material compliance with all applicable regulations material to its business operations   quality assurance  environmental compliance   the company utilizes inhouse quality and regulatory compliance control procedures hudson maintains its own analytical testing laboratory which is ahri certified to assure that reclaimed refrigerants comply with ahri purity standards and employs portable testing equipment when performing onsite services to verify certain quality specifications the company employs ten persons engaged fulltime in quality control and to monitor the companys operations for regulatory compliance   employees   on december   the company had  full time employees including air conditioning and refrigeration technicians chemists engineers sales and administrative personnel none of the companys employees are represented by a union the company believes it has good relations with its employees   patents and proprietary information   the company holds several us and foreign patents as well as pending patent applications related to certain refrigerantside® services and supporting systems developed by the company for systems and processes for measuring and improving the efficiency of refrigeration systems and for certain refrigerant recycling and reclamation technologies these patents will expire between february  and april    the company believes that patent protection is important to its business there can be no assurance as to the breadth or degree of protection that patents may afford the company that any patent applications will result in issued patents or that patents will not be circumvented or invalidated technological development in the refrigerant industry may result in extensive patent filings and a rapid rate of issuance of new patents although the company believes that its existing patents and the companys equipment do not and will not infringe upon existing patents or violate proprietary rights of others it is possible that the companys existing patent rights may not be valid or that infringement of existing or future patents or violations of proprietary rights of others may occur in the event the companys equipment or processes infringe or are alleged to infringe patents or other proprietary rights of others the company may be required to modify the design of its equipment or processes obtain a license or defend a possible patent infringement action there can be no assurance that the company will have the financial or other resources necessary to enforce or defend a patent infringement or proprietary rights violation action or that the company will not become liable for damages   the company also relies on trade secrets and proprietary knowhow and employs various methods to protect its technology however such methods may not afford complete protection and there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop such knowhow or obtain access to the companys knowhow concepts ideas and documentation failure to protect its trade secrets could have a material adverse effect on the company   sec filings   the company makes available on its internet website copies of its annual report on form k quarterly reports on form q current reports on form k and amendments thereto as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed with the securities and exchange commission   item a risk factors   there are many important factors including those discussed below and above as described under “patents and proprietary information” that have affected and in the future could affect hudson’s business including but not limited to the factors discussed below which should be reviewed carefully together with the other information contained in this report some of the factors are beyond hudson’s control and future trends are difficult to predict   our existing and future debt obligations could impair our liquidity and financial condition   our existing credit facility which currently expires in june  is secured by substantially all of our assets and contains formulas that limit the amount of our borrowings under the facility moreover the terms of our credit facility also include negative covenants that among other things may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness if we violate any loan covenants and do not obtain a waiver from our lender our indebtedness under the credit facility would become immediately due and payable and the lender could foreclose on its security which could materially adversely affect our business and future financial condition and could require us to curtail or otherwise cease our existing operations             we may need additional financing to satisfy our future capital requirements which may not be readily available to us    our capital requirements may be significant in the future in the future we may incur additional expenses in the development and implementation of our operations due to fluctuations in the price demand and availability of new refrigerants our existing credit facility that expires in june  may not in the future be sufficient to provide all of the capital that we need to acquire and manage our inventories of new refrigerant as a result we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing in order to develop our refrigerantside® services business our refrigerant sales business and our other businesses we have no current arrangements with respect to or sources of additional financing other than our existing credit facility there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all our inability to obtain financing if and when needed could materially adversely affect our business and future financial condition and could require us to curtail or otherwise cease our existing operations   adverse weather or economic downturn could adversely impact our financial results   our business could be negatively impacted by adverse weather or economic downturns weather is a significant factor in determining market demand for the refrigerants sold by us and to a lesser extent our refrigerantside® services unusually cool temperatures in the spring and summer tend to depress demand for and price of refrigerants we sell protracted periods of cooler than normal spring and summer weather could result in a substantial reduction in our sales which could adversely affect our financial position as well as our results of operations an economic downturn could cause customers to postpone or cancel purchases of the company’s products or services either or both of these conditions could have severe negative implications to our business that may exacerbate many of the risk factors we identified in this report but not limited to the following   liquidity   these conditions could reduce our liquidity and this could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations   demand   these conditions could lower the demand andor price for our product and services which would have a negative impact on our results of operations   the nature of our business exposes us to potential liability   the refrigerant recovery and reclamation industry involves potentially significant risks of statutory and common law liability for environmental damage and personal injury we and in certain instances our officers directors and employees may be subject to claims arising from our onsite or offsite services including the improper release spillage misuse or mishandling of refrigerants classified as hazardous or nonhazardous substances or materials we may be strictly liable for damages which could be substantial regardless of whether we exercised due care and complied with all relevant laws and regulations our current insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover potential claims and adequate levels of insurance coverage may not be available in the future at a reasonable cost a partially or completely uninsured claim against us if successful and of sufficient magnitude would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition   our business and financial condition is substantially dependent on the sale and continued environmental regulation of refrigerants   our business and prospects are largely dependent upon continued regulation of the use and disposition of refrigerants changes in government regulations relating to the emission of refrigerants into the atmosphere could have a material adverse effect on us failure by government authorities to otherwise continue to enforce existing regulations or significant relaxation of regulatory requirements could also adversely affect demand for our services and products   our business is subject to significant regulatory compliance burdens   the refrigerant reclamation and management business is subject to extensive stringent and frequently changing federal state and local laws and substantial regulation under these laws by governmental agencies including the epa the osha and dot although we believe that we are in material compliance with all applicable regulations material to our business operations amendments to existing statutes and regulations or adoption of new statutes and regulations which affect the marketing and sale of refrigerant could require us to continually alter our methods of operation andor discontinue the sale of certain of our products resulting in costs to us that could be substantial we may not be able for financial or other reasons to comply with applicable laws regulations and permit requirements particularly as we seek to enter into new geographic markets our failure to comply with applicable laws rules or regulations or permit requirements could subject us to civil remedies including substantial fines penalties and injunctions as well as possible criminal sanctions which would if of significant magnitude materially adversely impact our operations and future financial condition             a number of factors could negatively impact the price andor availability of refrigerants which would in turn adversely affect our business and financial condition   refrigerant sales continue to represent a significant majority of our revenues therefore our business is substantially dependent on the availability of both new and used refrigerants in large quantities which may be affected by several factors including without limitation i commercial production and consumption limitations imposed by the act and legislative limitations and ban on hcfc refrigerants ii the ban on production of cfc based refrigerants under the act iii the amendment to the montreal protocol if ratified and any legislation and regulation enacted to implement the amendment could impose limitations on production and consumption of hfc refrigerants iv introduction of new refrigerants and air conditioning and refrigeration equipment v price competition resulting from additional market entrants vi changes in government regulation on the use and production of refrigerants and vii reduction in demand for refrigerants we do not maintain firm agreements with any of our suppliers of refrigerants and we do not hold allowances permitting us to purchase and import hcfc refrigerants from abroad sufficient amounts of new andor used refrigerants may not be available to us in the future particularly as a result of the further phase down of hcfc production or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms additionally we may be subject to price fluctuations periodic delays or shortages of new andor used refrigerants our failure to obtain and resell sufficient quantities of virgin refrigerants on commercially reasonable terms or at all or to obtain reclaim and resell sufficient quantities of used refrigerants would have a material adverse effect on our operating margins and results of operations   as a result of competition and the strength of some of our competitors in the market we may not be able to compete effectively   the markets for our services and products are highly competitive we compete with numerous regional and national companies which provide refrigerant recovery and reclamation services as well as companies which market and deal in new and reclaimed alternative refrigerants including certain of our suppliers some of which possess greater financial marketing distribution and other resources than us we also compete with numerous manufacturers of refrigerant recovery and reclamation equipment certain of these competitors have established reputations for success in the service of air conditioning and refrigeration systems we may not be able to compete successfully particularly as we seek to enter into new markets   issues relating to potential global warming and climate change could have an impact on our business   refrigerants are considered to be strong greenhouse gases that are believed to contribute to global warming and climate change and are now subject to various state and federal regulations relating to the sale use and emissions of refrigerants current and future global warming and climate change or related legislation andor regulations may impose additional compliance burdens on us and on our customers and suppliers which could potentially result in increased administrative costs decreased demand in the marketplace for our products andor increased costs for our supplies and products in addition an amendment to the montreal protocol has established timetables for all developed and developing countries to freeze and then reduce production and use of hfcs by  between now and  with the first reductions by developed countries starting in  the amendment becomes effective january   if twenty countries ratify the amendment to date the amendment has not been ratified by the united states it is unclear if the united states will ratify the amendment and if it does ratify the amendment what legislation andor regulations will be enacted to implement the amendment   the loss of key management personnel would adversely impact our business   our success is largely dependent upon the efforts of our chief executive officer and chairman the loss of his services would have a material adverse

  the closing of the offering was held on december   at which time the company sold  shares of its common stock to the underwriters including  shares to cover overallotments at a price to the public of  per share less underwriting discounts and commissions and received gross proceeds of  million the company incurred approximately  million of transaction fees in connection with the offering resulting in net proceeds of  million             the company believes that it will be able to satisfy its working capital requirements for the foreseeable future from anticipated cash flows from operations and available funds under the pnc facility in addition the proceeds from the offering may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes which may include among other things funding additional acquisitions although we have no present commitments or agreements with respect to any such transactions any unanticipated expenses including but not limited to an increase in the cost of refrigerants purchased by the company an increase in operating expenses or failure to achieve expected revenues from the companys refrigerantside® services andor refrigerant sales or additional expansion or acquisition costs that may arise in the future would adversely affect the companys future capital needs there can be no assurance that the companys proposed or future plans will be successful and as such the company may require additional capital sooner than anticipated which capital may not be available on acceptable terms or at all   inflation   inflation has not historically had a material impact on the companys operations   reliance on suppliers and customers   the company participates in an industry that is highly regulated and changes in the regulations affecting our business could affect our operating results currently the company purchases virgin hcfc and hfc refrigerants and reclaimable primarily hcfc and cfc refrigerants from suppliers and its customers under the act the phasedown of future production of certain virgin hcfc refrigerants commenced in  and is scheduled to be fully phased out by the year  and production of all virgin hcfc refrigerants is scheduled to be phased out by the year  to the extent that the company is unable to source sufficient quantities of refrigerants or is unable to obtain refrigerants on commercially reasonable terms or experiences a decline in demand andor price for refrigerants sold by it the company could realize reductions in revenue from refrigerant sales which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s operating results and financial position   for the year ended december   two customers each accounted for  or more of the company’s revenues and in the aggregate these two customers accounted for  of the company’s revenues at december   there were no outstanding receivables from these customers   for the year ended december   two customers each accounted for  or more of the company’s revenues and in the aggregate these two customers accounted for  of the company’s revenues at december   there were no outstanding receivables from these customers   for the year ended december   two customers each accounted for  or more of the company’s revenues and in the aggregate these two customers accounted for  of the company’s revenues at december   there were  million in outstanding receivables from these customers   the loss of a principal customer or a decline in the economic prospects of andor a reduction in purchases of the companys products or services by any such customer could have a material adverse effect on the companys operating results and financial position   seasonality and weather conditions and fluctuations in operating results   the companys operating results vary from period to period as a result of weather conditions requirements of potential customers nonrecurring refrigerant and service sales availability and price of refrigerant products virgin or reclaimable changes in reclamation technology and regulations timing in introduction andor retrofit or replacement of refrigeration equipment the rate of expansion of the companys operations and by other factors the companys business is seasonal in nature with peak sales of refrigerants occurring in the first nine months of each year during past years the seasonal decrease in sales of refrigerants has resulted in losses particularly in the fourth quarter of the year in addition to the extent that there is unseasonably cool weather throughout the spring and summer months which would adversely affect the demand for refrigerants there would be a corresponding negative impact on the company delays or inability in securing adequate supplies of refrigerants at peak demand periods lack of refrigerant demand increased expenses declining refrigerant prices and a loss of a principal customer could result in significant losses there can be no assurance that the foregoing factors will not occur and result in a material adverse effect on the companys financial position and significant losses the company believes that to a lesser extent there is a similar seasonal element to refrigerantside® service revenues as refrigerant sales the company is continuing to assess its refrigerantside® service revenues seasonal trend   offbalance sheet arrangements   none

refrigerant management services consisting primarily of reclamation of refrigerants and refrigerantside® services performed at a customers site consisting of system decontamination to remove moisture oils and other contaminants in addition the company’s smartenergy ops tm service is a webbased real time continuous monitoring service applicable to a facility’s refrigeration systems and other energy systems the company’s chiller chemistry® and chill smart® services are also predictive and diagnostic service offerings as a component of the company’s products and services the company also participates in the generation of carbon offset projects the company operates principally through its whollyowned subsidiary hudson technologies company unless the context requires otherwise references to the “company” “hudson” “we “us” “our” or similar pronouns refer to hudson technologies inc and its subsidiaries   in preparing the accompanying consolidated financial statements and in accordance with asc “subsequent events” the company’s management has evaluated subsequent events through the date that the financial statements were filed   in the opinion of management all estimates and adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included and all such adjustments were normal and recurring   consolidation   the consolidated financial statements represent all companies of which hudson directly or indirectly has majority ownership or otherwise controls significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated the companys consolidated financial statements include the accounts of whollyowned subsidiaries hudson holdings inc and hudson technologies company the company does not present a statement of comprehensive income as its comprehensive income is the same as its net income   fair value of financial instruments   the carrying values of financial instruments including trade accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value at december   and december   because of the relatively short maturity of these instruments the carrying value of short and longterm debt approximates fair value due to the variable rate nature of the debt as of december   and december   please see note  for further details on fair value description and hierarchy of the company’s deferred acquisition cost   credit risk   financial instruments which potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments and trade accounts receivable the company maintains its temporary cash investments in highlyrated financial institutions and at times the balances exceed fdic insurance coverage the companys trade accounts receivable are primarily due from companies throughout the united states the company reviews each customers credit history before extending credit   the company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based on factors associated with the credit risk of specific accounts historical trends and other information the carrying value of the company’s accounts receivable is reduced by the established allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts includes any accounts receivable balances that are determined to be uncollectible along with a general reserve for the remaining accounts receivable balances the company adjusts its reserves based on factors that affect the collectability of the accounts receivable balances   for the year ended december   two customers each accounted for  or more of the company’s revenues and in the aggregate these two customers accounted for  of the company’s revenues at december   there were no outstanding receivables from these customers   for the year ended

reduction in purchases of the companys products or services by any such customer could have a material adverse effect on the companys operating results and financial position   cash and cash equivalents   temporary investments with original maturities of ninety days or less are included in cash and cash equivalents   inventories   inventories consisting primarily of refrigerant products available for sale are stated at the lower of cost on a firstin firstout basis or market where the market price of inventory is less than the related cost the company may be required to write down its inventory through a lower of cost or market adjustment the impact of which would be reflected in cost of sales on the consolidated statements of operations any such adjustment would be based on management’s judgment regarding future demand and market conditions and analysis of historical experience   property plant and equipment   property plant and equipment are stated at cost including internally manufactured equipment the cost to complete equipment that is under construction is not considered to be material to the companys financial position provision for depreciation is recorded for financial reporting purposes using the straightline method over the useful lives of the respective assets leasehold improvements are amortized on a straightline basis over the shorter of economic life or terms of the respective leases costs of maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred   due to the specialized nature of the companys business it is possible that the companys estimates of equipment useful life periods may change in the future   goodwill   goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in business combinations accounted for under the purchase method of accounting the company performed the annual goodwill impairment assessment using a qualitative approach to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value in performing the qualitative assessment we identify and consider the significance of relevant key factors events and circumstances that affect the fair value of our goodwill these factors include external factors such as macroeconomic industry and market conditions as well as entityspecific factors such as our actual and planned financial performance if the results of the qualitative assessment conclude that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill exceeds its carrying value additional quantitative impairment testing is performed   revenues and cost of sales   revenues are recorded upon completion of service or product shipment and passage of title to customers in accordance with contractual terms the company evaluates each sale to ensure collectability in addition each sale is based on an arrangement with the customer and the sales price to the customer is fixed in july  the company was awarded as prime contractor a fiveyear contract including a fiveyear renewal option by the united states defense logistics agency “dla” for the management supply and sale of refrigerants compressed gases cylinders and related terms due to the contract containing multiple elements the company assessed the arrangement in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc”   revenue recognition multipleelement arrangements  asc  addresses when and how a company that is providing more than one revenue generating activity or deliverable should separate and account for a multiple element arrangement the company determined that the sale of refrigerants and the management services provided under the contract each have standalone value and accordingly revenue related to the sale of product is recognized at the time of product shipment and service revenue is recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the arrangement annual service revenue under the contract is approximately  million of which  million was recognized during  and recorded in product and related sales   cost of sales is recorded based on the cost of products shipped or services performed and related direct operating costs of the companys facilities to the extent that the company charges its customers shipping fees such amounts are included as a component of revenue and the corresponding costs are included as a component of cost of sales             the companys revenues are derived from product and related sales and refrigerantside® services revenues the revenues for each of these lines are as follows   years ended december                 in thousands                         product and related sales                   refrigerantside ® services                      total                     income taxes   the company utilizes the asset and liability method for recording deferred income taxes which provides for the establishment of deferred tax asset or liability accounts based on the difference between tax and financial reporting bases of certain assets and liabilities the tax benefit associated with the companys net operating loss carry forwards “nols” is recognized to the extent that the company is expected to recognize future taxable income the company assesses the recoverability of its deferred tax assets based on its expectation that it will recognize future taxable income and adjusts its valuation allowance accordingly as of december   and  the net deferred tax asset was  million and  million respectively   certain states either do not allow or limit nols and as such the company will be liable for certain state taxes to the extent that the company utilizes its nols it will not pay tax on such income but may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax in addition to the extent that the company’s net income if any exceeds the annual nol limitation it will pay income taxes based on existing statutory rates moreover as a result of a “change in control” as defined by the internal revenue service the company’s ability to utilize its existing nols is subject to certain annual limitations all of the company’s remaining  million of nols are subject to annual limitations of  million   as a result of an internal revenue service audit the  and prior federal tax years have been closed the company operates in many states throughout the united states and as of december   the various states’ statutes of limitations remain open for tax years subsequent to  the company recognizes interest and penalties if any relating to income taxes as a component of the provision for income taxes   the company evaluates uncertain tax positions if any by determining if it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities as of december   and  the company had no uncertain tax positions   income per common and equivalent shares   if dilutive common equivalent shares common shares assuming exercise of options and warrants utilizing the treasury stock method are considered in the presentation of diluted earnings per share the reconciliation of shares used to determine net income per share is as

during the years ended december    and  certain options and warrants aggregating   and  shares respectively have been excluded from the calculation of diluted shares due to the fact that their effect would be antidilutive   estimates and risks   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the results of operations during the reporting period actual results could differ from these estimates             the company utilizes both internal and external sources to evaluate potential current and future liabilities for various commitments and contingencies in the event that the assumptions or conditions change in the future the estimates could differ from the original estimates   several of the companys accounting policies involve significant judgments uncertainties and estimates the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions to the extent that actual results differ from managements judgments and estimates there could be a material adverse effect on the company on a continuous basis the company evaluates its estimates including but not limited to those estimates related to its allowance for doubtful accounts inventory reserves and valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets relating to its nols and commitments and contingencies with respect to accounts receivable the company estimates the necessary allowance for doubtful accounts based on both historical and anticipated trends of payment history and the ability of the customer to fulfill its obligations for inventory the company evaluates both current and anticipated sales prices of its products to determine if a write down of inventory to net realizable value is necessary in determining the company’s valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets the company assesses its ability to generate taxable income in the future   the company participates in an industry that is highly regulated and changes in the regulations affecting our business could affect our operating results currently the company purchases virgin hydrochlorofluorocarbon “hcfc” and hydrofluorocarbon “hfc” refrigerants and reclaimable primarily hcfc hfc and chlorofluorocarbon “cfc” refrigerants from suppliers and its customers effective january   the clean air act the “act” prohibited the production of virgin cfc refrigerants and limited the production of virgin hcfc refrigerants effective january  the act further limited the production of virgin hcfc refrigerants and federal regulations were enacted which established production and consumption allowances for hcfc refrigerants which imposed limitations on the importation of certain virgin hcfc refrigerants under the act production of certain virgin hcfc refrigerants is scheduled to be phased out during the period  through  and production of all virgin hcfc refrigerants is scheduled to be phased out by  in april  the environmental protection agency “epa” published a final rule providing for the production or importation of  million and  million pounds of hcfc in  and  respectively in october  the epa published a final rule providing further reductions in the production and consumption allowances for virgin hcfc refrigerants for the years  through  the “final rule” in the final rule the epa has established a linear draw down for the production or importation of virgin hcfc that started at approximately  million pounds in  and reduces by approximately  million pounds each year and ends at zero in    to the extent that the company is unable to source sufficient quantities of refrigerants or is unable to obtain refrigerants on commercially reasonable terms or experiences a decline in demand andor price for refrigerants sold by the company the company could realize reductions in revenue from refrigerant sales which could have a material adverse effect on its operating results and its financial position   the company is subject to various legal proceedings the company assesses the merit and potential liability associated with each of these proceedings in addition the company estimates potential liability if any related to these matters to the extent that these estimates are not accurate or circumstances change in the future the company could realize liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on its operating results and its financial position   impairment of longlived assets   the company reviews longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less the cost to sell   recent accounting pronouncements   in august  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no  classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments this asu addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of eliminating the existing diversity in practice the amendments in this asu are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods therein we elected to adopt asu  as of december   and the adoption did not have a material impact on the presentation of the statement of cash flows   in june  the fasb issued asu no  financial instruments  credit losses this asu requires an organization to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts financial institutions and other organizations will now use forwardlooking information to better inform their credit loss estimates the amendments in this asu are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods therein the company does not expect the amended standard to have a material impact on the company’s results of operations             in march  the fasb issued asu no  “improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting” excess tax benefits and deficiencies will be recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings rather than capital in excess of par value of stock on a prospective basis a policy election will be available to account for forfeitures as they occur with the cumulative effect of the change recognized as an adjustment to retained earnings at the date of adoption excess tax benefits within the consolidated statement of cash flows will be presented as an operating activity prospective or retrospective application and cash payments to tax authorities in connection with shares withheld for statutory tax withholding requirements will be presented as a financing activity retrospective application the guidance is effective beginning in  the company expects that the future adoption of asu no  will not have a material impact on the company’s financial statements   in february  the fasb issued asu   leases topic  the new standard establishes a rightofuse rou model that requires a lessee to record a rou asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than  months leases will be classified as either finance or operating with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the statement of operations this asu is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   including interim periods within those fiscal years and early adoption is permitted a modified retrospective transition approach is required for capital and operating leases existing at or entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements with certain practical expedients available at a minimum adoption of asu  will require recording a rou asset and a lease liability on the companys consolidated balance sheet however the company is still currently evaluating the impact on its consolidated financial statements see note  for the current anticipated future operating lease payments   in november  the fasb issued asu  “income taxes topic   balance sheet classification of deferred taxes” asu  requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position the amendments in asu  apply to all entities that present a classified statement of financial position the current requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets of a taxpaying component of an entity be offset and presented as a single amount is not affected for public business entities the amendments in asu  are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after december   and interim periods within those annual periods the company elected to early adopt asu  prospectively in the fourth quarter of  as a result all deferred tax assets and liabilities have been presented as noncurrent on the consolidated balance sheet as of december   there was no impact on our results of operations as a result of the adoption of asu  and prior periods have not been adjusted   in september  the fasb issued accounting standards update no  “business combinations topic  simplifying the accounting for measurementperiod adjustments” or asu  this amendment requires the acquirer in a business combination to recognize in the reporting period in which adjustment amounts are determined any adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date prior to the issuance of asu  an acquirer was required to restate prior period financial statements as of the acquisition date for adjustments to provisional amounts the amendments in asu  are to be applied prospectively upon adoption the company adopted asu  in the fourth quarter of  the adoption of the provisions of asu  did not have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position   in may  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu   revenue from contracts with customers topic   the new revenue recognition standard provides a fivestep analysis to determine when and how revenue is recognized the standard requires that a company recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which a company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services this asu is effective for annual periods beginning after december   and will be applied retrospectively to each period presented or as a cumulativeeffect adjustment as of the date of adoption the company is currently evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of asu     note  fair value   asc subtopic  defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date the company often utilizes certain assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability including assumptions about risk andor the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique these inputs can be readily observable marketcorroborated or generally unobservable inputs the company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs based upon observable inputs used in the valuation techniques the company is required to provide information according to the fair value hierarchy             the fair value hierarchy ranks the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values into three broad levels as follows   level  valuations for assets and liabilities traded in active markets from readily available pricing sources for market transactions involving identical assets or liabilities   level  valuations for assets and liabilities traded in less active dealer or broker markets  valuations are obtained from thirdparty pricing services for identical or similar assets or liabilities   level  valuations for assets and liabilities include certain unobservable inputs in the assumptions and projections used in determining the fair value assigned to such assets or liabilities   in instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety the companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability the valuation methodologies used for the companys financial instruments measured on a recurring basis at fair value including the

the date the statement was made critical accounting policies the companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities several of the companys accounting policies involve significant judgments uncertainties and estimates the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions to the extent that actual results differ from managements judgments and estimates there could be a material adverse effect on the company on a continuous basis the company

its net operating loss carry forwards nols and commitments and contingencies with respect to accounts receivable the company estimates the necessary allowance for doubtful accounts based on both historical and anticipated trends of payment history and the ability of the customer to fulfill its obligations for inventory the company evaluates both current and anticipated sales prices of its products to determine if a write down of inventory to net realizable value is necessary in determining the companys valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets the company assesses its ability to generate taxable income in the future goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in business combinations accounted for under the purchase method of accounting the company tests for any impairment of goodwill annually unless indicators arise intangibles with determinable lives are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the assets currently ranging from  to  years the company reviews these useful lives annually to determine that they reflect future realizable value the company utilizes both internal and external sources to evaluate potential current and future liabilities for various commitments and contingencies in the event that the assumptions or conditions change in the future the estimates could differ from the

million of transaction fees in connection with the offering resulting in net proceeds of  million inflation inflation has not historically had a material impact on the companys operations reliance on suppliers and customers the company participates in an industry that is highly regulated and changes in the regulations affecting our business could affect our operating results currently the company purchases virgin hcfc and hfc refrigerants and reclaimable primarily hcfc and cfc refrigerants from suppliers and its customers under the act the phasedown of future production of certain virgin hcfc refrigerants commenced in  and is scheduled to be fully phased out by the year  and production of all virgin hcfc refrigerants is scheduled to be phased out by the year  to the extent that the company is unable to source sufficient quantities of refrigerants or is unable to obtain refrigerants on commercially reasonable terms or experiences a decline in demand andor price for refrigerants sold by it the company could realize reductions in revenue from refrigerant sales which could have a material adverse effect on the companys operating results and financial position for the three month period ended march   two customers each accounted for  or more of the companys revenues and in the aggregate these two customers accounted for  of the companys revenues at march   there were  million in outstanding receivables from these customers for the three month period ended march   two customers each accounted for  or more of the companys revenues and in the aggregate these two customers accounted for  of the companys revenues at march   there were  in outstanding receivables from these customers the loss of a principal customer or a decline in the economic prospects of andor a reduction in purchases of the companys products or services by any such customer could have a material adverse effect on the companys operating results and financial position seasonality and weather conditions and fluctuations in operating results the companys operating results vary from period to period as a result of weather conditions requirements of potential customers nonrecurring refrigerant and service sales availability and price of refrigerant products virgin or reclaimable changes in reclamation technology and regulations timing in introduction andor retrofit or replacement of refrigeration equipment the rate of expansion of the companys operations and by other factors the companys business is seasonal in nature with peak sales of refrigerants occurring in the first half of each year during past years the seasonal decrease in sales of refrigerants has resulted in losses particularly in the fourth quarter of the year in addition to the extent that there is unseasonably cool weather throughout the spring and summer months which would adversely affect the demand for refrigerants there would be a corresponding negative impact on the company delays or inability in securing adequate supplies of refrigerants at peak demand periods lack of refrigerant demand increased expenses declining refrigerant prices and a loss of a principal customer could result in significant losses there can be no assurance that the foregoing factors will not occur and result in a material adverse effect on the companys financial position and significant losses the company believes that to a lesser extent there is a similar seasonal element to refrigerantsider service revenues as refrigerant sales the company is continuing to assess its refrigerantsider service revenues seasonal trend recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no  intangiblesgoodwill and other topic  simplifying the test for goodwill
