about us the shield in the field partners history of robinson outdoor products llc a history of innovation business success is like a mathematical equation a combination of things creates results in today’s outdoor industry participant passion and new products that play to that passion are the clear drivers within that driven landscape the word innovation is tossed about a great deal although it is almost always used to refer exclusively to the product side of the formula our company thinks differently says scott shultz president of robinson outdoor products llc for us the concept of innovation underwrites everything we do yes it’s new products but at robinson innovation is even deeper than that our approach is that we innovate or we die and that means at every level every turn and in every aspect of how we manage and run our business it means that we seek innovation in how we initially view problems how we develop solutions how we connect with our customers and with consumers how we bring new products to market and even how we sweep the floors manage the finances and attract and motivate new people innovate is our internal mantra if you will and it applies to absolutely everything scent shield® is born this company was founded on innovation in  company founder bill robinson forever changed the hunting world with the introduction of robinson laboratories scent shield® a spray product that eliminated human odor bill robinson was a known chemist and saw an opening in the hunting industry that no one else had envisioned after developing pet care products for years bill robinson decided to try his hand in the hunting industry with scent elimination sprays for hunters after no success at his first shot show two important people in the industry discussed his idea with him and with that his vision of scent shield® was born hunting in general the hunting marketplace and the robinson company have together continued to evolve along those lines ever since our company’s history is one of unrelenting innovation shultz reflects in our first decade we plowed much new ground reinventing how hunters viewed their scent control efforts in the proceeding decades we reapplied ourselves over and over again to develop even better scent control products for hunters build and solidify our brands and create new and more effective ways to bring our goods to market to do all that we’ve had to continually change and grow scentblocker® changes the hunting world in  the company took a major step forward it negotiated a licensing agreement with an american firm that allowed it to produce activated carbon scent control clothing that was a bold and aggressive step for us up to that point we had focused almost exclusively on liquid scentelimination products with those products we delivered the ability to neutralize human odor on a ph acidic level that worked very well but it was only one part of the odor puzzle to control organic odor something different was required and what worked best for that was activated carbon and the science of adsorption we called our new carbon clothing scentblocker® and it allowed us to further our circle of effective scent control hunting products with activated carbon clothing we were into a whole new realm of science for us it was almost like we had been given the second half of the alphabet the carbon clothing completed the part of the scent control loop that we had been missing and it dovetailed perfectly into our innovative and aggressive plans to become the atoz source for every sort of effective scent control product for hunters taking it to the next level in  the company became aware of even more advanced carbon fabrics originally developed in europe which demonstrated outstanding scent control properties these freudenburg fabrics had even proven effective for biological and some radiation protection robinson quickly negotiated an exclusive agreement with the fabrics producer and began development of a secondgeneration of scentblocker® clothing line partnering with the freudenberg people allowed us to create and introduce a whole new level of activated carbon clothing for hunters at the same time it allowed us to differentiate our carbon clothing from the quality carbon clothing of other producers the extra effort required to innovate an exclusive carbon fabric for the scentblocker brand has certainly paid big dividends over the years the entire thing turned into a wonderful project in  we introduced the scentblocker® plus ultralite clothing line to rave reviews the clothing was revolutionary it was lighter quieter had all the right pockets and fit and functioned better for hunters than anything ever offered before at the same time the activated carbon very effectively adsorbed organic odors breakthroughs in thinking and new products were already a robinson outdoor products llc hallmark when in  the company introduced a revolutionary new scent elimination spray carbon blast carbon blast proved such a breakthrough for hunters that the united states patent office awarded us a patent on the formula reveals shultz changing of the guard  acquisition growth about the same time all of this product innovation was taking place the company itself also underwent a series of equally innovative changes in  with founder bill robinson retiring scott shultz purchased the company and in  robinson outdoor products llc acquired whitewater outdoors® a yearold wisconsin apparel company whitewater outdoors® had a long history of providing conventional outdoor clothing gloves and accessories in that sense they had everything we didn’t have and we had many things that they also needed they had been around a very long time and had many loyal customers including the united states military we were still fairly new but we had much experience in newage sophisticated fabrics garment technologies and designs the vertical integration of our two companies was a match made in heaven changing the way we go to market – partnerships we continually innovate new and exciting products that help hunters do every one of those things in  robinson outdoor products llc launched the nowwildly successful dream season® line of premium quality hunting clothing the launch was grounded in new product technology and in a new strategic marketing partnership with mark and terry drury of the dream season® television program with the input of the drury brothers we developed yet another breakthrough lineup of unique hunting garments the new dream season® apparel featured a brand new type of artfully printed camouflage fleece that was unbelievably soft quiet and hunter friendly because the fabric was so inviting and because of the exposure it received on the dream season® television show and in print the clothing line quickly set all sorts of sales records in  whitewater outdoors® also innovated whitewater® and realtree® strategically partnered to introduce the realtree® pro series line of hunting apparel which proved equally successful as the dream season® line the partnership followed the same lines that had already been successful with dream season realtree’s bill jordan and michael waddell are nothing short of outstanding in their appeal to consumers and to the outdoor industry in quick order we had another hit on our hands in  we launched sportsmen’s edge a line of vitamin supplements specifically formulated by leading physicians to increase the performance of sportsmen in the field a new step  footwear in  we debuted the new scentblocker® dream season® footwear line innovative s apparel proprietary fabrics including bamboo performance textiles and ti spray – the first spray scent eliminator to combine ph neutralization organic odor adsorption microbial prevention and an oxidization deterrent current director of footwear product developer eric bantley came from the big corporate footwear world his previous work can be seen under some of the major outdoor footwear manufacturers our mission it sounds obvious but behind the scenes of every technical product at robinson outdoor products llc is a history of exhaustive use abuse and in lab testing we start with an idea a need and then seek out the finest fabrics materials and formulas and start exploring design solutions to meet the need our advanced product lab tests materials compatibility performance levels and effectiveness scores with crucial data but the final step is most crucial we head into the field because real world hunting needs can’t be solved in the lab alone such fullon testing often exposes details that might otherwise be overlooked for example designing hood or headcovers on a mannequin in the office is one thing until you climb up a high placed treestand and pull it over your head and try to draw a bow and shoot that you realize your vision and draw is compromised when that chance of a lifetime walks out from this indepth field testing we have developed some of the most unique details and benefits that go into our products offset main zippers for clean shooting diamond crotch gusset for a resistant free climb into a treestand silent wrist ratchet body lock for on stand adjustment gearpendent technology for minimal movement while reaching for gear zip off removable arm guard for nonrestrictive shooting tree harness slit for integrated attachment perfect fit function and the list goes on honestly its an evolution of understanding more than anything else its years of experience and many days weeks and months of sitting in the tree stand on the stalk in the bottomlands on top of the mountains shivering sweating and soggy moments figuring out what something really does and why and what we can do to make it hunt better strategic partnerships innovative partnerships represent a fresh and beneficial way for us to bring new products to the outdoor marketplace we’ve long recognized that we are in a very competitive market and also within very competitive product categories within the market one of the problems that everyone in our position faces is the likelihood of having new products quickly and simply duplicated by the competition they may copy some of the features but they can not knock the garment in its important entirety such innovative partnerships do take considerable effort to formulate and no small expense but they clearly generate additional consumer demand and they allow us to offer products that can not be entirely duplicated in the market partnering with these television personalities also offers consumers the privilege of choosing their favorite camo pattern we have strategically partnered with realtree® and mossy oak® to bring you the highest quality camo patterns in the market to help you blend into your terrain partnering with the premiere shows in the industry only enhances our presence in the market but in order to introduce our innovations to the outdoor marketplace we need to rely on our retail partners such as cabelas gander mountain bass pro shops dicks sporting goods and the numerous dealers throughout the us to bring our products to the customer first hand robinson outdoor products llc helps the younger generation with life threatening illnesses each year by donating money to the catchadream foundation in order to
