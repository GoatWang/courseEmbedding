and use recommendations quality purchase only astm d7 certified biodiesel preferably from a bq accredited producer or certified marketer and request a certificate of analysis from your supplier ensure the quality of your diesel fuel as well offquality diesel or diesel with water can cause problems when blended with good quality biodiesel especially in cold weather biodiesel storage for best results store biodiesel in aluminum stainless steel or carbon steel tanks clean storage tanks before using biodiesel biodiesel is an excellent solvent and will break loose deposits left from petroleum diesel use these deposits will end up in fuel filters and cause operational problems inspect storage tanks for water accumulation regularly and if water is present remove immediately routine tank maintenance can eliminate fuel related problems winterization winterize fuel storage tanks and fuel handling equipment b thru b blends can be winterized by treating the diesel fuel with distillate or a commercial additive storage tanks should be heated or insulated to maintain biodiesel temperatures above the cloud  pour points piping pumps and valves also should be insulated or heated for similar reasons know the cloud point of the biodiesel you are using biodiesel cloud points vary by feed stock—soybean oil provides cloud points in the low ° f range while animal fats provide cloud points in the mid  to mid ° f range biodiesel made from combinations of feed stocks will have cloud points that vary depending on the ratio of feed stocks used transportation and blending avoid backloading b or blended fuel into a tanker contaminated with vegetable oils animal fats nondiesel fuels lubricants or chemicals unload b trucks promptly after arrival in cold weather do not let them sit out overnight unless the truck is insulated or equipped with an external heating source injection blending provides a more uniform and reliable blend than splash blending if splash blending is used it is recommended to splash biodiesel into diesel when blending from the top of tanks when blending from the bottom of tanks it is recommended to blend diesel into biodiesel for best blending results ensure the biodiesel temperature is ° f or higher this will also ensure flow ability of your fuel where to get help contact your local biodiesel supplier or futurefuel chemical company if you have questions concerning the storage handling or use of biodiesel during cold weather copyright futurefuel corporation all rights reserved home investors privacy news contact us search investor relations  futurefuel corp home
