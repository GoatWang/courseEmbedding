 years ago i researched surgeons for hours and days anywhere from the sacramento area to san francisco all the way to salt lake city i interviewed and met with several of them in fact i landed on dr kauffman in folsom ca because he was so humble well as humble as any plastic surgeon can be hahaand i loved the way his belly buttons turned out i also loved that his used lma anesthesia on my review for more info on that i woke up with no nausea whatsoever another thing that i absolutely loved loved loved loved is that i was never alone with him not in one meeting initial consultation follow up etci was never alone in a room with him he always had a female staff present probably for his sake and liability more than mine but i so appreciated that extra step and caution and it was probably prompted because his wife works there with him too and im sure she doesnt want anything going on privately lol i mean youve got a man seeing you naked and touching youits just a wise to have another person present in my other consultations with other surgeons that was not the case so final outcomework asidehe has my respect for that alone i really would recommend my surgeon and if fact already
