test prep need why should you choose studyguidenet it is pretty simple actually we offer the best test prep study guides at the most affordable prices you can imagine first of all other sites that we have noticed on the market simply show other companys products without really providing any of their own feedback and mostly mass producing content that is not personalized in anyway shape or form to individual types of students     in this site you will find a great intercombination of personalized content that makes it enjoyable to read and easy to understand and other mass produced content similarly as other companies do  you will also find on this site variety types of study paths and career paths something that many people simply do not offer take a look at career advise for accounting professionals for example here  in our case it makes sense to create this enjoyable to read content because we interlink and intercombine other synergies to it to really see what we mean read our google plus blog we show you how for free   how we can help local and online tutoring and test prep companies other affiliate test prep sites that we noticed on the market only show small selection of test prep materials and only from specific vendors well last time we checked students like options  what we do here is different we partner up with multiple test prep vendors who have variety types of educational products and list these products with intercombination of recommended links to our own products other affilate test prep companies cant really do that because technically you must have your own product as well to be able to benefit from such synergies the most and not just your own product but a method to convince others to be your partner and a method to interconnect your products together which is called networking    in our case it makes sense in other competitor cases it doesnt make much sense or at least its not as beneficial as it is in our case  plus what we noticed is other test prep companies do not really help with marketing other then marketing themselves  while we on the other hand help online test prep companies and local tutoring companies colleges universities schools and eductionatl organizations with marketing and have variety of marketing options commonly referred to as advanced educational marketing weapons in our case it makes sense to create this enjoyable to read content because we interlink and intercombine other synergies to it to really see what we mean read our google plus blog we show you how for free     at first glance this site may look like a typical blog site however if you look closely you start realizing that each of the tests that we add is backed up by some sort of busines model or a strategy many of these strategies we describe in plusgooglecomtutoringservices    either in the form of local tutoring companies pointing to these tests such as our own companies or other companies who purchased our advanced marketing edu weapons or in the form of related test prep products that are interconnect to each other or in the form of schools or tutors or books or other types of interconnected mechanism that are driving the gears behind this site  to help you understand what we mean take a look at this picture below                                                                      visit  our
