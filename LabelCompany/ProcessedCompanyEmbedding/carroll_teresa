learn morechoose wall art you lovethe number one rule for selecting artwork is that it should speak to you if it isn’t meaningful in any way it’s best to keep searching if you’ve themed your furniture and décor around a certain color or idea that can get you started in your search many paintings and other artwork have a cultural theme such as aboriginal art or japanese art on the other hand black and white photography goes great with anything whatever style you choose just make sure it represents your tastes interests or history check out every type of wall art out thereif you’re looking for paintings that fit perfectly with your traditional décor consider fine art prints these are a great alternative if you can’t afford genuine picasso paintings or works by other famous artists pencil art and some sculptures can also fit in well with a traditional scheme if you’re in the mood for some modern artwork illustrations and mixed media are a great place to start sculptures made from metal or glass can also have a modern tone try going bold with abstract paintings urban art or pop art which tend to incorporate more modern influences like graffiti and celebrities plus bright colors photographs work well with any décor as they can cross between modern and traditional easily depending on the subject matter don’t be afraid to mix and match either a modern piece can go amazingly

masterpieces here are a few tips on how to select pen and pencil art for your home• choose the right size if you have a large expanse of wall that needs filling make sure your artwork isn’t so small it will be overpowered by that empty space on the other hand you won’t want it to be so large it takes over a room if you’re unsure what size is right or are hesitant to go big and bold look for standardsized art that measures between  to  inches • your art should elicit emotion don’t just grab up every piece of art for sale be selective and look for pieces that you love do the colors call to you how about the lines and shading can you identify with the subject matter in any way whatever you choose it should add dimension and life to your home• educate yourself the easiest way to define your taste in art is to research different styles you may assume that because your home décor is traditional modern etc your taste in artwork will be the same however you may be pleasantly surprised and even more surprised to find those traditionalstyle pen and ink drawings look amazing hanging above your modern sofa embed photo open photo in new window pagetype pagebrowseproductproducttopic
