refer to note — definitions of notes to consolidated financial statements included in our  form k for the definitions of certain terms used herein during the first quarter of fiscal  the company determined that its prior year financial statements contained immaterial misstatements related to incorrect translation rates used in reporting us dollar values of goodwill held by foreign

participants as of the date fair value is determined the “measurement date” when determining fair value we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and we consider only those assumptions we believe a typical market participant would consider when pricing an asset or liability in measuring fair value we use the following inputs in the order of priority indicated level   quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level   observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in level  such as i quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities ii quoted prices in markets that have insufficient volume or infrequent transactions eg less active markets and iii modeldriven valuations in which all significant inputs are

the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issues accounting standards updates each being an “asu” to its accounting standards codification “asc” which constitutes the primary source of us gaap  the company regularly monitors asus as they are issued and considers their applicability to its business  all asus applicable to the company are adopted by the due date and in the manner prescribed by the fasb in may  the fasb issued asu no — revenue from contracts with customers the new guidance provided by asu  is intended to remove inconsistencies and perceived weaknesses in the existing revenue requirements provide a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues improve comparability provide more useful information and simplify the preparation of financial statements  asu  was initially effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after december   on july   the fasb approved a oneyear deferral of the effective date of this standard  the revised effective date for the standard is for annual reporting periods beginning after december   and interim periods therein  the fasb also approved changes allowing for early adoption of the standard as of the original effective date  the company has completed its initial assessment of the new standard and is in the process of developing a plan to assess its contracts with customers  the company currently intends to adopt the new standard using the modified retrospective application  this standard could have a significant impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements and an administrative impact on its operations  the company will further assess the impact through its implementation program in february  the fasb issued asu — leases  asu  requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for most leases asu  is effective for public entity financial statements for annual periods beginning after december   and interim periods within those annual periods  early adoption is permitted including adoption in an interim period  the guidance must be adopted using a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements  the company is evaluating the impact of the new guidance on its consolidated financial statements  this standard could have a significant administrative impact on its operations and the company will further assess the impact through its implementation program in march  the fasb issued asu — improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting  asu  simplifies several aspects of the accounting for sharebased payment transactions including the income tax consequences classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows  asu  is effective for annual periods beginning after december   and interim periods within those annual periods  early adoption is permitted for any entity in any interim or annual period for which financial statements have not been issued or made available for issuance  if an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period any adjustments must be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that page  jacobs engineering group inc and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements – unaudited december   continued   includes that interim period  an entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period  the company is e valuating the impact of the new guidance on its consolidated financial statements     segment information during the second quarter of fiscal  we reorganized our operating and reporting structure around four lines of business “lob”  this reorganization is intended to better serve our global clients leverage our workforce help streamline operations and provide enhanced growth opportunities  the four global lobs are petroleum  chemicals buildings  infrastructure aerospace  technology and industrial previously the company operated its business as a single segment   under the new organization each lob has a president that reports directly to the companys chairman and ceo who is also the company’s chief operating decision maker or “codm”  as part of the reorganization the sales function which had been managed centrally for many years is now managed on a lob basis and accordingly the associated cost is now embedded in the new segments and reported to the respective lob presidents  in addition a portion of the costs of other support functions eg finance legal human resources and information technology are allocated to each lob using methodologies which we believe effectively attribute the cost of these support functions to the revenuegenerating activities of the company on a rational basis  in addition the cost of the company’s cash incentive plan the management incentive plan “mip” and the expense associated with the jacobs engineering group inc  stock incentive plan “ sip” have likewise been charged to the lobs except for those amounts determined to relate to the business as a whole which amounts remain in corporate’s results of operations   financial information for each lob is reviewed by the codm to assess performance and make decisions regarding the allocation of resources  the company does not track assets by lob nor does it provide such information to the codm   the codm evaluates the operating performance of our lobs using operating profit which is defined as margin less “corporate charges” eg the allocated amounts described above  the company incurs certain selling general and administrative “sga” costs which relate to its business as a whole which are not allocated to the lobs

compensation costs are not allocated to the lobs iii the amortization of intangible assets acquired as part of purchased business combinations iv the quarterly variances between the company’s actual costs of certain of its selfinsured integrated risk and employee benefit programs and amounts charged to the lobs and v certain adjustments relating to costs associated with the company’s international defined benefit pension plans  in addition “other corporate expenses” includes adjustments to contract margins both positive and negative associated with projects where it has been determined in the opinion of management that such adjustments are not indicative of the performance of the related lob and therefore should not be attributed to the lob     business combinations

facility contains customary events of default we were in compliance with our debt covenants at december       revenue accounting for contracts  accounting for joint ventures in general we recognize revenue at the time we provide services depending on the commercial terms of the contract we recognize revenues either when costs are incurred or using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting by relating contract costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion contract losses are provided for in their entirety in the period they become known without regard to the percentageofcompletion for multiple contracts with a single customer we account for each contract separately we also recognize as revenues costs associated with claims and unapproved change orders to the extent it is probable that such claims and change orders will result in additional contract revenue and the amount of such additional revenue can be reliably estimated a significant portion of the company’s revenue is earned on cost reimbursable contracts the percentage of revenues realized by the company by type of contract during fiscal  can be found in note — description of business and basis of presentation of notes to consolidated financial statements included in our  form k certain costreimbursable contracts include incentivefee arrangements the incentive fees in such contracts can be based on a variety of factors but the most common factors are the achievement of target completion dates target costs andor other performance criteria failure to meet these targets can result in unrealized incentive fees we recognize incentive fees based on expected results using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting as the contract progresses and more information becomes available the estimate of the anticipated incentive fee that will be earned is revised as necessary we bill incentive fees based on the terms and conditions of the individual contracts in certain situations we are allowed to bill a portion of the incentive fees over the performance period of the contract in other situations we are allowed to bill incentive fees only after the target criterion has been achieved incentive fees which have been recognized but not billed are included in receivables in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets page  jacobs engineering group inc and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements – unaudited december   continued   certain costreimbursable contracts with government customers as well as certain commercial clients provide that contract costs are subject to audit and adjustmen t in this situation revenues are recorded at the time services are performed based upon the amounts we expect to realize upon completion of the contracts revenues are not recognized for nonrecoverable costs in those situations where an audit indicates that we may have billed a client for costs not allowable under the terms of the contract we estimate the amount of such nonbillable costs and adjust our revenues accordingly when we are directly responsible for subcontractor labor or thirdparty materials and equipment we reflect the costs of such items in both revenues and costs on those projects where the client elects to pay for such items directly and we have no associated responsibility for such items these amounts are not reflected in either revenues or costs the following table sets forth passthrough costs included in revenues for each of the three months ended december   and january   in thousands       for the three months ended       december       january     passthrough costs included in revenues               as is common to the industry we execute certain contracts jointly with third parties through various forms of joint ventures and consortiums although the joint ventures own and hold the contracts with the clients the services required by the contracts are typically performed by us and our joint venture partners or by other subcontractors under subcontracting agreements with the joint ventures the assets of our joint ventures therefore consist almost entirely of cash and receivables representing amounts due from clients and the liabilities of our joint ventures consist almost entirely of amounts due to the joint venture partners for services provided by the partners to the joint ventures under their individual subcontracts and other subcontractors in general at any given time the equity of our joint ventures represents the undistributed profits earned on contracts the joint ventures hold with clients very few of our joint ventures have employees none of our joint ventures have thirdparty debt or credit facilities our joint ventures therefore are simply mechanisms used to deliver engineering and construction services to clients rarely do they in and of themselves present any risk of loss to us or to our partners separate from those that we would carry if we were performing the contract on our own  in accordance with us gaap our share of losses associated with the contracts held by the joint ventures if and when they occur have always been reflected in our consolidated financial statements certain of our joint ventures meet the definition of a “variable interest entity” “vie” as defined in us gaap a vie is a legal entity in which equity investors do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or as a group the holders of the equity investment at risk lack any one of the following three characteristics i the power through voting rights or similar rights to direct the activities of a legal entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance ii the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the legal entity or iii the right to receive the expected residual returns of the legal entity accordingly entities issuing consolidated financial statements eg a “reporting entity” must consolidate a vie if the reporting entity has a “controlling financial interest” in the vie as demonstrated by the reporting entity having both i the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vie’s economic performance and ii the right to receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie or the obligation to absorb losses of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie in evaluating our vies for possible consolidation we perform a qualitative analysis to determine whether or not we have a “controlling financial interest” in the vie as defined by us gaap we consolidate only those vies over which we have a controlling financial interest  the company does not currently participate in any significant vies     page  jacobs engineering group inc and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements – unaudited december   continued   disclosures about defined

continue at a slower pace as clients continue to evaluate their capital spending plans operating profit for the three months ended december   decreased  million or  to  million from  million for the

results direct costs of contracts for the first quarter of fiscal  decreased  million or  to  billion from  billion for the corresponding period last year  direct costs of contracts include all costs incurred in connection with and directly for the benefit of client contracts including depreciation and amortization relating to assets used in providing the services required by the related projects the level of direct costs of contracts may fluctuate between reporting periods due to a variety of factors including the amount of passthrough costs we incur during a period on those projects where we are responsible for subcontract labor or thirdparty materials and equipment we reflect the amounts of such items in both revenues and costs and we refer to such costs as “passthrough costs” on other projects where the client elects to pay for such items directly and we have no associated responsibility for such items these amounts are not considered passthrough costs and are therefore not reflected in either revenues or costs to the extent that we incur a significant amount of passthrough costs in a period our direct costs of contracts are likely to increase as well passthrough costs included in revenues for the first quarter of fiscal  increased  million or  to  million from  million for the corresponding period last year in general passthrough costs are more significant on projects that have a higher content of field services activities passthrough costs are generally incurred at specific points during the life cycle of a project and are highly dependent on the needs of our individual clients and the nature of the clients’ projects however because we have hundreds of projects which start at various times within a fiscal year the effect of passthrough costs on the level of direct costs of contracts can vary between fiscal years without there being a fundamental or significant change to the underlying business the decrease in passthrough costs for the three months ended december   was due primarily to a decrease in our field services activity as a percentage of revenues direct costs of contracts for the three months ended december   was  this compares to  for the three months ended january    the relationship between direct costs of contracts and revenues will fluctuate between reporting periods depending on a variety of factors including the mix of business during the reporting periods being compared as well as the level of margins earned from the various types of services provided generally the more procurement we do on behalf of our clients eg where we purchase equipment and materials for use on projects andor procure subcontracts in connection with projects and the more field services revenues we have relative to technical professional services revenues the higher the ratio will be of direct costs of contracts to revenues because revenues from passthrough costs typically have lower margin rates associated with them it is not unusual for us to experience an increase or decrease in such revenues without experiencing a corresponding increase or decrease in our gross margins and operating profit sga expenses for the first quarter of fiscal  decreased  million or  to  million from  million for the corresponding period last year  the decrease for the three months ended december   as compared to the corresponding period last year was due primarily to higher restructuring costs recorded in the first quarter of fiscal  and higher savings associated with the  restructuring recorded since the first quarter of fiscal   excluding the impact of the  restructuring adjusted sga expenses for the first quarter of fiscal  decreased  million or  to  million from  million for the corresponding period last year net interest expense for the three months ended december   was  million as compared to net interest expense of  million for the corresponding period last year  the increase for the three months ended december   as compared to the prior year was due primarily to lower interest income miscellaneous expense for the three months ended december   was  million this compares to miscellaneous expense of  million for the corresponding period last year  the increase for the three months ended december   as compared to the prior year was due primarily to a loss on sale of a business in south america the company’s consolidated effective income tax rate for the first quarter ended december   was  contributing to the current period tax rate was  million of discrete benefit related to foreign tax refunds received in the quarter  the increase in the tax rate for the three months ended december   as compared to the corresponding period last year was primarily the result of a  million tax benefit related to the release of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in the prior year period pertaining to foreign net operating losses backlog information we include in backlog the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts that have been awarded to us our policy with respect to om contracts however is to include in backlog the amount of revenues we expect to receive for one succeeding year regardless of the remaining life of the contract for national government page  jacobs engineering group inc and subsidiaries   programs other than national government om contra cts our policy is to include in backlog the full contract award whether funded or unfunded excluding option periods because of the nature size expected duration funding commitments and the scope of services required by our contracts the timing of when backlog will be recognized as revenues can vary greatly between individual contracts consistent with industry practice substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation or termination at the option of the client while management uses all information available to it to determine backlog our backlog at any given time is subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as increases or decreases in costs relating to the contracts included therein  backlog is not necessarily an indicator of future revenues because certain contracts eg contracts relating to large epc projects as well as national government programs can cause large increases to backlog in the fiscal period in which we recognize the award and because many of our contracts require us to provide services that span over a number of fiscal quarters and sometimes over fiscal years we evaluate our backlog on a yearoveryear basis rather than on a sequential quarteroverquarter basis the following table summarizes our backlog at december   and january   in millions       december       january

government and the chemicals industry more than offset by the cancellation of certain projects in the life sciences areas and an approximately  million reduction due to foreign exchange and strong revenue associated with large pharma projects backlog in the aerospace  technology lob at december   was  billion up  billion when compared to the corresponding period last year  the yearoveryear increase in backlog was primarily the result of new awards from the us federal government backlog in the building  infrastructure lob at december   was  billion up  billion or  billion after the effect of exchange rate changes when compared to the corresponding period last year  the yearoveryear increase in backlog was primarily the result of new awards in the us buildings and infrastructure market backlog in the industrial lob at december   was  billion down  billion when compared to the corresponding period last year  the yearoveryear decrease in backlog was primarily the result of certain cancellations in the life sciences area and strong revenue burn associated with large pharma projects and a significant impact associated with the effect of exchange rates backlog in the petroleum  chemicals lob at december   was  billion up  billion when compared to the corresponding period last year  strong performance in chemicals backlog was somewhat mitigated by continuing weakness in the upstream market     liquidity and capital resources at december   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of  million of cash and cash equivalents and  billion of available borrowing capacity under our  billion  facility refer to the note longterm debt in notes to consolidated financial statements appearing under part — item  of this quarterly report on form q we finance much of our operations and growth through cash generated by our operations during the three months ended december   our cash and cash equivalents increased by  million from  million at september   to  million at december   this compares to a net decrease of  million of cash and cash equivalents during the three months ended january   page  jacobs engineering group inc and subsidiaries   the three most significant factors contributing to the  million net increase in cash and cash equivalents during the three mo nths ended december   as compared to the three months ended january   are i a  million increase in cash flows relating to our working capital accounts ii a  million increase in cash flows in financing activities in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  and iii a  million increase in group net earnings our operations provided net cash inflows of  million during the three months ended december   this compares to net cash inflows of  million for the corresponding period last year the  million increase in cash flows from operating activities during the three months ended december   as compared to the corresponding period last year was due primarily to a  million increase in cash generated from changes within our working capital accounts discussed below and a  million increase in group net earnings with respect to the company’s working capital accounts the company’s cash flows from operations are greatly affected by the costplus nature of our customer contracts because such a high percentage of our revenues is earned on costplus type contracts and due to the significance of revenues relating to passthrough costs most of the costs we incur are included in invoices we send to clients although we continually monitor our accounts receivable we manage the operating cash flows of the company by managing the working capital accounts in total rather than by the individual elements the primary elements of the company’s working capital accounts are accounts receivable accounts payable and billings in excess of cost accounts payable consist of obligations to third parties relating primarily to costs incurred for projects which are generally billable to clients accounts receivable consist of amounts due from our clients — a substantial portion of which are for projectrelated costs billings in excess of cost consist of billings to and payments from our clients for costs yet to be incurred this relationship between revenues and costs and between receivables and payables is unique to our industry and facilitates review of our liquidity at the total working capital level the  million increase in cash flows relating to our working capital accounts during the three months ended december   is indicative of our building momentum to become more effective in our working capital performance with respect to the company’s trade accounts receivable while our credit risk could be significant based on the fact that we provide services to clients operating in a wide range of industries as well as in a number of countries outside the us we manage these issues closely to reduce exposures as much as possible and historically have not experienced material losses  our private sector customers include large wellknown and wellestablished multinational companies and our government customers consist of national state and local agencies located principally in the us the uk and australia although we have not historically experienced significant collection issues with any of our governmental or commercial customers we are currently reassessing how we extend credit to certain customers and markets that we service we used  million of cash and cash equivalents for investing activities during the three months ended december   as compared to  million used during the corresponding period last year the  million decrease in cash used is primarily due to lower acquisition activities in the first quarter of fiscal  partially offset by higher property and equipment purchases our financing activities resulted in net cash inflows of  million during the three months ended december   this compares to net cash outflows of  million during the corresponding period last year the  million increase in cash flows during the first quarter of fiscal  as compared to the corresponding period last year was due primarily to i million in higher cash proceeds from issuances of common stock ii  million less cash used in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  to repurchase shares of the company’s common stock discussed in further detail in part ii item  of this quarterly report on form q offset in part by iii  million less cash inflow from borrowing activities on january   the board of directors approved a declaration of a cash dividend to shareholders a quarterly dividend of  per share will be paid on march   to shareholders of record on the close of business on february   the company had  million of cash and cash equivalents at december   of this amount approximately  million was held in the us and  million was held outside of the us primarily in the uk the eurozone chile and india other than the tax cost of repatriating funds to the us see note — income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements included in our  form k there are no material impediments to repatriating these funds to the us the company had  million of letters of credit outstanding at december   of this amount  million was issued under the  facility and  million was issued under separate committed and uncommitted letterofcredit facilities we believe we have adequate liquidity and capital resources to fund our operations support our acquisition strategy service our debt and pay dividends for the next twelve months we had  million in cash and cash equivalents at december   and page  jacobs engineering group inc and subsidiaries   our consolidated working capital position was  billion at that date in addition there was  billion of borrowing capacity remaining under the  facility at december   we believe that the capacity terms and conditions of the   facility combined with cash onhand and the other committed and uncommitted facilities we have in place are adequate for our working capital and general business requirements for the next twelve months     item  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not enter

risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates interest rate risk please see the note longterm debt in notes to consolidated financial statements appearing under part

costs are transacted in different currencies we sometimes enter into foreign exchange contracts in order to limit our exposure to fluctuating foreign currencies we follow the provisions of asc no —
