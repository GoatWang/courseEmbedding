abstractwebsiteprevious work has documented large fluxes of freshwater and nutrients from submarine groundwater discharge sgd into the coastal waters of a few volcanic oceanic islands however on the majority of such islands including moorea french polynesia sgd has not been studied in this study we used radium ra isotopes and salinity to investigate sgd and associated nutrient inputs at five coastal sites and paopao bay on the north shore of moorea ra activities were highest in coastal groundwater intermediate in coastal ocean surface water and lowest in offshore surface water indicating that highra groundwater was discharging into the coastal ocean on average groundwater nitrate and nitrite n  n phosphate ammonium and silica concentrations were    and  times greater respectively than those in coastal ocean surface water suggesting that groundwater discharge could be an important source of nutrients to the coastal ocean ra and salinity mass balances indicated that most or all sgd at these sites was saline and likely originated from a deeper unsampled layer of raenriched recirculated seawater this highsalinity sgd may be less affected by terrestrial nutrient sources such as fertilizer sewage and animal waste compared to meteoric groundwater however nutrientsalinity trends indicate it may still have much higher concentrations of nitrate and phosphate than coastal receiving waters coastal ocean nutrient concentrations were virtually identical to those measured offshore suggesting that nutrient subsidies from sgd are efficiently utilized edmunds pj leichter jj    spatial scaledependent vertical zonation of coral reef community structure in french polynesia ecosphere    ecs   abstractwebsitewe tested for depthdependent vertical zonation in coral reef community structure with surveys conducted in  at  m and  m depth off the islands of moorea tahiti maiao and tetiaroa which are distributed over similar to  km of the tropical south pacific benthic communities were censused using photoquadrats to obtain percentage cover first by functional groups scleractinians macroalgae and crustose coralline algae algal turf and bare space combined ctb and second by genus for scleractinians and millepora virtually every aspect of community structure differed between the two depths but the effects were dependent on spatial scale of investigation interactive effects of islands and depths determined the abundance of functional groups as well as seven of eight common coral genera on the two islands at which two sites were censused the abundance of functional groups also differed between sites and was affected by depth x site interactions the spatially variable effects of depth on community structure underscores the importance of contextspecific synergy between biotic and abiotic factors in driving these patterns spatial scaledependent vertical zonation also shows the potential for these effects to be modulated by the changes

distribution and abundance of meroplanktonic larvae in nearshore waters during strong internal tidal forcing continental shelf research    jcsr   abstractwebsitewe related the vertical distribution and abundance of nearshore meroplankton at hourly time scales with internal tidal wave events we proposed that significant changes in plankter abundance would occur across internal tidal fronts and that surface and bottom strata would respond in opposite fashions first mode internal tidal bores propagating in the alongshore direction were detected in watercolumn currents and baroclinic temperature changes surface and bottom currents always flowed in opposite directions and abrupt flow reversals coincided with large temperature changes during arrival of bores crab zoeae and barnacle cyprids were more abundant in the bottom strata whereas barnacle nauplii showed the opposite pattern significant changes in vertical distribution and abundance of target meroplankters occurred across internal tidal fronts especially for crabs at depth with surface and bottom organisms responding in opposite fashions changes in plankter abundance were significantly correlated with current flows in the strata where they were most abundant the manner in which plankters were affected increasing or decreasing abundance appeared to be modulated by their vertical position within the water column the significant differences found at the high frequencies of this study maintained across sampling days suggest that nearshore meroplankton populations may have greater and more consistent temporal and vertical variability than previously considered c  elsevier ltd all rights reserved hanson km schnarr el leichter jj    nonrandom feeding enhances the contribution of oceanic zooplankton to the diet of the planktivorous coral reef fish dascyllus flavicaudus marine biology    s   abstractwebsitecombining gut content analysis and sampling of ambient zooplankton we examine departures from random feeding in a planktivorous coral reef fish and explore the effects of apparent nonrandom feeding behavior on the relative contribution of oceanic versus reefassociated zooplankton to fish diet the planktivorous damselfish dascyllus flavicaudus appears to exhibit strong positive electivity for oceanic copepods including candacia spp and copepods from the families oncaeidae and corycaeidae and consistent negative electivity for cyclopoid copepods oithonidae in total prey taxa categorized as oceanic in origin contributed   of total zooplankton biomass in fish guts the summed contribution of oceanic prey taxa to fish diet was significantly higher than expected under a model of random feeding based on the availability of oceanic versus reefassociated prey as sampled by zooplankton net tows the feeding behavior of d flavicaudus appears to be visibilityselective rather than or in addition to sizeselective as electivity across prey taxa could not be explained by differences in prey size

quantified benthic community structure on shallow  m isobath reefs separated by  km on four islands in the south pacific and evaluated the roles of disturbances vs coral recruitment as causes of spatial heterogeneity reefs were surveyed in  on moorea tahiti tetiaroa and maiao with community structure sampled at two sites on each island using photoquadrats the effects of coral recruitment on population structure were evaluated through genetic analyses of pocillopora on three of the islands benthic community structure with functional group resolution differed among islands and generally among sites but coral community structure generic resolution differed among islands but generally not among sites genetic analyses of pocillopora using the open reading frame of host mtdna revealed varying relative abundances of pocillopora meandrinapocillopora eydouxi pocillopora verrucosa pocillopora effuses and two unnamed haplotypes on each island these results suggest that corals on each island represent unique samplings of genetically discrete larval assemblages rather than random samplings of a single larval assemblage together our findings emphasize the extent to which coral community structure varies over a scale of   km and suggests that recruitment from spatially discrete pools of coral larvae plays an important role in creating spatial variation in community structure

distribution and diversity in southern california estuarine coastal and shelf science    jecss   abstractlandscape and seascape structures are typically complex and manifest as patch mosaics within characteristic biomes bordering one another in gradual or abrupt ecotones the underlying patch structure in coastal shelf ecosystems is driven by the interaction of tectonic sedimentary and sea level dynamic processes animals and plants occupy and interact within these mosaics terrestrial landscape ecological studies have shown that patch structure is important for ecological processes such as foraging connectivity predation and species dynamics the importance of patch structure for marine systems is less clear because far fewer patternprocess studies have been conducted in these systems for many coastal shelf systems there is a paucity of information on how species occupy shelf seascapes particularly for seascapes imbued with complex patch structure and ecotones that are common globally due to tectonic activity here we present the results of a study conducted along a myriameterscale gradient of bottom and subbottom geological forcing altered by tectonic deformation sea level transgression and sediment allocation the resulting seascape is dominated by unconsolidated sediments throughout but also exhibits increasing density and size of outcropping patches along a habitat patch gradient forced by the erosion of a sea level transgressive surface that has been deformed and tilted by tectonic forcing a combination of subbottom profiling multibeam bathymetry and rov surveys of the habitats and the demersal megafauna occupying the habitats indicate  significant beta diversity along this gradient  biological diversity does not scale with habitat diversity and  species occupy the patches disproportionately nonlinearly with regard to the proportional availability of their preferred habitats these results indicate that shelf habitat patch structure modulates species specific processes and interactions with other species further studies are needed to examine experimentally the mechanics of how patch structure modulates ecological processes in shelf systems our results also provide further support for including multiple spatial scales of patch structure for the application of remote habitat sensing as a surrogate for biological community structure  wing

abstractwebsitebiological vectors are important for redistribution of nutrients in many ecological systems while availability of iron fe to phyto plankton limits pelagic productivity in the southern ocean biomagnification within marine food webs can lead to high concentrations of fe in the diet of seabirds and marine mammals we investigated patterns in concentrations of the micronutrients fe co zn and mn and the toxins cd and as in the guano of oceanic coastal and predatory seabirds and in faeces of  species of marine mammals that congregate to breed in the subantarctic auckland islands we found that much of the variability in concentrations of fe co zn and mn among species could be explained by foraging behaviour and by trophic position we observed concentrations of fe to be  orders of magnitude higher in the guano of predators and coastal foragers than in the subantarctic mixed layer high concentrations of as and cd were associated with organic matter sources from macroalgae analyses of the molar ratio feal indicated that fe within food webs supporting seabirds has likely been extensively recycled from its lithogenic source patterns in fen among species indicated that fe is concentrated  to  orders of magnitude in the guano of seabirds compared to limiting conditions for phytoplankton growth in subantarctic waters these data highlight the potential role of seabirds and marine mammals in the redistribution of micronutrients in the southern ocean and their likely role as key nutrient vectors in the ecosystem particularly around the subantarctic islands during the breeding season leichter jj stokes md vilchis li fiechter j    regional synchrony of temperature variation and internal wave forcing along the florida keys reef tract journal of geophysical researchoceans    jc   abstractwebsiteanalysis of  year temperature records collected along the florida keys reef tract flkrt reveals strong regionalscale synchrony in highfrequency temperature variation suggestive of internal wave forcing at predominately semidiurnal frequencies in each year and at all sites the amplitude of semidiurnal temperature variation was greatest from march to september and markedly lower from october to february comparisons of the semidiurnal component of the temperature variation among sites suggest complex patterns in the arrival of internal waves with highest cross correlation among closely spaced sites and synchrony in periods of enhanced internal wave activity across the length of the flkrt particularly in summer the periods of enhanced semidiurnal temperature variation at the  and  m isobaths on the reef slopes appear to be associated with the dynamics of the florida current and the onshore movement of warm fronts preceding the passage of florida current frontal eddies regionalscale satellite altimetry observations suggest temporal linkages to sea surface height anomalies in the loop current upstream of the florida current and setup of the tortugas gyre the synchronized forcing of cool water onto the reef slope sites across the flkrt is likely to affect physiological responses to temperature variation in corals and other ectothermic organisms as well as larval transport and nutrient dynamics with the potential for regionally coherent pulses of larvae and nutrients arriving on reef slopes across the flkrt key points temperature variation from internal waves is modulated regionally in the fl keys highfrequency temperature variation changes synchronously across sites thermocline dynamics are associated with

  biological and physical interactions on a tropical island coral reef transport and retention processes on moorea french polynesia oceanography  abstractwebsitethe moorea coral reef long term ecological research project funded by the us national science foundation includes multidisciplinary studies of physical processes driving ecological dynamics across the fringing reef back reef and fore reef habitats of moorea french polynesia a network of oceanographic moorings and a variety of other approaches have been used to investigate the biological and biogeochemical aspects of water transport and retention processes in this system there is evidence to support the hypothesis that a lowfrequency counterclockwise flow around the island is superimposed on the relatively strong alongshore currents on each side of the island despite the rapid flow and flushing of the back reef waters over the reef display chemical and biological characteristics distinct from those offshore the patterns include higher nutrient and lower dissolved organic carbon concentrations distinct microbial community compositions among habitats and reef assemblages of zooplankton that exhibit migration behavior suggesting multigenerational residence on the reef zooplankton consumption by planktivorous fish on the reef reflects both retention of reefassociated taxa and capture by the reef

interspecific variation in initiation and propagation of ice crystals biological bulletin  abstractwebsitesea ice typically forms at the oceans surface but given a source of supercooled water an unusual form of iceanchor icecan grow on objects in the water column or at the seafloor for several decades ecologists have considered anchor ice to be an important agent of disturbance in the shallowwater benthic communities of mcmurdo sound antarctica and potentially elsewhere in polar seas divers have documented anchor ice in the mcmurdo communities and its presence coincides with reduced abundance of the sponge homaxinella balfourensis which provides habitat for a diverse assemblage of benthic organisms however the mechanism of this disturbance has not been explored here we show interspecific differences in anchorice formation and propagation characteristics for antarctic benthic organisms the sponges h balfourensis and suberites caminatus show increased incidence of formation and accelerated spread of ice crystals compared to urchins and sea stars anchor ice also forms readily on sediments from which it can grow and adhere to organisms our results are consistent

to determine the spatial and temporal patterns of bleaching whether bleaching affected sponge mortality and whether there was a relationship between bleaching and seawater temperatures bleaching increased significantly with depth and was greater in autumn than spring but the response was not uniform across the sponge population bleaching of x muta did not result in sponge mortality corroborating the conclusion that cyanobacterial symbionts of the sponge provide little or no benefit to the host there was greater sponge bleaching with higher minimum daily seawater temperature anomalies within  d of surveys in the spring for both the spring and autumn there was greater bleaching with a higher number of positive  degrees c daily anomalies within  d before surveys anomalously

mesophotic zone is dominated by sponges and algae that are uncommon or absent from shallower areas and a fish fauna that is largely specialized to these intermediate depths it is likely that these

the industry is a lucrative and rewarding field and why more young people should enter the trades he has a true desire to nurture the entrepreneurial spirit of those in the mechanical trades and help them build successful companies that engage employees and customers leichter is president and ceo of software company aptora corp mr hvac llc and ra tax and accounting inc we talked with him recently about his thoughts on today’s hvacr industry  when and why did you decide to go into your particular career field i grew up in a singleparent alcoholic drugusing family and when i was in high school my counselor brought me into her office shortly before graduation and reminded me i had a low iq and a low gpa she asked me what my plans were for the future and i stared at my feet she went on to say ‘youre probably not collegebound you might want to consider a trade school such as plumbing or heating or air conditioning possibly a career in the military have you thought about that’ and i continued to stare at my feet i glanced up at all the plaques on the wall and didnt dare argue with her she went on for another few minutes thanked me for coming into her office and i walked out shortly after that i got into the mechanical trade by signing up for something called the job training partnership act its not around anymore it was a government program paid by welfare dollars that would pay me half my wage for  apprenticeship hours so the government paid me  an hour and the employer paid me  an hour which was close to minimum wage at the time and the employer was responsible for training me on useful skills and my job was to learn and not become a permanent drain on society  how did you develop the passion you have for the mechanical contracting industry ive had people ask me ‘why are you so passionate why are you always smiling youre always in a good mood where does that come from’ it began with that first mechanical trade job i excelled at it i was awesome at it frankly i was just very gifted for the trade i came out of my shell i had selfconfidence i felt important i became a whole new person and i owe all that to the hvac industry and ive done extremely well financially and every way else ive raised an awesome family i mean life has been fantastic so why not smile all the time thats why im always walking around with a grin on my face because life is awesome one thing i’ve learned about contractors and this really hurts them is they think their business is so unlike any other business that you could not and should not take advice from somebody who owns a lawn care company or a manufacturing company or a bar and grill they couldnt possibly help you because you do heating and air conditioning right but really hvac is the product and service everything else is the same  whats the most important thing you can impart on the readers for what they can expect to hear during contractor leadership live my topic is performancebased compensation that is basically pay for performance and the good news is business owners get paid by performance when owners hear performancebased compensation at first they say ‘maybe i should do that i dont know if we can i dont know if we should implement that will people like it will it motivate people’ well sure it will because performancebased compensation is the single method of paying a business owner when the business does really well you get paid when the business does really poorly you stop getting paid its just that simple so all business owners are on performancebased compensation what my class will do is propose that we pay everybody on some form of performancebased compensation a form that meets their individual culture so its not onesizefitsall but i think whatll surprise them is how simple performancebased compensation is how were already implementing it in our company and finally how american performancebased compensation is performancebased compensation is about as american as apple pie  tell us something interesting about yourself i make my living running the software company called aptora but my passion is mr hvac its a trademark of mine and it came from being insulted so part of that passion story is when i was an apprentice i ran to the truck i ran up the ladder i ran down the ladder and someone said ‘oh look theres mr hvac’ and i thought ‘i like that’ so i insisted everybody call me mr hvac then i trademarked it and bought the domain name for it  whats the most exciting part of your job right now well i believe public speaking and teaching classes is the most fun a person can have its a lot of fun filling a room full of people and showing them things maybe they havent seen before or giving them different ways to think about things the other thing i really enjoy doing is being part of the design team that builds software for the contracting industry so i serve as a software architect not the same thing as a programmer being involved in designing software that makes the lives of contractors better is what aptora is all about and so it’s the second most fun that i have building software being part of the process  what is the biggest issue we need to face in the hvacr contracting space i believe the biggest challenge the hvac industry has is finding good employees specifically service technicians in fact its really hard to find employees period it doesnt matter what business you own because everywhere you go theres a “help wanted” sign but its really difficult in the plumbing and hvac industry because young people dont want to get dirty they dont want to use tools there are young people that have never fixed anything theyve never used a tool to make a repair many of us in my generation we fixed everything we could you fixed the car the toilet you changed your own oil but many young people just have no interest in repairing anything and by the way my two sons are just like that ones  ones  they dont want to fix anything they dont want to get dirty they dont even want dirt on their hands so its really difficult when you combine that with a  percent unemployment rate nationally the other part of the problem and people dont like to hear this is there are too many owners too many technicians who start their own heating and airconditioning business now my daughters middle name is america so im about as proamerican as you can get im all for starting your own company but heres the difference many people start their own company because they have a better mousetrap to sell but in the hvac industry many people start their own company because theyre tired of putting up with garbage from other people so they walk out of your office and they quit ‘im going to start my own heating and airconditioning company’ they say so it wasnt that i thought i had a better idea its because i got tired of you telling me what to do thats the wrong motivation because you trade one boss for hundreds maybe thousands of bosses — your customers many of them fail some struggle and do very poorly they dont make as much money as they would working for somebody else especially a good company and they put up with a lot of stress they dont need they put their family through stress they dont need and again it isnt because they are an entrepreneur at heart its because they were avoiding authority i mean the economy can be so good that decent people can do pretty well but when things get really tough a lot of these weaker companies go out of business and its sad because many consulting people like me see a lot of pain weve seen a lot of families in bad shape because the man typically its a man is just deadset on calling his own shots so if they would just go to work for other companies and get along if we could all just get along we would have many more technicians to pick from owners need to think about it like this you have to make the transition from technician to business owner a lot of us are under the mistaken impression you can make more money by turning your wrench a little faster but at some point you realize youve maxed yourself out youve done all you can do with a toolbox right so you have to graduate to pushing the pen but many of us come from a background where our families made fun of pen pushers if you grew up middle class lower middle class like me the people who sat behind the desk they didnt work the people who made the company were the ones out turning the wrench right but its a team effort thats like saying the head coach doesnt need the quarterback and the quarterback doesnt need the coach or the offensive line its a different mentality to think youre actually working by sitting at a desk  what technology is coming up in the near future that you believe will alter the mechanical contracting course forever i believe home automation could be potentially very bad for the contractor as homes become ‘smarter’ then it means things are going to get more and more sophisticated leaving out unsophisticated contractors so in other words if thermostats can monitor the operating conditions of the heating and cooling system if water heaters can send a message to somebody saying ‘im not heating water’ if the home gets really really sophisticated it spells doom for smaller contractors that cant keep up with technology for example many contractors have failed to transition to mobile software full disclosure my company makes mobile software among other things but many contractors have said ‘no no were not doing that my people wont like that were going to use pen and paper’ if youre using that excuse youre being left behind because it’s basically ups vs the united states postal service ups went hightech long before the postal service did and we all know how that worked out ups has done far better and so has fedex right so dealers have to understand contractors have to understand that they have to keep up with technology home automation means the larger companies have a chance to do away with the smaller contractor and ill give you an example amazon sells you a thermostat that understands when the hvac system isnt working properly the thermostat then sends a message to amazon and then amazon gives the service call to the lowest bidder and thats whats going to start happening youre going to have home automation companies — honeywell

spirit of those in the mechanical trades and help them build successful companies that engage employees and customers jun   by kelly faloon ask james leichter about the hvacr and mechanical contracting industry and you’ll hear many reasons why he believes the industry is a lucrative and rewarding field and why more young people should enter the trades he has a true desire to nurture the entrepreneurial spirit of those in the mechanical trades and help them build successful companies that engage employees and customers leichter is president and ceo of software company aptora corp mr hvac llc and ra tax and accounting inc we talked with him recently about his thoughts on today’s hvacr industry  when and why did you decide to go into your particular career field i grew up in a singleparent alcoholic drugusing family and when i was in high school my counselor brought me into her office shortly before graduation and reminded me i had a low iq and a low gpa she asked me what my plans were for the future and i stared at my feet she went on to say ‘youre probably not collegebound you might want to consider a trade school such as plumbing or heating or air conditioning possibly a career in the military have you thought about that’ and i continued to stare at my feet i glanced up at all the plaques on the wall and didnt dare argue with her she went on for another few minutes thanked me for coming into her office and i walked out shortly after that i got into the mechanical trade by signing up for something called the job training partnership act its not around anymore it was a government program paid by welfare dollars that would pay me half my wage for  apprenticeship hours so the government paid me  an hour and the employer paid me  an hour which was close to minimum wage at the time and the employer was responsible for training me on useful skills and my job was to learn and not become a permanent drain on society  how did you develop the passion you have for the mechanical contracting industry ive had people ask me ‘why are you so passionate why are you always smiling youre always in a good mood where does that come from’ it began with that first mechanical trade job i excelled at it i was awesome at it frankly i was just very gifted for the trade i came out of my shell i had selfconfidence i felt important i became a whole new person and i owe all that to the hvac industry and ive done extremely well financially and every way else ive raised an awesome family i mean life has been fantastic so why not smile all the time thats why im always walking around with a grin on my face because life is awesome one thing i’ve learned about contractors and this really hurts them is they think their business is so unlike any other business that you could not and should not take advice from somebody who owns a lawn care company or a manufacturing company or a bar and grill they couldnt possibly help you because you do heating and air conditioning right but really hvac is the product and service everything else is the same  whats the most important thing you can impart on the readers for what they can expect to hear during contractor leadership live my topic is performancebased compensation that is basically pay for performance and the good news is business owners get paid by performance when owners hear performancebased compensation at first they say ‘maybe i should do that i dont know if we can i dont know if we should implement that will people like it will it motivate people’ well sure it will because performancebased compensation is the single method of paying a business owner when the business does really well you get paid when the business does really poorly you stop getting paid its just that simple so all business owners are on performancebased compensation what my class will do is propose that we pay everybody on some form of performancebased compensation a form that meets their individual culture so its not onesizefitsall but i think whatll surprise them is how simple performancebased compensation is how were already implementing it in our company and finally how american performancebased compensation is performancebased compensation is about as american as apple pie  tell us something interesting about yourself i make my living running the software company called aptora but my passion is mr hvac its a trademark of mine and it came from being insulted so part of that passion story is when i was an apprentice i ran to the truck i ran up the ladder i ran down the ladder and someone said ‘oh look theres mr hvac’ and i thought ‘i like that’ so i insisted everybody call me mr hvac then i trademarked it and bought the domain name for it  whats the most exciting part of your job right now well i believe public speaking and teaching classes is the most fun a person can have its a lot of fun filling a room full of people and showing them things maybe they havent seen before or giving them different ways to think about things the other thing i really enjoy doing is being part of the design team that builds software for the contracting industry so i serve as a software architect not the same thing as a programmer being involved in designing software that makes the lives of contractors better is what aptora is all about and so it’s the second most fun that i have building software being part of the process  what is the biggest issue we need to face in the hvacr contracting space i believe the biggest challenge the hvac industry has is finding good employees specifically service technicians in fact its really hard to find employees period it doesnt matter what business you own because everywhere you go theres a “help wanted” sign but its really difficult in the plumbing and hvac industry because young people dont want to get dirty they dont want to use tools there are young people that have never fixed anything theyve never used a tool to make a repair many of us in my generation we fixed everything we could you fixed the car the toilet you changed your own oil but many young people just have no interest in repairing anything and by the way my two sons are just like that ones  ones  they dont want to fix anything they dont want to get dirty they dont even want dirt on their hands so its really difficult when you combine that with a  percent unemployment rate nationally the other part of the problem and people dont like to hear this is there are too many owners too many technicians who start their own heating and airconditioning business now my daughters middle name is america so im about as proamerican as you can get im all for starting your own company but heres the difference many people start their own company because they have a better mousetrap to sell but in the hvac industry many people start their own company because theyre tired of putting up with garbage from other people so they walk out of your office and they quit ‘im going to start my own heating and airconditioning company’ they say so it wasnt that i thought i had a better idea its because i got tired of you telling me what to do thats the wrong motivation because you trade one boss for hundreds maybe thousands of bosses — your customers many of them fail some struggle and do very poorly they dont make as much money as they would working for somebody else especially a good company and they put up with a lot of stress they dont need they put their family through stress they dont need and again it isnt because they are an entrepreneur at heart its because they were avoiding authority i mean the economy can be so good that decent people can do pretty well but when things get really tough a lot of these weaker companies go out of business and its sad because many consulting people like me see a lot of pain weve seen a lot of families in bad shape because the man typically its a man is just deadset on calling his own shots so if they would just go to work for other companies and get along if we could all just get along we would have many more technicians to pick from owners need to think about it like this you have to make the transition from technician to business owner a lot of us are under the mistaken impression you can make more money by turning your wrench a little faster but at some point you realize youve maxed yourself out youve done all you can do with a toolbox right so you have to graduate to pushing the pen but many of us come from a background where our families made fun of pen pushers if you grew up middle class lower middle class like me the people who sat behind the desk they didnt work the people who made the company were the ones out turning the wrench right but its a team effort thats like saying the head coach doesnt need the quarterback and the quarterback doesnt need the coach or the offensive line its a different mentality to think youre actually working by sitting at a desk  what technology is coming up in the near future that you believe will alter the mechanical contracting course forever i believe home automation could be potentially very bad for the contractor as homes become ‘smarter’ then it means things are going to get more and more sophisticated leaving out unsophisticated contractors so in other words if thermostats can monitor the operating conditions of the heating and cooling system if water heaters can send a message to somebody saying ‘im not heating water’ if the home gets really really sophisticated it spells doom for smaller contractors that cant keep up with technology for example many contractors have failed to transition to mobile software full disclosure my company makes mobile software among other things but many contractors have said ‘no no were not doing that my people wont like that were going to use pen and paper’ if youre using that excuse youre being left behind because it’s basically ups vs the united states postal service ups went hightech long before the postal service did and we all know how that worked out ups has done far better and so has fedex right so dealers have to understand contractors have to understand that they have to keep up with technology home automation means the larger companies have a chance to do away with the smaller contractor and ill give you an example amazon sells you a thermostat that understands when the hvac system isnt working properly the thermostat then sends a message to amazon and then amazon gives the service call to the lowest bidder and thats whats going to start happening youre going to have home automation companies — honeywell amazon and others — starting to take away our customers so our customers arent going to know us anymore theyre going
