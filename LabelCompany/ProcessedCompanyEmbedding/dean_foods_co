about df  the largest milk processor in the us is now taking steps to unify all its white milk brands around the country into a single brand in an announcement significant to dean foods cosnysedf future growth strategy the company recently made this declaration that it will integrate all its  regional milk brands into a single brand dairypure dairy foods will however retain regional labels like berkeley farms deans and garelick farms etc but they would be placed alongside ‘dairypure’ name on the packaging dean foods company is primarily into food and beverages competing with the likes of dairy farmers of america and california diaries the company’s product range comprise of white milk ice cream cultured dairy products creamers juice tea ice cream mix and other dairy products that are distributed through retailers distributors foodservice outlets educational institutions and governmental entities across the country hitherto dean foods was selling several brands having limited regional presence and was battling competition struggling to protect its falling market share on one hand and rising cost of goods sold on the other the company has a  percent us market share warning gurufocus has detected  warning sign with df click here to check it out df year financial datathe intrinsic value of dfpeter lynch chart of dfbenefit of single brand while in a competitive scenario companies choose to grow and protect their markets by launching several brands of a single product and attack at various price segments and geographies at times having a single brand and focusing on its growth too is not a bad idea having a unified brand will help the company market the brand better and all its energies will be focused in selling dairypure besides it can claim to market fresh milk in different markets processed from its nearest regional diaries consolidation will mean more sales higher production capacity utilization and higher profit margins as a result of decreased promotion  selling costs this will help the company come out of the red and maybe earn sustainable profits for many years dean foods’ major challenges have been declining percapita us milk consumption fierce competition from other beverages demographic shifts and other factors this has resulted in the closure of  factories or  percent of its production capacity the company’s remaining  plants too are operational at just over threefifths or about  of their capacities will it spell profits dean foods slipped into losses for the year ended december  as against a net income of  million in  the company posted a loss of  million despite the growth in revenues from  billion in  to  billion in  the announcement has so far failed to cheer investors the stock has seen little upside during the past couple of trading session there is skepticism though the adoption of one brand will make dairypure a  billion brand catapulting it to one of the largest consumer packaged goods in the us it also needs to be mentioned that the journey is going to be anything but smooth given the contemporary consumer behavior and falling average milk consumption in the us the company may have to answer several health and weight control issues it may need to convince consumers about the suitability of cow’s milk as a good source of protein and vitamin d its product being antibiotic free and natural besides all these even competition may choose to play spoil sport by adopting counter strategies it therefore remains to be seen whether dean foods can be profitable soon again and whether the same is

between seo and sem which one is right for me search engine optimization seo is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results you cannot pay to improve your website ranking on bing or yahoo thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or organic search results clicks from seo are free but seo also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results
