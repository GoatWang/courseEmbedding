future of ophthalmology richard lindstrom has placed a high value on personal relationships ocular surgery news us edition june  michael piechocki richard l lindstrom md describes himself as a sciencebased practitioner “i’m very science or evidencebased in my approach to medicine while there is art to medicine i try to have a scientific approach and if we don’t have any science i try to help create that science” he said over the past several decades dr lindstrom has had a large role in doing just that creating science in ophthalmology but for him he said the most rewarding aspect has been practicing medicine and patient care and teaching other ophthalmologists mentors that he met early in his career taught him the value of the physicianpatient relationship and he has not forgotten their lessons “i find it extraordinarily rewarding to do a cataract operation or lasik and have the patient come back with a big smile on his or her face i like the feedback the positive reinforcement we get from restoring or enhancing people’s sight with eye surgery” he said meeting the mentors dr lindstrom grew up wayzata minn a western suburb of minneapolis he graduated from wayzata high school and went on to graduate magna cum laude from the university of minnesota he received his doctorate from the university of minnesota medical school in  dr lindstrom first became interested in ophthalmology toward the end of his medical training while doing his rotations he narrowed his choices to plastic surgery ear nose and throat and ophthalmology “i was always interested in what i call microsurgery” dr lindstrom said “i like the idea of sitting down and operating under a microscope and doing things that are precise ent plastics and ophthalmology offered that opportunity” two surgeons he met at this time particularly influenced his decision “as is often the case i met a mentor in ophthalmology a gentleman whose name is donald j doughman md he had just come to the university of minnesota from harvard where he had completed a fellowship in cornea” dr lindstrom said “he influenced my interest in ophthalmology significantly” at about that time dr lindstrom also met malcolm a mccannel md a prominent private practice ophthalmologist in minnesota “he let me spend a month following him around i watched him in the clinic and in the operating room after working in the laboratory with don doughman and getting excited about eye research at the university and then seeing what mac mccannel’s practice was like i quickly chose ophthalmology” dr lindstrom said “i really was influenced by their personalities and the fact that they were happy with their choices that influenced me to follow in their footsteps” dr lindstrom said “if i had met a similar set of mentors in ent or plastic surgery i probably would have gone in that direction it really was the people that i happened to meet at that moment in my life that allowed me to make the decision” dr lindstrom said dr mccannel in particular was very good with people “he taught me a lot of interactive people skills in terms of how to talk to people i learned a lot by just observing his style i still use some of the things he taught me about physicianpatient interaction” dr lindstrom said “don doughman was a very ethical careful clinician a consummate combined teacherresearcherclinician he influenced me to be not just a clinician but to pursue a role in teaching and to have an inquisitive mind and do clinical and basic research” dr lindstrom said “in my career i have tried to do all three” early research while he was a senior medical student in  dr lindstrom began his pioneering research into corneal preservation partially funded by the national eye institute this research paved the way for the development of optisol gs bausch  lomb which has since become the corneal storage medium most commonly used by eye banks in the united states and abroad “the research i began as a medical student with don doughman really led to the eventual development of that product with my careerlong scientist associate debra shelnik ms” dr lindstrom said “optisol didn’t come on the scene until almost  years later but it was that seed that really built that product” dr lindstrom also did research in organ culture preservation finding that the cornea is also well preserved at a higher temperature a method that was commonly used in europe this early research sparked dr lindstrom’s lifelong interest in the cornea over his career he has attained  patents in ophthalmology but he said he is most proud of the six in the field of corneal preservation from a financial standpoint however the invention dr lindstrom said has been the most financially rewarding is in the area of iol design in  after completing a cornea fellowship in minnesota dr lindstrom began a fellowship in dallas working with william s harris md a pioneer in the development of phacoemulsification and posterior chamber lens implants “i was introduced to bill harris at a time when most people were doing intracapsular cataract extraction and if they were implanting were using irissupported or anterior chamber lenses through him i was introduced to phaco and posterior chamber lenses” dr lindstrom said “this was around the time steve shearing dick kratz john sheets john pearce bob sinskey charles kelman and others were doing their pioneering work i got to know all those people so i became involved at a very early stage of my career” he said dr lindstrom designed his first iol in  since then he has designed iols for several companies including iolab surgidev m vision care storz and chiron several of the lenses dr lindstrom said were commercially successful and some of the patents he holds cover these lens designs phillips eye institute following a month heed fellowship in glaucoma at the university of utah and a stint as a private practitioner in dallas dr lindstrom returned to minnesota where he would spend the next  years on the faculty of the university of minnesota in his last  years there he was made a full professor of ophthalmology and held the harold g scheie research chair in ophthalmology he was the youngest surgeon at that time to hold an endowed chair at the university of minnesota after leaving the university dr lindstrom took a lead role in the development of the center for teaching and research at the phillips eye institute the phillips eye institute was – and still is – a freestanding ambulatory surgery center and freestanding diagnostic unit open to any ophthalmologist in the community it is a nonprofit private venture which unlike many similar centers is not universitybased “i haven’t seen anything else exactly like it in the country” dr lindstrom said “basically it is a place to go and do your surgery in a high quality environment and also provides access to all the expensive sophisticated diagnostic testing equipment that most private practitioners cannot afford” when dr lindstrom left the university he approached the group developing the phillips eye institute and suggested the addition of a teaching and research agenda “i thought that would enhance the prestige of the institution and make it even more attractive to patients” he said “i suggested our primary training agenda and research agenda should be a practical agenda for practicing ophthalmologists we would focus on surgical skills transfer for the already practicing eye surgeon we would train them on how to incorporate new surgical technologies into their armamentarium” this was at the time when phacoemulsification use was on the increase its popularity was growing but many ophthalmologists had not yet been fully trained for it during their residencies the phillips center offered courses on phacoemulsification and iol implantation subsequently dr lindstrom said they began training surgeons in refractive surgery including photorefractive keratectomy and lasik the phillips center for teaching and research has also supported numerous clinical trials on new technologies dr lindstrom said out of the office in his private life dr lindstrom’s interests extend far beyond ophthalmology to activities as diverse as philanthropy restoring and collecting classic cars and wooden boats investing in real estate serving as chairman and chief executive officer of a yearold construction company and traveling dr lindstrom owns several classic cars including a ferrari a fully restored austin healy and an old jeep occasionally he can be found displaying them at local car shows dr lindstrom also recently finished restoring an allmahogany italian riva runabout boat that once belonged to rita hayworth he also owns a  garwood speedster and a venetian taxi boat also built in italy “there’s a nationwide society the antique and classic boat society we have rallies and a couple of shows a year here but i haven’t taken them on the road yet” he said “there are a couple of national boat shows for the antique and classic boats of america and i might take this boat on the road and show it a few places i’ve shown my austin healy and its won one concourse it’s been restored to mint condition” he said dr lindstrom has also made philanthropy a hobby raising money for the vision foundation at the university of minnesota department of ophthalmology where he has endowed a chair and the university of minnesota williams fund which supports student athletes his philanthropy touches organized ophthalmology as well he was a founder donor to the american academy of ophthalmology foundation and at the recent american society of cataract and refractive surgery meeting incoming president marguerite b mcdonald md announced that he and his wife jaci are among the highest level early contributors to the new ascrs foundation dr lindstrom also raises money for small charities in his local area “there’s one called inner city tennis which works with inner city kids to give them the opportunity to experience tennis but really it’s a characterbuilding and mentoring program disguised as tennis” he said “i spend some of my time and money now supporting that program” mentor role these days dr lindstrom said “i actually get more and more pleasure out of mentoring other people like my junior associates and my fellows than i do from doing ophthalmology myself i am still active in patient care teaching and research but i kind of enjoy the mentoring part of it more every year” over the  years dr lindstrom has spent in practice he has trained  ophthalmologists as fellows in his practice some of whom have gone on to become rather notable names stephen lane md is now the president elect of the american society of cataract and refractive surgery other former fellows include s gregory smith md frank bucci md and richard duffy md three of dr lindstrom’s current partners at minnesota eye consultants david harden md elizabeth a davis md and tim schneider md were also former fellows “i get a lot of satisfaction from teaching the things i’m appreciating more now are how important those  fellows i’ve trained are and the contributions they are making they make me feel a little bit immortal if you will like my work will live on with all the good work that they are doing i take a lot of pride in that” dr lindstrom said “oneonone teaching of other surgeons and then letting them go off and apply those skills to their patients kind of multiplies the good” he said construction experience lends perspective dr lindstrom is also the majority owner the chairman and ceo of lindstrom cleaning and construction an insurance reconstruction business started by his father following world war ii “when you have wind damage fire damage or water damage to your home or building you call the insurance company and tell them what’s wrong then the insurance company calls lindstrom cleaning and construction and we fix it” he said “i grew up in the business i started working as a laborer in it when i was  then as a carpenter etc” “my father sort of groomed me to go into the business but instead i went to medical school and thought that was the end of that since this was a familyowned business my father needed to sell it to someone to retire” dr lindstrom said “i was the only person in the family who could afford to buy it” dr lindstrom bought the business  years ago and still serves as chairman and chief executive officer spending at least  day a month meeting with the management team and leading the company “it’s been fun for me it’s quite different from medicine i’m working with a different group of people than i am in my practice” he said ten years ago dr lindstrom also started another business with a friend of his “we went out and bought an apartment building that needed some work and fixed it up each year we acquired another so i’m in the rental property ownership business as well that’s been a nice diversification too” he said he also has enjoyed providing seed capital and consultation for several startup companies inside and outside the eye care field he serves on several corporate boards including tlc vision a public company traded on nasdaq dr lindstrom said the experiences he had growing up and working in the construction business have influenced his approach to medicine “i think it did in that i learned what it is to work hard” he said “going out in the field on construction jobs where there had been a fire or a flood or wind damage a lot of times it was very hard work i also got to see how a small business was run i think that got me more interested in the business side of medicine a lot of people have not had that opportunity and i think i have more of a business mind than i might otherwise have had without that experience i think that’s helped me as far as managing a practice it’s helped me be a little bit better as a consultant to companies in the ophthalmic industry” his experience in the construction business also gave him an appreciation for the quality of life ophthalmology has given him “when i look at the nice environment in my private office and at the phillips eye institute and i compare that to the work i did from age  to  in the summers working on a construction crew i don’t feel so bad even when i’m having a bad day” he said “a bad day in ophthalmology is pretty good compared to some days i would spend on a construction crew trying to clean up a fire you work all day you go home dirty and tired you make a decent living but comparing it to the quality of life of the typical ophthalmologist it gives you an appreciation if you’ve been on both sides” travel dr lindstrom and his wife travel frequently and have seen much of the world “the most interesting is africa i’ve been to south africa zimbabwe seeing all the big animals i found africa to be fascinating to travel and a fascinating culture” he said “the country that i enjoy visiting the most is australia except that it’s too far away i think the australians are fortunate to have such a beautiful country” he said dr lindstrom currently has a small house on the wailea coast of maui in hawaii where he and jaci escape the minnesota winters jaci lindstrom has also been involved in ophthalmology at dr lindstrom’s side she is a certified ophthalmic medical technologist and has served as executive director of the international society of refractive surgery she is currently executive director of the intraocular implant club the small honorary club of cataract surgeons started by harold ridley and others in  dr lindstrom’s family is important to him together dr lindstrom and jaci have raised their daughter michelle who is currently training to become a nurse at regis college in colorado and son michael who will be a junior in high school future plans dr lindstrom will be  years old this year and he is starting to take a little more time off however he still plans to continue practicing teaching researching consulting and mentoring “but i’ll do it at a slower pace” he said he is slowly cutting back on the number of patients he sees and making more time for golf tennis skiing boating and automobiling “there are two ways to stop practicing ophthalmology” he said “there is the ophthalmologist who works to a certain age full time and then retires completely then there’s the ophthalmologist who slowly tapers off but maybe never quits” “when i was in dallas we had a senior partner who was  or  years old who was still coming to the office every day seeing about  patients reading journals and staying in touch i hope that’ll be me” dr lindstrom said “it’s my current intent not to quit ever but to continually taper back as long as my skills hold up i’ll continue to be a surgeon then i think i’ll continue to do a little medical ophthalmology a little research and some teaching and consulting on the side until no one is interested in what i have to say anymore “ophthalmology has been very good to me and is a big part of my life i would like to stay involved with it as long as i’m able as long as i’m making a contribution” for your

ophthalmology myself i am still active in patient care teaching and research but i kind of enjoy the mentoring part of it more every year” over the  years dr lindstrom has spent in practice he has trained  ophthalmologists as fellows in his practice some of whom have gone on to become rather notable names stephen lane md is now the president elect of the american society of cataract and refractive surgery other former fellows include s gregory smith md frank bucci md and richard duffy md three of dr lindstrom’s current partners at minnesota eye consultants david harden md elizabeth a davis md and tim schneider md were also former fellows “i get a lot of satisfaction from teaching the things i’m appreciating more now are how important those  fellows i’ve trained are and the contributions they are making they make me feel a little bit immortal if you will like my work will live on with all the good work that they are doing i take a lot of pride in that” dr lindstrom said “oneonone teaching of other surgeons and then letting them go off and apply those skills to their patients kind of multiplies the good” he said construction experience lends perspective dr lindstrom is also the majority owner the chairman and ceo of lindstrom cleaning and construction an insurance reconstruction business started by his father following world war ii “when you have wind damage fire damage or water damage to your home or building you call the insurance company and tell them what’s wrong then the insurance company calls lindstrom cleaning and construction and we fix it” he said “i grew up in the business i started working as a laborer in it when i was  then as a carpenter etc” “my father sort of groomed me to go into the business but instead i went to medical school and thought that was the end of that since this was a familyowned business my father needed to sell it to someone to retire” dr lindstrom said “i was the only person in the family who could afford to buy it” dr lindstrom bought the business  years ago and still serves as chairman and chief executive officer spending at least  day a month meeting with the management team and leading the company “it’s been fun for me it’s quite different from medicine i’m working with a different group of people than i am in my practice” he said ten years ago dr lindstrom also started another business with a friend of his “we went out and bought an apartment building that needed some work and fixed it up each year we acquired another so i’m in the rental property ownership business as well that’s been a nice diversification too” he said he also has enjoyed providing seed capital and consultation for several startup companies inside and outside the eye care field he serves on several corporate boards including tlc vision a public company traded on nasdaq dr lindstrom said the experiences he had growing up and working in the construction business have influenced his approach to medicine “i think it did in that i learned what it is to work hard” he said “going out in the field on construction jobs where there had been a fire or a flood or wind damage a lot of times it was very hard work i also got to see how a small business was run i think that got me more interested in the business side of medicine a lot of people have not had that opportunity and i think i have more of a business mind than i might otherwise have had without that experience i think that’s helped me as far as managing a practice it’s helped me be a little bit better as a consultant to companies in the ophthalmic industry” his experience in the construction business also gave him an appreciation for the quality of life ophthalmology has given him “when i look at the nice environment in my private office and at the phillips eye institute and i compare that to the work i did from age  to  in the summers working on a construction crew i don’t feel so bad even when i’m having a bad day” he said “a bad day in ophthalmology is pretty good compared to some days i would spend on a construction crew trying to clean up a fire you work all day you go home dirty and tired you make a decent living but comparing it to the quality of life of the typical ophthalmologist it gives you an appreciation if you’ve been on both sides” travel dr lindstrom and his wife travel frequently and have seen much of the world “the most interesting is africa i’ve been to south africa zimbabwe seeing all the big animals i found africa to be fascinating to travel and a fascinating culture” he said “the country that i enjoy visiting the most is australia except that it’s too far away i think the australians are fortunate to have such a beautiful country” he said dr lindstrom currently has a small house on the wailea coast of maui in hawaii where he and jaci escape the minnesota winters jaci lindstrom has also been involved in ophthalmology at dr lindstrom’s side she is a certified ophthalmic medical technologist and has served as executive director of the international society of refractive surgery she is currently executive director of the intraocular implant club the small honorary club of cataract surgeons started by harold ridley and others in  dr lindstrom’s family is important to him together dr lindstrom and jaci have raised their daughter michelle who is currently training to become a nurse at regis college in colorado and son michael who will be a junior in high school future plans dr lindstrom will be  years old this year and he is starting to take a little more time off however he still plans to continue practicing teaching researching consulting and mentoring “but i’ll do it at a slower pace” he said he is slowly cutting back on the number of patients he sees and making more time for golf tennis skiing boating and automobiling “there are two ways to stop practicing ophthalmology” he said “there is the ophthalmologist who works to a certain age full time and then retires completely then there’s the ophthalmologist who slowly tapers off but maybe never quits” “when i was in dallas we had a senior partner who was  or  years old who was still coming to the office every day seeing about  patients reading journals and staying in touch i hope that’ll be me” dr lindstrom said “it’s my current intent not to quit ever but to continually taper back as long as my skills hold up i’ll continue to be a surgeon then i think i’ll continue to do a little medical ophthalmology a little research and some teaching and consulting on the side until no one is interested in what i have to say anymore “ophthalmology has been very good to me and is a big part of my life i would like to stay involved with it as long as i’m able as long as i’m making a contribution” for your

result and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for yourisksdoctors see a number of patients in a day sometimes in minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand this can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations and they can end up missing certain problem indicators while some problems like a cold or flu can be diagnosed in this time more complex ailments require attention which takes up time reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demandsurgery has some more dire risks attached to it so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure if a patient has a reaction to anesthesia it can cause very serious complications but this is an uncommon occurrence blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery often caused by inactivity during recovery infections numbness scarring swelling and death are all possible but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery youre undergoing talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potentialaftercaresurgery affects people in different ways but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia youll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have the nurse will tell you how the procedure went what effect it will have on your condition what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal if you start feeling pain the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse when possible its also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs this can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot some surgeries are outpatient procedures where people are released the same day for major surgeries patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bringrecovery and followupyour recovery time and followup expectations will vary depending on your procedure for example you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heartvalve surgery your surgeon will give you a list of things that youll need to do during this time including what medications to take and when youll be able to get back to work and other activitiesevery surgery will have a followup call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health if you have a major operation like heart surgery its important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected these appointments will give you peace of mind about your state of health and ensure that any issues are caught early on we just redesigned ypcom do you like it×
