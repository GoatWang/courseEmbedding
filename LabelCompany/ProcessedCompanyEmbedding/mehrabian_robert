conference over to your host mr jason vanwees please go ahead sir jason vanwees hi everyone and good morning this is jason vanwees senior vice president strategy and mergers and acquisitions at teledyne and i’d like to welcome everyone to teledyne’s first quarter  earnings release conference call we released our earnings earlier this morning before the market open joining me today are teledyne’s chairman president and ceo robert mehrabian chief operating officer al pichelli senior vice president and cfo sue main and senior vice president general counsel chief compliance officer and secretary melanie cibik after remarks by robert and sue we’ll ask for your questions however before we get started our attorneys have reminded me to tell you that all forwardlooking statements made this morning are subject to various assumptions risks and caveats made in our sec filings and in the earnings release itself and of course actual results may differ materially in order to avoid potential selective disclosures this call is simultaneously being webcast and a replay both via webcast and dialin will be available for approximately one month here’s robert robert mehrabian thank you jason good morning ladies and gentlemen let me begin with a very short review of our history my predecessor henry singleton founded teledyne july of  we’ve been in operation as an independent company for  years with the exception of a failed marriage between mid and late i’ve had the privilege of serving as the ceo of the company since our divorce in late  or spinoff in the accepted wall street jargon and this is my th earnings conference call as i noted in my annual letter to stockholders compared to any time in the past  years and the most excited about our current business portfolio and the overall outlook of our markets now getting back to the current business teledyne begin  with a great quarter we achieved organic growth across each business segment with especially strong performance in our digital imaging segment furthermore bookings were strong in nearly all commercial businesses as well as our government imaging business resulting in a quarterly booktobill  adjusted operating margin which excludes ev acquisition related charges increased over  basis points and was a record for any first quarter furthermore given the strong sales and marketing performance adjusted earnings were  compared to our prior outlook of  to  which also excluded ev acquisition related cost the adjusted earnings of  or  increase over the solid  of q of last year before discussing our business segments i want to make some comments about the presentation of our results in light of the recent ev acquisition for the last  years and throughout our prior  acquisitions we have consistently presented gaap margins and earnings per share however this quarter in order to eliminate any confusion regarding our underlying business performance we are presented our results with and without ev acquisition related charges we felt this was necessary first because our prior earnings outlooks excluded ev and second the magnitude of our largest transactions to date and it’s related onetime expenses overwhelm our core business performance i believe it’s also worth noting that even this time we’ve only adjusted the results and outlook for specific shortterm nonrecurring transaction costs which we expect to end – before the end of  significant ongoing expenses such as amortization of intangible assets have always been and we remain within our reported gaap results for reference in full year  amortization alone will represent nearly  million or about  per share of expense regarding teledyne ev we were delighted to close that acquisition on march  of the first quarter we’re proud to continue the company year legacy of innovation in specialized high technology product the integration is proceeding rapidly and smoothly and our ev colleagues made presentations to our board of directors and participated in our three day quarterly operations reviews last week going forward given the complementary products in which machine vision space imaging medical imaging and semiconductor markets the majority of ev’s operations will be reported within our digital imaging segment on an annual basis such teledyne ev businesses represent approximately  million of sales the balance of teledyne ev’s businesses comprised of defenserelated microwave and semiconductor devices and representing approximately  million of annual sales will be reported within our aerospace and defense electronics segment finally a small but very important high technology business most at teledyne known as teledyne sp devices will be combined with teledyne lecroy reported within our instrumentation segment now turning back to the first quarter results in our instrumentation segment first quarter sales increased  from last year’s sales of marine instrumentation decreased  due to lower sales of interconnect systems or offshore energy production largely offset by increased sales of defenserelated and landbased interconnect systems marine instrumentation orders however increased over  from last year and were at the highest level in two years with the demand balance across subsea vehicles mine countermeasures and other solar systems and landbased cables interconnect and corrosion sensors in the environmental domain sales increased  and operating margin and operating profit also increased largely as a result of continued growth in pollution and particulate monitoring instrumentation and the recent acquisition of hanson research and strong margin performance across the majority of product lines sales of electronic test and measurement systems increased  overall with organic growth of  sales of protocol analyzers used by engineers to troubleshoot data communication systems and test interoperability of devices continue to be very healthy segment operating profit and operating margin decreased but this was solely due to lower sales margins and product mix within our marine instrumentations margins for our environmental and electronic test and instrumentation product lines improved  basis points and  basis points respectively from last year turning to digital imaging first quarter sales increased  with organic growth of  the organic increase in sales was relatively broadbased including strong growth for industrial machine vision cameras micro electromechanical systems or mems and laserbased mapping systems in addition to strong sales orders were excellent with a booktobill of  this statistics exclude the  million of revenue from teledyne ev at the end of the quarter and over  million of assumed backlog from the acquisition gaap operating margin increased  basis points from last year and excluding  million of ev acquisitionrelated costs in this segment operating margin increased  basis points in the aerospace and defense electronics segment first quarter sales declined slightly as a result of divestiture of teledyne printed circuit technology in july  excluding the divestiture organic sales grew  primarily as a result of increased sales of commercial avionics segment operating margin increased  basis points from last year to  in the engineering systems segment first quarter revenue increased  and operating margin improved  basis points the higher revenue resulted from increased sales of cruise missile engines commercial hydrogen generators and missile defense engineering services in conclusion i’m very pleased with our great start in  first our businesses performed exceptionally well second we closed what i believe to be one of teledyne’s best acquisitions while teledyne ev is our largest acquisition todate it is a company made up of a combination of strong businesses all of which are large boltons to existing businesses inside teledyne as i mentioned earlier the integration is going very well and we’re very impressed with the quality of ev management employees and technologies just as an example while teledyne ev represents approximately  of teledyne’s pro forma combined revenue ev’s patent represent approximately  of our combined portfolio of over  issued active patents finally we’re committed to maintaining strong cash flow and a healthy balance sheet given the ev transaction our debttoebitda leverage ratio increased to  in the first quarter compared to  at yearend  however our aggregate cost of debt decreased by approximately  basis points given the very favorable terms of the ev acquisitionrelated financing i will now turn the call over to sue sue main thank you robert and good morning everyone i will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by robert and then i will discuss our second quarter and full year  outlook in the first quarter cash flow from operating activity was  million compared with cash flow of  million for the same period of  while cash flow declined from last year it was nevertheless the secondhighest level for any teledyne first quarter the lower cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter of  primarily reflected the impact of transactionrelated expense payments for the ev acquisition and the timing of accounts receivable collections free cash flow that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures was  million for the first quarter of  compared with  in  capital expenditures were  million in the first quarter compared to  million for the same period of  depreciation and amortization expense was  million in the first quarter compared to  million for the same period of  we ended the quarter with approximately  billion of net debt that is approximately  billion debt and capital leases less cash of  million or a net debt to capital ratio of  stock option compensation expense was  million in the first quarter of  compared to  million in the first quarter of  as noted in the earnings release the first quarter of  contained  million of pretax charges related to the ev acquisition included in cost of sales for our digital imaging segment was  million related to inventory stepup amortization included in sga expense was  million comprised of stamp duty a  basis points uk transaction tax and financial advisory legal accounting and other fees of this  million was included in corporate expense and  million was included in the digital imaging segment included in other expense was  million for foreign currency option contract to hedge the purchase price finally a commitment fee expense of  million related to uk specific certain funds bridge financing facility was included in interest expense while the majority of costs were expensed in the first quarter we expect an additional cost of approximately  million or  to  per share in the remainder of  most of these will relate to inventory stepup amortization and restructuring cost and will be included in the digital imaging segment and to a lesser degree in the aerospace and defense electronics segments turning to our outlook management currently believe that gaap earnings per share in the second quarter of  will be in the range of  to  per share adjusted earnings per share which excluded transaction related costs are expected to be in the range of  to  and for the full year  our gaap earnings per share outlook is  to  adjusted full year earnings per share are expected to be in the range of  to  this compares to our prior outlook of  to  which excluded ev the  full year effective tax rate excluding any discrete items is expected to be  i will now pass the call back to robert robert mehrabian thank you sue we would now like to take your questions operator if you are ready to proceed with the questions and answers please go ahead questionandanswer session operator operator instructions and our first question will come from the line of greg konrad please go ahead greg konrad good morning and great quarter robert mehrabian thank you greg greg konrad i just wanted to start with ev i mean multiple times you’ve mentioned about how complementary the two portfolios are and i was hoping you could discuss maybe some of the product development indiscernible the combination and how should we think about revenue synergies over time robert mehrabian sure greg let me start with professional imaging as an example we currently make machine vision cameras as well as sensors and they make machine vision sensors the difference between the sensors are that they’re stronger in cmos sensors than we are and most importantly in twodimensional area scan cmos sensors the area that we expect would contribute to growth is their ability to do threedimensional imaging which we do not have currently in our professional imaging portfolio even though we do have it in our laser imaging portfolio that we do from above ground or underground this is our multiple laser scans of object second we have extra oral dental sensors in our professional imaging and they have intraoral dental sensors and a very healthy ip portfolio in that area and we think that would benefit us significantly to generate new products and revenues in the rf power domain we make traveling wave tubes large ones they make magnetrons which are used for cancer therapy radiation those are similar technologies the underlying technologies in amplifying electromagnetic waves are very similar on those two technologies on the other hand while we make large wave tubs traveling wave tubes they make small traveling wave tubes both of these are again microwave power modules and we would benefit from each others technologies just as importantly couple to a traveling wave tube is usually you have to have a power supply that supplies the power to the traveling wave tube as the traveling wave tube then magnifies the electromagnetic waves they make the part amplifies where both their solid state and small mini traveling wave tubes we do not have that technology and we’d like to develop it for our larger traveling wave tubes i’ll just make one other very quick observation there are many similar things let me give one in space imaging we are wellknown and respected the best in the world for space imaging in the infrared domain whether it’s on satellites looking up or on various scopes like large hobbled telescopes looking down and looking up they are great as well as our first groundbased telescopes they’re very good the world’s best in the visible area i think we can combine their product in the visible domain with our products in the infrared domain and present a unique set of capabilities to a wide range of customers including classified programs those are just some of the examples there are many others that i can’t give greg greg konrad thank you that was great and then if we look at the guidance that you gave for the year last quarter versus the adjusted guidance in this quarter it’s up about  how much of that is attributable to ev excluding transaction expenses versus the change in outlook for the rest of the business robert mehrabian i think about  to  is from ev let’s just say  and  to  is from our core businesses – existing businesses greg konrad thank you and then just… robert mehrabian yes go ahead please greg konrad sorry just last one for me i mean the booktobill in the quarter of  i think last quarter you’re talking about organic growth of maybe  to  have you seen an acceleration in that organic growth especially when i look at digital imaging did in the quarter robert mehrabian yes i think an organic growth in the first quarter was about  – over  i expect that during the year it’d be about  better than the  to  that we indicated greg konrad thank you robert mehrabian thank you greg operator thank you and next we’ll go to jim ricchiuti with needham and company please go ahead jim ricchiuti hi good morning congratulations on closing the transaction wanted to follow up on just the growth acceleration that you’re seeing in a couple of parts of the business in particular starting with the digital imaging i think that you alluded to  organic growth you cited a couple of areas i mean how evenly was that it seems like the machine vision business is going very well but i wondered if you could just give us a little bit of color on that and is ev seeing this same kind of momentum in this area of their business robert mehrabian yes let me start with our business first jim there are two areas that are contributing to our strong growth in the imaging businesses first is flat panel displays and there we’re enjoying really strong orders especially with oled displays that are the new flexible displays plants are being built and almost all of them use our cameras lines cameras for those displays to look at the quality second we have – as you may recall we have a mems foundry in beaumont and that foundry is one of the three largest independent mems foundries in the world we’re enjoying an exceptional year there we’re almost  booked in that foundry and that’s another growth area i think ev also is enjoying similar growth specifically in barcode reading use again that uses their cameras as well as the d sensors which i mentioned which are very unique we are also seeing demand growing for our cmos xray detectors at the core teledyne businesses so those are some examples jim ricchiuti okay that’s helpful robert in the ev d sensors are the applications there for – we’ve been hearing more and more of about d machine vision are the end markets again skewed more toward consumer electronics devices industrial applications or inspection of in production lines that are producing consumer electronics or are there some other applications for their d sensors that go into d machine vision robert mehrabian i would say in both areas first d sensors are used obviously in consumer electronics but also they are used in machine vision applications because you get a more precise reading of three dimensional sizes and quality of objects that you are observing they are also used in and i think we will probably start participating in in addition to machine vision in automotive collision and avoidance and this gives us a whole debt capability in d added to what we have in our own laserbased systems this gives us a whole new set of capabilities to go in new markets jim ricchiuti is there any unusual seasonality that we need to be mindful of with respect to the ev business as we go through the year robert mehrabian yes historically what they’ve done is they’ve had – year was ended in march and historically what it had is a bigger quarters at the end of the year we’re trying to obviously flatten that out like we trying to do with our own businesses but historically they started slow in their first quarter which is this would be their first quarter and of course this is our second quarter but then they picked up but i think that i would view that jim as transition year this should flatten out in future years jim ricchiuti and last question for me if we think about blended gross margins for teledyne now i mean it seems to be that you are given the mix and you seem to be overlaying some highermargin businesses is there a way to think in broad terms about your gross margins over the next one to two years robert mehrabian i think our gross margins would go up from let’s say  to  but the bottom line margins are different the business is we buying have better in some areas not into all areas in some areas have better operating margins than we do but overall because we’re going to be adding about  to  of intangibles what happens is that if you do on ebitda analysis that is take the amortization out our overall margins would increase but because the amortization is hitting us pretty hard the overall bottom line margin of the company will go down somewhat maybe    basis points but that’s all right because in the end what you’re looking for is how much profit you make and what happens to your eps so in that way we should be fine jim ricchiuti thanks very much operator thank you operator instructions robert mehrabian thank you operator that doesn’t seem to be any other questions are there operator there are no further questions please go ahead robert mehrabian great i will

disclosures this call is simultaneously being webcast and a replay both via webcast and dialin will be available for approximately one month heres robert robert mehrabian thank you jason and good morning everyone we ended  with our best quarter of the year the majority of our commercial businesses that is imaging for machine vision and life sciences environmental and electronic test and measurement instrumentation and commercial aerospace avionics all increased organically from last year sales of marine instrumentation declined as expected but comparisons are also expected to ease significantly in  orders across our government businesses continued to be strong and continue to yearend overall backlog which was approximately  million greater than last years gaap earnings per share from continued operations were  excluding  of charges related to the pending acquisition of ev earnings were  i should note that our fourth quarter earnings outlook of  to  issued on november   did not include charges related to the ev transaction which was announced on december   finally fullyear cash from operations and free cash flow were all time record each increasing over  from last year before i commenting on our business segment i want to emphasize that sales and comparisons reflect the fact that the fourth quarter and fullyear  contained  and  weeks respectively versus  and  weeks last year so we had one less week this year in both the fourth quarter and the fullyear to ship products in the instrumentation segment fourth quarter sales decreased  from last years sales of marine instrumentation decreased  due to lower sales of interconnect systems and other marine sensors for energy exploration and production throughout the last two years sales at marine instrumentation to defense markets have helped mitigate the decline due to energy the longterm outlook for our products for us submarine programs as well as our autonomous underwater vehicles remain very attractive in the environmental domain sales increased  and operating margin and operating profit also increased largely as a result of continued growth in our pollution and particulate monitoring instrumentation sales of electronic test and measurement systems increased  overall sales of protocol analyzers used by engineers to troubleshoot data communication system and test interoperability continued to be very healthy while gaap segment operating profit declined and operating margin decreased this was solely due to lower sales and margins within the marine instrumentation margins for both our environmental and electronic test and measurement instrumentation product lines were at record levels turning to digital imaging segment fourth quarter sales increased  and operating margin increased  basis points the increase in sales primarily reflected greater sales of machine vision cameras for industrial and semiconductor application xray detectors for life sciences microelectromechanical systems or mems and geospatial software and laser based mapping systems sales of infrared sensors and government funded research decreased slightly yearoveryear but orders were very strong with our government based backlog increasing over  in this segment in the aerospace and defense electronics segment fourth quarter sales increased  organically from last year primarily as a result of increased sales of commercial avionics segment operating margin increased  basis points from last year to  in the engineered systems segment fourth quarter revenue decreased  and operating margin improved  basis points the lower revenue resulted from a difficult comparison and the timing of deliveries from certain marine manufacturing programs which were partially offset by increased sales of cruise missile engines in conclusion i am most excited compared to anytime in our history about our current business portfolio and the overall outlook for our end markets over the last few years with endured cuts to the defense spending followed by severe decline in offshore energy markets nevertheless we have responded aggressively by reducing our costs and in  we achieved record operating margin in the third quarter we generated record fullyear cash flow and we were largely able to maintain gaap earnings even including ev acquisitionrelated charges we are a much leaner company today for the first time in years there is no obvious storm on the horizon for teledyne or our largest end market in addition im personally also very excited about the pending acquisition of ev from industrial machine vision to spacebased imaging microwave devices spanning radar to radiography  radiotherapy and specialty semiconductors to microelectromechanical system our combined market capabilities and engineering centric cultures are truly a great hit our smaller acquisitions in  were also significant we enhanced our software capabilities and our participation in life sciences markets we also added key product lines to some of our best performing businesses finally we divested a lower margin bill to print business we inherited in our spinoff  years ago looking forward and excluding ev we currently expect modest overall revenue growth in  we believe most of our commercial businesses will grow sales of marine instrumentation comparison will be relatively stable and our government businesses will see a recovery as we deliver on our improved backlog i will now turn the call over to sue sue main thank you robert and good morning everyone i will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by robert and then i will discuss our first quarter and fullyear  outlook in the fourth quarter cash flow from operating activities was  million compared with cash flow of  million for the same period of  the higher cash provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter of  primarily reflected lower income tax payments partially offset by higher working capital including a facility purchase with the use of restricted cash pursuant to a  likekind exchange free cash flow that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures was  million in the fourth quarter of  compared with  million in  capital expenditures excluding the facility purchase was  million in the fourth quarter compared to  million for the same period of  depreciation and amortization expense was  million in the fourth quarter compared to  million for the same period of  we ended the quarter with  million of net debt that is  million of debt and capital leases less cash of  million for a net debt to capital ratio of  regarding taxes while the fourth quarter of  contained discrete tax benefits of  million or  per share the fourth quarter of  also contained discrete tax benefits as well as the retroactive adoption of fullyear  rd tax credits which collectively contributed  million or  per share last year turning to pension and stock compensation expense in the fourth quarter of  pension income was  million compared with pension expense of  million and for reference our pension which is primarily for legacy retirees remains fully funded stock option compensation expense was  million in the fourth quarter of  compared with  million in the fourth quarter of  finally turning to our outlook management currently believes that gaap earnings per share from continuing operations in the first quarter of  will be in the range of  to  per share and for the fullyear  our earnings per share outlook is  to  the  fullyear effective tax rate excluding any discrete items is expected to be  please note that our current outlook excludes ev and corresponding transactional related expenses i will now pass the call back to robert robert mehrabian thank you sue we would now like to take your questions alan if youre ready to proceed with the questionsandanswers please go ahead questionandanswer session operator absolutely operator instructions we will go first to the line of greg konrad with jefferies go ahead greg konrad good morning you had in digital imaging you had mentioned that backlog was up and you expected better volumes for dod going into  can you maybe discuss what drove that backlog increase and maybe the cadence of some of that backlog turning to revenues robert mehrabian good morning greg thank you there are really two areas the first one is as you may recall we make laser spectacles for laser eye protection and we have a fairly large program with the air force on that which we announced last year the second one the second area which is of great interest to us is in the national space or what we refer to as classified programs historically we have not participated very strongly in that domain and we have made some really very good strides in introducing new infrared sensors and detectors in that  in those businesses so those two are the primary drivers we also have of course significant other programs but in terms of new increases those would be the ones greg konrad thank you and then just in oil and gas the comps obviously are better in  what are you seeing in terms of order activity and is it too early to call the bottom and may be modest growth or flat going from here robert mehrabian i think right now if you listen to everyone people think that at least in the oil and gas domain we probably have been or close to have or have hit bottom and for example the number of subsidiaries that are used in exploration and production especially production they were at the lowest level in  and are expected to grow somewhat in  our overall booktobill in the marine business was about  for the year so we still think there might be a little difficulty in the comps but nothing like we experienced this past year because  partially because what has happened to our marine businesses is oil and gas back in  used to be  of those businesses and science construction defense security and other businesses that we have underwater were  with the serious declines that weve seen in the last two years that has flipped over so oil and gas is more like  and the remainder of our marine businesses are  and as i mentioned in my earlier comments our defense businesses in the marine domain are improving and we have really longterm contract so i think the comparisons are going to be easier obviously we might see a little downside but everybody is predicting a pickup in late  greg konrad thank you and then just quick housekeeping sorry if i missed this but what is your assumption for pension income in  versus  and then also do you have any restructuring included in the  numbers robert mehrabian i think in the pension we anticipate that discount rate will go down but we know its going to go down so much so overall i would say the  or  basis points will drive our pension income down by about a nickel on the second part of the question i dont  we dont have any restructuring charges greg as you know in our history weve always have been a gaap company gaap everything has been gaap weve always kind of swallowed our onetime charges restructuring charges and also acquisition charges the only thing i anticipate in  is significant from our perspective significant charges related to acquisition of ev and that could be significant for us it could be as much as  million which we probably cannot totally absorb as we have with our previous indiscernible acquisitions operator well go next to line of jim ricchiuti with needham and company please go ahead jim ricchiuti hi good morning couple of questions robert id be interested in your perspective on ev acquisition what is it that really excites you about the business and given that there is a similar portfolio of businesses of ev how should we think about the speed with which this business can be integrated robert mehrabian let me start by saying that while the businesses are similar theyre very complimentary for example jim in the sensor domain our focus historically has been and our strength have been in infrared sensors for example we practically or the major player in infrared sensors both sensors both for space imaging as well as drawn based astronomy ev is exactly the mirror image of us expect they are in the visible imaging domain actually the seven or eight programs that currently aware of that we acted in we provide the infrared images sensors detectors and they provide the visible detectors the same is true in a number of other businesses including machine vision were strong in certain areas of machine vision especially in ccds and some cmos but theyre much stronger in complementary metal oxide semiconductors and more importantly they are very strong in two dimensional imaging which is larger market for machine vision and then finally in the medical arena our strength are in detectors we need to reduce cmos detectors that are the most sensitive detectors that reduce the amount of xray exposure to the patient and are much more sensitive in terms of the quality of the pictures that you get they on the other hand are the leading providers of magnetrons which are essentially electronic accelerators or microwave accelerators by traveling wave tubes except they impinge on a constant substrate and produce xrays that are used for cancer treatment so in that area we have probably a lot of common customers when you do radiography you also want to do complementary imaging to make sure that you are not damaging surrounding pieces so those are some observations about the complementary nature of our businesses in terms of integration i feel very comfortable about that for the following reasons first theyre a public company so they have a very well documented financial and other processes and second we have already acquired two fairly large companies lecroy and dalsa in the last five years and weve been able to integrate those very successfully relatively quickly and the margins in both of those large acquisitions have more than doubled in the interim period so i think we would integrate this acquisition assuming were successful we have some more hurdles to pass in terms of regulatory hurdles i think we will integrate this successfully in  jim ricchiuti thanks thats helpful and just with respect to the existing business robert can you give us a perhaps feel for how we might think about the growth across the four business units i think youve given us some color as to how we should think about marine instrumentation but digital imaging and showed decent growth in q im not sure what was organic in that and you also saw good growth in the electronic test and measurement business but again i dont know how much of that was organic can you give us feel as to how we might think about growth broadly in across some of the business units robert mehrabian of course let me actually just go down the list for you if i may organically overall in the instrument businesses which would include environmental test and measurement and marine i would say in  organically the growth would be about  in digital imaging it should be higher perhaps as much as  to  in aerospace and defense it could be closer to instruments  to  and we have a really good backlog in our engineered systems and i expect that in there  in that domain our upside can be closer to five when you roll all of that i think the overall organically we should have  to  we do have some acquisitions from  that we should enjoy a little the fullyear benefits of those those may add another percent so when you do the math jim i think were talking about  to  all in thats excluding ev jim ricchiuti okay and thats really helpful so the optimism that you have entering  has really based it sounds like on both what you are seeing in both the commercial and government business i think thats kind of what youve been saying as well so it sounds like on the commercial side perhaps a little bit more positive but you are seeing i guess fairly good order intake in the engineered systems business robert mehrabian yes we do we have a good backlog there we have stronger expect strong we know exactly how many missile engines were going to be making in  its going to be one of our better years in recent history we have good backlog in our shallow water and underwater vehicles for our special operations and we feel good and this is as good as weve felt about our overall business portfolio in a very very long time operator we will go now to the line of george godfrey with clk go ahead please george godfrey thank you i just want to followup on the organic growth and thank you robert for the commentary outlook on how it looks for  can you just run through over the fullyear  organic growth figures by those four product lines robert mehrabian i think mainly in  if i had to  let me start with marine because that was obviously the big negative for us right we were down almost  from  to  for a hefty  million if you look at our overall decline yearoveryear in revenue it was actually less than that so marine declined significantly everything else together actually grew a little bit maybe  million  million our environmental businesses were relatively flat we had ups and downs as id say overall it was a wash our test and measurement was up about   digital imaging im talking organic only digital imaging was up about  if you throw in our acquisitions and it was higher than that our engineered systems was down about    but im not concerned about that only as i mentioned because we had really strong  weve had really strong orders its just i know everybody talked about timing but in this case i can assure you it was timing so aerospace and defense electronics was a really strong performer it was up about  with our avionics business up about almost  which this is the business that provides data acquisition on commercial aircraft and thats been a very strong performer almost made up for the decline that we had in terms of earnings in our marine businesses i hope thats helpful george godfrey yes thats great robert thank you very much for that detail and then the last question just looking at the free cash flow conversion this year based on net income was   last year so what do you target for free cash flow conversion in  as it relates to net income sue main about even about same as this year little  about little less from a percentage point of view operator operator instructions we will go next to line of ben klieve with noble capital markets go ahead ben klieve all right thanks for taking my questions just got a couple followup questions first of all regarding your commentary earlier on the energy sector im curious when you think that business may shift from stabilization to growth is that going to require in your estimate further increases in oil prices or do you think just for long stability in the energy market could facilitate growth as you look right into  or  and beyond robert mehrabian ben if im correct if im going to go to oil and gas specifically i think whats happened is the declines have been very significant and the prognosis right now is that everything is stabilizing with oil price prices hovering in the plusdollar range close to  on west texas intermediate what that does is it helps really the first  days fracking businesses which have breakeven prices of about  a barrel and were seeing already recurrence go up we do have some land based products there so were enjoying some of that when you go to the ocean then the breakeven prices there shallow water is closer to  bucks a barrel deepwater which is between  to  feet is about plusdollars per barrel or actually maybe   per barrel its the very deepwater interestingly its better its closer to  because the reservoirs are larger and the breakeven is lower than deepwater so having said all of that a lot of our products going to deepwater and ultra deepwater which would be over  feet and we think that source capex will probably not improve until later in  or  were seeing some pick up but nothing like we had in prior years and so i think you summed it up correctly the future we think is going to be for us in deepwater and ultra deepwater the only other thing i will add is that we dont supply directly to the final customers like shell or bp we supply to intermediate customers that provide for example trees on the water christmas trees for oil production et cetera and we have frame agreements now develop with those customers to be able enjoy  to  of their businesses going forward those frame agreements are of course are based on the fact that we have unique capabilities in products so i think when it does come back were going to be really good posture i hope that answers your questions there ben klieve yes very much thank you for commentary one other quick question i know regarding the ev acquisition given the regulatory issue that you cant really comment too much but you said that integration would hopefully occur in  im wondering if you think its regarding the timing of that i mean are you expecting that in the near to near term or do you think that could be more second half event can you give any kind of context regarding timing robert mehrabian i think right now we expect to close in the first half of the year but im hopeful that we would be able to do it in the first quarter the regulatory hurdles are really theyve already had the general shareholder meeting that both have be successfully achieved we do have summit botox cut indiscernible in this country they have some german french and uk authorities that have to clear it and then finally of course we have to have a court hearing in the uk im very hopeful that we can  we will be able to close this by the end of the first quarter but we certainly expect if everything goes right that we would be able to do this by in the first six months we dont really know what the outcomes of this various questions that were getting are going to be ben klieve perfect thank you very much for the time ill jump back in queue operator thank you operator instructions robert mehrabian alan thank you i think we exhausted that if its okay then what i would like to do is turn the call over jason

three elements account differently for our liking for the person who puts forward a message concerning their feelings words account for  tone of voice accounts for  and body language accounts for  of the liking for effective and meaningful communication about emotions these three parts of the message need to support each other  they have to be congruent in case of any incongruence the receiver of the message might be irritated by two messages coming from two different channels giving cues in two different directions the following example should help illustrate incongruence in verbal and nonverbal communication verbal i do not have a problem with you nonverbal person avoids eyecontact looks anxious has a closed body language etc it becomes more likely that the receiver will trust the predominant form of communication which to mehrabians findings is the nonverbal impact of tonegestures    rather than the literal meaning of the words  this is known as the  rule it is important to say that in the respective study mehrabian conducted experiments dealing with communications of feelings and attitudes ie likedislike and that the above disproportionate influence of tone of voice and body language becomes effective only when the situation is ambiguous such ambiguity appears mostly when the words spoken are inconsistent with the tone of voice or body language of the speaker sender misinterpretationedit this  rule has been widely misinterpreted it is often claimed that in any communication the meaning of a message is conveyed mainly by nonverbal cues not by the meaning of words this generalization from the initially very specific conditions in his experiments is the common mistake made in relation to mehrabians rule on his website mehrabian clearly states total liking   verbal liking   vocal liking   facial liking please note that this and other equations regarding relative importance of verbal and nonverbal messages were derived from experiments dealing with communications of feelings and attitudes ie like–dislike unless a communicator is talking about their feelings or attitudes these equations are not applicable also see references  and  in silent messages – these are the original sources of my findings criticismedit the  rule is based on two studies reported in the  papers decoding of inconsistent communications and inference of attitudes from nonverbal communication in two channels both dealt with the communication of positive or negative emotions via single spoken words like dear or terrible the first study compared the relative importance of the semantic meaning of the word with the tone of voice and found that the latter was much more influential the second study dealt with facial expressions shown in blackandwhite photographs and vocal tone as heard in a tape recording and found that the relative contributions of the two communication channels had the ratio  mehrabian then combined the results of the two studies to obtain the ratio  there are several limitations of the studys applicability to real life which are largely ignored when the study is now cited outside a scientific context and contribute to the misinterpretation above first it is based on the judgment of the meaning of single tape of recorded words ie a very artificial context second the figures are obtained by combining results from two different studies which are inappropriately combined third it relates only to the communication of positive versus negative emotions fourth it relates only to women as men did not participate in the study fifth other types of nonverbal communication eg body posture were not included in the studies since then other studies have analyzed the relative contributions of verbal and nonverbal signals under more naturalistic situations one in  using video tapes shown to the subjects analyzed the communication of submissivedominant attitude and found that all types of nonverbal cues combined – especially body posture – had  times the effect of verbal cues on the other hand another in  dealing with the communication of happysad mood found that hearing words spoken in a flat voice was about  times more influential than facial expressions seen in a film with no sound thus different studies may reach very different conclusions dependent on methodology see alsoedit pad emotional state model

misinterpretationedit this  rule has been widely misinterpreted it is often claimed that in any communication the meaning of a message is conveyed mainly by nonverbal cues not by the meaning of words

nonverbal communication in two channels both dealt with the communication of positive or negative emotions via single spoken words like dear or terrible the first study compared the relative importance of the semantic meaning of the word with the tone of voice and found that the latter was much more influential the second study dealt with facial expressions shown in blackandwhite photographs and vocal tone as heard in a tape recording and found that the relative contributions of the two communication channels had the ratio  mehrabian then combined the results of the two studies to obtain the ratio  there are several limitations of the studys applicability to real life which are largely ignored when the study is now cited outside a scientific context and contribute to the misinterpretation above first it is based on the judgment of the meaning of single tape of recorded words ie a very artificial context second the figures are obtained by combining results from two different studies which are inappropriately combined third it relates only to the communication of positive versus negative emotions fourth it relates only to women as men did not participate in the study fifth other types of nonverbal communication eg body posture were not included in the studies since then other studies have analyzed the relative contributions of verbal and nonverbal signals under more naturalistic situations one in  using video tapes shown to the subjects analyzed the communication of submissivedominant attitude and found that all types of nonverbal cues combined –

or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump
