unaudited for the six months ended december         market conditions for municipal governments in general the economic picture began to brighten in  but the recovery has been progressing at a slow pace fiscal strains have softened and many state and local governments have been able to achieve budgetary balance through a combination of cost cutting and revenue enhancement measures municipal credit quality has continued to improve as most states and many local governments have recovered slowly from the recession in particular state general funds have shown consecutive quarters of growth in personal income tax and sales tax revenue both important sources of revenue preliminary data from the rockefeller institute indicate that while state tax revenue growth slowed in the third quarter of  yearoveryear growth was  percent and personal income tax revenue growth was  percent yearoveryear in most states the overall trend in tax collections for fiscal year  is expected to be positive

performance of the stock market provide the biggest share of revenue voters in  raised income tax rates to  percent on those making  million or more the most of any state and boosted sales levies many of californias cities counties and school districts have reached the bottom of the credit cycle and are on the path to recovery although this outlook is largely driven by the continued improvement at the state level there are a variety of local economic and budgetary factors that are also contributing to this view abate california may see its credit rating raised if governor jerry brown persists in paying down debt and revenue continues to outpace spending according to standard  poors sp in early  sp had raised the most indebted us states rating to a its sixthhighest level in january saying policy makers had made strides toward improving californias fiscal health continued improvement in the states credit could add to the stability of local credits especially counties and school districts that rely heavily on state transfers to fund their operations            performance analysis as of december   active assets california taxfree trust had net assets of approximately  billion
