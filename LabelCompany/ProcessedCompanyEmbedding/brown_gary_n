newly colored hair photo by katie jacewicz what we call white silver or gray hair color is actually hair that no longer has pigment when covering or coloring gray hair consider these options and advice from angies list members and highly rated hair stylists semipermanent hair dye options“for locks that are about  to  percent gray use a demi or semipermanent hair color thats closest to your natural tone to blend away the grays with minimal damage” recommends bab may owner of bab  company hairdesigners of carmel indiana “both types deposit color into your hair without ammonia however the demipermanent color uses a stronger concentration of hydrogen peroxide to open up the hair cuticle and inject more color as a result demipermanent color lasts almost twice as long as semipermanent semipermanent color delivers a rich shiny color but fades out in six to  shampoos” nonpermanent products can be a good way to get started with dying gray hair agrees ceilon aspensen owner and manager of salon simpatico in bozeman montana “semipermanent color will not completely color gray but can stain it enough to change your hair color or make it look like a highlight against the darker color” she says “after the color has disappeared at the end of six to eight weeks the client will have a better idea of the possibilities available to them in professional hair color” hair stylist deborah foster mixes the color treatment shell use to cover a clients gray hair photo by katie jacewicz permanent hair dye“there are some clients whose gray is covered very well by demipermanent color but it gets to the point where they get more gray and it doesn’t cover” may says “most permanent colors contain ammonia which opens the hair cuticle to allow color to penetrate much deeper than without it” angie’s list member carol libutti of lake worth florida began coloring her gray by having her stylist apply semipermanent dye but eventually switched “i’ve been happier with permanent hair color because i spend a lot of time outside and permanent color doesnt fade as much” she says an online poll of angie’s list members who color their gray hair found that  percent use permanent color while  percent use nonpermanent highlights and lowlights“if hair is long enough you can try a light highlight a small concentration of highlights around the problem area” may says “usually gray is noticed most around the area of the part you can add a few highlights along the part to break up the gray” highlights or lowlights can also keep hair from being monochromatic causing it to appear fuller may says “by choosing colors that flatter your natural hair color the end result is that your hair will appear to have more dimension it will create the illusion of lift and movement” libutti disliked allover color when she first began to have her gray colored “i thought i looked older” she says “my new stylist recommended using highlights i was very happy with the results and got a lot of compliments” when it’s time to reassess your hair dye colorangie’s list member kira stark of colusa california says the emergence of significant amounts of gray is a good time to review past coloring habits “be honest with yourself do you need to be a blonde in your mids or would a more subtle color closer to your natural color better suit ask your stylist to be honest too ‘is this a good color and look for me’ ‘what would you recommend’” related angies list guide to salons and barbers be aware of how color treatment can affect hair any time you apply a chemical to the hair there will be some damage” may says “but if your colorist uses hair color properly there should be minimal damage to the hair” how much does it cost to dye your hairyoull spend more than money when you dye your hair the process of having haircolor mixed applied heattreated and shampooed can add an hour or more to a cutandstyle appointment and because hair grows a halfinch a month recolorings or touchups are required as soon as four weeks “if you get permanent color you’re going to have regrowth in four to six weeks that will distract you and youll want to get it touched up” aspensen says “if you have semipermanent color your color will mostly shampoo out in about six to eight weeks and you wont have a regrowth line demipermanent color will also shampoo out — mostly but not as much as semipermanent color — in about six to eight weeks but you will have a faint and indistinct regrowth line” editors note this is an updated version of an article originally posted on march   related articles to dye

hire a stylist have you tried to color your gray hair share your experience in the comments section below june  by ellen millerellen miller is a former staff writer and editor for angies list leave a comment   comments grace  year ago subject silver grey natural hair would like to highlight or streaks not dark just to give it a different look what would you recommend victoria melton  year ago subject reply to add highlights or not to add highlights hello i have had many clients throughout the years that i have added a weaving of lowlights of their natural color into their silver or grey colored hairthis technique is used when a client does not want to go from having their natural color  which is grey to completely covered with say a medium or dark brown or any one process color this is shocking and not subtle at all when you choose to use the lowlight technique i think you will get the most natural looking color you do not get a strong root line as you would with other color processes if you cover all of the grey you will have a root line of a quarter inch that needs to be covered again with in  weeks some woman can get by with  weeks between their haircolor appointments but with this lowlight technique a client can go at least  to  months in between color appointments which is another very big plus when considering this process my name is victoria melton i have a small salon called victorias salon south park in charlotte i have been a licensed and working cosmetologist for  years and i would love to speak to you further about your hair and answer any other questions or concerns you may have  my salon is listed here on angies list and i offer a  off your choice of service when you come to the salon from angies list or come for the complimentary consultation i offer  give me a call  thank youi look forward to meeting you lisa poray  year ago subject gray roots with highlights of blonde and brown hi my girlfriend lisa has grey roots and then the keeps highlighting the roots and the rest of her hair her hair coloring last  weeks because her hair grows really fast what should she do he natural color is brown light brown  victoria melton  year ago subject what to do for girlfriends highlighted roots every  weeks hello my name is victoria melton i have a salon called victorias salon south park in charlotte i have been a licensed and working cosmetologist for  years i love helping people with their hair i have been in the business for so long i have so much information that i have learned and picked up over the years and i love to share all of it with my clients many woman get caught up into this terrible revolving door that is root color many dont know how to get out of it either so i am glad that you have asked i hope i can help by shedding some light on the subject i know even i f your girlfriend has thought to herself how do i get out of this she is wondering how in the world will she ask her stylist why she got her hooked with this haircolor and what can she do seems scary to clients i think so let me try to explain so when a woman has her very first highlights ever put into her hair  it is the most beautiful color she has ever seen and it is beautiful so if the hairdresser is good she will only put the highlight into her clients hair in a subtle looking way that is a good hairdresser most times i want a first time highlight to look like she has been at the beach al summer when it is done in this way  you will not get a huge dark line of new hair growing in our hair grows one quarter inch a month ok so then the clients is told she should come back in at  weeks for her haircut and they ask do you want to touch up highlights then too sure why not i must need to thinks client this is where it goes wrong a true touchup for a highlighting is only supposed to be the new quarter inch of new grown hair and a client in this position should not need that quarter inch colored again because remember when i said it should look natural well if she had gotten that blond over the summer at the beach she wouldnt need to color after  weeks it would just grow in a bit more like  to  weeks before anyone would notice the darkness at the top so when a client comes in too early it is very hard for the stylist to only put the color on that tiny section of hair that is newly grown in that is what a highlight is  but these hairdressers of today are sloppy and badly trained because they take the color and not only color the new hair but they over lap to the existing colored hair now she has over processed the hair and by over lapping she has put color over the weaved out hair that wasnt colored last month that is supposed to stay without color on it or you would end up with all hair colorednot a highlight you are supposed to weave like every other hair and leave her natural color as the other hair so after this happens for about  or  times forget about happens for  or  years the client is left with hair that has none of her natural color left in it except where the new stuff grows in bad highlightingthat is why that new  inch of new hair looks so bad and so dark to girls because all of the rest of the hair is colored now then they sell you on you need to add lowlights for  more bucks well if it was done correctly this would not be the case i hope i explained it in a way you can understand  i think i would really like to meet your girlfriend and to see what is going on with her haircolor i offer a complimentary consultation and would love to show you all what i mean in person you can reach me at  you can text a day and time you guys or just her are available to come to this number and i will get right back to you i would really like to help her with this
