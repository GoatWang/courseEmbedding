moneymakersclosing in sugar land reduces imperial debt bill hensel jr copyright 0 houston chronicle published  am friday january  0 robert peiser came to houston less than three years ago as president chief executive officer and a director of imperial sugar in sugar land the company has about 0 employees in the houston area and roughly 0 nationwide before imperial peiser served as chairman and chief executive of floridabased vitality beverages a  million privately owned beverage company he also held management positions at cv services international western pacific airlines foxmeyer drug co and trans world airlines peiser spoke with chronicle reporter bill hensel jr about changes that have been made at the company story continues below   latest news video q you were brought in as a turnaround guy at imperial sugar back in  what has transpired at the company since that time a the company has come a long way from when this management team first came in at that time the company had quite a bit of debt on its balance sheet and was struggling with earnings but since then we have been able to reduce debt significantly and improve earnings at least through the end of the last fiscal year q how has the company been able to do that a i think if you look at the margins of the company we have taken a lot of costs out by rationalizing some of the capacity it is pretty well known we closed the refinery in sugar land which was very difficult and emotional but it was inefficient that allows us to reduce the cost of our operation and improve our margins we have focused quite a bit on brands in an effort to improve that part of the business we have become much more innovative in the packaging and have established processes in the company and cultures in the company that are much more conducive to a wellmanaged operation q in addition to the food and beverage industry you have spent quite a bit of time in the airline industry what is your take about what is occurring with the airlines and how it relates to other businesses a there obviously are wrenching changes occurring in the industry as lowercost competitors work to gain greater footholds and the industry finds it impossible to pass on costs it cant control namely energy costs the leaders in those companies have a very difficult time in trying to maintain a morale that is extremely important in a service industry and at the same time reduce the cost of that labor component q you mentioned energy as it relates to airlines but imperial in its last earnings report also cited energy as a high cost how so a energy is a big component of ours and like the airline business we have difficulty passing that on our prices for refined sugar to our customers are more based on our cost of raw sugar than any component and you have to eat all the increases in energy costs we made the statement a month ago that if energy costs stayed at the level they were energy costs would be about  million higher in 0 than in  that is something that is difficult to deal with over time but you have to strive to with increased efficiencies and new product innovations but it is going to make 0 a challenging year q what other challenges do you expect to face this year a the margins are very dependent on the size of the beet sugar crop and the beet crop has been relatively high so the margins have been low we have been able to overcome that because of improvements made on the cost side of the company and expanding new product initiatives but industry conditions remain difficult which is one of the reasons we are moving away from the pure commodity side of the business and are emphasizing our brands and new packaging developments we have talked a lot about our new packaging but much of the improvement hasnt been seen on the bottom line yet because it is new and you dont necessarily make money in the first few months of a new product billhenselchroncom latest from the chroncom homepage click below
