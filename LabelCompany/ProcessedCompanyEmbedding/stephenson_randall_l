executive officer att inc editor’s note randall stephenson assumed his current post in  he began his career with southwestern bell telephone in  from  to  he was the company’s chief financial officer and from  to  he served as the company’s chief operating officer he was appointed to att’s board of directors in  stephenson is a member of the board of directors of emerson electric co a member of the pga tour policy board and a national executive board member of the boy scouts of america stephenson received his bs in accounting from the university of central oklahoma and his master of accountancy from the university of oklahoma company brief att wwwattcom is one of the world’s largest telecom companies with  billion in  revenues it continues to spearhead the mobile internet revolution driving innovation and investing more capital into the us economy over the past several years than any other public company att customers enjoy the nation’s fastest and most reliable g lte network by bringing together fast mobile networks and cloudbased services att is helping customers mobilize everything from business solutions to cars to education in addition to providing sophisticated communications services for businesses of every size att offers highspeed broadband connectivity and advanced tv services to millions of consumers and businesses across the united states what factors have contributed to the enduring success of att you must have the right leadership talent at the top that is committed to constant innovation constant reinvigoration of the business and constant and persistent investment through good and bad times in fact the investments we’ve made through the down cycles have always been when we have taken competitive leaps forward is it more challenging to maintain a culture of innovation as you get to a certain size and scale size is a detractor from innovation but so is the nature of our revenues we’re a service company and we tend to have large recurring revenue streams so in our industry innovation oftentimes means replacement and substitution of existing revenue streams if you don’t have a culture that drives relentlessly on innovation here’s what happens you hold onto embedded recurring revenue streams and legacy products and never move to the next place then someone else will come and take the market from you these are the inherent gravitational pulls away from innovation you need a mindset that says we will innovate and not be afraid of cannibalizing our own revenue streams in order to bring customers the latest technology it can be painful in the short run but it’s critical to do the classic example is wireless the more you invest in wireless voice and data quality the more you put at risk your fixedline voice and data revenue streams but you need to recognize where the market is going commit to it and make the necessary investments – and then deal with the cannibalization because that is what your customers want do today’s job candidates understand how att has evolved and the type of career this organization can offer we’ve done well in attracting good high quality technical talent over the years a lot of this talent has come through acquisitions but we’ve also done a good job bringing in talent at the grassroots level and growing it we have also been very aggressive and successful at bringing in talent at a senior level convincing people of the dynamism excitement and innovation in this industry is not difficult how critical is it that your workforce mirrors the diversity of your clientele a lot of people call diversity a sustainability effort and something we have to do i maintain that if you don’t commit to diversity you cannot succeed so we are disciplined and focused to ensure that our leadership team reflects our markets if you don’t grow up and live and breathe in different cultures it’s much more difficult to know how to serve them in the marketplace will future growth be throughout the organization or driven by specific parts of your operations it’s across our business in our industry it seems that every time somebody predicts the death of a particular set of services that area reinvigorates itself for instance consumer home solutions is a fixedline business for us that hadn’t seen growth in four or five years but in just a few years’ time we have built att uverse tv and highspeed internet into a business with nearly  billion in annualized revenues now we’re making further investments through an initiative we call project vip which will provide significant bandwidth to millions of homes bandwidth to the home is going to be a major driver in this industry for a long time the other area that will drive all parts of the market over the next five or six years is the convergence of highspeed mobile networks – think g lte – with cloud technology in fact this convergence is playing out right now as we begin to combine these technologies new services and opportunities are appearing all over the place the connected car can only become a reality when you combine fourthgeneration highspeed mobile networks and the cloud we’re changing the homesecurity monitoring industry – which hasn’t changed in  or  years – by virtue of this same dynamic businesses and industries across the board over the next five years are going to be reinvented one of the most exciting places you will see this is in education which includes our recent announcement involving georgia tech att and udacity education is an industry that has largely escaped the productivity revolution over the past  years costs have gone up and quality has gone sideways next year together with georgia tech and udacity we are introducing a fully accredited online master of science degree in computer science at a fraction of the cost of a traditional oncampus program this is radical only the technological innovation of highspeed connectivity and the cloud can make this happen how tough is it to get the message across about what makes a company unique in this space you have to invest in branding your capabilities and your business branding is critical in fact we spend more on advertising and brand positioning than maybe any other industry it starts though with having a differentiated experience we believe – and time has proven this – that a highquality network experience will always be a differentiator in this industry it sounds easy but it’s not so we have invested aggressively in wireless spectrum which is the critical resource in our business you cannot have a quality experience that is differentiated without the spectrum and technological innovation that rides on top of it – this is how you get to the future firstwe believe that what we’re about is human progressonce you achieve that positioning yourself in the marketplace – through aggressive branding – does produce significant returns in the us we have differentiated ourselves in virtually every segment of the market – consumer as well as highend business and small business att is associated with the phrase “rethink possible” what does this messaging convey you have to ask what is your enduring proposition what do you do that goes beyond making a buck we believe that what we’re about is human progress to the extent that we invest and bring new capabilities to market it results in human progress at its most core level it’s about increasing productivity and broadly improving prosperity through fixed and mobile broadband the way we facilitate innovation and productivity is by opening up our capabilities to innovators and challenging them to rethink how we change customers’ lives a lot of people were apprehensive about our doing a deal with apple for the iphone it looked like a wonderful opportunity to us – it caused us to rethink our business model and allowed us to rethink possible it also allowed apple to do the same so they opened their platform to application developers to the extent that you invest and open your capabilities you have created a new opportunity for layered innovation what is the value of corporate responsibility for att is it important that the areas you support align with the business i have always believed that when we reach out to our communities we need to do it in places that make sense not just for the communities but for the business this is why we have made education a huge focus with our philanthropic dollars as well as why we ask our people to volunteer their time – particularly focusing on the high school dropout epidemic it’s important to us because we hired  people last year alone and the type of people we hire need to have technical skills we don’t necessarily need a lot of phds in engineering but we do need people who can do technical support work for customers including installation of technical services for largescale businesses so when we have high dropout rates it’s not only detrimental to society it also impacts our business we obviously need a good welleducated workforce so we made this commitment you don’t have to sell a lot of people on investing in education when it serves the needs of the business as well as the community how tough is it to keep up with the advances in technology and how far out do you need to be looking we are making network design decisions today in light of a world that we believe will be very different five years from now five years out we believe the lion’s share of the traffic on our network will be driven by video specific services that will drive video consumption will include some that we bring to market but the lion’s share will come from letting innovators create on top of our network infrastructure we believe the best way to participate in innovation cycles is to open up our networks and turn the innovators loose although we have an industry that has traditionally been averse to that att used to sell the telephone that was hardwired into the wall and that was the service you got then we opened up these networks and began to see innovation evolve and develop we are strong believers in this model – you build aggressively and invest aggressively in core capabilities and let the innovators create on top of it has there been an understanding from your people of the need to continually evolve how important is it to reinforce the need for change when you have a company with such a successful history when i assumed this role ed whitacre former chairman and ceo had already assembled some great assets – in business services and wireless plus the traditional local exchange businesses six years ago when he handed me this business we determined that we had to become a wireless company we weren’t that at the time though we had wireless assets most of the people in our company had grown up in the fixedline or wireline side of the business but we realized that we were going to have to make a hard pivot to accomplish this we said there would have to be cultural change and that would require resetting the mindset of everyone in this business one of the first things i did was go to my hr guy and say we’re going to create att university a place where we’ll bring the leadership of this company in and make them invest considerable time in where we want to go as a company – where the industry is headed and what our role will be in it – all building from this idea of being wireless driven at that time we were launching an iphone and it helped drive this concept home within a short period of time we got our employee team fully in sync we also had to get our owners aligned because they weren’t completely sold at first mobility soon became the focus of the business capital allocation our approach to the marketplace and how we branded the company – everything was wireless driven today we are regarded largely as a mobility company it wasn’t easy and it required a lot of painstaking diligence and investing in culture but the payoff has been worth it are you concerned about the competitiveness of us companies globally and are we still an innovation leader when you consider the key global drivers over the past six years i would say there have been two great innovations that have changed the complexion of business and economies around the world energy and the mobile internet look at what has happened with hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling it’s driving a revolution around the globe in terms of energy extraction and availability and even bringing the united states closer to energy independencetoday we are regarded largely as a mobility companythe other place that has been just as revolutionary is the mobile internet and all of the ecosystems surrounding it and what that’s doing to productivity in every area from health care to retail there is not an industry that hasn’t already been affected or that will not be even more radically affected over the next five years by virtue of the mobile internet the mobile internet and the total ecosystem surrounding it – including the applications community and the new services community in silicon valley – have come into existence over just the past five or six years and they’ve all largely been driven by the united states so yes we are doing a terrific job in this area• click here to download a pdf of an

stephenson left speaks with david m rubsenstein the president of the economic club of washington stephenson spoke at the mandarin oriental hotel in southwest washington on tuesday the economic club of washington dcsam kittner by steven overly by steven overly june   follow stevenoverly washington you’re bringing randall l stephenson down the chairman and chief executive of att told the economic club of washington tuesday that the biggest disadvantage to his role atop the nation’s secondlargest telecommunications company is that the company’s investment strategy and growth depends so heavily on lawmakers and regulators here but stephenson isn’t still smarting from the bungled  billion acquisition of tmobile that federal regulators blocked in  out of concern the deal would eliminate a major wireless provider and drive up costs for consumers instead stephenson told the audience of business executives that congress’s unwillingness to enact corporate tax reform is inhibiting the expansion of the us economy and dissuading businesses from investing money in growth that’s particularly true after a series of tax benefits for corporations expired on jan  only after changes are made stephenson added will jobs be created at a suitable rate and revenue be generated to sustain health care and entitlement programs “investment has slowed across corporate america and it’s illogical to think it happened for any reason other than these tax benefits going away congress should extend these provisions as a bridge to tax reform” said stephenson who became chairman of the business roundtable in january but washington gridlock due to deep political divisions makes it unlikely congress will pass tax reform legislation this session stephenson lamented despite what he sees as a bipartisan understanding that changes need to be made “the ability to work on core issues where there is general agreement is the part that frustrates me” stephenson said on tax reform “there is just general agreement on the big issues what needs to be done get rid of the preferences and the special deductions and the loopholes  and invest in getting the tax rate to a competitive level so we stop seeing companies move off shore” “and it comes to ‘start passing legislation’ and you can’t get past square one” immigration reform on the other hand stands a narrow chance of clearing the house and senate stephenson said urging president obama to make a concerted push over the next two months for comprehensive legislation “it’s a firstrate crisis that needs to be dealt with and to keep punting this and pushing this off it feels irresponsible” he said immigration reform has become increasingly important to the business community particularly technology companies because they would like to hire foreignborn students earning degrees in highdemand areas of science and engineering stephenson spoke at the mandarin oriental hotel in southwest washington the lunchtime engagement drew a full ballroom of attendees to hear both stephenson’s remarks and his interview with economic club of washington president david m rubenstein the hourlong talk did circle back to washington’s regulatory climate canada’s is better stephenson said as att finds itself asking once again for approval of a bigticket purchase this time the company’s proposed merger with television provider directv stephenson told the audience that consumers are streaming more video on their portable devices than ever before  thus buying a tv provider with  million us subscribers will give att access to extensive video content — not to mention the ability to bundle wireless and tv services à la verizon “the shift has happened and mobile internet and mobile data isn’t what’s going to drive this industry and your industries it’s mobile video” he told the audience “well over half of the traffic that flows over our networks is coming from video as you think about a business that is going to be video centric and video focused you want to have scale on the video programming side to be able to take advantage of this” ultimately stephenson told the crowd telecommunications companies cannot afford to miss out on any new wave of innovation or they risk going out of business entirely just take a look at blackberry “this is an industry where if you’re not investing you’re going to die” stephenson said “the obsolescence cycles in this industry are stunning” business capitalbusiness false afterth true please provide a valid email address sign up you’re all set see all newsletters

parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in
