states board of trustees of the leland stanford junior university v  roche molecular systems inc et al certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit no – argued february  —decided june   in  a small california research company called cetus began to develop methods for quantifying bloodborne levels of human immunodeficiency virus hiv the virus that causes aids a nobel prize winning technique developed at cetus known as pcr was an integral part of these efforts           in  cetus began to collaborate with scientists at stanford university’s department of infectious diseases to test the efficacy of new aids drugs dr holodniy joined stanford as a research fellow in the department around that time when he did so he signed an agreement stating that he “agreed to assign” to stanford his “right title and interest in” inventions resulting from his employment there holodniy’s supervisor arranged for him to conduct research at cetus to learn about pcr as a condition of gaining access to cetus holodniy was required to sign an agreement stating that he “will assign and does hereby assign” to cetus his “right title and interest in … the ideas inventions and improvements” made “as a consequence of his access” to cetus working with cetus employees holodniy devised a pcrbased procedure for measuring the amount of hiv in a patient’s blood upon returning to stanford he and other stanford employees tested the procedure stanford secured three patents to the measurement process           roche molecular systems acquired cetus’s pcrrelated assets after conducting clinical trials on the hiv quantification method developed at cetus roche commercialized the procedure today its hiv test kits are used worldwide           the university and small business patent procedures act of  bayhdole act or act allocates rights in federally funded “subject inventions” between the federal government and federal contractors  u s c §§e c a the act defines “subject invention” as “any invention of the contractor conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the performance of work under a funding agreement” §e and provides that contractors may “elect to retain title to any subject invention” §a because some of stanford’s research on the hiv measurement technique was funded by the national institutes of health nih the bayhdole act applied in accordance with the act’s requirements stanford notified nih that it was electing to retain title to the invention and conferred on the government a license to use the patented procedure           petitioner the board of trustees of stanford university filed suit against respondents roche claiming that their hiv test kits infringed stanford’s patents roche responded that holodniy’s agreement with cetus gave it coownership of the procedure and thus stanford lacked standing to sue it for patent infringement stanford countered that holodniy had no rights to assign because the university had superior rights under the bayhdole act the district court agreed with stanford and held that under the bayhdole act holodniy had no rights to assign to cetus the court of appeals for the federal circuit disagreed concluding that holodniy’s agreement with cetus assigned his rights to cetus and thus to roche it also found that the bayhdole act did not automatically void an inventor’s rights in federally funded inventions thus the act did not extinguish roche’s ownership interest in the invention and stanford was deprived of standing held  the bayhdole act does not automatically vest title to federally funded inventions in federal contractors or authorize contractors to unilaterally take title to such inventions pp –      a since  patent law has operated on the premise that rights in an invention belong to the inventor see eg gayler v wilder  how   in most cases a patent may be issued only to an applying inventor or—because an inventor’s interest in his invention is assignable in law by an instrument in writing—an inventor’s assignee see united states v dubilier condenser corp   u s   absent an agreement to the contrary an employer does not have rights in an invention “which is the original conception of the employee alone” id at  an inventor must expressly grant those rights to his employer see id  at  pp –      b stanford and amicus united states contend that when an invention is conceived or first reduced to practice with the support of federal funds the bayhdole act vests title to those inventions in the inventor’s employer—the federal contractor congress has in the past divested inventors of their rights in inventions by providing unambiguously that inventions created pursuant to certain specified federal contracts become the government’s property such unambiguous language is notably absent from the bayhdole act instead the act provides that contractors may “elect to retain title to any subject invention” §a defining a “subject invention” as “any invention of the contractor conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the performance of work under a funding agreement” §e      stanford contends that “invention of the contractor” means all inventions that a contractor’s employees make with the aid of federal funds that reading assumes that congress subtly set aside two centuries of patent law in a statutory definition this court has rejected the idea that mere employment is sufficient to vest title to an employee’s invention in the employer stanford’s reading also renders the phrase “of the contractor” superfluous since the definition already covers inventions made under a funding agreement construing the phrase to refer instead to a particular category of inventions conceived or reduced to practice under a funding agreement—inventions “of the contractor” that is those owned by or belonging to the contractor—makes the phrase meaningful in the statutory definition and “invention owned by the contractor” or “invention belonging to the contractor” are natural readings of the phrase “invention of the contractor”      section a which states that contractors may “elect to retain title” confirms that the act does not vest title stanford reaches the opposite conclusion but only because it reads “retain” to mean “acquire” and “receive” that is certainly not the common meaning of “retain” which is “to hold or continue to hold in possession or use” you cannot retain something unless you already have it and §a—which provides that the act “takes precedence over any other act which would require a disposition of rights in subject inventions … that is inconsistent with” the act—does not displace the basic principle that an inventor owns the rights to his invention only when an invention belongs to the contractor does the bayhdole act come into play the act’s disposition of rights does nothing more than clarify the order of priority of rights between the federal government and a federal contractor in a federally funded invention that already belongs to the contractor      the act’s isolated provisions dealing with inventors’ rights in subject inventions are consistent with the court’s construction of the act see §d that construction is also bolstered by the act’s limited procedural protections which expressly give contractors the right to challenge a governmentimposed impediment to retaining title to a subject invention §b but do not provide similar protection for inventor and thirdparty rights      stanford’s contrary construction would permit title to an employee’s inventions to vest in the university even if the invention was conceived before the inventor became an employee so long as the invention’s reduction to practice was supported by federal funding it also suggests that the school would obtain title were even one dollar of federal funding applied toward an invention’s conception or reduction to practice it would be noteworthy enough for congress to supplant one of the fundamental precepts of patent law and deprive inventors of rights in their own inventions to do so under such unusual terms would be truly surprising had congress intended such a sea change in intellectual property rights it would have said so clearly—not obliquely through an ambiguous definition of “subject invention” and an idiosyncratic use of the word “retain”      the court’s construction of the act is also reflected in the common practice of contractors who generally obtain assignments from their employees and of agencies that fund federal contractors who typically expect those contractors to obtain assignments with effective assignments federally funded inventions become “subject inventions” and the act as a practical matter works pretty much the way stanford says it should the only significant difference is that it does so without violence to the basic patent law principle that inventors own their inventions pp –  f d

counselling hesitation the court of appeals should consider how the reasoning and analysis in ziglar bear on the question whether the parents of a victim shot by a us border patrol agent may recover damages for his death  it would be imprudent for the supreme court to decide jesus hernandez’s fourth amendment claim when in light of the intervening guidance provided in abbasi doing so may be unnecessary to resolve this particular case and  with respect to hernandez’s fifth amendment claim because it is undisputed that the victims nationality and the extent of his ties to the united states

support thereof and all records and papers on file in this action and any evidence or oral argument offered at any hearing on this motion stanford respectfully moves this court for an order confirming and granting leave to amend stanford’s infringement contentions to address roche’s cobas taqman hiv test as an accused product i introduction stanford hereby moves to confirm andor amend its preliminary infringement contentions with respect to roche’s cobas taqman hiv test “taqman” product roche initially agreed to produce documents relating to its taqman product and has sought the court’s extensive consideration of the claim construction issue related exclusively to taqman although stanford served roche with amended infringement contentions identifying taqman as an accused product almost six months ago roche has refused to provide any document discovery regarding taqman because stanford did not file a formal motion to amend most recently roche has refused to prepare its rule b witness on any categories relating to taqman roche’s duplicity has caused stanford substantial prejudice and even the court’s specific consideration of taqman issues in claim construction has not ended roche’s discovery abuse accordingly stanford requests that the court confirm taqman is part of the case andor grant stanford leave to amend                             cooley godward kronish

april   stanford served preliminary infringement contentions as required factual background by the court’s case management order for the infringement phase of this case declaration of anthony j patek in support of stanford’s motion to confirm and amend its infringement contentions “patek decl” exs    stanford’s april   preliminary infringement contentions identified two roche products the amplicor hiv monitor test and the cobas amplicor hiv monitor test id ex  at the time these products were the only fdaapproved quantitative pcr hiv tests marketed by roche on may   roche announced that the fda had approved roche’s taqman assay for distribution in the united states patek decl ex  at stan  roche’s taqman product uses realtime pcr to quantitate hiv rna for monitoring the effectiveness of therapy id at stan  although documents related to taqman were responsive to stanford’s existing document requests that covered “roche products used to monitor the clinical progression of hiv infection and its response to antiretroviral therapy through the use of pcr” roche did not notify stanford of the release of the product patek decl ex  indeed roche had provided no discovery whatsoever with regard to taqman on may   stanford explicitly requested discovery relating to taqman patek decl ex  in response roche stated “with respect to roche’s document production we believe that stanford already has much of what it seeks including development documents and fda submission the accused kits nevertheless we are in the process of gathering additional documents and will specifically search for the categories of documents identified in your letter” patek decl ex  information for emphasis added after learning of the fda approval of taqman on its own on may   stanford reiterated its request for taqmanrelated documents patek decl exs    roche again responded that it would produce relevant documents without any suggestion cooley godward kronish llp attorneys at law palo alto   stanford’s motion to confirmamend pics case no c mhp casecvmhp document filed page of  that it would withhold documents related to taqman stating “roche is searching for additional relevant documents and will be producing additional documents on a rolling basis” patek decl ex  contrary to its representations roche produced no documents related to taqman stanford conducted its own investigation and on july   stanford served an amended set of infringement contentions that specifically identified taqman as an accused device patek decl ex  although stanford served the amended contentions without leave of court roche did not object to stanford’s service of amended infringement contentions identifying taqman as an accused product on august   months after roche agreed to produce taqman documents roche took the position in a footnote of its responsive claim construction brief that taqman “real time kits are not accused products” because “stanford has not sought leave to amend its infringement contentions” patek decl ex  at  n since then roche has refused to provide any discovery relating to taqman stanford nonetheless continued to pursue discovery related to taqman from roche on august   stanford again requested taqman documents covered by its prior requests patek decl ex  also on august   stanford served roche with document requests that explicitly identified taqman as an accused product patek decl ex  in attached correspondence stanford reiterated that “although the taqman product is clearly covered by our previous definition of accused products we have amended the definition to avoid any ambiguity on this point” patek decl ex  stanford included additional requests for taqman related material in correspondence on november  and november   patek decl exs  b stanford was diligent despite roche’s failure to comply with its discovery obligations stanford’s july  amended contentions clearly meet the good cause requirement the court may grant a party the right to amend its infringement contentions upon a showing of “good cause” patent lr  a movant may establish good cause by a showing of                             cooley godward kronish llp attorneys at law palo alto   stanford’s motion to confirmamend pics case no c mhp casecvmhp document filed page of  diligence and lack of prejudice to the nonmovant o micro int’l ltd v monolithic power sys inc  fd   fed cir  other factors relevant to the “good cause” inquiry are notice effect on case schedule the nonmovant’s access to relevant knowledge and whether the issues raised by the amendment were addressed during claim construction here although the taqman product was being sold in europe it was reasonable for stanford to wait until the product’s release in the united states before naming it as an accused infringing product for example products being used solely to gain their fda approval may have protection from infringement under  usc § e as soon as taqman was released stanford moved quickly to evaluate it and subsequently add it to its infringement contentions within a week of the fda approval of taqman for distribution in the united states stanford requested a sample of taqman from roche for inspection patek decl ex  shortly thereafter stanford specifically informed roche that discovery requests encompassed taqman as an accused product patek decl ex  then despite roche’s failure to comply with its discovery obligations stanford conducted an independent investigation and served amended infringement contentions identifying taqman as an accused instrumentality patek decl ex  in sum stanford “put all its cards on the table up front” and thus has good cause for the amendment integrated circuit sys inc v realtek semiconductor co  f supp d   nd cal  further by its conduct roche has waived any right to claim prejudice roche has “long been on notice” that stanford accused taqman ixys corp  f supp d at  n if roche objected to providing taqman discovery the time to do so was in response to stanford’s letters in may instead roche not only failed to claim any prejudice at that time  see eg ixys corp v advanced power tech inc  f supp d   n nd cal  j patel notice tessera inc v

kronish llp attorneys at law palo alto   stanford’s motion to confirmamend pics case no c mhp casecvmhp document filed page of  it actually agreed twice to search for documents leading stanford to believe that roche was not contesting discovery related to taqman thus any delay in serving the amended infringement contentions was caused by roche’s own discovery abuse and gamesmanship as to the fact that stanford did not seek leave to amend when it served the july  contentions roche’s failure timely to object coupled with its apparent agreement to provide taqman discovery led stanford reasonably to believe that taqman had been placed at issue in the case roche’s subsequent objection in its claim construction brief was plainly calculated to maximize the prejudice to stanford after having lulled stanford into believing taqman was already at issue stanford thus respectfully submits that as in ixys corp granting leave to amend “will privilege substance over form”  f supp d at  n c the claim construction proceeding and this court’s ruling have already addressed taqman although roche reneged on its agreement to produce taqman materials in its responsive claim construction brief that brief nonetheless treated taqman as part of the case only the taqman product uses real time pcr which was a prominent part of roche’s claim construction efforts roche devoted about two pages of its responsive claim construction brief and part of one supporting expert declaration to real time pcr patek decl ex  id ex  during the claim construction tutorial and hearing roche discussed real time pcr at length patek decl ex  at   roche even requested additional briefing related solely to construction of claim terms with respect to real time pcr id at   roche subsequently submitted two additional expert declarations dedicated solely to the issue of real time pcr and construction of the “about  cycles” limitation of the patents patek decl exs    the court’s claim construction ruling expressly addresses the real time issue that roche raised and that relates solely to taqman  patek decl exs    compare fresnius med care  wl  at  delay in moving to amend excused where opposing party failed to object and move to strike with o micro int’l  fd at  delay in moving to amend unjustified where opposing party clearly objects to amended contentions  stanford respectfully disagrees with and objects to the court’s conclusion regarding real time                             cooley godward kronish llp attorneys at law palo alto   stanford’s motion to confirmamend pics case no c mhp casecvmhp document filed page of  given its extensive briefing on this topic roche cannot now argue that taqman is not already included in this case or that roche would be prejudiced by granting stanford leave to accuse taqman of infringement fresenius med care  wl  at  further roche’s decision to raise this procedural issue first and solely in a footnote in the claim construction briefing made it reasonable for stanford to await the court’s claim construction decision and address any amendment issues at the same time at roche’s insistence this court ruled on the real time issue presented by taqman which should have prompted roche to provide full discovery regarding taqman taqman is plainly part of this case and roche should be deemed to have waived its arguments to the contrary roche should not be permitted to benefit from its discovery abuse d in the six months since stanford specifically requested taqman discovery and roche agreed to provide it roche never claimed any prejudice from the addition of taqman to the case only as recently as december   did roche claim for the first time that it would be prejudiced by having to provide taqman discovery acknowledging that it has refused to search for taqmanrelated documents and that did not intend to prepare its rule b witnesses on taqman topics this alleged prejudice is of roche’s own making roche’s refusal to comply with the federal rules cannot be twisted into a basis for prejudice to the contrary roche’s discovery abuses have substantially prejudiced stanford it is unfair for roche to agree to provide discovery retract that agreement and then claim that its own discovery failure results in prejudice fresenius med care  wl  at  where amended contentions and discovery were served without leave finding that opposing party’s delay in moving to strike supported later motion for leave to amend furthermore since discovery is not limited by the identification of accused devices any failure on roche’s part to gather and prepare taqman materials is the product of its own discovery misconduct lg electronics inc v qlity computer inc  frd  nd pcr as well as its construction of the terms “about  cycles” and “pcr” the court specifically excluded the term “about  cycles” from briefing and the term “pcr” had never been identified as a term requiring construction                             cooley godward kronish llp attorneys at law palo alto   stanford’s motion to confirmamend pics case no c mhp casecvmhp document filed page of  cal  refusing to limit scope of discovery to products identified under patent lr  b roche should not be rewarded for its refusal to comply with its discovery obligations e requiring a new case to be filed for taqman would waste judicial and party resources amendment to formally include taqman is also supported by considerations of efficiency and resources if taqman is not part of the case stanford’s only choice is to bring another separate case focused on taqman that would plainly be a waste of the parties’ and this court’s resources monohan v new york dep’t of corrections  fd   d cir  citing block v first blood ass’n  fd   d cir  considering ability of plaintiff to raise second claim in new lawsuit in weighing prejudice associated with amending complaint iii stanford’s revisions to its lr c and d chart based on the court’s order are a matter of right under the local rules under patent lr  “if a party claiming patent infringement believes in good faith that  the court’s claim construction ruling    so requires not later than  days after service by the court of its claim construction ruling that party may serve ‘final infringement contentions’ without leave of the court that amend its ‘preliminary infringement contentions’ with respect to the information required by patent lr c and d” stanford had asserted literal infringement by taqman in its preliminary contentions this court’s claim construction ruling precludes literal infringement by taqman thus stanford’s amended contentions are revised to reflect the court’s construction and the infringement by taqman under the doctrine of equivalents in light of that construction these amended contentions were served on december   and thus within the required  days patek decl ex                                   cooley godward kronish llp attorneys at law
