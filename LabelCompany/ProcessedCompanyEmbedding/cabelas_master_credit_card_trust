card master note trust series ii by pymnts posted on july   share tweet share share share email fitch ratings assigns the following ratings to cabela’s credit card master note trust’s assetbacked notes series ii as follows – class a fixedrate ‘aaasf’ outlook stable – class a floatingrate ‘aaasf’ outlook stable – class b fixedrate ‘asf’ outlook stable – class c fixedrate ‘bbbsf’ outlook stable – class d fixedrate ‘bbsf’ outlook stable key rating drivers fitch’s ratings are based on the underlying receivables pool available credit enhancement world’s foremost bank’s underwriting and servicing capabilities and the transaction’s legal and cash flow structures which employ early redemption triggers the transaction structure is similar to series i with credit enhancement totalling  for class a credit enhancement of  for the class b credit enhancement of  plus an amount from a spread account for the class c and credit enhancement of an amount from a spread account for the class d notes only rating sensitivities fitch models three different scenarios when evaluating the rating sensitivity compared to expected performance for credit card assetbacked securities transactions  increased defaults  a reduction in monthly payment rate mpr and  a combination stress of higher defaults and lower mpr increasing defaults alone has the least impact on rating migration even in the most severe scenario of a  increase in defaults the rating sensitivity to a reduction in mpr is more pronounced with a moderate stress of a  reduction leading to possible downgrades across all classes the harshest scenario assumes both stresses occur simultaneously the severe stress could lead to more drastic downgrades to all classes to date the transaction has exhibited strong performance with all performance metrics within fitch’s initial expectations for further discussion of fitch’s sensitivity analysis please see the presale report related to the transaction listed above the presale
