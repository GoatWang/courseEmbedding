to open the call for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from the line of michael hertz with hertz investments please go ahead with your questions michael hertz hi i was hoping you can give us a little more detail on the quarter for etailz just to give us an idea of the growth that took place in the fourth quarter versus last year michael feurer yes overall the etailz were up kind of for the year if you look that end of the standalone they were up about  and in the fourth quarter they were up just under  on the topline michael hertz and is the fourth quarter by far their best quarter or is it less seasonal than our business michael feurer it is less seasonal than our business but it does have a seasonality to it michael hertz thank you very much michael feurer welcome operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from the lines of william meyers with miller asset management please go ahead with your question william meyers hi yes you used the term unlock potential i think referring to etailz and fye can you give us a little bit of detail i mean in my imagination that something like etailz helping to sell the physical product thats in your stores or warehouses is that right michael feurer hi william its michael great question without getting into too many specifics we did reveal that we are going to be operating etailz as a standalone business i think that is very prudent but at the same time there are synergies that will be unlocking there are things like – the things you mentioned but vendor access as an example or costing or even a corporate data approach and in the future trend identification i mean these are just a couple of the things that were already unlocking through this relationship william meyers okay if i could just followup on that tell me about trend identification michael feurer again without getting into too many specifics about the underlying technology it is a data driven approach and a data driven merchandising approach that etailz engages in and so through that data approach and algorithms et cetera they do identify trending opportunities in the marketplace william meyers okay thanks it sounds good end of qa operator okay thank you this concludes today’s qa i would like to turn the call back to management for closing comments michael feurer thank you brenda i would like to thank you for your time today we look forward to talking to you about our first quarter  results in may thank you everyone operator thank you this concludes today’s

syn michael feuer adding drama to sale of health products with maxwellness by mary vanac  comments  jan   at  pm shares westlake ohio — in  michael feuer helped createâ office supply superstoreâ officemax “all we did was took the stuff out of the boxes brought it to life let people touch it feel it and added a sense of drama and theater” feuer said now the selfdescribed “marketing creative writing” guy is adding a sense of drama toâ health and wellness products the name of his store maxwellness of course feuer a savvy retailer who plans aâ  national rollout for maxwellness also thinks now is the right time to cash in on the  billionayear wellness industry a dedicated runner feuer has been interested in health and wellness for most of his adult life as aâ trustee for university hospitals case medical center in cleveland he has shadowed brain surgeons in the operating room andâ pediatricians in the neonatal intensive care unit heâ has counted the cost of making people well what if fewer people got sick “there’s nothing more important than the gift of health”â says feuer who recently donated bone marrow to his brotherâ facing endstage cancer the government and employers cannot reform health care people have to work at staying well “if you stay well you bring the economic benefit to yourself and the country” he said “wellness lives here” feuer says as he holds the door for a visitor toâ his first maxwellness store in westlake ohio the squarefoot store with its  products has been open one hour and  minutesâ another ohio store and two florida stores are planned to open within four weeks feuer and his associates have three goals forâ maxwellness enhance the quality of life prevent illness and treat illness “a year ago when we started thinking about this we never expected all this excitement about wellness” feuer said “i have a very simple business theory i’d rather be lucky than good however when one is luckyâ you have to be smart enough to know there’s an opportunity and then you seize it” feuer knows retailing he asks customers what they want and then he listens while doing market research for maxwellness feuer realized that people see themselves as they want to be not as they are soâ he adorned his store with bright oranges and greens — no sedate browns and beiges hereâ and he pipes in scents “we’re testing ‘clean fresh air’ now people need to be happy feel good” he says his storeâ greets visitors with aâ “cure du jour” sectionâ  he says in this season of new year’s resolutionsâ glass display shelves ofâ cold and flu weightloss and smokingcessation products the maxwellness heart health area stocks simple blood pressure monitors to expensive automated defibrillatorsâ “we plan to work very closely with the medical community … to provideâ the right product for the right need”â he says the electronic tablet in feuer’s hand will help match customer needs with products loaded on the tablet is maxanwers –â purchased consumerhealth software to which he and his staff ofâ wellness professionals have added a lot of information “it’s like webmd on steroids” he says “first and foremost we want to provide answers for healthy living”â  he says showingâ off shelves of sleep exercise and hydration products there’s the vitamin wall whichâ stocksâ dietary supplements for the most serious of athletes to people who areâ trying toâ stay young “ninetyfive percent of what we carry is organic” feuer says “we are not competing with cvs walgreens or rite aid” shoppers can smellâ the aromatherapy section the back twothirds of the store housesâ products that needâ sensitivity to sell a footwear section offers a machine that tells you what orthotics would solveâ lower back pain when you run crocsrx footwear are aâ prescriptiveâ line of the ubiquitousâ rubber clogs thereâ is footwear socks and support hosiery for people who have diabetesâ health and wellness books that offer the latest advice and a section dedicated to sexual wellnessâ that offers expensive vibrators and howto videos “hopefully everything is tastefully packaged” feuer says mobility products — scooters wheelchairs walkers rollators and canes — are displayed in a brightly litâ section that features an ovalshaped test track “how do you buy a car without test driving it” feuer asks the incontinence productsâ section offers large black plastic “sensitivity bags” meant to give buyers privacy the bathroom safety section offersâ rails and bars of every sort shower and transfer benches andâ a lowthreshold bathtub an orthopedics section stocksâ an array of joint braces “the thing we keep pushing is respect dignity” feuer saysâ â “a third of our customers will have an issue do they need the added aggravation of being treated like a dog no” then there’s the confessional — a twosided desk behind smoked glass — where customers will be able to discretelyâ tell their problems to staff feuer got the idea from the catholic confessional where the faithful tell their sins to a priest often behind the anonymity of an opaque screen pipedin sound willâ mask what you’re talking about he says feuer hiredâ someâ therapists and trainers to staff the storeâ “one of our criteria is we hire healthy people we want people to have a passion about their work this is all about staying well” a largescreen televisionâ  behind the checkout counter willâ broadcast wellness messages and tips an area of the store hasâ displays that can be moved to make way for tables and chairs “starting next week we’ll have daily wellness seminars” feuer says as a retailer feuer realizes that attractive packaging and attentive knowledgeable staff can make sales he’s also hoping customers willâ drop by at least once a month for a different reason “once they start to feel good they’ll be afraid to stop coming” he says feuerâ expects to get more satisfaction out of selling wellness products than he did office supplies “here the excitement is the products that we carry can help people have a better life” shares topics cleveland diabetes maxwellness michael feuer ohio —advertisement— hear the latest industry news first sign up for our daily newsletter

michael feurer cofounder of office max originally published  by terry tanker terry tanker met with michael feuer who cofounded officemax in  with  of his own money during a year span feuer as ceo grew the company to almost  stores worldwide with annual sales of about  billion before selling this retail giant for almost  billion in     what would surprise people about you i’m a motorcycle rider i even raced them when i was younger  personally how do you keep your business edge i’m into physical fitness because it keeps me in “fighting” shape i work out six days a week  can you sum up your business philosophy always look at what you are trying to sell through the eyes of the consumer secondly always have a backup plan plan a usually never works as intended so you need to be flexible and adapt trust but always verify and finally stir the pot i hate the phrase if it ain’t broke don’t fix it break it so you can make it better  you have a new book out the benevolent dictator why did you write it i’ve always enjoyed writing i find the process energizing a good writer has to be a good thinker and i enjoy thinking  where can our readers buy a copy amazoncom my website thebenevolentdictatorbiz or any large retailer  in addition to the book you have a new business venture — maxwellness what is the business concept it’s a store for every age at every stage of life featuring over  products to enhance life help prevent illness and treat wellness issues it’s the fruition and realization that companies and the government cannot be expected to continue to take care of everyone individuals have to take responsibility for their own health needs and those of their family companies can’t do it anymore it’s too expensive  how will you launch the brand we’ve opened six brickandmortar stores at time of interview we have our online store and soon you will see “wellness in a box” which is similar to the best buy vending machines you see in airports ours will be in hospitals hotels urgentcare centers exercise facilities and seniorliving centers the products offered will be specific to each location we also have mini max which operates smallerversion stores in hospitals  as a retailer do you like having the stores are they a necessity yes to both the stores are part of the branding process they anchor the business and serve as a great laboratory to test new products and concepts   you have an interesting approach to business plans what’s your philosophy entrepreneurs like to write these painfully long and detailed fiveyear plans but too many companies die in the first year so what good are they in this digital age change happens in minutes rather than weeks months or years  how difficult is it to get your management team to think along the same lines the name of my book answers that question what it means is that as the boss your job is to do what’s right for the greater good of all involved — employees customers whomever the dictator piece simply means when the time for talking is done your job is to make the decision and decide which fork in the road to take  why do so many ceos run companies with three and fiveyear plans comfort and safety if things aren’t going well it buys you time  do you have any other advice about business plans in general don’t fall in love with how you’re going to do something instead fall in love with what you will accomplish and change your methods and techniques as needed to make the results better  you quoted kenny rogers’ lyrics “you’ve got to know when to hold ’em fold ‘em and walk away” as great business advice why most business people don’t know when to pull the plug get up and leave or simply change no one likes to lose sometimes the smartest course of action is to walk away  how often do entrepreneurs make the right decision when they reach phase two after getting started as described in your book not very often most entrepreneurs are creative or simply good at getting out of the starting blocks but don’t know how to get to the next level when you start out and have one store you do everything — design production marketing sales thing are great and you have lots of energy but when you have multiple stores you have to know how to accomplish objectives through others  entrepreneurs often aren’t good delegators why entrepreneurs tend to do many things well themselves one of their fears and dangers is letting go of things they do well  what’s the best way to manage business risk first identify the risks and the down side what is the worstcase scenario and then know your limits how much pain can you endure either mentally or without going out of business you can’t manage what you don’t know once you know you can make decisions on how deep you can go  how many landmines were you able to sidestep while setting up maxwellness because of your officemax experiences literally hundreds you’re always smarter the second time around because you know what your tolerances are  why do entrepreneurs need a sense of “fear of failure” or fof as you call it as soon as you believe you’re as good as you think you are it’s over don’t take anything for granted  what’s the best way to motivate coworkers make them part of the process history shows us the best leaders pick a common enemy get them to focus on a common enemy or common cause get everyone focused  do you have any parting words of wisdom share as much information as you can with everyone you can let coworkers know they have a chance to go farther faster with you than any other place and they are limited only by their own energy ingenuity and ability     articles by terry tanker greg mericle president of hurlburt heating  plumbing greg mericle president of hurlburt heating  plumbing in durand
