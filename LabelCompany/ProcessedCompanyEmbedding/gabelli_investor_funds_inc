of  stocks were slowly sinking under the weight of a declining bond market a tumbling dollar and the prospect of more aggressive federal reserve monetary policy tightening technology stocksthe last bastion of strength in an otherwise weak marketfinally cracked in the last two weeks of the quarter sending virtually all market indices sharply lower thanks to our cash reserves and positive contributions from our arbitrage investments the fund posted a modest return for the quarter as the major stock market indices declined investment performance for the third quarter ended september   the gabelli abc funds the fund total return was  the standard  poors sp  index declined  while the lipper us treasury money market average had a total return of  over the same period the sp  index is an unmanaged indicator of stock market performance while the lipper average reflects the average performance of mutual funds classified in this particular category the fund was up  over the trailing twelvemonth period the sp  index and lipper us treasury money market average rose  and  respectively over the same twelvemonth period for the fiveyear period ended september   the funds total return averaged  annually versus average annual total returns of  and  for the sp  index and lipper us treasury money market average respectively since inception on may   through september   the fund had a cumulative total return of  which equates to an average annual total return of  what we do the gabelli abc fund and its unique performance guaranty program was created in  for conservative investors who had been reluctant to participate in the equity markets in other words it was a vehicle to allow investors to get their feet wet in the stock market without risking loss of capital we see ourselves as an enhanced money market our approach has been to maintain a diversified portfolio of valueoriented equities convertible preferred stocks convertible bonds and us government securities conceptually the upside potential of stocks would help produce greater total return potential than a straight bond or government securities fund and the risk in the equity portion of the portfolio would be diminished by the graphic omitted investment results a  quarter  st nd rd th year       net asset value       total return         net asset value       total return         net asset value

of an investment will fluctuate when shares are redeemed they may be worth more or less than their original cost b from commencement of investment operations on may    combination of lower risk convertible securities and virtually risk free us treasury bills to date this approach has worked quite well although we have indefinitely suspended the performance guaranty program we believe the funds investment strategy can continue to produce favorable results history of the fund the gabelli abc fund was launched on may   with a minimum guaranteed total return of  through may   for   and   performance guaranty programs were in place these programs were unique because they provided investors the full upside potential of the  investment while guaranteeing a minimum total return gabelli funds incs fourth performance guaranty program concluded on december   and a new program was not in effect for  or  the funds annual total returns were  and  respectively for those two years although the performance guaranty program is not being offered for  the fund continues striving to achieve the same objectives during the most recent fouryear period in which the sp  index has delivered  plus annual returns a minimum return guarantee of  appeared dull and unattractive however in terms of market volatility the fund has provided comfort to the risk averse the adviser and board of directors continue to explore several options involving a longer term guaranty program in a closed end structure this would require shareholder approval meanwhile the fund will continue to be managed as it has been the past six years to provide an attractive rate of return without excessive risk of capital commentary too much of a good thing in the third quarter of  the us economy continued to barrel along at a pace that investors feared would lead to higher inflation paced by the long anticipated recovery in japan asian economies are perking up coupled with prospects that european economies are gaining momentum this has spawned concern that synchronized global growth would further increase inflationary pressure here at home all of this positive global economic news was simply too much of a good thing for the us bond market which continued to slide long term synchronized global growth is a blessingwe should all be thinking in terms of gross world product gwp rather than gross domestic product gdp however in the short term it may put additional pressure on the fed to press down on the monetary brakes investors should view this as a dose of cod liver oilbitter medicine but a tonic that will improve the long term health of the economy and the stock market unfortunately mr market often does not like to take his medicine and additional fed interest rate hikes and higher bond yields are not likely to improve his mood so even though third quarter corporate earnings are likely to be quite strong priceearnings pe multiples a function of investor psychology and interest rates may continue to contract sending stocks even lower the good news in this scenario would be the return of ben grahams margin of safety to the market if the domestic economy begins to decelerate in the fourth quarter and the fed declares a monetary ceasefire mr market may be in a better mood although pe multiples are not likely to expand they may stabilize allowing earnings to rally stocks however with equity valuations still at relatively lofty levels advances will engender additional speculative risks the dollar in limbohow low can it go as we write the dollar has hit a fouryear low against the yen this is another good newsbad news situation a cheaper dollar benefits us exporters and ultimately would help reduce trade deficits which have been running at extraordinarily high levels it also bolsters dollar denominated earnings from the international operations of us companies however over the short term it actually increases dollar calculated trade deficits perhaps most importantly a lower dollar is potentially inflationary because the  prices of imported products that us consumers treasure will move higher if the american consumer is willing to pay these higher prices for toyota cars and trucks sony big screen televisions and sega video games it will soon be reflected in the consumer price index cpi this leads us to another important question will fatigue hit the american consumer high employment and the wealth effect of a rising housing and stock market have buoyed consumer confidence discretionary income has risen as a result of depressed energy prices low mortgage rates and rising wages if the domestic economy does slow down consumers may become more concerned about job security when investors receive third quarter statements from their brokers money managers and mutual funds they will realize that their net worth has been trimmed americans are paying more at the pump for gasoline and their home heating bills will be significantly higher this winter variable rate mortgage payments will increase and new fixed rate mortgages are higher so consumers will not be able to raise spending money by leveraging real estate assetsno more take the home mortgage from  to  with the same monthly payments and pocket the difference as aforementioned the prices for imported goods are increasing will all this be enough to cause the american consumer to tighten the purse strings or will a significant tax cutthe republicans are running on the  fs faith finances and familyembolden the american consumer and keep the economic wheels moving here and abroad this quarters scorecard the abc funds portfolio batting average was over  this quarter a respectable showing in a weak market many of our hits came from arbitrage investments one united water resources uwr was a home run uwr returned  for the quarter on the whole however most were not home runsthat is not the idea behind arbitrage investing the portfolio is full of infield singles that helped us score some runs and produce a positive return cilcorp new england electric system and thermo power corp each a utility arbitrage play all singled in runs with returns of   and  the scorecard was not perfect however a few of the funds arbitrage plays looked as if they needed a pinch hitter most notably nalco chemical southwest gas and osullivan industries holdings with declines of   and  respectively the manager decided to stay with the veterans and it appears that they might be beginning to climb out of their respective slumps since arbitrage plays a major role in our portfolio strategy we want to share excerpts from an article we prepared for cigar aficionado magazine discussing what we believe is now a very exciting investment subject risk arbitragehow to profit from the third wave of takeoverstm we are in the midst of the third great wave of mergers and acquisitions since world war ii the first wave swelled in the s with conglomerators like ltvs jimmy ling gulf  westerns charles bluhdorn and itts harold geneen merging companies in nonrelated industries they did so in  an attempt to produce more consistent earnings growth through the ups and downs of the business cycle the second major wave of takeovers began in the s when financial engineers including leveraged buyout firms like kohlberg kravis  roberts and corporate raiders like t boone pickens used junk debt to gobble up undervalued companies and then dismember them for a profit this second wave broke as financially unrealistic deals like the proposed leveraged buyout lbo of united airlines fell apart the junk bond market collapsed and the house of drexel disintegrated under the weight of a government criminal investigation the third great wave of mergers and acquisitions is being driven by consolidatorscompanies in a wide range of industries buying competitors in order to extend their franchises trim costs and increase profitability we trace the beginning of this wave to march   when much admired general electric chairman jack welch launched a hostile bid to buy kemper insurance  signaling that deals were once again respectable this third wave will continue to gain momentum as companies worldwide jockey for market position and profits in the increasingly competitive global economy there are two ways investors can take advantage of merger and acquisition activity the first is buying public shares of likely takeover candidates before the deal is announced gabelli asset managements ability to identify industries ripe for consolidation and our focus on undervalued companies has resulted in a long list of portfolio holdings being taken over at substantial premiums to our purchase prices the second and much less known method is through risk arbitrage it would take a book to detail all the complexities of risk arbitrage in this article ill provide the basics and more importantly the reasons why i believe risk arbitrage is such a compelling investment strategy simply stated risk arbitrage is investing in a merger or acquisition target after the deal has been announced and pocketing the spread between the trading price of the target company following the announcement and the deal price upon closing this spread is usually relatively narrowoffering a somewhat modest nominal total return however since deals generally close in much less than a years time this modest total return translates into a much more attractive annualized return the following is a very basic risk arbitrage investment on march   the nyselisted first data corp announced it would pay  in cash for all the remaining publicly owned shares of paymentech inc  of the company would continue to be owned by bank one which has a merchant processing alliance with first data the deal was expected to close within four months following the announcement we were able to purchase paymentech shares for  the trading price of  per share on the day the deal was announced plus  cents per share in commissions the spread between our purchase price and the value of the stock upon closing was  the deal closed on july   generating an annualized return of  this particular arbitrage worked out very well for us we were able to buy paymentech shares at a good discount to the final transaction price and the deal closed on schedule not all arb investments produce such an attractive annualized return however arbitrage portfolios have posted annualized returns in the low to mid teens in the s  the great advantage of risk arbitrage is that it is largely a market neutral strategydeals get done in good markets and badthat can deliver consistent returns even in volatile markets because a conservatively managed risk arbitrage portfolio produces consistent gains the financial magic of compounding works strongly in its favor let me offer two examples of the power of compounding returns once upon a time there was a king in a far away land in order to repay the local sage for saving his daughters life the king offered the sage any reward he wished the sage asked for what appeared to be a modest stipendone grain of rice  the amount to be doubled each day for  days the sage would receive one grain of rice that day two the next four the next and so on the king thought nothing of giving away a few grains of rice on a daily basis but it was only a matter of weeks before the kings granaries were empty and the sage had become the richest man in the land after only one month the king was paying the sage over  billion grains of rice a day in  days one grain became one billion through the magic of compounding the purchase of manhattan island from the indians for just  worth of beads is generally considered one of the greatest investments in history the estimated value of all the real estate in manhattan today is around  trillion dollars amazingly this equates to an annualized compounded return of just  in the  years since the deal was done of course arbitrage investments dont compound at  daily and most investors time horizons are much shorter than the  years it took to make the purchase of manhattan look like such a great deal but consider the following hypothetical scenario alice and bob both invest  million of their k money in the year  alice puts her money in a risk arbitrage fund that ends up returning  each year for the next ten years bob puts his money in an aggressive equity fund that gains  in eight of the ten years but is down  in year one and year six in  alice has  million compared to bobs  million despite the fact that bobs returns were almost double alices returns in eight of the ten years are we shortchanging bob in this scenario after all the stock market has had only one down year in the last  and over that time period the sp  has posted an average annual gain of  true enough however the long term average annualized return from stocks is just over  and i suggest that over the next ten years equities returns will more closely resemble the historic norms i would also opine that these returns will be accompanied by considerable volatilityyes major corrections and perhaps a full scale bear market are alices arb fund returns realistic remember risk arbitrage returns are impacted by deal flow not the direction of the stock market if deal flow continues to be as robust as we anticipate over the next ten years arb funds have the potential to deliver consistent annual returns in the low to mid teens so this hypothetical scenario may prove remarkably accurate at this juncture you may be wondering where is the risk in risk arbitrage the biggest risk in risk arbitrage is that announced deals will not be consummated and that the stock of the company to be acquired will sink following a bust up in the deal in fact in virtually every individual risk arbitrage investment upside potential is dwarfed by downside risk one old time pundit  said it best  arbitrage is the only business we know where you risk dollars to make nickels the second biggest risk is that the deal may take much longer to close than first anticipated turning an attractive annualized gain into a much more modest return deals do break for a variety of reasons and a busted deal generally means a big loss however during this third great wave of mergers and acquisitions  of all announced deals have been consummated that puts the odds in the arbritrageurs favor particularly if he or she knows how to analyze a deal in a manner that helps avoid most if not all the inevitable potholes an adequately diversified arbitrage portfolio is a must a diversified arb portfolio can withstand the large loss from a broken deal and still generate a positive return regarding the timing issue deals do get stretched out but provided one is not investing with leverage or having to bear the cost of a short position in a stock swap deal this generally results in a more modest gain rather than a loss due to the complexities of most deals and because broad diversification is absolutely essential in my opinion risk arbitrage is best left to organizations with research and trading expertise and sufficient assets to support a fully diversified arb portfolio but just because you cant do it at home doesnt mean that investors shouldnt take advantage of this relatively low risk strategy to create wealth through the magic of compounding returns there are numerous arbitrage partnerships open to individual investors so when the next deal is announced remember it is still not too late to buy and earn an attractive return on your investment lets talk stocks the following are stock specifics on selected holdings of our fund favorable earnings prospects do not necessarily translate into higher stock prices but they do express a positive trend which we believe will develop over time cilcorp inc cer    nyse an illinois utility company agreed to be acquired by aes corp aes    nyse for  billion in cash and assumed debt

finally attracting attention the sharp technology stock correction which began in the second week of march revived the antiquated notion that the severely depressed stocks of high quality companies in outoffavor industry groups might be an attractive alternative to the richly priced technology stocks this allbutforgotten concept gained credence as the previous drivers of the nasdaq continued to plummet in april however investors quickly lost interest in the merits of value investing when technology stocks began rebounding in late may by the end of the second quarter all eyes were once again focused on technology stocks leaving the rest of the market adrift the dow jones industrial average djia and standard  poors  index materially outperformed the nasdaq composite index during the second

reserve interest rate hikes over the last eighteen months the economy is still growing at a pace that troubles the monetary authorities this is also an election year while the campaign has been a relatively quiet one the rhetoric is sure to heat up as we approach november political posturing on economic issues principally how to reallocate the growing budget surplus may rattle the financial markets finally while there are large pockets of attractive fundamental values in the equity markets the overall market as measured by the sp  index is still rather richly priced relative to historic norms of concern to us is the soaring trade deficit thus far the world has been happy to finance this deficit by buying us stocks and bonds this has worked out well for all concerned however if we see inflation continue to trend higher and if the us financial markets sputter international investors may seek opportunities elsewhere reduced global demand for us financial assets may have a greater impact on stocks and bonds than the aforementioned economic political and market issues if international demand dries up the favorable supplydemand dynamics the us financial markets have enjoyed over the last decade may be disrupted in addition the federal reserve may have to pump up interest rates even further and at the wrong time to defend the dollar that is the dark side the bright side is that we are finally seeing evidence of economic deceleration housing starts and home sales are down substantially and with the exception of oil commodity prices have stabilized the most recently released employment numbers were relatively benign and there are indications that consumer confidence has been dented for the time being the federal reserve has spared us an additional rate hike we just may be returning to a goldilocks economynot too hot not too cool but just rightthat will help propel stocks higher we have labeled this rosy economic scenario soft landing part ii ideally we will see a much broader market advance in which companies in a wider range of industries participate a tug of war for brief periods during the second quarter market activity looked like a tugofwar between technology and value stocks when the techheavy nasdaq composite was down the valueoriented dow jones was up and viceversa this raises the question of whether tech stocks must fall before stocks from value sectors may rise and if so what economic and market phenomena may cause such a reversal in fortune lets examine the economic hypothesis being used to glorify technology stocks and relegate value stocks to investment purgatory the nasdaq composite and djia began to diverge at the end of the second quarter of  when it became clear the federal reserve was determined to raise shortterm interest rates until the economy slowed technology company earnings were thought to be largely immune  to higher interest rates and a slower economyan argument that had validity due to strong secular growth trends in many tech sectors earnings for economically sensitive companies would trend lower as the economy deceleratedalso a reasonable assumption despite the federal reserves best efforts the economy continued to barrel along and we saw solid earnings gains across the industry group spectrum tech stocks were grandly rewarded for meeting or exceeding earnings estimates but better than expected earnings for companies in other industries were largely ignored at the close of this reporting period the nasdaq composite had a trailing priceearnings pe multiple of  while the dow jones industrials had a trailing pe of  pes are a function of earnings growth rates and interest rates a company growing earnings at  per year deserves a higher pe than a company growing earnings at  annually however pes are also a reflection of investor sentiment presently quality tech stocks are priced as if nothing can go wrong and quality companies in other industries are priced as if nothing can go right this challenges economic reality wall street analysts are paid to look forward but their forecasts are generally strongly biased by the past over the last several years leading technology companies earnings have beaten consensus projections analysts have responded by raising the earnings bar at least in part to justify soaring valuations if the economy slows technology spending may moderate as well and tech companies earnings may fall short of what we believe are overly optimistic forecasts high valuations leave little room for even modest earnings disappointments just ask the folks at qualcomm and lucent technologies as for the rest of the market if the economy is slowing earnings for economically sensitive companies may have peaked albeit a year later than many anticipated cyclical stocks have received little tribute for better than expected earnings in fact we believe that significantly lower earnings are already baked into valuations so any pleasant surprises should generate enthusiasm other industry groups such as food and drug stocks suffered more from investor indifference than any present or potential earnings dislocations media stocks which stalled in  after exceptionally strong performance in  may recapture stock market interest as consolidation in the industry accelerates in the last year we have seen aol combine with time warner viacom acquire cbs and the recently announced vivendicanal plusseagram merger we think there are many more deals big and small on the horizon as content and distribution are linked to improve media companies competitive positions on the world stage telecommunications stocks have also taken a welldeserved rest this year however the three forces driving the industrytechnology deregulation and consolidationremain firmly in place we are investment realists technology is the preeminent growth industry in the world and over the long term discriminating tech investors should receive generous rewards however the current diet of nothing but super rich technology stocks is dangerous the addition of some high protein low calorie items from some other investment food groups will help promote healthier longterm results what is risk arbitrage simply stated risk arbitrage is investing in a merger or acquisition target after the deal has been announced and pocketing the spread between the trading price of the target company following the announcement and the deal price upon closing this spread is usually relatively narrow offering a somewhat modest nominal total return however since deals generally close in much less than a years time this modest total return translates into a much more attractive annualized return  mergers and acquisitions the value of announced mergers and acquisitions in the first half of  increased to  billion from  billion in the first half of  merger activity continues to surge as companies in industries such as banks broadcasters brokers telecommunications utilities defense and health care combine in response to falling regulatory barriers and increased competition a number of themes continued to surface in the first half of the year cross border mergers minority buyouts strategic acquisitions and hostile bids all highlighted a vibrant arbitrage environment arbitrage activity should remain dynamic during the coming months as strategic mergers and acquisitions continue to be announced in a variety of industries we plan to capitalize on those opportunities that fit our investment philosophy investment scoreboard once again risk arbitrage investments in announced deals provided solid performance for the fund our utility investments contributed respectable returns and helped stabilize the portfolio in the midst of a volatile stock market while our us treasury security holdings approximately  of portfolio assets at the close of the quarter added slow but steady returns our losers list was dominated by cyclical companies such as federal mogul whx and carlyle

financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the financial statements actual results could differ from those estimates the following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the fund in the preparation of its financial statements security valuation portfolio securities listed or traded on a nationally recognized securities exchange quoted by the national association of securities dealers automated quotations inc nasdaq or traded on foreign exchanges are valued at the last sale price on that exchange as of the close of business on the day the securities are being valued if there were no sales that day the security is valued at the average of the closing bid and asked prices or if there were no asked prices quoted on that day then the security is valued at the closing bid price on that day except for open short positions which are valued at the last asked price all other portfolio securities for which overthecounter market quotations are readily available are valued at the latest average of the bid and asked prices portfolio securities traded on more than one national securities exchange or market are valued according to the broadest and most representative market as determined by gabelli funds llc the adviser securities and assets for which market quotations are not readily available are valued at their fair value as determined in good faith under procedures established by and under the general supervision of the board of directors short term debt securities with remaining maturities of  days or less are valued at amortized cost unless the directors determine such does not reflect the securities fair value in which case these securities will be valued at their fair value as determined by the directors debt instruments having a maturity greater than  days are valued at the highest bid price obtained from a dealer maintaining an active market in those securities options are valued at the last sale price on the exchange on which they are listed if no sales of such options have taken place that day they will be valued at the mean between their closing bid and asked prices repurchase agreements the fund may enter into repurchase agreements with primary government securities dealers recognized by the federal reserve board with member banks of the federal reserve system or with other brokers or dealers that meet credit guidelines established by the adviser and reviewed by the board of directors under the terms of a typical repurchase agreement the fund takes possession of an underlying debt obligation subject to an obligation of the seller to repurchase and the fund to resell the obligation at an agreedupon price and time thereby determining the yield during the funds holding period the fund will always receive and maintain securities as collateral whose market value including accrued interest will be at least equal to  of the dollar amount invested by the fund in each agreement the fund will make payment for such securities only upon physical delivery or upon evidence of book entry transfer of the collateral to the account of the custodian to the extent that any repurchase transaction exceeds one business day the value of the collateral is markedtomarket on a daily basis to maintain the adequacy of the  the gabelli abc fund notes to financial statements continued unaudited collateral if the seller defaults and the value of the collateral declines or if bankruptcy proceedings are commenced with respect to the seller of the security realization of the collateral by the fund may be delayed or limited futures contracts the fund may engage in futures contracts for the purpose of hedging against changes in the value of its portfolio securities and in the value of securities it intends to purchase upon entering into a futures contract the fund is required to deposit with the broker an amount of cash or cash equivalents equal to a certain percentage of the contract amount this is known as the initial margin subsequent payments variation margin are made or received by the fund each day depending on the daily fluctuation of the value of the contract the daily changes in the contract are included in unrealized gains or losses the fund recognizes a realized gain or loss when the contract is closed at june   there were no open futures contracts there are several risks in connection with the use of futures contracts as a hedging device the change in value of futures contracts primarily corresponds with the value of their underlying instruments which may not correlate with the change in value of the hedged investments in addition there is the risk that the fund may not be able to enter into a closing transaction because of an illiquid secondary market securities transactions and investment income

program was created in  for conservative investors who had been reluctant to participate in the equity markets in other words it was a vehicle to allow investors to get their feet wet in the stock market without risking loss of capital we see ourselves as an enhanced money market our approach has been to maintain a diversified portfolio of value oriented equities convertible preferred stocks convertible bonds and us government securities conceptually the upside potential of stocks would help produce greater total return potential than a straight bond or government securities fund and the risk in the equity portion of the portfolio would be diminished by the combination of lower risk convertible securities and virtually risk free us treasury bills to date this approach has worked quite well although we have indefinitely suspended the performance guaranty program we believe the funds investment strategy can continue to produce favorable results

attractive format for initial investors the program would be available to all investors in the fund as of june   the fund will continue to be managed as it has been over the past five years to provide an attractive rate of return without excessive risk of capital commentary in compiling our thoughts for this shareholder letter we looked forward by looking through the rear view mirror in the process we witnessed the testimony of federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan and we could not say it any better to quote alan    mr chairman and members of the committee i appreciate this opportunity to present the federal reserves midyear report on monetary policy overall the performance of the us economy continues to be impressive over the first part of the year we experienced further gains in output and employment subdued prices and moderate longterm interest rates important crosscurrents however have been impacting the economy with labor markets very tight and domestic final demand retaining considerable momentum the risks of a pickup in inflation remain significant but inventory investment which was quite rapid late last year and early this year appears to have slowed perhaps appreciably moreover the economic and financial troubles in asian economies are now demonstrably restraining demands for us goods and services  and those troubles could intensify and spread further weighting these forces the federal open market committee chose to keep the stance of policy unchanged over the first half of  however should pressures on labor resources begin to show through more impressively in cost increases policy action may need to counter any associated tendency for prices to accelerate before it undermines this extraordinary expansion  excerpt from the monetary policy testimony and report to congress before the subcommittee on domestic and international monetary policy of the committee on banking and financial services us house of representatives july   arbitrage a favorable riskreward investment strategy in light of the uncertainty over how the asian economic crisis will impact the us economy and stock market shareholders may be surprised to see that the cash levels in the fund have dropped from  of assets at the end of the first quarter of  to  at the close of the second quarter how have we been spending this money primarily by investing in arbitrage situations such as allied group dekalb genetics orange  rockland utilities mercantile stores giant food and southern new england telecommunications  pndth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th what is arbitrage we define arbitrage as investing in event driven situations primarily but not exclusively in announced mergers acquisitions reorganizations and other workout opportunities when a company agrees to be acquired by another company its stock price generally immediately rises to just below the stated acquisition price we look at the spread between the sellers stock price and the announced deal price and the time frame in which the acquisition is expected to close if we are confident the acquisition will be consummated on schedule at the full deal price and we can earn an annualized rate of return materially higher than that likely to be realized through investing in cash equivalents then we are interested we do the research we value the target company to see if it is really worth what the acquiring company has announced it will pay sometimes we find it is worth even more increasing the odds that some other company might make a higher bid we also research the acquiring company to insure that it can finance the deal if it is a stock transaction we need to know that we will be receiving good value in return we look at merger agreements to see if there are any loopholes we review any antitrust concerns raised by the government in short we make judgements to assure that what we see will be what we get there is greater risk in this strategy than in simply owning money market instruments because announced acquisitions are not always completed and in situations where the deal currency is the acquirers stock as opposed to cash the ultimate acquisition price may vary in value however if we do a thorough job evaluating the downside risk we can often earn generous returns relative to the money markets particularly with todays low money market yields in summation we think arbitrage as we practice it in the abc fund represents an attractive investment opportunity with historically low correlation to the performance of the overall stock market we borrow a quote from warren buffett to explain our use of arbitrage in the fund our subsidiaries sometimes engage in arbitrage as an alternative to holding short term cash equivalents we prefer of course to make major long term commitments but we often have more cash than good ideas at such times arbitrage sometimes promises much greater returns than treasury bills and equally important cools any temptation we may have to relax our standards for long term investments lets talk stocks the following are stock specifics on selected holdings of our fund favorable earnings prospects do not necessarily translate into higher stock prices but they do express a positive trend which we believe will develop over time allied group inc grp    nyse accepted a sweetened offer of  billion from

terror incidents around the world the us presidential election dominated the national conscience to such an extent that it impacted football ratings and retail spending a conclusion to this quadrennial process some might say ordeal and greater political certainty would likely have sparked a market rally no matter who was elected but the  rise in the sp  since november  has the potential to rank as the largest market postelection move for a new president since the  inauguration of jfk the socalled trump rally has been fueled by the potential for increased fiscal stimulus lower

comments from barrons roundtable in previous reports to shareholders as is our custom we are including selected comments of mario gabelli trades portfolio from barrons  roundtable part  and part  published on january  and january   respectivelymario gabelli trades portfolio head of gabelli funds and its parent firm is a wall street legend for good reason hes a shrewd thematic investor with a love of deals an eye for steals and an encyclopedic knowledge of multiple businesses and the people who built themspeaking of opportunities how about sharing your ideas mariogabelli to echo my comments this morning in electing donald trump the us is moving away from creeping socialism toward the reinvigoration of capitalism we are seeing a wave of confidence in america which will spark a wave of innovation individual tax rates could fall from  to  a new tax plan could create only three tax tiers and the earned income credit could rise returning money to the working class also regulatory reform could help improve the tone of business the us consumer had a record net worth of  trillion as of september  minus debt thats  trillion there are two pockets of concern auto loans are up substantially in the past ten years and student loans have ballooned to  trillion thats a big dragthats the macro backdrop on stocks i recommended cbs last year and it rose nicely i expected cbs to buy viacom viab but it didnt happen viacom has  million shares outstanding about  million are class a controlled by the redstone familys nationalamusements the rest are class b with the b shares around  viacom has an equity valuation of  billion the enterprise value including debt is  billion viacoms paramount movie studio is a great brand but it lost about  million last year it must revitalize its theatrical and television production and it will viacom could also do some creative financing with paramount  selling assets entering joint ventures and suchviacoms cable tv networks arent performing well either how can the company turn those aroundgabelli the basic business includes nickelodeon mtv and other networks the new ceo bob bakish must trim the portfolio and energize product development we look for viacom to report  billion of revenue and  billion of ebitda in this fiscal year ending september  the stock trades for seven times enterprise value to ebitda if im apple aapl and want to get into the entertainment business and have a market cap of  billion viacom wouldnt be hard to buy but shari redstone president of national amusements likely wont sellblack dont you think viacom is a value trap it has been depressed for several yearsgabelli you are correct the assets werent managed right by the previous management team the companys ratings are starting to improve viacom stations in the aggregate have more viewers than espn notwithstanding millennials penchant for cordcutting cancellation of cable service the stock potentially could double in three years the rules are changing in the media business the industry will consolidate globallyschafer the problems are priced into the stockgabelli thank you a year ago congress passed the fast act  fixing americas surface transportation stocks like astec industries aste and gencor industries genc which make machinery used in highway construction surged if we get more visibility on infrastructure spending vendors to industrial companies will do well we like the rental equipment business the uber of the industry it is a  billion business in the us growing at  a yearwhich stock are you pickinggabelli herc holdings hri a rental equipment supplier was spun out of hertz global holdings htz on july   the company is a work in progress but should have a significant tail wind if the trump administration launches a big infrastructure initiative herc has an ebitda margin of  the stock is trading for  and the market cap is  billion herc has  billion of debt courtesy of hertz but it isnt overleveragedconstruction equipment companies also are well positioned my pick today is cnh industrial cnhi formerly case new holland the company has  million shares and the stock is trading for about  exor the agnelli familys holding company controls cnh since its merger with fiat industrial in  cnh has a large global presence in the construction equipment business it is also known for farming equipment and engines profits have been slim in the construction business but that could change cnh recently struck a deal with hyundai heavy industries korea stock exchange to make mini excavators through the fiat merger it owns iveco a european truck maker the class a truck market in europe is improving the stock could double in the next two yearsabout ten years ago i identified the singleserve coffee market as an exciting growth opportunityyou were hardly alonebillion business and sparkling water is the fastest growing subset it is growing by  a year lacroix gets significant floor space at grocers and has a  market share in its categorycohen what are the profit margins on thisgabelli let me give you the math first the fiscal year ends april  national beverage has been rolling up beverage companies it bought the shasta brand  which is popular in the west  and faygo and others energy drinks are a small part of the business lacroix should generate  million in revenue this fiscal year and  million of ebitda so the profit margin isnt as high as you would expect the ceo is taxsensitive the company declared a dividend of  a share in late november but it isnt payable until jan  after trump becomes president if congress abolishes the estate tax and the tax on long term capital gains comes down would he be likely to sell the company i doubt it but eventually cocacola ko or pepsico pep or dr pepper snapple group dps will knock on the doorrogers is lacroix nationally distributedgabelli yes more or less national beverage has significant bottling capacity lacroix is their premier brandlacroixs revenue could rise to  million over the next several years driving overall revenue to more than  billion shasta is doing okay and the other brands are small national beverage is likely to earn  a share this year rising to  in the year ending april  capital expenditure is de minimis maybe  million the company doesnt put money into trucks or delivery routespriest what is the market capgabelli today i like the prospects for sparkling water  in particular national beverage fizz which markets lacroix the company is based in florida and has  million shares outstanding the stock sells for  the ceo nick caporella is sugary soft drinks are perceived to be bad for you and in some places theyre being taxed but lacroix has no sugar or additives carbonated soft drinks are a  gabelli it is about  billion we look for new products and new channels of distribution the one i kick myself for is amazoncom amzn if only wed known jeffrey bezos amazons

is about  million and capex is  million to  million those are the kinds of things i like today the company announced the sale of its anvil international piping system divisionthere are so many attractive companies when you think about how a  tax rate would boost earnings we expect more corporate takeovers too romance is in the airlets leave things therethanks mario corporate tax reform has been on the washington agenda for many years but with the executive and legislative branches in the hands of one party it could finally become a reality with many details to be reconciled a reduction in corporate tax rates from  to  or even lower combined with a change to the current global system that taxes profits wherever they are earned should lead to higher earnings similarly a reduction in individual tax brackets and rates has the potential to stoke consumption and increase the incentive for work both of these reforms will have to be accompanied by offsetting limits to deductions including the potential elimination of the deductibility of corporate interest expense which could have broad consequences and somewhat limit the impact of lower rates increased fiscal stimulus in the form of increased infrastructure and defense spending should also boost gdp growth but may be limited by republican concerns about the size of the deficit and the practical scarcity of shovelready projects finally a rollback in the regulatory creep of the obama years seems most assured a redesign of the healthcare system a loosening of doddfrank rules governing the banking system a lighter touch toward internet regulation a different approach to domestic energy production and transportation and a more accommodative vision for antitrust enforcement appear to have awakened the animal spirits of the business communitytrump as presidenttrump will make mistakes as all presidents do for better or worse our federal constitutional system with the checks and balances of congress and the courts and power dispersed through the states modulates change by design as we witness the evolution of candidate trump into presidentelect trump he has gathered some controversial but wellseasoned advisors and seems humbled by the majesty of the office three areas bear continued watching protectionism is bad for consumers and businesses alike but free trade is not always fair trade and doesnt mean that the president shouldnt attempt to negotiate better deals with our trading partners second a geopolitical crisis is a near certainty over the next four years  how will trump balance a desire to project a strong america with a distaste for foreign entanglements lastly it is worth noting that candidates who are populists are usually not unwaveringly probusiness ceos in all sectors should be alert for twitter bombs the modern form of jawboning such as those lobbed by the incoming president at the pharmaceutical industry and several defense contractorstailwinds and headwindspresident trump will inherit several interrelated macroeconomic shifts that were already in motion before the election and accentuated by its aftermath higher interest rates a stronger dollar and increased inflation expectations the tenyear us treasury note rose from a low of  in july to  at the time of this writing while the dollar has strengthened against its trade weighted basket by about  over the same time frame the federal reserve has signaled a willingness to raise rates multiple times in  a divergence in monetary policy from still dovish central banks in europe and japan not to mention a fraying of the european union will continue to propel the dollar and reduce the competitiveness of us exports an outcome neither chairman janet yellen nor the new administration will relish a tightening labor market and the promised fiscal stimulus may however force the hand of the fed with all else equal higher interest rates and accelerating inflation are bad for all asset classes including equities but all else is never equal the question is whether gdp and consequently earnings growth will accelerate enough to overcome the natural governors of higher rates felt in the form of higher borrowing costs and inflation felt in the form of reduced purchasing power put simply earnings estimates for sp  may be revised upward but may not overcome the pressure of a reduction in the market multiple which at over x is already above historical norms much as it is foolish to underestimate the dynamic nature of the economy one cannot generalize changes in the political economic environment to all industries this has spurred a great rotation in the equity market markets especially since the election from growth to value noncyclical to cyclical and large cap to small cap stocks to the extent that financial companies are overrepresented in value indices all of these shifts can be understood as the pendulum swinging to those companies most levered to tax reform and domestic stimulus and least exposed to currency and trade disruptions indeed the fang stocks facebook amazon netflix googlealphabet  of net assets as of december   that dominated returns in  trail the market slightly this year up a weighted average  and appear out of favor both in washington and on wall street what remains to be seen is whether the virtuous vicious if you are a value investor cycle of flows into passive etfs and these names has been brokenyour portfolio deals deals  more dealswe believe we are generally well positioned for almost any economic environment including the inflationary one described above our holdings tend to be domestically focused with strong franchises and often pricing power we have never been topdown allocators trying to chase every trend rather we rely on fundamental bottomup research informed by our view of the shifting political economic tides we purchase and hold securities trading at discounts to their private market values appropriate for their level of risk and seek to identify one or more catalysts that could close that valuation gap industry consolidation financial engineering eg spinoffs changes in management and changes in regulation are just a few catalysts in which the portfolio is rich in briefspinoff activity was healthy in  though down from  and  notable spinoffs in the portfolio include the separation of hertzs equipment rental unit herc from the car rental business the spinoff of honeywells  of net assets as of december   nylon business advansix the spinoff of johnson controls  automotive interiors business adient and the continued transformation of conagra under ceo sean connolly with its spinoff of potato processor lamb westonas could be expected dr john malone contributed to our list of new securities with the spinoff of

acquisitions ma as well two deals announced in  involving significant holdings  the longawaited purchase of cablevision and carl icahn trades portfolios purchase of pep boys  closed during  january

engineer time warner  att has agreed to pay  in cash and stock in a transaction that will garner scrutiny in washington but we think is likely to succeed finally at the time of this writing there is speculation that g capital and berkshire hathawaywarren buffett trades portfolio have identified their next meal in the global food space  mondelez  which was formerly part of gs current acquisition

currency where applicable and are presented as of december  cbs corp of net assets as of december  cbsnyse cbs operates the cbs television network and the premium cable network showtime it also owns  local television stations and  radio stations we believe that cbs has a number of opportunities to generate incremental nonadvertising revenue from the sale of existing content through its ott platforms online video distributors and retransmission agreements with traditional distributors in addition we expect a continued recovery in advertising to contribute to earnings growth finally we believe that financial engineering including the splitoff of its radio business could act as a catalyst for shares honeywell international inchonnyse hon operates as a diversified technology company with highly engineered products including turbine propulsion engines auxiliary power units turbochargers brake pads environmental and combustion controls sensors security and life safety products resins and chemicals nuclear services and process technology for the petrochemical and refining industries one of the key drivers of hons growth is acquisitions that increase the companys growth profile globally creating both organic and inorganic opportunities the company recently acquired elster industries a leading provider of thermal gas solutions smart meters software and data analytics for the commercial industrial and residential heating market elsters gas business offers products in high demand among natural gas customers and brings a strong global distribution network and numerous crossselling opportunities for existing hon technologies to new customers elsters gas electric and water meters are highly valued for their reliability safety and accuracy the company maintains an installed base of more than  million meter modules deployed over the course of the last  years that generate significant recurring revenues we believe acquisitions such as elster should

presidential elections from his classic democracy in america  as you reflect on the year that has been and the vibrancy of our american experimentfor a long while before the appointed time has come the election becomes important and so to speak the allengrossing topic of discussion factional ardor is redoubled and all the artificial passions which the imagination can create in a happy and peaceful land are agitated and brought to lightas the election draws near the activity of intrigue and the agitation of the populace increase the citizens are divided into hostile camps each of which assumes the name of its favorite candidate the whole nation glows with feverish excitement the election is the daily theme of the press the subject of private conversation the end of every thought and every action the sole interest of the present it is true that as soon as the choice is determined this ardor is dispelled calm returns and the river which had nearly broken its banks sinks to its
