character remained in the show after modifications were made to relevant dialogue the weekend after colemans death a scheduled funeral was postponed and later canceled due to a dispute regarding the disposition of his estate and remains among colemans adoptive parents former business associate anna gray and price colemans former manager dion mial was involved initially but withdrew after colemans  will which named mial as executor and directed that his wake be conducted by those with no financial ties to me and can look each other in the eyes and say they really cared personally for gary colemen sic turned out to be superseded by a later one replacing mial with gray and directing that there be no funeral service wake or other ceremony memorializing my passing questions were also raised as to whether price who approved discontinuing colemans life support was legally authorized to do so the controversy was exacerbated by a photograph published on the front page of the tabloid newspaper the globe depicting price posed next to a comatose intubated coleman under the headline it was murder the hospital later issued a statement confirming that coleman had completed an advance health care directive granting price permission to make medical decisions on his behalf an investigation by santaquin police was closed on october   after the medical examiner ruled colemans death accidental and no evidence of wrongdoing could be demonstrated in june colemans remains were cremated in accordance with his wishes after a utah judge agreed that there was no dispute regarding that issue but disposition of the ashes was delayed pending a judicial decision on permanent control of the estate while colemans final will signed in  named gray as executor and awarded his entire estate to her coleman and price married in  although they divorced in  price claimed in a court petition that she remained colemans commonlaw wife sharing bank accounts and the couple presented themselves publicly as husband and wife until colemans death an assertion that if validated by the court would make her the lawful heir in may  judge james taylor ruled that while price had indeed lived in colemans home after their marriage ended their relationship at the time of his death failed to meet utahs standard for a commonlaw marriage the disposition of his ashes remains unreported price said were she granted disposition she would scatter the ashes at the golden spike national historic site in utah as a tribute to colemans lifelong love of trains filmographyedit year title role notes  the

 will which named mial as executor and directed that his wake be conducted by those with no financial ties to me and can look each other in the eyes and say they really cared personally for gary colemen sic turned out to be superseded by a later one replacing mial with gray and directing that there be no funeral service wake or other ceremony memorializing my passing questions were also raised as to whether price who approved discontinuing colemans life support was legally authorized to do so the controversy was exacerbated by a photograph published on the front page of the tabloid newspaper the globe depicting price posed next to a comatose intubated coleman under the headline it was murder the hospital later issued a statement confirming that coleman had completed an advance health care directive granting price permission to make medical decisions on his behalf an investigation by santaquin police was closed on october   after the medical examiner ruled colemans death accidental and no evidence of wrongdoing could be demonstrated in june colemans remains were cremated in accordance with his wishes after a utah judge agreed that there was no dispute regarding that

to her coleman and price married in  although they divorced in  price claimed in a court petition that she remained colemans commonlaw wife sharing bank accounts and the couple presented themselves publicly as husband and wife until colemans death an assertion that if validated by the court would make her the lawful heir in may  judge james taylor ruled that while price had indeed lived in colemans home after their marriage ended their relationship at the time of his death failed to meet utahs standard for a commonlaw marriage the disposition of his ashes remains unreported price said were she granted disposition she would scatter the ashes at the golden spike national historic site in utah as a tribute to colemans lifelong love of trains filmographyedit year title role notes  the

 will which named mial as executor and directed that his wake be conducted by those with no financial ties to me and can look each other in the eyes and say they really cared personally for gary colemen sic turned out to be superseded by a later one replacing mial with gray and directing that there be no funeral service wake or other ceremony memorializing my passing questions were also raised as to whether price who approved discontinuing colemans life support was legally authorized to do so the controversy was exacerbated by a photograph published on the front page of the tabloid newspaper the globe depicting price posed next to a comatose intubated coleman under the headline it was murder the hospital later issued a statement confirming that coleman had completed an advance

accidental and no evidence of wrongdoing could be demonstrated in june colemans remains were cremated in accordance with his wishes after a utah judge agreed that there was no dispute regarding that

publicly as husband and wife until colemans death an assertion that if validated by the court would make her the lawful heir in may  judge james taylor ruled that while price had indeed lived in colemans home after their marriage ended their relationship at the time of his death failed to meet utahs standard for a commonlaw marriage the disposition of his ashes remains unreported price said were she granted disposition she would scatter the ashes at the golden spike national historic site in utah as a tribute to colemans lifelong love of trains filmographyedit year title role notes  the

colemen sic turned out to be superseded by a later one replacing mial with gray and directing that there be no funeral service wake or other ceremony memorializing my passing questions were also

colemans home after their marriage ended their relationship at the time of his death failed to meet utahs standard for a commonlaw marriage the disposition of his ashes remains unreported price said
