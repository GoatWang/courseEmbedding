kingdoms collide new teaching cd by david bercot romans  commands christians to obey the governmental authorities but what happens when caesar�s demands conflict with jesus� commandments this happened in ken miller�s case in this message bercot sets for  biblical principles we must look at when caesar�s kingdom and god�s kingdom collide more  min cd    what about timo miller march   over the past six months i�ve been asked numerous times about the role that timothy timo miller and others played in the prosecution of the ken miller case �was it right for timo to testify against ken miller� i�m often asked so let me explain how i look at the matter which to the best of my knowledge is also how ken looks at it to begin with nobody testified against ken miller several anabaptists including timo miller gave their testimony concerning what they knew about the disappearance of lisa miller and her daughter they weren�t joining sides with the prosecution against ken if any of them had refused to testify the government would have prosecuted them for the role they played in lisa�s disappearance the government would also have called them to testify before a grand jury and they would have been jailed for contempt of court if they had refused to testify there as it happened the testimony of these anabaptists confirmed the circumstantial evidence the government already had against ken and it led to ken�s arrest however it�s important to understand that each of these persons testified that it was ken who had contacted them and asked them to get involved in helping lisa move to nicaragua in other words they didn�t bring ken into the matter he brought them into it that being the case would it have been right for ken to let them go to jail in order to protect him if ken was the one who got them involved in the lisa miller disappearance and if they were offered immunity for their testimony then christian love required that ken be the one to face prosecution instead of them it�s for that reason that ken is not in any way upset or disappointed with these fellow believers nor does he want anyone else to view them negatively because of the stance they took he is happy that he was the only one to be prosecuted for it could have easily turned out differently and everyone could have been prosecuted instead of just ken march   ken miller has written a page on his impressions of lisa miller to read this paper click on lisa miller read the letter that ken miller sent to judge william sessions while ken was in jail click on ken miller letter ken miller has been set free for now march   this afternoon judge sessions made three rulings  he sentenced ken miller to  months in federal prison for aiding lisa miller to flee to nicaragua with her daughter  he decided that ken is not going to testify before the grand jury regardless of continued incarceration so he lifted the civil contempt order  before the hearing we filed a notice that we intended to appeal ken�s conviction because we feel that venue was improper venue is the place a trial is held we feel that the federal rules require that the case be tried in virginia instead of vermont the judge ruled that we have raised a �substantive issue� meaning we have a reasonable chance of prevailing on the appeal he therefore put ken�s prison sentence on hold until the nd circuit rules on our appeal this will probably take  years or longer if the sentence were not stayed ken could serve nearly his entire sentence only to have the original conviction overturned so ken was able to leave the federal courthouse in burlington vt and return with his wife and family to virginia when i last spoke with him he was en route to virginia about  brothers and sisters attended the hearing ken will be under the same restrictions he was previously under�such as not leaving the state of virginia two to three years from now we should receive a ruling from the nd circuit court of appeals on our appeal if they agree with us that venue in vermont was improper then the federal government will have to start over such a ruling would erase ken�s sentence as well as his felony conviction the government may elect to try ken in virginia or they may decide to drop the case if the court of appeals rules that venue in vermont was proper then ken will have to report to the prison to which he will be assigned to begin his sentence the judge said that ken would serve his time in a minimum security prison in or near virginia db february  i spoke with ken a few hours ago and he wants to thank everyone for their letters when he left the essex county jail last week one of the guards told him that he had probably set a record for the most mail received by any prisoner in their jail for a similar time period ken told me that he received about  letters today at the new prison however half of the letters had to be returned to their senders without ken getting to see them because they violated the prison�s rules on letters the new prison has stricter rules on mail than did the essex county jail some of the new mail restrictions are ●   no postcards ●   no letters containing colors by magic markers or highlighters ●   no letters or pictures with drawings by crayon paint etc ●   no letters with staples so be certain to follow these restrictions so that your letters will reach ken thanks db you�re invited to attend march  i wanted to let everyone know that they are invited to attend ken�s sentencing on march   at  pm even though you will probably not get an opportunity to talk to ken he will certainly be encouraged and strengthened by your presence ken is back in the vermont state prison  pm feb   i spoke with ken this evening around  pm he had just been processed back to the vermont state facility where he was originally held he was nearby the phone when i called so we were able to have an extended talk he wants everyone to know that he is doing fine we knew he would be transported back to vermont before the hearing on march  but we weren�t expecting the move quite this early ken actually left the essex county jail around  am this morning but the transportation van was also picking up prisoners from various other jails so it took until about  pm this evening for the van to reach the northwest correctional center in vermont because ken is back in state prison it means that only visitors who are on his approved visitor�s list can see him we don�t know how long it will take to get that list set up i plan on speaking with him on thursday morning around  am and he should know more then also ministers have to be on the prison�s approved �volunteer list� to be able to visit from what the officer said ministers are not able to have a oneonone visit as they are at the essex county jail instead the approved ministers meet with a group of prisoners at one time letters will mean more than ever right now his new address is ken miller northwest correctional center  lower newton rd swanton vt  ken miller en route back to vermont prison feb    pmthis afternoon i attempted to call ken at the new york essex jail where he has been the last couple of weeks the officer i spoke with said that ken has been taken back to the vermont northwest state correctional facility i have tried to reach him there but the officer i spoke to said that they have no ken miller there its possible that he is still en route david bercot time of ken miller sentencing set many people have asked me what time on march   will ken�s hearing occur his hearing for sentencing is set for  pm on march  a number of people have also asked how ken is doing in jail ken is doing very well the lord has blessed his time in jail similarly to his blessing joseph�s time in jail in ancient egypt ken has asked and been granted permission to have a bible study in the jail he has already been able to use his pastoral gifts to minister to various men in the jail ken and the three other men who were processed into the jail at the same time all eat at the same table for their three meals each day the men noticed ken silently praying before he began his meals so one of them men suggested that the four of them stand for prayer before each meal with ken doing the praying so that is what they do now at each mail when i spoke with ken two days ago he said that he was receiving about  letters a day from various brothers and sisters all over even if you have already written ken a letter i encourage you to send him additional letters as these are a source of real encouragement to him david bercot ken miller�s sentencing set for march   judge sessions has set ken�s sentencing for the morning of march   we do not have the exact time yet you are welcome to attend if you are in a position to attend ken�s sentencing on march  i know your presence would mean a lot to him please write to ken it would mean the world to ken to receive letters from his brothers and sisters letting him know that we all stand with him at least until march  his address is ken miller essex county correctional center  stowersville rd p o box  lewis ny  note letters do not have to be handwritten in addition to writing ken why not sending a note of encouragement to ken�s wife linda and his family their address is linda miller  stuarts draft highway waynesboro va  jan   ken miller sent back to jail ken miller appeared before judge sessions today thur jan  in order for the judge to see if ken had changed him mind about testifying ken told the judge that jail has only made his convictions that much stronger ken explained to the judge why he cannot conscientiously testify against a fellow citizen of gods kingdom who was acting in good faith to obey the laws of christ since he was not willing to testify the judge remanded ken back to jail until ken changes his mind or until such time that it is clear that coercion is not going to cause ken to violate his conscience brooks mcarthur and i david bercot both argued before the judge that such a time has already arrived ken could have avoided all of the legal problems and punishments he has faced if he had just testified two years ago if he hasnt changed his mind over these two years he is hardly going to change his mind now ken asked me to relay to his fellow believers that he is totally at peace and he felt that he was the freest man in the courtroom today he would rather be in jail with a conscience that is free and clear before god than to be physically free and have his conscience condemning him saturday january   letter from ken�s wife dear friends i was privileged to speak with ken for a bit on the phone today he is doing well by the grace of god he said he has a fine cell block to stay in a group of men with whom he feels a comradeship his cell mate is a christian and a lot of men in his unit read their bibles hes had good spiritual conversations with some of them he feels your prayers and is very appreciative to all the rest of us also feel the support of your prayers may god richly bless you each one linda miller and family ken miller is imprisoned for refusal to testify on thursday morning january  ken miller was asked to testify in front of a federal grand jury in burlington vt concerning the involvement of any other persons in the lisa miller case ken believes that such testifying would be disloyal to jesus christ therefore he politely refused to testify as a result judge sessions found ken in contempt of court he ordered ken to be imprisoned until such time as ken agrees to testify or until the term of the grand jury expires     more details to follow court of appeals hears grand jury issue on tuesday december  the attorneys for ken miller and for the government argued their positions before the second circuit court of appeals in new york the government is trying to force ken to testify before a grand jury before he is sentenced for his conviction in helping in lisa millers parental kidnapping if ken refuses to testify then the government wants to use that to argue that the district court should give ken a heavier sentence than it would otherwise give from their statements in the proceedings it appears that the second circuit views what the government is trying to do as unconstitutional however the appellate court is giving the government the opportunity to modify its position here is the statement issued by kens attorney josh autry today we had oral arguments before the second circuit court of appeals in new york regarding our petition for extraordinary relief essentially we have asked the second circuit to reverse the district court and to prevent ken millers grand jury deposition prior to his sentencing we argued that forcing him to testify against his will and without an attorney present would violate his constitutional protections to not incriminate himself and to have an attorney although it is impossible to predict how the judges will rule on the motion the judges seemed uncomfortable with the prosecutors position the prosecutor argued that the government can increase ken millers sentence if he exercises his right to silence at the grand jury deposition the judges appeared to make clear that this punishment would violate ken millers constitutional rights grand jury testimony put on hold good news i had just arrived in burlington vermont on the afternoon of november  when i received a phone call informing me that the second circuit court of appeals temporarily stayed the subpoena ordering ken miller to appear before a grand jury on the morning of the th this is only a temporary hold until the second circuit has time to study our motion to dismiss and then to rule on it so ken miller is now back home in virginia waiting until we hear something further david bercot grand jury testimony ken miller is scheduled to appear before a grand jury at  am on thursday november  in burlington vermont the purpose of the hearing is for the government to obtain more information about others if any who may be involved in the lisa miller matter david bercot will be in burlington vermont for the hearing attorneys are not allowed to be present during the actual grand jury testimony however ken will have the right to talk to david and to brooks mcarthur his local attorney at any time during the testimony well update our readers once the grand jury testimony is over presentencing hearing on september   a representative of the federal court in vermont conducted a presentencing hearing with ken miller by video ken along with his attorneys were at the federal court house in harrisburg pa for the video interview matters involving the case were not discussed in the interview rather the court representative asked ken about his health family job education and matters like that no date has been set yet for the sentencing ken miller found guilty wednesday august   from loyal martin our whole family along with several others brothers from ny arrived at burlington court about  am to find a line stretching out the front door and down the sidewalk it took some time to go through the security line and court was already in session till we got through the courtroom on the fifth floor was packed and the marshals and technicians were scurrying to set up audio in an overflow room on the second floor we were placed in the overflow room quite a few were present from va plus many from pa ny vt oh ma me ks tx and im sure other places i later counted over  in the courtroom and at least another  in the overflow room besides a few journalists almost all were anabaptist people janets lawyer was present i understand from others that a brother from stuarts draft ivan swarey gave brief testimony for the defense first thing this morning but the audio was not yet connected in our room so i could not hear it brother ken did not take the witness stand our audio was turned on in time for us to hear the prosecutor begin his closing statements he strung together all the evidence against ken that had been presented emphasizing kens initiatory role in each situation he said lisa needed help to do what she wanted to do and ken provided that help he spoke for almost an hour he said venue was appropriate in vt because that is where ken was arrested and that evidence shows ken thought it was right to help lisa in spite of the law and that his intent was to impede evil court orders he was very specific in emphasizing that they intentionally helped lisa violate existing visitation rights he asked the jurors to return a guilty verdict the closing arguments of the defense lasted about a half hour he emphasized that several witnesses testimonies including the key witness timo agreed that at the time of lisas travel they did not believe they were violating any laws he said you cant intend to violate a law that doesnt exist yet he replayed some clear statements from timos deposition for the jury to hear he did not contest the evidence but said that kens motive was to help a mother who would possibly lose her own biological daughter to a woman who had no connection to her he said lisa had every right to travel when she did and that she travelled legally he emphasized that to return a guilty verdict there must not be a reasonable doubt we dont put people in jail for maybes or possiblys he very kindly instructed the jurors to make sure theyre fair and that its ok not to compromise just to have a unanimous vote he ended by thanking the officials of the state of vt for their kindness during the trial the prosecution gave a final rebuttal reiterating that in their opinion a guilty verdict depended on actual violation more than intent to violate she emphasized that they purchased one way tickets and that there was no change in kens behavior after the custody transfer she said mr miller decided his judgment not the vt court judgment should stand he did it because he felt janet should not have access to isabella she asked the jury to find him guilty as charged after a short break the judge gave a lengthy charge to the jury detailing their responsibilities and giving some specific helpful guidelines for making a judgment he said that if the evidence supports two conclusions you must conclude the defendant is innocent he stated the charge aiding and abetting the removal of a child from the us with the intent to obstruct the lawful excercise of parental rights he asked the jury to give a verdict on two points  is the defendant guilty or innocent as charged  if guilty is venue appropriate in vt he said their decision must be unanimous he appointed a juror named rosanne to be the floor person of the jury and dismissed them judge william sessions then addressed those of us who had attended the court case he expressed that it had been a pleasure for him to watch the way this trial was conducted he said even though it was a long trial attendees were very attentive wellmannered and respectful especially the children were extraordinarily wellmannered and he wanted to express his personal appreciation for the conduct of all of us one of the marshals later said that all of them had respect and sympathy for us lunch was provided for some in the basement of the nearby church and we gathered in the sanctuary to share together in song and prayer the prevailing atmosphere was very yielded beseeching and united soon after  we began to make our way back into the courthouse so we would be through security before the courtroom doors opened at about  court was briefly called into session because the jurors wanted to ask the judge if they could view part of timos deposition again the judge responded that any testimony could only be given once but that if it was really necessary he could perhaps arrange for a portion of the court transcript to be read if both the defense and prosecution approved the portion the jurors asked to be dismissed again at about  court was reconvened with the marshals saying the jury had reached a verdict in a quiet subdued courtroom the verdict was read guilty venue is appropriate in vt the judge asked the defense if they wanted the jury to be polled after an affirmative response each juror was asked by name if they agreed to the verdict they all responded yes one juror was near tears the judge gave  days for the defense to present posttrial motions at which point sentencing will take place ken miller is released on bail until then but was asked to surrender his passport after a sentence is given the case could possibly be appealed we all left the courthouse and gathered across the street raising our voices in song together while the news media took in our response owen yoder of va did an excellent job of directing about  of us as we selected songs and sang together man of sorrows what a name victory in jesus when peace like a river faith of our fathers there is a god he is alive my jesus i love thee when the roll is called up yonder how beautiful heaven must be victory in jesus again i was in sins prison weve got the power in the name of jesus theres power in the blood wonderful story of love sing the wondrous love of jesus kneel at the cross amazing grace rock of ages sing the wondrous love of jesus again the old rugged cross a wonderful savior is jesus my lord i believe in god blest be the tie that binds my faith has found a resting place nothing but the blood theres power in the blood again and some others my heart was very encouraged to be part of the many groups who were being drawn to the lord together by this mutual trial some reporters gathered around ken asking for his response he said we had hoped for a ruling in our favor but we respect the judge and jury and feel like we were treated fairly he said our people will not respond with lobbying and protesting but by gods grace will seek to obey the word of god with quiet suffering he spoke about the changes that are taking place in our society and how it is almost inevitable that these kind of conflicts will increase ken very clearly and simply presented the gospel message that god sent his son jesus christ into this world that he came and dwelt among us carrying the sin of each one of us as he died on the cross whoever believes this and surrenders their life to him in repentance can have their sin taken away and be reconciled to god one day last week while sitting in court i opened my bible at random and read these words but and if ye suffer for righteousness sake happy are ye and be not afraid of their terror neither be troubled but sanctify the lord god in your hearts and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear having a good conscience that whereas they speak evil of you as of evildoers they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in christ for it is better if the will of god be so that ye suffer for well doing than for evil doing for christ also hath once suffered for sins the just for the unjust that he might bring us to god  pet while we do not profess to have fully arrived in our pursuit of understanding and applying gods will in our lives i believe these verses and others call us to be willing to face these kinds of suffering experiences so that gods glory his character on display is made known by our lives and seeking souls are brought to him i would like to note that while the church at stuarts draft has not said much about finances there is a continued need for finances for legal fees esp if the case is appealed more information is available at wwwmillercaseorg trial day two friday august   from loyal martin in yesterdays report i misinformed you that andrew harmon was a journalist for a glbt magazine he is covering the trial for the atlantic which is a mainstream magazine please accept my apologies i apologize as well that this report is late anesha who does so much better at typing than i typed it for me as i dictated from my notes while we travelled home through the adirondack mountains we got so involved in our project that i made a wrong turn we drove about an hour the wrong direction before realizing our mistake had to retrace our path and arrived home at  pm the courtroom today was well filled with over  anabaptist believers plus a few journalists more people arrived from pa and va also a few from vt were again present the prosecution had little visible support before the jury was called in the judge gave direction that janet jenkins anticipated testimony should be kept brief because this case is not seeking to resolve the child custody issues the focus of the trial should remain on the issues of kens alleged crime we then finished watching timos deposition from december timo said that there had been no organized plan but that events simply unfolded as individuals related to the situation timo was crossexamined on the deposition but it was a disadvantage to the prosecution that he was not present today to be crossexamined next andy yoder presently from oh but previously field director for cam in nicaragua gave a very clear and honest testimony he answered questions about cams work in nicaragua about his involvement with the lisa miller case and about evidence that he took  cash to nicaragua for timo he spoke about cams refusal to involve themselves with helping lisa miller testifying that cam was sympathetic to her case but didnt want to jeopardize all their other projects for lisa he stated that he didnt know if helping lisa was illegal but he preferred to follow cams directive since he was working for them he said there was not a lot communication between him and timo about lisa he also said timo believed his actions were legal after this a us marshall from burlington testified that he arrested ken in burlington this testimony was necessary because the prosecution is seeking to validate the trial taking place in burlington rather than va under crossexamination he also testified that ken came to burlington voluntarily to be arrested and said he was not aware that ken had committed any crimes in vt janet jenkins was then called as a witness she stated that by occupation she is a licensed child care provider and gave testimony about her and lisas relationship and their plan to have a family she said they planned for isabella to be born in vt but she was born prematurely in va efforts to have a second child ended in a miscarriage under cross examination she acknowledged that initially after their separation lisa had allowed regular visits with isabella and that those visits continued for a time even after the custody case was in court she became somewhat emotional when referring to the lack of visits with isabella after her testimony janet stayed in the courtroom until lunch break but was not present in the afternoon court sessions doug wright pastor of keystone baptist church in va testified that lisa and her brother chris had been members of their church that isabella attended preschool there and that they took care of isabella while lisa was working as a teacher he testified that chris left va to go to seminary in sept  and shortly after that he received a call from lisa he met them in a walmart parking lot because she and isabella wanted to say goodbye to him he said lisa was not wearing mennonite clothes at the time he also gave testimony about a phone call from ken miller on nov   in which he agreed to arrange helpers to clear out lisas vacant house and provide money to pay the rent that was due in the afternoon a banker gave testimony about understanding check records and verifying bank transactions elaine cooper timos motherinlaw was called to give testimony about timos use of her credit card she said timo did not have a credit card and would occasionally use hers with permission and later reimburse her she verified granting permission for timo to use her credit card to purchase airline tickets in sept  and also verified receiving two money orders from an unknown source as reimbursement a us postal investigator gave testimony to help jurors understand the function of money orders and verified details of the  money orders on record he said they were purchased in stuarts draft va at this point the jury was dismissed temporarily so the judge could make some rulings about how the case should proceed from here im not sure i fully understand all the issues they discussed but will give what understanding i have the defense asked the judge to acquit ken on the basis that some testimony had given evidence that there was not a definite intent to break the law the judge agreed that such testimony had been given but said that other testimony had been given as well and the jury should make the decision the judge also declined to rule on the issue of whether venue is appropriate in vt but said he would raise the issue to the jury for a decision for legal reasons i do not fully understand the prosecution was asking the judge to prohibit the defense from calling witnesses to give testimony about kens character the judge overruled this and said the law allows and even supports some character witnesses in a case like this but that they should seek to avoid linking it with religious issues the judge denied introducing timos cooperation agreement into the case he said he would review information timo gave to the grand jury and rule later about whether it could be introduced after the jury returned to the room the defense called linda rose miller of golden rule travel to witness again she testified that she knew ken well that he was humble honest and lawabiding that he was honest about his shortcomings and a man of integrity she said her testimony was based on conversations with him and observations of his life ivan beachy of free union va bishop and secretarytreasurer of ama gave testimony that he had known ken for  yrs he said on a scale of  to  ken was a  or  in closeness to him he said ken was absolutely a man of character unpretentious and very authentic and that he was honest and trustworthy what you see is what you get was his description of ken he said his knowledge came from meeting ken and hearing him teach at ministers meetings and from associating in church work and church social gatherings on a frequent basis my understanding is that there are perhaps no other witnesses to be called by the defense but i could be wrong about this mr autry kens lawyer said he would give the judge an answer on monday even though there is no court on monday about whether ken will take the witness stand in his own defense please pray about this decision mr autry also told us that the trial could well be finished on tuesday or wednesday i was getting numerous requests to please try to report on the trial next week perhaps i can arrange that  tim i exhort therefore that first of all supplications prayers intercessions and giving of thanks be made for all men for kings and for all that are in authority that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty for this is good and acceptable in the sight of god our saviour who will have all men to be saved and to come unto the knowledge of the truth trial day two thursday august   from wwwmillercaseorg there were approximately sixty people present for the trial today the security invited us to sit on either side of the court room as there was not enough room on our side the court opened at  am the judge inquired as to whether any jury member had heard of or spoken to anyone of the case one juror had something to tell the judge the judge called for a brief recess with the lawyers and jurors yesterday one juror was disqualified leaving one juror as a backup the juror this morning was also disqualified leaving no reserve the judge admonished the jurors of their responsibility in maintaining absolute reserve regarding the case the prosecution continued with witnesses by google and ntelos regarding phone calls made enroute to niagara ny a statement prepared by rebecca zodhiatis terry miller lisas father mary jones of bee line transport in regard to the towing of lisas car in virginia linda rose miller golden rule travel in regard to the sale of airline tickets a statement prepared by marvin mast golden rule travel regarding some latenight phone calls gary hubbard of google involving record keeping practices for emails patrick   a linguistic expert in pennsylvania german to describe translation of certain emails and finished with a video deposition by timo miller this was not finished this evening and will be finished tomorrow we want to especially give recognition to linda rose miller for her part on the witness stand it was not easy for her she most certainly credits the grace of god on her behalf and the prayers of all of her brothers and sisters in christ it may be that she will be called to the stand again tomorrow we ask that you do not try to contact her with any questions or information about the case until she is released from her testimony duties keep her in your prayers especially considering that her father just came through a cancer surgery and she cannot be there with him many of our readers would have found the pennsylvania german dutch linguistic expert quite interesting he is a gentleman associated with a pennsylvania german historical society in pennsylvania he described his work of translating old pennsylvania german letters into english and spoke of the various nuances he encounters in his work in the course of his crossexamination patrick made reference to grundsaugh dauk groundhogs day has anyone ever seen a high profile federal court in stitches of laughter the vermonters knew nothing of the origins of groundhog day feb  especially when patrick related of the eight foot tall groundhog mascot for a males only groundhog society the court went into hysterics i thought the one juror lady would be struck out from laughing so hard ms cawley the crossexamining prosecutor was over come with laughing the judge couldnt contain himself as well as the other lawyers kens vermont lawyer was wiping tears and wiping his nose the judge suggested they may need a recess to get this thing straightened out they finally got their act together and dismissed the pennsylvania german groundhog society member god has been answering prayers some quite specifically pray especially for bro ken and his family sister linda rose several others of our brothers who may be called upon to testify pray for the prosecution and the defense lawyers as the spirit of god lays it on your hearts day one furnished by loyal martin date wed  aug  we arrived at court about  this morning in time to hear the opening statements from the prosecution and the defense throughout the day the prosecution brought  witnesses which gave testimony a social worker from vt a canadian border agent a brother from ont who was subpeoned a lady from thomas road baptist church in lynchburg also subpeoned she was crying afterward because she couldnt bear it that she had to testify for the prosecution and a lady from verizon wireless the brother from ontario gave a very loving but clear reason for why he participated and what the bible says about immoral lifestyles and about us helping people to find gods way the atmosphere was calm i counted  believers from about  different churches in vt va ny pa and ont during the morning session and in the afternoon it swelled to near  spilling over onto the side where the prosecutions support was janet jenkins was not there only about  people on the other side  a few were reporters this number dropped to around  in the afternoon i was told that a daily report will be available on wwwmillercaseorg and that monroe chupp from va is working to coordinate groups who would like to come the number of folk who are here may drop a little the first part of next week unless more brethren decide to come although i heard a commitment from the churches in vt that they will do what they can to keep that from happening court was dismissed a little early at about  with the prosecution saying they hope to finish with their witnesses maybe by friday noon after which the defense will bring their witnesses timos account will be given thursday on prerecorded video he is not required to come in person because of an imminent childbirth at homethere is no court on monday i came away with a greater burden for the need to pray for all that are in authority that we may be able to lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty and with a greater awareness of the chaos that results when a society functions with less and less of the fear of god i was impressed with the thoughtful and understanding way the elderly judge deliberated at the trial a church has been made available about a block from the court for meeting at lunchtime to pray together and this evening we had a very refreshing time together with about  of us at a park along the lake singing praying and sharing while we had our time together another group of mostly younger people marched through the park with placards chanting disarm the police for justice and for peace may our gaze be upon the one who loves us and washes us from our sins with his own blood as we find our place living for him in this society trial day two august   from wwwmillercaseorg reminder today is the day of fasting and prayer for this case approximately  people were in attendance to support ken along with a handful of reporters ken and supporters seated on the right news and prosecution seated on the left the clerk opened the court addressing the united states vs kenneth miller the judge addressed the jury stating the case and presenting the normal processes of the courts the judge told the jury  the case will be decided upon evidence testimonies admission of evidence  both sides will have opportunity to present evidence  if kens side gives evidence the government will have opportunity to give a rebuttal  after the rebuttal the evidence is closed  once arguments are completed the charge is given to consider the evidence there is nothing about the judges view of the evidence  define the charge that is given  when the charge is given it is in your hands remember  ken is presumed to be innocent  they need proof beyond reasonable doubt  the defendant is not required to testify the judge stressed that it is not about what you believe about same sex amish or vas position on same sex marriages the prosecution began examining witnesses in the forenoon they called the following witnesses today witnesses  tara levine legal guardian of isabella  went over many documents of earlier court proceedings to show that lisa was unwilling to cooperate with court sanctioned visitation rights with janet jenkins rebuttal by mr autry  points out documents showing a ruling by the state of va that lisa is the sole parent of isabella  showed that janet showed no interest in establishing a relationship with isabella other than by litigation  burden of proof in establishing parentage was a big topic ms grainger  intelligence officer from canada  explained records of lisas crossing into canada by taxi ervin horst  ontario canada pastor farmer  called to testify how he was called by ken to pick up lisa and take her to the airport  spoke of conversation with a philip janet stasulli  an acquaintance from lynchburg spoke of her contacts up to the time of lisas disappearance the defense did not get much from her verizon wireless  explained how the cell phone system works reviewed some of kens phone calls judge had discussion with the lawyers about timos evidence he knows that the prosecution feels it will be detrimental to their case if his deposition is read in court he asks that it would be read because it is helpful to the case closed at  missions    dvd documentaries     nook books     david bercot     about us     report errors   peter hoover newsletters     the witness
