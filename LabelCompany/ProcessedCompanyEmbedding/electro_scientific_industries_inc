to drill cut trim ablate and test and mark features for the functionality of the component the micromachining segment includes products that are sold to manufacturers of end devices across various industries and are used to drill cut or mark features on a range of materials generally on the casing or external surface of the end device the companys integrated solutions allow industrial designers and process engineers to control the power of laser light to transform materials the company has operations and subsidiaries in asia europe and north americalaser microfabrication consists of a set of precise micronlevel processes including drilling scribing dicing singulation cutting ablating trimming and precision marking on multiple types of materials its laserbased systems are utilized in the production of consumer electronics printed circuit boards pcbs semiconductor devices semiconductor packaging electronic sensors touchpanel glass flat panel liquid crystal displays lcds and other components and devices additionally it produces test and inspection equipment for quality control process during the production of multilayer ceramic capacitors mlccsthe companys core competencies enable it to design manufacture and market a range of integrated laserbased solutions for microfabrication applications its customers manufacture components interconnectpackaging devices semiconductors displays or other parts that serve a range of electronic applications its systems enable the manufacturing of these components and devices the primary endmarket applications for its customers are consumer electronics including smart mobile devices such as smart phones and tablets computers and semiconductors these devices and applications are also utilized in a range of other industries including automotive aerospace medical security and general lightingcomponent processingthe companys laser systems for interconnect products address applications and materials on a set of substrates panels and continuousfeed reels for the pcb packaging and display industries the companys lasers via drilling systems target electrical interconnect applications that require the accuracy

effective october   annexation fightedit in  esi joined columbia sportswear tektronix and other washington county companies in an effort led by nike to convince the state legislature to prohibit the practice of forcible annexation of islands of unincorporated land that have become surrounded by a city the nike effort stemmed from an aggressive annexation policy being practiced by the city of

sunset highway freeway although the headquarters of esi and columbia are not on islands surrounded by beaverton both directly abut the city boundary and company officials were concerned about the likely eventual effect of the citys annexation practices should future annexations cause their properties to become part of such an island the  oregon legislature enacted a law prohibiting beaverton from any forced islandtype annexations for two years and additionally included language effectively banning beaverton from forcibly annexing any of electro scientific industries property—whether an island or not—for at least  years operationsedit esi manufactures a variety of laserbased processing and micromanufacturing solutions designed to help manufacturers optimize their production
