mountain of debt dorothy and thom williams husbandandwife owners of benner street restaurant in bethlehem pa were unsure if they would see their retirement if the dire situation at their business didn’t improve they looked to robert irvine and his restaurant impossible team to give their eatery the second chance it deserves and when robert arrived he soon realized the root of benner street’s problems its bickering owners to start plus its drab interior and poorly stocked bar with just two days to work and a budget of  robert helped dorothy and thom learn how to effectively manage a staff while he overhauled the restaurant’s design and revamped its menu fn dish checked in with dorothy a few months after benner street’s reopening to find out how her business is doing today “business is up  percent” dorothy says “all the employees and family are excited about our new beginning and all are working toward our success” in terms of the transformed interior dorothy tells fn dish “people are enjoying the new decor” the benner street menu is now a mix of robert’s offerings and “some of the old favorites” from before the remodeling according to dorothy this update came as a result of longtime customers missing particular dishes dorothy now says “i do delegate a lot more but i still expect perfection” she admits she and thom still argue but she insists “arguing is part of our life — that doesn’t mean we don’t love each other” thom’s health has not improved since the show and dorothy tells us “he has taken some time away from work” like robert suggested looking back on her restaurant impossible journey dorothy explains “this experience was one of the hardest things we ever experienced as … business owners and for our family” but she advises fellow restaurateurs who may
