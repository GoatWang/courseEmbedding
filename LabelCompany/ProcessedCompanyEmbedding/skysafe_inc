red hat continues cloud transformation with new openstack and cloud platform suite products skysafe a sixmonthold san diego cabased company whose technology can disable drones that are flying where they shouldn’t has raised  million in seed funding andreessen horowitz led the round with participation from founder collective sv angel and boxgroup no doubt the company is serving a fastgrowing need particularly given the number of drones poised to wreak havoc on public spaces from sports arenas to airports consider the british airways flight that was hit by a commercial drone as it approached heathrow airport on sunday or the world cup skier nearly done in by a falling drone in december the faa estimates there will be  million drones sold in the  us alone just this year “we’re very excited about a future where drones are used by consumers and businesses for all sorts of purposes but to get there drones need to be made extremely reliable and safe” says venture capitalist chris dixon who led the deal for andreessen horowitz dixon suggests skysafe will ensure that drones don’t go rogue largely via radio waves which it uses to override a drone’s remote and take control of the aircraft perhaps so what skysafe is building certainly sounds less menacing than some of the other options to emerge recently including an antidrone laser and an antidrone rifle unfortunately for competitive reasons the sixperson company isn’t willing to dive much more deeply into how its tech works as we learned when we talked yesterday with cofounder and ceo grant jordan our chat has been edited for length tc skysafe has four founders what’s your background and how did you come together gj i graduated from mit then spent four years as an officer in the air force research lab testing antidrone tech where i got a lot of exposure to various ways that different groups have come up with for taking down small drones after i finished my time there i went to grad school at uscd for computer security and i connected with my cofounders for a security company consulting firm that we founded called somerset recon between that security work and my drone work we saw a growing threat in the drone space tc what types of customers will you be trying to persuade to use skysafe gj pretty much the entire space of public safety airports prisons stadiums other event venues border protection critical infrastructure the number of places that have seen incidents in the past year has grown tremendously tc would you characterize most of those incidents as accidents or otherwise gj in the aviation industry at airports those look like accidents but in prisons there are no accidents those are drones that are trying to smuggle in weapons drugs and other contraband i wouldn’t classify what we’ve seen in stadiums as accidents either drone operators might not mean any harm but they’re going out of their way to fly into an area they aren’t supposed to be and right now there’s nothing an event venue can do about it tc are they buying what you’re selling gj we’re still pretty early we’re working to grow out our base of pilot customers now with an eye toward launching in the fourth quarter of this year in the meantime we’re working on test installations with partners in multiple industries tc what kind of early feedback are you receiving has anything caught you off guard gj how much of an appetite there is for this sort of capability in the industry a lot of these potential customers have been looking for a solution for some time and coming up emptyhanded tc there are other technologies that can disable drones why is your product better gj there are lasers there are netbased solutions that are shot out of cannons the one doesn’t have capacity to handle what customers are looking for hitting something with a net is hard the other is a more weaponized sort of thing and i don’t think we’re going to see airports becoming authorized to plant giant laser death rays at the ends of their runways tc you say your system doesn’t just jam the airwaves gj it can mitigate malicious drones but it’s a surgical solution it’s not a jamming solution that will knock out other drones and wifi and other things tc how does it work exactly gj we’re basically building a perimeter with nodes and monitoring facilities for activity so we monitor airwaves for signals that drones use — identifying them by their signature so we know which are whitelisted and which aren’t — then we can alert our customer when drones are detected that aren’t supposed to there so that the operator can take action to safely take over the drone tc can you drill down a layer also can a truly malicious operator override your override gj we don’t go into real detail about our tech but it’s relatively unique in that it’s about mitigation not just detection we take complete control of the drone it sees us as the legitimate controller as for blocking our technology not really certainly there’s a lot of complexity involved but we’re bringing tools to take action on all fronts whereas now these venues have nothing tc what’s the farthest away a drone can be and still be disabled gj it depends there’s a pretty wide range of types of drones and protocols and radio specifications for the most part we detect them at the same ranges that the system itself has in terms of its maximumminimum range but we’re bound by the same laws of physics httpsplayervimeocomvideo  shares advertisement advertisement newsletter subscriptions the daily crunch get the top tech stories of
