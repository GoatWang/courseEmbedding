than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples

data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be

reporting of our financial information determined under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap with certain nongaap financial measures these nongaap financial measures exclude certain significant items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to results from our ongoing business operations we believe that these nongaap measures may be useful for periodoverperiod comparisons of underlying business trends and our ongoing business performance however they should be used in conjunction with gaap measures our nongaap measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related gaap measures and other companies may define similarly named measures differently we encourage investors to review our financial statements and publiclyfiled reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure we utilize the following definitions for the nongaap financial measures included in this release adjusted income from continuing operations and adjusted diluted earnings per shareadjusted income from continuing operations and adjusted diluted earnings per share both exclude special charges net of income taxes and a significant multiyear income tax settlement we consider items recorded in special charges net of income taxes such as enterprisewide restructuring to be of a nonrecurring nature that is not indicative of ongoing operations in addition the income tax settlement is not considered to be indicative of ongoing operations since it represents a significant onetime favorable settlement of our  to  tax years manufacturing cash flow before pension contributionsmanufacturing cash flow before pension contributions adjusts net cash from operating activities of continuing operations gaap for the following excludes dividends received from textron financial corporation tfc and capital contributions to tfc provided under the support agreement and debt agreements as these cash flows are not representative of manufacturing operations deducts capital expenditures and includes proceeds from the sale of property plant and equipment to arrive at the net capital investment required to support ongoing manufacturing operations adds back pension contributions as we consider our pension obligations to be debtlike liabilities additionally these contributions can fluctuate significantly from period to period and we believe that they are not representative of cash used by our manufacturing operations during the period while we believe this measure provides a focus on cash generated from manufacturing operations before pension contributions and may be used as an additional relevant measure of liquidity it does not necessarily provide the amount available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain nondiscretionary obligations that are not deducted from the measure   income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share eps gaap to nongaap reconciliations
