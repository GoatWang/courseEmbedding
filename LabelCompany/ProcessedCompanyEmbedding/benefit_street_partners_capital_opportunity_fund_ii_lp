described by section ac of the act fund ii affiliated adviser serves as investment adviser to fund ii and strategic funding bsp adviser serves as investment adviser to bsp bdc providence flexible

serves as investment adviser to griffin bsp in addition bsp adviser serves as subadviser to griffin bsp applicants state that gba and bsp adviser are not affiliated persons as defined by the act  applicants seek an order “order” to permit one or more regulated funds  andor one or more affiliated funds  to participate in the same investment opportunities through a proposed coinvestment program the “coinvestment program” where such participation would otherwise be prohibited under section a and rule d by a coinvesting with each other in securities issued by issuers in private placement transactions in which an adviser negotiates terms in addition to price  and b making additional investments in securities of such issuers including through the exercise of warrants conversion privileges and other rights to purchase securities of the issuers “followon investments” “coinvestment transaction” means any transaction in which a regulated fund or its whollyowned investment sub as defined below participated together with one or more other regulated funds andor one or more affiliated funds in reliance on the requested order “potential coinvestment transaction” means any investment opportunity in which a regulated fund or its whollyowned investment sub could not participate together with one or more affiliated funds andor one or more other regulated funds without obtaining and relying on the order  applicants state that a regulated fund may from time to time form a whollyowned investment sub such a subsidiary would be prohibited from investing in a coinvestment transaction with any affiliated fund or regulated fund because it would be a company controlled by its parent regulated fund for purposes of section a and rule d applicants request that each whollyowned investment sub be permitted to participate in coinvestment transactions in lieu of its parent regulated fund and that the whollyowned investment subs participation in any such transaction be treated for purposes of the requested order as though the parent regulated fund were participating directly applicants represent that this treatment is justified because a whollyowned investment sub would have no purpose other than serving as a holding vehicle for the regulated funds investments and therefore no conflicts of interest could arise between the regulated fund and the whollyowned investment sub the regulated funds board would make all relevant determinations under the conditions with regard to a whollyowned investment subs participation in a coinvestment transaction and the regulated funds board would be informed of and take into consideration any proposed use of a whollyowned investment sub in the regulated funds place if the regulated fund proposes to participate in the same coinvestment transaction with any of its whollyowned investment subs the board will also be informed of and take into consideration the relative participation of the regulated fund and the whollyowned investment sub  when considering potential coinvestment transactions for any regulated fund the adviser or start printed page advisers if there are more than one will consider only the objectives and strategies investment policies investment positions capital available for investment and other pertinent factors applicable to that regulated fund the advisers expect that any portfolio company that is an appropriate investment for a regulated fund should also be an appropriate investment for one or more other regulated funds andor one or more affiliated funds with certain exceptions based on available capital or diversification the regulated funds however will not be obligated to invest or coinvest when investment opportunities are referred to them  applicants state that gba will be investment adviser to griffin bsp while bsp adviser will be subadviser applicants represent that although bsp adviser will identify and recommend investments for griffin bsp gba will have ultimate authority to approve or reject the investments proposed by bsp adviser subject to the oversight of griffinbsps board applicants further represent that each of bsp adviser and gba has adopted allocation policies and procedures which are designed to allocate investment opportunities fairly and equitably among their clients over time applicants state that in the case of a potential coinvestment transaction bsp adviser will apply its allocation policies and procedures in determining the proposed allocation for griffin bsp consistent with the requirements of condition a applicants further submit that if gba approves the investment for griffin bsp the investment and all relevant allocation information would then be presented to griffin bsps board for its approval in accordance with the conditions to the application applicants state that they believe the investment process between bsp adviser and gba prior to seeking approval from griffin bsps board which is in addition to rather than in lieu of the procedures required under the conditions of the application is significant and provides for additional procedures and processes to ensure that griffin bsp is being treated fairly in respect of potential coinvestment transactions  other than pro rata dispositions and followon investments as provided in conditions  and  and after making the determinations required in conditions  and a the applicable advisers will present each potential coinvestment transaction and the proposed allocation to the directors of the board eligible to vote under section o of the act “eligible directors” and the “required majority” as defined in section o of the act “required majority”  will approve each coinvestment transaction prior to any investment by the participating regulated fund  with respect to the pro rata dispositions and followon investments provided in conditions  and  a regulated fund may participate in a pro rata disposition or followon investment without obtaining prior approval of the required majority if among other things i the proposed participation of each regulated fund and affiliated fund in such disposition is proportionate to its outstanding investments in the issuer immediately preceding the disposition or followon investment as the case may be and ii the board of the regulated fund has approved that regulated funds participation in pro rata dispositions and followon investments as being in the best interests of the regulated fund if the board does not so approve any such disposition or followon investment will be submitted to the regulated funds eligible directors the board of any regulated fund may at any time rescind suspend or qualify its approval of pro rata dispositions and followon investments with the result that all dispositions andor followon investments must be submitted to the eligible directors  no noninterested director of a regulated fund will have a financial interest in any coinvestment transaction other than indirectly through share ownership in one of the regulated funds  under condition  if the providence advisers the principals or any person controlling controlled by or under common control with the providence advisers or the principals and the affiliated funds collectively the “holders” own in the aggregate more than  of the outstanding voting securities of a regulated fund “shares” then the holders will vote such shares as directed by an independent third party when voting on matters specified in the condition applicants believe that this condition will ensure that the noninterested directors will act independently in evaluating the coinvestment program because the ability of the providence advisers or the principals to influence the independent directors by a suggestion explicit or implied that the noninterested directors can be removed will be limited significantly applicants represent that the noninterested directors will evaluate and approve any such voting trust or proxy adviser taking into accounts its qualifications reputation for independence cost to the shareholders and other factors that they deem relevant applicants legal analysis  section d of the act and rule d under the act prohibit participation by a registered investment company and an affiliated person in any “joint enterprise or other joint arrangement or profitsharing plan” as defined in the rule without prior approval by the commission by order upon application section d of the act and rule d under the act are applicable to regulated funds that are registered closedend investment companies similarly with regard to bdcs section a of the act generally prohibits certain persons specified in section b from participating in joint

companys participation in the joint transaction is consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the act and the extent to which such participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants  under section b of the act any person who is directly or indirectly controlling controlled by or under common control with a bdc is subject to section a applicants submit that each of the affiliated funds and the regulated funds excluding griffin bsp could be deemed to be a person related to each other regulated fund excluding griffin bsp in a manner described by section b by virtue of being under common control in addition section b applies to any investment adviser to a regulated fund including subadvisers applicants submit that bsp adviser in its role as subadviser to griffin bsp could be deemed to be a person related to griffin bsp in a manner described in section start printed page b therefore bsp adviser and any control affiliate of bsp adviser such as the regulated funds and the affiliated funds could be prohibited from participating in the coinvestment program with griffin bsp by section a and rule d  applicants state that in the absence of the requested relief in some circumstances the regulated funds would be limited in their ability to participate in attractive and appropriate investment opportunities applicants believe that the proposed terms and conditions of the application will ensure that the coinvestment transactions are consistent with the protection of each regulated funds shareholders and with the purposes intended by the policies and provisions of the act applicants state that the regulated funds participation in the coinvestment transactions will be consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the act and would be done in a manner that is not different from or less advantageous than that of other participants applicants conditions applicants agree that the order will be subject to the following conditions  each time a providence adviser considers a potential coinvestment transaction for an affiliated fund or another regulated fund that falls within a regulated funds thencurrent

fund with information concerning each participating partys net asset value to assist the eligible directors with their review of the regulated funds investments for compliance with these allocation procedures c after making the determinations required in conditions  and a the adviser to the regulated fund or advisers if there are more than one will distribute written information concerning the potential coinvestment transaction including the amount proposed to be invested by each participating regulated fund and affiliated fund to the eligible directors of each participating regulated fund for their consideration a regulated fund will coinvest with one or more other regulated funds andor one or more affiliated funds only if prior to the regulated funds participation in the potential coinvestment transaction a required majority concludes that i the terms of the potential coinvestment transaction including the consideration to be paid are reasonable and fair to the regulated fund and its shareholders and do not involve overreaching in respect of the regulated fund or its shareholders on the part of any person concerned ii the potential coinvestment transaction is consistent with a the interests of the shareholders of the regulated fund and b the regulated funds thencurrent objectives and strategies iii the investment by any other regulated funds or any affiliated funds
