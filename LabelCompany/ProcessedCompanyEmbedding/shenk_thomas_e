awards cytomegaloviruses are members of the herpes virus family human cytomegalovirus hcmv infections are widespread and subclinical in the vast majority of cases but the virus exhibits increased virulence in the very young and old and in immunocompromised individuals congenital infections cause lifelong disabilities in a significant number of children transplant recipients cancer patients and aids patients all of whom can exhibit decreased immune function suffer a variety of clinical manifestations resulting from cytomegalovirus infection including mononucleosis and pneumonia there are also suggestions in the literature that hcmv might serve as a cofactor in certain cancers atherosclerosis and immune senescence the hcmv particle carries a viral genome comprised of linear doublestranded dna that encodes more than  proteins  micrornas and a variety of additional noncoding rnas we study molecular mechanisms underlying hcmv replication and pathogenesiswhen the virus infects a fibroblast epithelial cell or endothelial cell it actively replicates and generates infectious progeny we have studied the hcmv life cycle by using a mixture of genetic biochemical proteomic and metabolomic approaches one area of special interest to us has been the identification of mechanisms by which the virus blocks defensive responses of the host cell an area where the hcmv pul protein plays a major role we constructed a mutant virus unable to express pul and found that it failed to efficiently express all viral genes tested and infected cells died of apoptosis before the viral replication cycle was completed using proteomic technology we discovered that pul binds to the cellular tuberous sclerosis protein complex tsc this is a tumor suppressor complex that interprets stress signals and modulates the activity of mtor which in turn controls translation fatty acid synthesis and many other vital processes in the cell the pul protein blocks the ability of tsc to respond to upstream signals allowing the virus to continue to utilize cellular biosynthetic systems in spite of inducing a strong stress response we have further probed the hcmvhost cell interaction by studying how metabolism is altered by infection this work has revealed that hcmv induces glycolysis nucleotide synthesis citric acid cycle flux and lipid biosynthesis inhibition of the committed step of fatty acid synthesis and elongation acetylcoa carboxylase blocks hcmv replication so we performed an sirna screen and identified a substantial number of enzymes that sponsor fatty acid and lipid biosynthesis and are needed for successful virus replication we are now working to elucidate how these enzymes are regulated and one approach we have employed is to knock down each of the cellcoded kinases and test how the loss of function influences hcmv replication this approach has identified several kinases that modulate the cell metabolome following infection most recently we discovered that each of the seven human sirtuins is an hcmv restriction factor sirtuins are naddependent protein deacetylases and we have begun to identify cellular targets of sirtuins that are critical for their antiviral activitywhen hcmv infects a bone marrow stem cell or a monocyte it doesnt replicate rather it enters a state of quiescence termed latency we have developed and validated two cell culture models for latency using these models we have discovered that the virus transiently expresses a large number of viral products after infecting these cells but after several days the viral genome becomes quiescent a small number of viral proteins that continue to be expressed including pul a protein whose role in latency was first identified in our latency models others have shown that it controls the expression of at least one cell surface protein and we are now following this clue by characterizing the cell surface proteome of uninfected monocytes as compared to monocytes harbouring latent hcmv our early results show that they are remarkably different levin jm holtzman sh maraganore j hastings pj cohen r dahiyat b et al us immigration order strikes against biotech nat

  abstract human cytomegalovirus is the prototypical member of the betaherpes virus family epidemiological studies have shown that human cytomegalovirus infection is widespread in healthy individuals infection is generally asymptomatic but the virus can cause serious disease in people with immature or compromised immune systems it is the leading infectious disease cause of birth defects and a lifethreatening adventitious agent in transplant recipients the longterm objective of this research program is to elucidate the function of human cytomegalovirus genes that regulate the interaction of the virus with its host cell and thereby control viral replication and pathogenesis this proposal is designed to contribute to the understanding of several of the g proteincoupled receptors encoded by hcmv one of the receptors to be studied is the product of the us gene preliminary studies have shown that a mutant human cytomegalovirus lacking the us coding region exhibits an accelerated pattern of gene expression after infection of g fibroblasts early and late mrnas accumulate long before they are detected in wildtype virusinfected fibroblasts in the absence of the us receptor the timedependent cascade of immediateearly early and late gene expression observed in wildtype virus infections is disrupted the first specific aim seeks to characterize the effects of hcmvcoded pus on the transcriptional cascade within multiple infected cell types and explore the mechanism of pus action the second g proteincoupled receptor to be studied is the product of the ul gene the murine cytomegalovirus homologue of this gene is packaged into virions and after the receptor is delivered to cells by fusion of the virion envelope with the plasma membrane it facilitates activation of the viral m immediateearly gene in the second specific aim human cytomegalovirus mutants that do not express the ul product will be characterized in multiple cell types to explore the function of that receptor this project will include analysis of a laboratory strain ad and two clinical isolates vr fix and ph of human cytomegalovirus viral replication will be studied in fibroblasts the cell commonly used to propagate hcmv aortic endothelial and smooth muscle cells which are relevant to the possible role of hcmv in atherosclerosis retinal pigmented epithelial cells which are infected in
