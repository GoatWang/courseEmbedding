bahama would be among the designers participating “in the fashion world the brand is considered lowbrow” sughrue says “but they were credit and the lenders could understand it” fashion institute gallery or fig opened in  and has since expanded four times with the showroom utilized only about five weeks a year for fashion markets brook partners began looking at other event opportunities the wideopen finished space in the center of the arts district soon got bookings for everything from bar mitzvahs to super bowl parties today the events operation on its own is a multimilliondollar operation  ross also hosts the dallas art fair a labor of love sughrue launched with esteemed art consultant chris byrne in  as fig began to flourish  ross also began attracting more traditional office tenants including amegy bank landscape firm mesa usa and beck sughrue tapped mesa to develop a park off the building’s west side which honors beck’s late founder henry c beck jr during an event at beck park dallas caterer wendy krispin looked up and asked sughrue what he was going to do with the property’s streetlevel space as it happened one of her restaurant friends was looking for a spot in the arts district “can you rip off the front of the building” she asked the chef was stephan pyles “like the fashion business we had no intention of getting into the restaurant business” says sughrue “i also have no thought in my mind of getting into the broadway business but if andrew lloyd webber shows up i’m going to think about it” the lenders were convinced to do the deal—after the acclaimed chef cooked dinner for them—and stephan pyles the restaurant opened in  the onceempty  ross was now  percent occupied and in a perfect position to sell ray hunt whose hunt oil home base sits just north of the building snapped it up giving him control of the block from woodall to ross  sughrue formed an enterprise to take ownership of the fashion gallery between fig and his brook partners office he leased a total of  square feet going from the building’s landlord to its largest tenant the project ended up generating about a  percent return—and exemplifies the creative dealmaking and urban renewal efforts for which sughrue has become known “this building has been a wild ride but it’s pretty indicative of our capabilities our interests our passions and our conviction in downtown dallas” sughrue says “i sometimes joke that we probably could have made a lot more money building strip centers in flower mound but that’s not how we’re wired” from boston to dallassughrue grew up in braintree mass “pretty much the boston version of mayberry rfd” he says he attended harvard university thanks to solid grades and a generous financial aid package then like many of his peers headed to wall street he worked in real estate lending for chemical bank then in merrill lynch’s capital markets group in  one of his banking clients a wealthy italian family asked him to move to dallas the north texas real estate market was depressed at the time and there were bargains to be had operating as sci real estate development the firm made a flurry of acquisitions then reached its limit but sughrue kept seeing deals he got approval to begin investing on his own behalf and soon was able to launch his own firm partnering with robert petrucello sughrue bought petrucello out of the business a number of years ago although the friends remain partners in various deals burgin joined brook partners in  he had served as architect for several of the company’s projects in the west end but it was the magnolia that in  lured burgin away from corgan where he’d worked for  years at the time he was overseeing a team of  architects he missed having more handson design involvement and also wanted to tap into his entrepreneurial nature “the opportunity presented itself to partner with mark cuban and roll out a new movie theater chain” burgin says the plan was to do about  theaters and marry it to magnolia pictures an independent film company led by eamonn bowles and bill banowsky who had approached sughrue about getting involved the team built four theaters before cuban bought landmark theatres—and things changed “he was our shareholder and became our biggest competitor” sughrue says “mark thought it would be a good idea if the two companies merged and all of the gadfly investors lyle and me included go away he handled it very well i applaud him he didn’t overpay—but he didn’t take advantage of the situation either” tower playthe real showstopper among brook partners’ projects is museum tower a story glassencased  million condominium project under construction in the arts district designed by los angeles architect scott johnson it will include between  and  luxury units ranging in size from  square feet to more than  square feet brook partners and codeveloper turtle creek holdings led by dan boeckman and greg greene began working on the project nearly  years ago  it’s slated for completion in —not quite the timetable the developers originally had in mind “we thought we knew it all and that we’d have a building up in five years mr nasher told us it would be at least ” says sughrue referring to the late raymond nasher whose renowned nasher sculpture center sits immediately west of the condo tower when predevelopment work began nasher made his opinions known about the project “he didn’t pull any punches he damn sure didn’t want anything mediocre on the site” sughrue says and that was in line with the developers’ goals “from the moment we got involved we knew we controlled an important site” sughrue says “the original partners are all dallasites we wanted to make sure that what was built was not just a commercial success but a civic success as well” construction of museum tower finally kicked off in mid to move the project forward the developers gave up their equity stake the  million tower is  percent owned by the dallas police  fire pension system sughrue says it’s surreal to see the project take shape after so many years of looking at renderings model units will be available at the end of  and sales are under way to date brook partners has been involved in  billion in developments and  billion in investments it also oversees a  billion advisory assignment late last year former crescent executive paul smith joined the firm to lead the advisory group and gary sherman who once served as a lender’s representative for  ross was tapped to manage principal investments and brook partners’ new york office “i don’t think i ever intended to stay in dallas but the longer i did the more i realized i enjoyed contributing to citybuilding” sughrue says “we have been remarkably fortunate to play a part along with so many others in recreating a city’s centerthat dallas has so transformed itself over the last  years is a tribute to the talent and commitment and passion of dallasites twenty years from now dallas is going to be a

were not able to leave germany before october  in december  we asked our prior attorney to apply for the extension of the visa he filed the application for the extension of the la visa in april   months later instead of answering the ins request for evidence rfe he tried to change the visa application from la into a lb the us immigration denied the petition because we were not able to change the status for a filed petition to do so we would have had to file a new one however not worst enough he told us not to leave the us and to stay during he was filing a petition for a b visa to gain additional time to prepare a new la applicationmr martin valko took on our case he told us that it will be difficult but he would try to rescue the case thoroughly explained the case to us after his analysis of the immigration laws and regulations and promised us to do the best after he had all our paperwork he and his legal team needed only a few days to prepare the new la petition l for the family we used the premium processing service of the uscis and we had our approval after less than one week we then scheduled a visa appointment at the us consulate in berlin germany the following week and our new la and l visas have been granted for a full one yearwhen searching for a good immigration attorney you will find thousands of attorneys and all of them promise to be the best and to

other attorneys are good im sure they are but im gonna talk about gary frost gary frost is amazing i called the law firm in tears and he made me see that i was over stressing about something that was not even a problem at allmy abusive ex boyfriend who is like totally trashy and lame filed a k petition and talked me into signing it during the time that i was on zoloft and xanax due to the stress in the relationship which i did love makes people act stupidlater on when i realized he cheated on me i cancelled itmy main concern was knowing that this would cause trouble later on like for example when i go to the states on vacation because me and my family have been going there since i was like two i was stressed and i appreciate his kind words which meant so much to me as well as his legal advice he broke with all the stereotypes of the mean and cold attorneys now in spanishno se que tal sean los otros abogados pero yo voy a hablar de gary frost llame a las oficinas asi como que llorando y me hizo ver que estaba asi como que preocupandome por algo que nada que verel naco de mi ex novio dio de alta una peticion k y me convencio de iniciar todo el rollo y cuando me di cuenta que el muy loser me engaño pues obvio que la quise cancelar osea nadie va andar con alguien que lo trate mal y encima hablaba mal de los mexicanos a veces solo por ser el norteamericano osea que le pasabami preocupacion principal era saber que estoy me pudiera afectar en un futuro y el me hizo saber que no tenia porque preocuparme de una manera bastante amigable aprecio mucho su asesoria legal pero aun mas sus palabras de aliento cuando yo estaba toda nerviosa y desesperada y necesitaba escuchar que todo iba a estar bienchavez  valko llpterry h ratedwe did it my wife is coming to america no words can ever convey my heartfelt thanks to chavez and valko’s  martin valko and eduardo amaro my heart is full of joy as i write the following…the law firm of chavez and valko was referred to me by an acquaintance and i met with martin valko immediately upon returning from my wedding in zhengzhou china and i liked him very much the road to a successful migration can be a perilous one never dreaming our case would require almost five years and three visa interviews to complete the us department of state made several errors that no one could have foreseen the us consulate in guangzhou sent our case back  times and chavez and valko reaffirmed it and then finally on the third try the consulate visa officers realized ours was a bona fide marriage i know this placed additional burden and countless manhours on chavez and valko i was concerned when our first visa interview was not successful in march  and i was concerned the law firm would drop us as clients i met with mr valko and he put all my worries to rest they are true to their word and a law firm of the highest honor mr valko and mr amaro our paralegal never once wavered and i can’t imagine anyone anywhere at anytime fighting any harder for our case all these years they paid the closest of attention to slightest of details when we gave up they kept fighting for us chavez and valko’s law firm has grown in size since over the last five years but those assigned to our case in the beginning…remained on our case until the very end may god bless the law firm of chavez and valko and their staff members chavez

he was eight years old originally we contacted mr valkos office to help my husband get a visa in the meantime the new deferred action came out and mr valko suggested that we go this route since it appeared that my husband met the criteria immigration received my husbands application for deferred action in september  he went to his biometrics appointment in midoctober  received an approval notification in midnovember  and three days letter received his work permit in the mail now he has his social security card and driver license no more worries that my husband will go to work one day and not return home because he was picked up by immigration again we are so thankful and appreciative for the great work mr valko and jessica have done for us they always return your call or email very quickly and you dont always get that kind of service from attorneys offices mr valko exuded confidence in our case and his expertise and that in turn eased our minds a great deal we felt like we were treated as human beings by people who cared about our situation there is still more to do and we will stay with mr valko because we can trust him if he can help you then he will if he cannot help you he will be honest and tell you so if you have any immigration issues this is the office to go to we have recommended mr valko to other family our friends and strangers that we have heard are in

green card in august  this is life changing in so many areas i work in a midmanagement position for a fortune  company in the dallasfort worth metroplex area and sometime in the mids my company migrated its immigration legal representatives from a very expensive washington dc area firm to the much more affordable firm of chavez  valko in the dfw area while there were a few parties involved in my process the champions have been martin valko and his team of paralegals including the ever available shannon at chavez  valko as anyone who may have gone through the us immigration system can attest the suspense and uncertainties in the process can be a teeth grinding experience throughout my dual intent hb  perm process martin and his team kept me updated performed timely execution of the series of uscis document filing and notifications state department visa applications provided me and my family reassurance during uscis delays and pretty much held my hands through it all i am very grateful for their hard work proactive professionalism dedication to my personal process and uncompromising commitment to deliver i am already gladly recommending the firm of chavez  valko to family

assocchristopherindallas ratederic fein is in a class all toeric fein is in a class all to himself when you need the toughest attorney willing to do whatever it takes to win your case you need eric fein eric specializes in business corporation insurance intellectual property among other areas however what eric fein most specializes in is winning hes like a pit bull once he gets a hold of the other side he doesnt let go eric has represented me in a number of cases and has always delivered a positive outcome even when the odds were stacked against i have seen eric take on the largest of insurance companies that have unlimited resources and were willing to do anything to deny a claim even though it was a valid claim when eric was done they didnt know what hit them he did circles around them and showed them that the law was not on their side and neither was he in the end it wound up costing the insurance company a whole lot more than if they would have just paid the claim in the first place and this type of outcome is typical with eric fein eric is not a low cost attorney and he typically charges by the hour but the end value he delivers is well worth it when you absolutely need to win and want the toughest guy in town willing to do whatever it takes to win eric fein is your guy if you are an insurance company and eric fein is the opposing counsel in a claim you are screwed and better pay now because the outcome will not be in your favor on a scale of  eric fein gets an  chavez  valko llpswarans ratedi’m a srnetweaver administrator at a fortune  company which manufactures and distributes steel my company retains chavez  valko immigration law firm and their corporate immigration team initially assisted my company with the transfer of my hb and h petitions from my previous employer after i was “ported” the company filed a new labor perm application in a faster category and the i petition was then filed to recapture my earlier priority date from my old petition which was successful our cases were not very simple as the i green card applications for me and my wife were accepted first without our kids during this time martin valko and his paralegals worked relentlessly on my cases communicated with uscis and even conferenced me into a call to make sure that all of the cases were consolidated what sets this team apart from other attorneys i worked with in the past is that they were always accessible and provided me with regular updates and answered my calls or emails sometimes within minutes after the priority dates became current this year we received a call from martin that our green cards are being produced and that was the best news for me and my family as we have been in this immigration process for many years i would recommend chavez  valko to my family and friends without hesitation and not only in employment cases but also for deportation and family immigration needs their team is the bestswaran s with familychavez  valko llphrmgr ratedi am a human resource manager at a fortune  company with over  locations in  countries we have been working with martin valko and his employmentbased immigration team at chavez  valko for almost  years and our experience has been great martin’s team handles all of our immigration and employer compliance needs and to date has successfully completed over  matters the cases include hb la lb and tn petitions the respective visa applications at consulates perms i petitions green card applications as well as applications for employment and travel authorizations they are very professional prompt to answer our calls and emails even during holidays and weekends and they navigate through the maze of complex laws with absolute ease for example with longer green card wait times they skillfully prepared new labor certifications and petition in the faster category so that several of our employees received their green cards faster the major advantage of working with martin’s team over large national immigration law firms we used in the past is that martin’s team is quick efficient and reliable and the end result is a great value to the company i can call martin or any other team member for a quick chat without having to schedule the meeting in advance and i don’t receive an itemized invoice for such a call which is very important to us in this economy law

experience questions one of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorneys history when you first step into a lawyers office you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas you have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practices success look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of courtonce you inquire about the broad details of their legal career you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue you should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs lawyers cant mention clients by name but you should ask for basic details about identical past casesfinancial questions you need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney you should request a list of all costs in advance so you wont be surprised by additional expenses like overhead also determine exactly when you will start being billed you want to inspect paperwork carefully if the attorney charges you for his or her experience you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistantfind out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour many civil lawyers work on contingency whatever the payment plan make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performancelawyerclient relationship questions when you hire a lawyer youre agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time you need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship the attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updatesyou should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyerclient relationship great questions to start off
