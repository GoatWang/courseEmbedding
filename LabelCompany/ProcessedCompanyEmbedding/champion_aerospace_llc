overviewfeatureschampion distributorvideotech sheetsthe function of the aviation piston engine ignition system is to provide an electrical spark to ignite the fuelair mixture in the engine cylinders the ignition system of the engine is a separate system and is not part of the airplane’s overall electrical system the magneto type ignition system is used on most reciprocating aircraft engines magnetos are enginedriven selfcontained units that supply electrical current without using an external source of current magnetos are frequently not maintained to requirements specified in l manual  series magneto maintenance and overhaul manual probably because they’re so reliable and all engines have a redundant magneto magnetos need regular maintenance and the consequences of neglect can be devastating modern airplane engines are required by to have a dual ignition system – that is two separate magnetos to supply the electric current to the two spark plugs contained in each cylinder one magneto system supplies the current to one set of plugs while the second magneto system supplies the current to the other set of plugs the airplane’s double ignition system provides better performance because of more efficient combustion and a higher level of safety through redundancy champion slick magnetos have applications on nearly all piston engines and are known for the following design features smaller and lighter unique design allowing for a dimensionally smaller magneto resulting in easier installation and lighter weight as much as one pound lighter than competitive magnetos radio noise suppression slick magnetos feature superior noise suppression eliminating the need for magneto filters easy to maintain slick magnetos use up to  fewer parts than the competitive aircraft magnetos in addition  of the parts in any slick magneto are interchangeable with the comparable parts in other current production slick magnetos slick magnetos are engineered so that mechanical parts wear at a balanced rate consistent and complimentary wear patterns establish the recommended maintenance intervals defined in champion aerospace service literature so used and serviceworn parts should never be used to troubleshoot or repair a magneto nor should original parts be replaced by used service worn parts on magnetos being returned to service further nonchampion aerospace manufactured parts may wear at uneven and different rates than original champion aerospace manufactured parts making champion aerospace service literature an inappropriate guide to proper maintenance parts not manufactured by champion aerospace even if faapma approved may not fit or operate like original champion aerospace manufactured parts faa testing of pma parts does not require operation on an engine or flight tests and does not require the test duration to exceed the maintenance intervals called out in champion aerospace literature for these reasons used service worn parts or parts not manufactured by champion aerospace may adversely affect magneto reliability in ways not anticipated by champion aerospace and its service literature genuine champion aerospace parts are produced and inspected under rigorous procedures to ensure airworthiness and suitability in slick magnetos parts purchased from sources other than champion aerospace even though outwardly identical in appearance may not have had the required tests and inspections performed may be different in fabrication techniques and materials and may be dangerous when installed in a slick magneto salvaged magneto parts reworked parts obtained from nonchampion aerospace approved sources or parts the service history of which is unknown or cannot be authenticated may have been subjected to unacceptable stresses or temperatures or have other hidden damage not discernible through routine visual or usual nondestructive testing techniques this may render service work with this part even though originally manufactured by champion aerospace unsuitable or unsafe for use in a slick magneto champion aerospace expressly disclaims any responsibility slick magnetos can also be economically serviced at hour intervals to ensure their reliability all ad’s are complied with and the following high wear parts are replaced brush capacitors points rotor gear impulse spring as applicable for aircraft that

high performance aviation products slick magnetos are endorsed by today’s top aviation mechanics and are renown for their reliability and service life the champion slick magneto features a liftoff housing so internal timing is not disturbed during inspections simplified internal timing improves internal markings and the unique slick egap tool makes timing easier and more accurate slick magnetos have fully sealed bearings keeping contaminants out and grease in for smoother operation and less maintenance lower emi levels and a redesigned housing improve sealing and less radio noise most importantly champion slick magnetos are oem approved slick magnetos are available for more than  engines – all compatible with existing slick ignition harnesses get the ignition system that meets your needs for simple maintenance and quality performance the champion difference known and proven quality commitment to technology advanced engineering applications for virtually every aviation reciprocatingpiston engine sales technical and customer services available product information and technical data ignition harnesses the aircraft ignition harness carries an electrical current from the aircraft magneto to the spark plugs an aircraft ignition harness is shielded to support and protect the wires from damage and to act as a conductor for stray magnetic fields this in turn will minimize electrical interference with sensitive electrical equipment on the aircraft faapma approved slick harnesses by champion are built to handle the maximum spark energy produced while delivering more energy than is required by the spark plugs – even during emergency fullpower engine operation using anything less could result in more than a  reduction of radio sensitivity in commonly used communication frequencies as tested by champion features such as a heavygauge contact spring provide more contact area and force inside the spark plug while the flexibility of the coiled center conductor reduces fatigue and breakage resulting from repeated temperature cycling and vibration champion ignition leads have a polymer coating to resist heat and are engineered for hightemperature environments which is common in reciprocating engines the champion difference known and proven quality commitment to technology advanced engineering applications for virtually every aviation reciprocatingpiston engine sales technical and customer services available product information and technical data electronic ignition champion aerospace developed a lycoming piston engine solid state ignition system chpra in  for the light sport aircraft program this ignition system design can be tailored for use on experimental aircraft as well at the system level the design consists of a control module assembly and two capacitive discharge module assemblies both assemblies are packaged within anodized aerospace grade aluminum housings for mechanical strength environmental and emi considerations the design is interchangeable with the traditional magneto and has two redundant electrical power and control channels the unit is powered at low rpm by aircraft bus power and then is selfpowered at the targeted internal permanent magnet alternator assembly pma takeover speed to avoid burdening the electrical bus during flight the control module contains two surface mounted pcb assemblies traditional style magneto shaft and bearing assembly a sensor assembly and the pma assembly the capacitive discharge ignition cdi module assembly receives a low voltage input from the control assembly and steps the voltage up to traditional magneto output levels the delivered energy can easily be configured to customer requirements for improved ignition performance the high voltage
