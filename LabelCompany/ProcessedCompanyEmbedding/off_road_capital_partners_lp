university in   the composition of the off road investment team and the composition of altitude capital partners and loeb king responsible for investment performance discussed on this page are not the same and off road is not affiliated with either altitude capital partner or loeb king the success of the altitude capital partners or loeb king is not predictive of the success of off road certain performance calculations are prepared internally and have not been audited or verified by a third party the use of a different methodology for preparing calculating or presenting performance returns may lead to different results and such differences may be material philosophyoff road capital management is governed by a select core of beliefs and principles a strong alignment of interest with our investors and operating partners is central to our operating philosophy transacting and partnering with driven highintegrity professionals is an imperative having processes in place designed to protect downside is of paramount importance we use financial structuring preferred equity debt “top of waterfall” mechanisms deep value analysis and scenariobased stress testing to exhaustively measure and intended to mitigate the risk of loss a search for the facts and a focus on transformative issues distinguishes our approach we place great value on diversification as we understand from vast experience that too much conviction and concentration is dangerous  our primary objective is to expose off road partners to asset classes and returns to which most family offices and institutions are not privy we believe such niche private assets can provide attractive returns without stock market volatility and high correlation to traditional asset classes we are prepared to take intelligent calculated risks and adopt “out of the box thinking” from years of experience we have learned that impressive returns can be generated by focusing on smaller niche assets that are difficult to source diligence and structure we believe that illiquidity can be an alphagenerative asset which many in the investment world simply cannot exploit because of structural impediments and assetliability matching hurdles simply we are “off road” investors that have unstinting conviction in the idea that through a vigorous search process we attempt to find uncommon mispriced assets with upside optionality by partnering with bestinclass and ethical operators asset managers and industry specialists our universeoff road capital management sits at the nexus between those in search of differentiated investments and those with unique business models in need of flexible capital industry specialist and niche operators off road’s investorbase includes some of substantial offices investing institutions and highnetworth individuals our sophisticated and wellcapitalized investor base affords us the ability to execute on “coinvestment” opportunities of significant scale and of atypical nature off road may be a solution for niche businesses and asset classes in need of strategic and creative capital to permit growthsourcing and value creationoff road’s founders have fifty years of collective experience and relationships that span the investment ecosystem these valued relationships form a holistic approach to sourcing and executing upon transactions focuswhere we typically invest investment size  million agnostic to structure and instrument debt preferred equity straight equity contractual cash flow instruments hybrid vehicles investment durations  years governance minority positions with high visibility into business process or control stakes with board representation if appropriate areas of interest credit  cash flow assets industry niches specialty financeinsurance special situations litigation claims off road invests in uncommon riskreturn profiles that have “visible returns” or cash flow streams and stores of value that can be identified with probing research an examination of history and hightouch factfinding   where we typically don’t invest traditional private equity venture capital macro themes off road does not purport to be able to predict complex macro events and trends off road is not a solution for institutions that must put billions of dollars to work in standard products off road’s founders understand that successful business relationships must be symbiotic we strive to add value by helping to prepare companies specialists operators and fund managers for their next phase of growth after we invest we provide advice

offroadcapitalcom an si board since october  posts subjectmarks bans    emcee  topannuity type  unmoderated company website offroadcapitalcomfirm opens doors to deals online  offerings only available to accredited investors must have net worth over  minimum investment is by bill meyers usa today steve pelletier thought he had created the next ebay or amazoncom so he pitched the concept to his colleagues at benchmark capital theredhot silicon valley venture capital firm backed by hightech titans such as michael dell scott mcnealy and craig mccaw benchmark which has invested more than  million in digital enterprises since  was lukewarm to pelletiers idea undeterred pelletier left benchmark and went on to launch offroad capital  the first web site that allows affluent individuals to invest electronically in established private growth companies seeking financing offroad says pelletier was too close to home for benchmark i saw a lot of opportunity but its not clear how much they saw more than  individual investors saw plenty and confounding the powerful pros at benchmark they anted up more than  million for offroad which officially goes on line next month its a magnificent concept says dan brumbaugh a senior finance fellow at the milken institute and one of offroads first backers that was clear to me after hearing the first  words for interested investors the concept is simple after going to offroads web site wwwoffroadcapitalcom all they have to do is click on an icon for an application form to become an offroad member a person must be  or older have  million in household net worth and understand the securities and exchange commission rules investors must also pay a  initiation fee waived until june  and undergo credit and background checks before reviewing the deals offroad will feature on line monthly the minimum investment in a deal will be  based in san francisco offroad is known as a butterfly company in silicon valley because it carries two groups of people who want to do business with each other on its wings the  million american households with  million or more in assets account for about twothirds of the nations wealth yet thesehighnetworth players rarely get a chance to invest in private companies that might soon go public unless you hear about this kind of transaction at the country club you almost never get to participate says pelletier  when it comes to money highnetworth investors are pretty sophisticated and selfdirected theyre saying give us the opportunities show us the deals  capital chasm for their part the  private companies in the usa with  or more employees account for  trillion in book assets yet when theyre looking to raise between  million and  million these firms often plunge into a capital chasm and are forced to scrounge together the needed funds themselves thats because most venture capitalists and investment banks overlook established companies looking to raise  million to  million and outside individuals traditionally invest less than  million offroad says dan burke of gomez advisors a research firm specializing in electronic commerce for consumers has the potential to be a doublehot situation with so many private companies seeking money and the enormous demand among highnetworth investors still pelletier and his colleagues at offroad will face competition wr hambrecht for example is making initial public offerings available on line and garagecom has raised money for startup companies pelletier is unfazed and he points out that offroads companies wont be in the embryonic stage  theyll have customers revenues profits and plans to go public were not going to ask people to invest money in an untested idea created by three guys with  slides says offroads founder with our companies there will be real tires you can kick to kick the tires and examine offroads deals investors will be able to chat on line with each cashhungry company and ask questions before they buy in offroad subscribers will also be able to discuss the transactions with each other on the web and offroads private companies will be required to disclose their quarterly results its still unclear whether the digitaldeal concept will appeal to highnetworth investors its not as simple as posting a plan on the net and then waiting for people to send you the check says guy kawasaki founder of garagecom initial interest is piqued by email and web sites but it often comes down to facetoface meetings before they invest after helping intuit grow from  million to  million between  and  pelletier knows a lot about investor behavior steve sees the trends early says bill campbell chairman of the board at intuit hes a technology person who really understands the needs of consumers the entrepreneurial bug a harvard philosophy major pelletier learned the hightech side of the business at kurzweil computer products where he helped create a reading machine for the blind in the late s then he moved to interleaf in the early s and developed desktop publishing products pelletiers advanced education in consumer marketing took root at intuit when he worked with scott cook the companys cofounder a former procter  gamble executive after microsofts failed acquisition of intuit pelletier left the company and took six months off to recharge before going to benchmark while serving as entrepreneurinresidence at the venture capital firm he sat in a conference room and listened as scores of startups made their pitches for funding it was an eyeopening experience for me pelletier says at first i thought why would anybody start a business its scary and the failure rate is high then i told myself you can do this i guess i really got the entrepreneurial bug benchmark listened to his proposal for offroad but walked away we passed initially for a couple of reasons says benchmarks kevin harvey primarily we wanted a tighter focus on hightech laterstage financings  i think its too early to say that we wont work together including an investment this time radical business model pelletier persevered after other venture capital firms rejected his radical new business model for private equity financing after four months and many meetings with investors he had his funding in place along the way he picked up support from the milken institute a nonprofit economic think tank started and sponsored by michael milken the onceconvicted former highyield bond whiz in the s milken recognized a similar capital crunch and financed the same type of companies that offroad plans to back three members of the milken institute are now on offroads advisory board steven wallman a former commissioner of the securities and exchange commission is a member of offroads board of directors and susan woodward the former chief economist of the sec now serves in the same role at offroad during the past month offroad has analyzed more than  established private companies that are seeking cyberfunding on its site if selected these firms will pay offroad  to  of the capital raised for them pelletier also reports that  highnetworth investors have signed up as offroad subscribers his goal
