investment result smaller than the assumed investment rate the amount of annuity payments would decrease a higher assumed investment rate will result in a larger initial payment but more slowly rising and more rapidly falling subsequent payments than a lower assumed investment rate additional information transfers between divisions and payment plans subject to the short term and excessive trading limitations described below and any frequent trading policies adopted by the funds that are described in their prospectuses you may change the allocation of purchase payments among the divisions and transfer values from one division to another both before and after annuity payments begin in order to take full advantage of these features you should carefully consider on a continuing basis which division or apportionment is best suited to your longterm investment needs you may at any time change the allocation of purchase payments among the divisions by written notice to us purchase payments we receive at our home office on and after the date on which we receive notice will be applied to provide accumulation units in one or more divisions on the basis of the new allocation before the effective date of a payment plan you may upon written request transfer accumulation units from one division to another after the effective date of a payment plan the payee may transfer annuity units from one division to another we will adjust the number of accumulation or annuity units to be credited to reflect the respective value of the accumulation and annuity units in each of the divisions for accumulation units the minimum amount which may be transferred is the lesser of  or the entire value of the accumulation units in the division from which the transfer is being made we currently make no charge for transfers you may transfer amounts which you have invested on a fixed basis to any division of the account and you may transfer the value of accumulation units in any division of the account to the guaranteed interest fund for investment on a fixed basis subject to the restrictions described in the contract see the guaranteed interest fund after the effective date of a payment plan which does not involve a life contingency ie plan  a payee may transfer to either form of life annuity at no charge we will apply the value of the remaining payments to the new plan selected we will determine the amount of the first annuity payment under the new plan on the basis of the particular plan selected the annuity payment rate and the annuitants adjusted age and sex subsequent payments will vary to reflect changes in the value of the annuity units credited we permit other transfers between payment plans subject to such limitations as we may reasonably determine generally however we do not permit transfer from a payment plan involving a life contingency to a payment plan which does not involve the same life contingency you may make transfers from the money market division at any time while a payment plan is in force the contract provides that transfers between the other divisions and transfers between payment plans may be made after the payment plan has been in force for at least  days and thereafter whenever at least  days have elapsed since the date of the last transfer we will make the transfer based upon the next valuation of accumulation unites in the affected divisions that we make after we receive your request for transfer at our home office provided it is in good order short term and excessive trading short term and excessive trading sometimes referred to as market timing may present risks to a portfolios longterm investors because it can among other things disrupt portfolio investment strategies increase portfolio transaction and administrative costs require higher than normal levels of cash reserves to fund unusually large or unexpected redemptions and adversely affect investment performance these risks may be greater for portfolios that invest in securities that may be more vulnerable to arbitrage trading including foreign securities and thinly traded securities such as small cap stocks and noninvestment grade bonds these types of trading activities also may dilute the value of longterm investors interests in a portfolio if it calculates its net asset value using closing prices that are no longer accurate accordingly we discourage market timing activities to deter short term and excessive trading we have adopted and implemented policies and procedures which are designed to control abusive trading practices we seek to apply these policies and procedures uniformly to all contract owners except to the extent we are prevented from doing so under applicable state or federal law or regulation any exceptions must be either expressly permitted by our policies and procedures or subject to an approval process described in them because exceptions are permitted it is possible that investors may be treated differently and as a result some may be allowed to engage in trading activity that might be viewed as market timing among the steps we have taken to reduce the frequency and effect of these practices are monitoring trading activity and imposing trading restrictions including the prohibition of more than twelve transfers among divisions under a single contract  mason streetsm variable

transfer in an amount in excess of  within fourteen calendar days will be restricted from making additional transfers after the third such round trip transfer until after the next contract anniversary date and sent a letter informing him of the restriction thereafter the same investor will be similarly restricted after the second such round trip transfer an investor who is identified as having made one or more round trip transfers within thirty calendar days aggregating more than one percent  of the total assets of the portfolio underlying a division will be sent a warning letter after the first such round trip transfer and will be restricted from making additional transfers until after the next contract anniversary date after the second such round trip transfer thereafter the same investor will be similarly restricted after the first such round trip transfer these limitations do not apply to automatic asset transfers scheduled or systematic transactions involving portfolio rebalancing dollar cost averaging interest sweeps or to initial allocations or changes in allocations these policies and procedures may change from time to time in our sole discretion without notice provided however contract owners would be given advance written notice if the policies and procedures were revised to accommodate market timing additionally the funds may have their own policies and procedures described in their prospectuses that are designed to limit or restrict frequent trading if we believe your trading activity is in violation of or inconsistent with our policies and procedures or otherwise is potentially disruptive to the interests of other investors you may be asked to stop such activities and future investments allocations or transfers by you may be rejected without notice because we retain discretion to determine what action is appropriate in a given situation investors may be treated differently and some may be allowed to engage in activities that might be viewed as market timing we intend to monitor events and the effectiveness of our policies and procedures in order to identify whether instances of potentially abusive trading practices are occurring however we may not be able to identify all instances of abusive trading practices nor completely eliminate the possibility of such activities and there may be technological limitations on our ability to impose restrictions on the trading practices of contract owners owners of the contract the owner of the contract has the sole right to exercise all rights and privileges under the contract except as the

payment rate to the product of the number of accumulation units in the division on the effective date of the payment plan and the accumulation unit value for the division on that date annuity rates currently in use are based on the  a table with projection scale g and age adjustment variable annuity payments after the first will vary from month to month and will depend upon the number and value of annuity units credited to the annuitant after the effective date of a payment plan a contract will not share in the divisible surplus of northwestern mutual the number of annuity units in each division is determined by dividing the amount of the first annuity payment from the division by the value of an annuity unit on the effective date of the payment plan the number of annuity units thus credited to the annuitant in each division remains constant throughout the annuity period however the value of annuity units in each division will fluctuate with the investment experience of the division the amount of each variable annuity payment after the first is the sum of payments from each division determined by multiplying this fixed number of annuity units each month by the value of an annuity unit for the division on a the fifth valuation date prior to the payment due date if the payment due date is a valuation date or b the sixth valuation date prior to the payment due date if the payment due date is not a valuation date to illustrate if a payment due date falls on a friday saturday or sunday the amount of the payment will normally be based upon the annuity unit value calculated on the preceding friday the preceding friday would be the fifth valuation date prior to the friday due date and the sixth valuation date prior to the saturday or sunday due dates annuity unit value the value of an annuity unit for each division is established at  as of the date operations begin for that division the value of an annuity unit on any later date varies to reflect the investment experience of the division the assumed investment rate on which the annuity rate tables are based and the deduction for mortality rate and expense risks assumed by northwestern mutual the annuity unit value for each division on any valuation date is determined by multiplying the annuity unit value on the immediately preceding valuation date by two factors a the net investment factor for the current period for the division and b an adjustment factor to neutralize the assumed investment rate used in calculating the annuity rate tables b prd�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�rd illustrations of variable annuity payments to illustrate the manner in which variable annuity payments are determined consider this example item  in the example shows the applicable monthly payment rate for a male adjusted age  who has elected a life annuity payment plan with a certain period of  years with an assumed investment rate of  plan  as described in the prospectus the example is for a contract with sexdistinct rates  assumed number of accumulation units in balanced division on maturity date   assumed value of an accumulation unit in balanced division at maturity   cash value of contract at maturity  x     assumed applicable monthly payment rate per  from annuity rate table    amount of first payment from balanced division  x  divided by     assumed value of annuity unit in balanced division at maturity   number of annuity units credited in balanced division  divided by   the  value at maturity provides a first payment from the balanced division of  and payments thereafter of the varying dollar value of  annuity units the amount of subsequent payments from the balanced division is determined by multiplying  units by the value of an annuity unit in the balanced division on the applicable valuation date for example if that unit value is  the monthly payment from the division will be  multiplied by  or  however the value of the annuity unit depends entirely on the investment performance of the division thus in the example above if the net investment rate for the following month was less than the assumed investment rate of  the annuity unit would decline in value if the annuity unit value declined to  the succeeding monthly payment would then be  x  or  for the sake of simplicity the foregoing example assumes that all of the annuity units are in the balanced division if there are annuity units in two or more divisions the annuity payment from each division is calculated separately in the manner illustrated and the total monthly payment is the sum of the payments from the divisions valuation of assets of the account the value of portfolio or fund shares held in each division of the account at the time of each valuation is the redemption value of such shares at such time if the right to redeem shares of a portfolio or fund has been suspended or payment of redemption value has been postponed for the sole purpose of computing annuity payments the shares held in the account and annuity units may be valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the board of trustees of northwestern mutual b
