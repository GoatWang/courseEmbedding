writes the days specials on a whiteboard ahead of the opening of the pullman farmers market on wednesday afternoon kai eiselein visitors browse the pullman farmers market on wednesday afternoon kai eiselein its no moscow farmers market  that the manager vendors and patrons can agree onbut pullman farmers market manager richard link said thats not the pointthe moscow market is very much a social event and the things that they set up policy wise basically encourages that and we wanted to really focus on the food and make it very local very fresh food link said tucked away in the spot shop parking lot at  ne kamiaken street on wednesday eight vendors staked out tents for the market which has been running since may  the market was attracting sporadic clusters of customers from the streets on the hot summer solstice day a child blew bubbles in the wind while local classic rock band the paradons played live rock n roll other children used chalk to write welcome on the pavementcustomers might notice a lack of craft vendors at pullmans market if they have ever visited moscows which typically features dozens selling everything from soaps to jewelry on wednesday pullmans market featured homemade jams and bread and fresh farmed produce meats and plantsthe board running the market does not necessarily say no to craft vendors but it is selective link said it focuses on sponsoring local food and though it is relatively small link said the people who do come buyand i think maybe a little bit of that is that we are inconvenient you have to want to be here to be here link said with a laugh adding the board is always searching for a better locationbut one other factor might be preventing pullmans market from reaching moscow levels  state regulationswesley harness of kays krunch peanut brittle based in colfax said the moscow and pullman markets are totally different  the company sells at both his wife kay pierson boiled that difference down to idaho and washington state codesa lot of idaho people will not come to this market because they dont follow the same rules we do pierson said adding she and harness prepare their products in a commercial kitchen in palouse to meet washington regulationsat a booth for omache farm based just southwest of pullman margaret parsley sold pork and vegetables her yearold daughter alli sat at her own miniature stand near the booth selling manicures for  to since i got these for christmas i thought i could do peoples nails alli said sifting through her display of rainbow polish colors she had yet to receive a customer wednesday but the most requested color this year has been her crayola bubblegumscented polish though margaret said there are not many differences in regulations for her products between state lines she pointed out she cannot sell her eggs unless they have been washed in a sink outside of her living space per washington regulations so margaret does not sell eggs in pullman but she does in moscow on saturdaysby contrast pioneer produce owner peggy welsh currently sells her jams herbs and vegetables solely in washington as a relatively new grower with a small farmi pretty much sell everything that i am able to produce so far im getting bigger and bigger every year but it takes a while so i really dont have enough to go to the moscow market yet welsh saidthe pullman farmers market runs every wednesday through oct  with a rotation of live bands and vendors the market has been extended to run from  to  pm this year to give people time to come after work link said the

they were dignified men who did undignified labor they made beds and cleaned toilets they shined shoes dusted jackets cooked meals and washed dishes in cramped and rolling quarters yet the thousands of african american men who rode the nation’s railroads as pullman porters between  and  changed history in the face of adversity and racial prejudice they created the first labor union for african americans they helped build the civil rights movement in the s and ’s and exemplified the possibility of upward mobility for black males long before barack obama took up residence in the white house brian kerseyap a textile conservator examines a pullman railroad porter hat dating from the s “these are ordinary men who did extraordinary things” noted lyn hughes a pullman porters historian in a tribute to five former porters held this week at the oakland calif amtrak station as part of black history month as the award ceremony took place passenger trains could be heard whistling and chugging to a stop on nearby tracks “you knew who they were” hughes said “they dressed well they carried themselves well they were men of purpose and principle” whose standard of excellence became the measure by which others were judged hughes founder and curator of the a philip randolph pullman porter museum in chicago has spent years compiling records of every porter dining car worker and maid who served on the railroads into the book an anthology of respect still the bestdressed men in any train station none of the retired porters would dare speak with such immodesty about themselves “it was a job and you got used to it” said lee gibson of los angeles who started working for the union pacific railroad in  and still wears a crisp white shirt tie and stylish dark suit at age  “you would get up each morning and do the best job you could and accept whatever comes but it was a steady job and we got pretty good money got to travel the country and the work wasn’t too hard it was kind of fun but you know it was a service job” like many pullman workers gibson grew up in the south in louisiana and texas and was introduced to railroad work by a church deacon after moving to los angeles in  “he carried me down to the superintendent’s office and he hired me right then he told me ‘you ought to make a good porter for us’ so i went to work” gibson thinks his work as a pullman porter allowed him to stay married  years until his wife passed away three years ago “we had five days on the railroad and five days off so by the time the wife was tired of you you were gone and by the time you got back she was happy to see you again” he said with a chuckle troy walker  was born in oklahoma and was working in a bar at union station in kansas city mo when he learned he could get work on a union pacific dining car “it was a good job you made a lot of your money in tips because the salary wasn’t great but we served firstclass meals and because we were in the dining car you got to meet a lot of movie stars and business people” he remembers wearing tuxedo pants a white dinner jacket and a black bow tie while waiting on his customers who included director orson welles and actress elizabeth taylor “in my era it was about the only good job a black fella could get” walker who stayed with the railroad for  years before retiring in seattle attended the oakland ceremony with fellow honoree thomas henry gray  a thirdgeneration railroad porter while the pullman porters were held in high esteem in the black community their historical legacy is often overlooked chicago industrialist george pullman began recruiting black men as porters on his new luxurious rail sleeper cars which revolutionized train travel just after the end of the civil war he was looking to hire men for his rolling hotels who were dignified and diligent and who epitomized pullman’s vision of safe reliable and invisible servants but the jobs came with a price historians note that for over a century in the intimate confines of railcars that crisscrossed america a pullman porter had workloads lasting sometimes  hours per month and encountered indignities and outright humiliations from passengers most white customers called their porters “george” after pullman or simply “boy” for a time in the midth century more black american males worked for the railroads than anywhere else the good pay and steady work made a pullman uniform a status symbol for generations of african american families hoping to gain economic mobility supreme court justice thurgood marshall and his father were both pullman porters so was the father of former san francisco mayor willie brown as well as the father of tom bradley the first black mayor of los angeles filmmaker gordon parks and activist malcolm x also served as pullman porters the porters were also inextricably linked to the union and civil rights movements after contentious battles both within the black community and against management of the pullman company the brotherhood of sleeping car porters founded by a philip randolph won recognition in  after a year campaign the union’s organizing slogan was “fight or be slaves” in december  when rosa parks refused to sit in the back of a montgomery ala municipal bus and was arrested ed nixon a pullman porter who headed the local branch of the naacp helped organize the pivotal montgomery bus boycott randolph and one of his chief lieutenants bayard rustin were also the chief architects of the  march on washington “they learned to organize by standing up for themselves and organizing a union” hughes said “and perhaps unintentionally they helped organize the civil rights movement too” the porters disappeared in the s when amtrak took over the trains and porters became “attendants” “the white people they hired didn’t want to be called ‘porter’ and they didn’t want to wear the uniform” walker explained but to train buffs like brian rosenwald who used to hang out in chicago’s union station as a teen and now is the chief of product management for amtrak the contribution of the pullman porters remains vivid “you know it’s just cold steel” rosenwald said “but these men gave the trains their soul” michael zielenziger is a writer based in oakland calif join the discussion    add yours please leave your comment below you must be logged in to leave a comment next article
