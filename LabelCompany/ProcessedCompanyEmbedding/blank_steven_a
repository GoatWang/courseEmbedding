methodology is a cornerstone of the lean startup movement popularized by eric ries whom blank states was “the best student i ever had” the lean startup approach relies on validated learning scientific experimentation and iterative product releases to shorten product development cycles measure progress and gain valuable customer feedback blank and ries developed the ideas beginning around  when blank was an investor and advisor to the company imvu that ries cofounded the lean startup has been adopted by entrepreneurs worldwide as a constructive way to try out ideas and gain customers ries

entrepreneurship in  at uc berkeley’s haas school of business and has since taught entrepreneurship to both undergraduate and graduate students he currently teaches at stanford the university of california berkeley haas school of business new york university and columbia his lean launchpad curricula uses the customer development methodology and lean startup methods he developed throughout his career as a serial entrepreneur and academic the lean launchpadedit in january  blank created the lean launchpad class at stanford university and uc berkeley the class is a scientific method for teaching entrepreneurship that combines experiential learning with the three building blocks of a successful lean startup alexander osterwalders business model canvas blanks customer development model and agile engineering the lean launchpad changed the way entrepreneurship is taught instead of relying on the traditional business school practice of teaching students how to write a standard corporate business plan or simply build a product the course provides handson experience in what it takes to start a company students propose and immediately test business hypotheses they get out of the building to talk to  prospective customers partners and others each week they use the customer feedback acquired in these interviews to refine their product or service by building a new minimal viable product weekly ensure their product or service meets a customer need or solves a customer problem and validate that they have created a repeatable scalable business model since its inception blank’s course has been adopted by more than  universities worldwide and more than  people have taken a free online version of the class at udacitycom the national science foundation innovation corpsedit in july  the national science foundation asked blank to adapt his lean launchpad class for its innovation corps icorps which develops and nurtures a national innovation ecosystem by helping discoveries from fundamental research to become new companies the course is now the standard for science commercialization serving as the syllabus of the national science foundation innovation corps icorps that is taught in  universities and has been adopted by the other federal research agencies nih doe hhs nsa and is helping to drive innovation within the us government particularly within the defense and intelligence community following a successful pilot the icorps program quickly expanded a version of the icorps program specifically dedicated to biomedical research called the icorps at

about steve startup tools secret history books for startups guide slidesvideos national security innovation just got a major boost in washington posted on july   by steveblank two good things just happened in washington – these days that should be enough of a headline first someone ideal was just appointed to be deputy assistant secretary of defense second funding to teach our hacking for defense class across the country just was added to the national defense authorization act interestingly enough both events are about how the best and brightest can serve their country – and are testament to the work of two dedicated men soldier scholar entrepreneur joe felter was just appointed deputy assistant secretary of defense for south and southeast asia as a result our country just became a bit safer and smarter that’s because joe brings a wealth of realworld experience and leadership to the role i got lucky to know and teach with joe at stanford when we met my first impression was that of a very smart and pragmatic academic and i also noticed that there was always a cloud of talented grad students who wanted to follow him i learned later i was watching one of the qualities of a great leader joe had appointments at stanford’s center for international security and cooperation cisac where he was the codirector of the empirical studies of conflict project and at the hoover institute where he was a research fellow i learned he’d gone to harvard to get his mpa at the kennedy school of government in conflict resolution but the thing that really caught my attention his stanford phd thesis in political science had the world’s best title “taking guns to a knife fight a case for empirical study of counterinsurgency” i wondered how this academic knew anything about counterinsurgency this was another reminder that when you reach a certain age people you encounter may have lived multiple lives had multiple careers and had multiple acts it took me a while to realize that joe had one heck of a first act before coming to stanford in  as i later discovered joe’s first act was  years in the army special operations forces sof retiring as a colonel his special forces time was with the st special forces group as a team leader and later as a company commander he did a tour with the th ranger regiment as a platoon leader in  he returned to west point where he earned his undergrad degree and ran the combating terrorism center putting theory into practice he went to iraq in  as part of the th ranger regiment in support of a joint special operations task force in  joe was in afghanistan as the commander of the counterinsurgency advisory and assistance team at various points his special forces career took him to countries in southeast asia where counterinsurgency was not just academics ironically i was first introduced to joe not at stanford but through one of his other lives – that of an entrepreneur and businessman – at the company he founded bmnt partners it was there that joe and i along with another retired army colonel pete newell came up with the idea of creating the hacking for defense class we combined the lean startup methodology – used by the national science foundation to commercialize science  – with the rapid problem sourcing and solution methodology pete developed on the battlefields in afghanistan and iraq when he ran the us army’s rapid equipping force my interest was to get stanford students engaged in national service and exposed to parts of the us government where their traditional academic path and business career would never take them i have a strong belief that we’ve run a year experiment with what happens when you disconnect the majority of americans from any form of national service and the result hasn’t been good for our country today if college students want to give back to their country they think of teach for america the peace corps or americorps or perhaps the us digital service or the gsa’s f few consider opportunities to make the world safer with the department of defense state department intelligence community or other government agencies joe pete and i would end up building a curriculum that would turn into a series of classes — first hacking for defense then hacking for diplomacy with the state department and professor jeremy weinstein hacking for energy hacking for impact etc hacking for defense our first hacking for defense class in  blew past our expectations – and we had set a pretty high bar see the final class presentations here and here our primary goal was to teach students entrepreneurship while they engaged in national public service our second goal was to introduce our sponsors – the innovators inside the department of defense and intelligence community –  to a methodology that can help them understand and better respond to rapidly evolving asymmetric threats we believed if we could get teams to rapidly discover the real problems in the field using lean methods and only then articulate the requirements to solve them then defense acquisition programs could operate at speed and urgency and deliver timely and needed solutions finally we also wanted to show our sponsors in the department of defense that students can make meaningful contributions to understanding problems and rapid prototyping of solutions to realworld national security problems the innovation insurgency spreads fast forward a year hacking for defense is now offered at eight universities in addition to stanford – georgetown university of pittsburgh boise state uc san diego james madison university university of southern mississippi and later this year university of southern california and columbia university we established hacking for defenseorg a nonprofit to train educators and provide a single point of contact for connecting the dodic sponsor problems to these universities by the middle of this year hacking for defense started to feel like it had the same momentum as when my lean launchpad class at stanford got adopted by the national science foundation and became the innovation corps icorps icorps uses lean startup methods to teach scientists how to turn their discoveries into entrepreneurial jobproducing businesses over  teams of our nation’s best scientists have been through the program it has changed how federally funded research is commercialized recognizing that it’s a model for a government program that’s gotten the balance between publicprivate partnerships just right last fall congress passed the american innovation and competitiveness act making the national science foundation innovation corps a permanent part of the nation’s science ecosystem it dawned on pete joe and me that perhaps we could get congress to fund the national expansion of hacking for defense the same way but serendipitously the best person we were going to ask for help had already been thinking about this the congressman from science and innovation before everyone else thought that teaching scientists how to build companies using lean methods might be a good for the country there was one congressman who got it first in  rep dan lipinski dil ranking member on the house research and technology subcommittee got on an airplane and flew to stanford to see firsthand the class that would become icorps for the first few years lipinski was a lonely voice in congress saying that we’ve found a better way to train our scientists to create companies and jobs but over time his colleagues became convinced that it was a nonpartisan good idea rep lipinski was responsible for helping icorps proliferate through the federal government while joe felter and pete newell were thinking about approaching congressman lipinski about funding for hacking for defense lipinski had already been planning to do so as he recalled “i was listening to your podcast as i was working in my backyard cutting digging chopping etc yes i do really work in my backyard when it dawned on me that funding hacking for defense as a national program – just like i did for the innovation corps – would be great for our nation’s defense when we are facing new unique threats i tasked my staff to draft an amendment to the national defense authorization act and i sponsored the amendment” the successful outcome of icorps has given the congressman credibility on entrepreneurship education among his peers and it doesn’t hurt that he has a phd and was a university professor before he ended up in congress joe felter and pete newell mobilized a network of hacking for defense supporters joe and pete’s reputations preceded them on capitol hill but in part a testament to the strength of hacking for defense there’s now a large network of people who have experienced and believe in the program and were willing to help out by writing letters of support reaching out to other members of congress to ask for support and providing congressman lipinski’s office with information and background congressman lipinski led the amendment he brought on cosponsors from both sides of the aisle representatives steve knight rca  ro khanna dca  anna eshoo dca  seth moulton dma  and carol sheaporter dnh  on the floor of the house lipinski said “rapid lowcost technological innovation is what makes silicon valley revolutionary but the dod hasn’t historically had the mechanisms in place to harness this american advantage hacking for defense creates ways for talented scientists and engineers to work alongside veterans military leaders and business mentors to innovate solutions that make america safer” last friday the house unanimously approved an amendment to the national defense authorization act authorizing the hacking for defense hd program and enabling the secretary of defense to expend up to  million to support development of curriculum best practices and recruitment materials for the program this week the hd amendment moves on to the senate and joe felter moves on to the pentagon both of those events have the potential to make our world a much safer place – today and tomorrow share thisprintemailtweetwhatsapptelegramshare

build a ship don’t drum up the people to gather wood divide the work and give orders instead teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea antoine de saintexupéry i was visiting with an exstudent who’s now the cfo of a large public tech company the company is still one of the hottest places to work in tech they make hardware with a large part of their innovation in embedded software and services the cfo asked me to stay as one of the engineering directors came in for a meeting i wish i hadn’t — the director was there to protest the forced relocation of his entire person team from palo alto to the east bay “today most of my team walks to work or takes the train there the move will have them commuting for another  minutes we’re going to lose a lot of them” the director had complained to his boss the vp of engineering who admitted his hands were tied as this was a “facilities matter” and the vp of facilities reported to the cfo so this was a meeting of last resort as the engineering director was making one last appeal to the cfo to keep his team in town while a significant part of the headcount of this tech company was in manufacturing the director’s group was made up of experienced software engineers given they could get new jobs by just showing up at the local coffee shop i was stunned by the cfo’s reply “too bad but we need the space they’re lucky they work here if they leave at least they’ll have ‘name of our company’ on their resume” wtf i wasn’t sure who was more shocked the director or me after the director left i must have looked pretty surprised as the cfo explained “we have tens of thousands of employees and at the rate we’re growing it’s almost impossible to keep up with our space needs in the bay area you know for our ceo ‘love us or leave us’ has been his policy from day one” by coincidence the ceo was an intern at one of my startups more than two decades ago i asked “now that the company is public and has grown so large has the policy changed” the cfo replied “no our ceo believes we are on a mission to change the world and you really have to want to work here or you ought to leave and because we’re inundated with resumes from people who want to work for us he sees no reason to change” i don’t know what was more sobering thinking that the policy which might have made sense as a scrappy startup was now being applied to a company with  employees or that the phrase “…we are on a mission to change the world and you really have to want to work here or you ought to leave…” was the exact same line i used when the nowceo was my intern adult supervision before the rapid rise of unicorns startups with a valuation over a billion dollars when boards were still in control they “encouraged” the hiring of “adult supervision” of the founders after they found productmarket fit the belief then was that most founders couldn’t acquire the hr finance sales and board governance skills rapidly enough to steer the company to a liquidity event so they hired professional managers these new ceos would also act as a brake to temper the founder’s excesses in the last decade technology investors realized that these professional ceos were effective at maximizing but not finding product cycles yet technology cycles have become a treadmill and to survive startups need to be on a continuous innovation cycle this requires retaining a startup culture for years – and who is best to do that the founders founders are comfortable in the chaos and disorder in contrast professional managers attempt to bring order to chaos and often kill the startup culture in the process venture firms realized that teaching a founding ceo how to grow a company is easier than teaching the professional ceo how to find the new innovation for the next product cycle and they were right  it was true in the company i was visiting— and in the last five years over  other unicorns have emerged and most still have their founders at the helm and so this startup found itself with a “founder friendly” board that believed that the company could grow at a greater rate if the founding ceo continued to run the company this founder’s reality distortion field attracted a large number of employees who shared his vision it was so compelling everyone worked extremely long hours for little pay and some stock they were lucky they got the timing right and after a painful couple of years figured out productmarket fit and went public and those early employees got rewarded as their stock turned into cash the problem was that at some point past employee  the big payoffs ended from prepublic stock and the stock’s subsequent runup from their ipo but the ceo never noticed that the payoff had ended for the other  of his company flying to his remote company locations in his private jet and surrounded by his early employees who were now worth tens of millions of dollars the mantra of “you really have to want to work here or you ought to leave” rang hollow for the latest employees the company was now attracting interns who did want the name of this hot company on their resume but since compensation was way below average they stayed just long enough to pump up their resumes and left for much better paying jobs – often in a startup and because fewer senior engineers considered it a great place to work the company’s initial technology advantage has started to erode wakeup call the downside of founders running large companies is that there are no written best practices no classes no standard model at all and given that in the past founders as a group were rarely in charge as startups became large companies it’s no surprise reprogramming founders who grew their business by being agile relentless tenacious and often aggressive and irrational and at times into ceos that can drive organizational growth is tough this means quickly learning a new set of skills sublimating large egos working through direct reports when their span of control can no longer encompass the entire company and building repeatable processes that enable scale at times this comes only after a crisis that provides a wakeup call as a startup scales into a company founders and the board need to realize that the most important transitions are not about systems buildings or hardware they’re about the company’s most valuable asset – its employees founders of great companies figure out how the keep their passion but put people before process postscript i can tell this story now as the director left the company and founded his own startup in a different market segment over the next six months  of the  employees in his group that were asked to relocate left  of them joined his new startup and of the other  who left  six new startups were formed lessons learned be careful of unintended consequences when you grow recognize the transition boundaries in company size recognize that what drove an innovation culture when you were small may no longer apply when you’re large share thisprintemailtweetwhatsapptelegramshare on tumblrpocketlike thislike loading filed under corporate innovation   comments » why a company can’t “be more like a startup” posted on june   by steveblank this article originally appeared in the harvard business review   as more and more companies face disruption from globalization new technology and startups that have more capital than the incumbents the continuing cry from wall street investors is “why can’t companies be as innovative as startups” here’s one reason why startups can do anything companies can only do what’s legal startups can do anything one of the unheralded advantages of a startup is what at first glance appears to be its weakness initially a startup has no business model and no market share to defend its employees and investors don’t depend on an existing revenue stream if they select a business model that targets industry incumbents they don’t have to worry about upsetting existing customers partners or distribution channels yet those very weaknesses give startups an overwhelming advantage in innovation  startups can try any idea and any business model—even those that are on the surface patently illegal at times laws and regulations are in place for the health and safety of consumers but often the legal obstacles confronting startups have been put in place by companies that look to the government and regulators as their first line of defense against new market entrants existing companies also use network effects of monopoliesduopolies distribution channel kickbacks etc to stifle competition in the past these antiinnovation tools were sufficient to keep new entrants out but today investors realize that companies that depend on regulation and artificial market constraints are actually vulnerable once presented with an alternative to the status quo customers who have been locked into rentseeking companies flock to innovative startups with business models that provide better service lower prices etc enormous financial returns are available to startups taking on incumbents regulators and the law so startup investors comfortable making a risk capital bet are actively encouraging startups to go after large static industries that look prime for disruption here are some of the most visible examples uber – current valuation  billion – knew the day they started that their ridesharing service violated the law in most jurisdictions carrying passengers for payment historically considered commercial use was regulated in most cities  in addition some cities put an artificial limit on the number of taxi operators by requiring them to buy medallions and agree to a set of local regulations  uber ignored all of these requirements and reinvented local transportation by offering a more convenient service today new york city has  yellowtaxi medallions and more than  uber and lyft cars paypal – acquired by ebay three years after it was founded for  billion – started as a money transfer system for buyers and sellers on ebay banks protested that paypal was an unregulated bank and of course are regulated by the federal government and states as paypal grew incumbent banks forced it to register in each state ironically once paypal complied with state regulations by registering as a “money transmitter” on a statebystate basis it created a barrier to entry for future new entrants airbnb – current valuation  billion – allows people to rent out their homes rooms or apartments to visitors not surprisingly airbnb violates local housing laws and regulations in many cities  none of the renters pay hotel or tourist tax  every airbnb rental is a lost night of revenue for hotels that hate it  the company has more rooms available then any hotel chain tesla – current valuation  billion – sells cars directly through its own distribution channel to protect auto dealerships in the s direct sales by an automobile manufacturer were made illegal in most states in the us  because tesla believed that existing auto dealers would have no incentive to sell electric cars they created an alternative option for consumers companies can do anything legal in the th century companies worried about increasing their market share profit margins return on investment and return on net assets they tenaciously protected their existing markets from other existing companies that were using the same business model they very rarely worried about disruption from new firms as the barriers to entry financial legal regulatory were so high ironically once companies become locked in their entrenched market positions it became difficult for them to compete by breaking the same laws or untangling their existing channel relationships in contrast to startups companies are constrained by local state and federal laws and regulations  the risk of breaking laws can result in large penalties and shareholder lawsuits  the justice department and state attorneys general find large companies attractive targets as a consequence one of the roles of the legal department in large corporations is to protect the company from straying into any legal or regulatory danger for example when volkswagen discovered their diesel cars couldn’t pass us pollution standards it faked the tests by programming cars to pass inspections however in normal driving these cars put out over  times the allowed nitrous oxide pollutants allowed by law  after it was discovered legal penalties cost volkswagen  billion and several indicted executives yet trying to stay within the legal lines companies paint themselves into a corner by creating their own internal barriers to innovation instead of innovating most industries being disrupted turn to litigation to compete with tesla’s direct sales to consumers gm ford and the rest of the auto industry either have to shut tesla out of selling directly to consumers or they have to abandon their own dealer networks and sell directly as well it’s an untenable and unsustainable position as consumers find car salesmen to be one of the least trusted groups to defend their dealer network car makers decided to litigate instead of innovating taxi companies needed to start copying uber’s business model but instead they turned to lobbyists and legislation to convince cities that deregulated ridesharing was a bad idea hotel chains burdened with even a greater capital investment in their physical buildings are doing the same thing corporations using existing business models have people processes and revenue goals that can’t be changed overnight these incumbents tend to have shortterm goals and incentives stock price quarterly earnings yearend bonuses and often fail to recognize that more money can be made on new platforms and new distribution channels in each case litigation versus innovation is seems obvious choice what can a company do the introduction of new technology has always been disruptive to existing markets particularly to those who sell through wellestablished distribution channels and have extensive capital equipment and fixed investments but today as disruption happens faster and is funded at enterprise scale companies need to figure how to create a portfolio of innovation they can do so by first identifying technology trends with innovation outposts located in technology centers second by investing in earlystage disruptors third – buying disruptors and keeping their innovation culture and people while fourth creating an innovation culture internally that disrupts their own business model before others do share thisprintemailtweetwhatsapptelegramshare on tumblrpocketlike thislike

steveblank automobile manufacturers shipped  million cars in  tesla shipped  yet wall street values tesla higher than any other us car manufacturer what explains this more than  to  discrepancy in valuation the future — too many people compare tesla to what already exists and that’s a mistake tesla is not another car company at the turn of the th century most people compared existing buggy and carriage manufacturers to the new automobile companies they were both transportation and they looked vaguely similar with the only apparent difference that one was moved by horses attached to the front while the other had an unreliable and very noisy internal combustion engine they were different and one is now only found in museums companies with business models built around internal combustion engines disrupted those built around horses  that’s the likely outcome for every one of today’s automobile manufacturers tesla is a new form of transportation disrupting the incumbents here are four reasons why electric cars pollute less have fewer moving parts are quieter and faster than existing cars today the technology necessary affordable batteries with sufficient range for them to be a viable business have all just come together most observers agree that autonomous electric cars will be the dominate form of transportation by midcentury that’s bad news for existing car companies first car companies have over a century of expertise in designing and building efficient mechanical propulsion systems – internal combustion engines for motive power and transmissions to drive the wheels if existing car manufacturers want to build electric vehicles all those design skills and most of the supply chain and manufacturing expertise are useless and not only useless but they become this legacy of capital equipment and headcount that is now a burden to a company in a few years the only thing useful in existing factories building traditional cars will be the walls and roof second while the automotive industry might be  times larger than tesla tesla may actually have more expertise and dollars committed to the electric car ecosystem than any legacy car company tesla’s investment in lithiumion battery factory the gigafactory its electric drive train design and manufacturing output exceed the sum of the entire automotive industry third the future of transportation is not only electric it’s autonomous and connected a lot has been written about selfdriving cars and as a reminder automated driving comes in multiple levels level  the car gives you warnings but driver maintains control of the car for example blind spot warning level  the driver and the car share control for example adaptive cruise control acc where the driver controls steering and the automated system controls speed level  the automated system takes full control of the vehicle accelerating braking and steering the driver monitors and intervenes if the automated system fails to respond level  the driver can text or watch a movie the vehicle will handle situations that call for an immediate response like emergency braking the driver must be prepared to intervene within some limited time when called upon by the vehicle level  no driver attention is ever required for safety ie the driver may safely go to sleep or leave the driver’s seat level  no human intervention is required for example a robotic taxi each level of autonomy requires an exponential amount of software engineering design and innovation while cars have had an everincreasing amount of software content the next generation of transportation are literally computers on wheels much like in electric vehicle drive trains autonomy and connectivity are not core competencies of existing car companies fourth large existing companies are executing a known business model and have built processes procedures and key performance indicators to measure progress to a known set of goals but when technology disruption happens electric drive trains autonomous vehicles etc changing a business model is extremely difficult very few companies manage to make the transition from one business model to another and while tesla might be the first mover in disrupting transportation there is no guarantee they will be the ultimate leader however the question shouldn’t be why tesla has such a high valuation the question should be why the existing automobile companies aren’t valued like horse and buggy companies lesson learned few market leaders in an industry being disrupted make the transition to the new industry the assets expertise and mindset that made them leaders in the past are usually the baggage that prevents them from seeing the future share thisprintemailtweetwhatsapptelegramshare on tumblrpocketlike

class at stanford eight teams presented their lessons learned presentations hacking for defense is a battletested problemsolving methodology that runs at silicon valley speed it combines the same lean startup methodology used by the national science foundation to commercialize science with the rapid problem sourcing and curation methodology developed on the battlefields in afghanistan and iraq by colonel pete newell and the us army’s rapid equipping force goals for the hacking for defense class our primary goal was to teach students entrepreneurship while they engaged in a national public service today if college students want to give back to their country they think of teach for america the peace corps or americorps or perhaps the us digital service or the gsa’s f few consider opportunities to make the world safer with the department of defense intelligence community or other government agencies our second goal was to teach our sponsors the innovators inside the department of defense dod and intelligence community ic that there is a methodology that can help them understand and better respond to rapidly evolving asymmetric threats that if we could get teams to rapidly discover the real problems in the field using lean methods and only then articulate the requirements to solve them could defense acquisition programs operate at speed and urgency and deliver timely and needed solutions finally we also wanted to show our sponsors in the department of defense and intelligence community that civilian students can make a meaningful contribution to problem understanding and rapid prototyping of solutions to realworld problems the class here’s a brief description of the lean methodology our students used if you can’t see the video click here our mantra to the students was that we wanted them to learn about “deployment not demos” our observation is that the dod has more technology demos than they need but often lack deep problem understanding  our goal was to have the students first deeply understand their sponsors problem – before they started building solutions as you can imagine with a roomful of technologists this was tough further we wanted the students to understand all parts of the mission model canvas not just the beneficiaries and the value proposition we wanted them to learn what it takes to get their productservice deployed to the field not give yet another demo to a general this meant that the minimal viable products the students built were focused on maximizing their learning of what to build not just building prototypes our sponsors did remind us that at times getting a solution deployed meant that someone did have to see a demo the hacking for defense class was designed as “fundamental research” to be shared broadly and the results are not subject to restriction for proprietary or national security reasons in the  weeks the students have hacking for defense hardware and software prototypes don’t advance beyond a technology readiness level  and remain outside the scope of us export control regulations and restrictions on foreign national participation results eight teams spoke to over  beneficiaries requirements writers program managers warfighters legal security customers etc seven out of the eight teams realized that the problem as given by the sponsor really wasn’t the problem their sponsors agreed received from a problem sponsor midlive stream broadcast “we are working funding for this team now” over half the student teams have decided to continue working on national security projects after this class this is the end each of the eight teams presented a minute video to provide context about their problem and then gave an minute presentation of their lessons learned over the weeks each of their slide presentation follow their customer discovery journey all the teams used the mission model canvas customer development and agile engineering to build minimal viable products but all of their journeys were unique the teams presented in front of several hundred people in person and online st century frogman if you can’t see the video click here   the

offered at eight universities in addition to stanford – georgetown  university of pittsburgh boise state uc san diego james madison university university of southern mississippi and later this year university of southern california and columbia university we established hacking for defenseorg a nonprofit to train educators and to provide a single point of contact for connecting the dodic sponsor problems to these universities the department of defense has expanded their use of hacking for defense to include a classified version and corporate partners are expanding their efforts to support the course and to create their own internal hacking for defense courses another surprise was how applicable the “hacking for x…” methodology is for other problems working with the state department we offered a hacking for diplomacy class at stanford both the defense and diplomacy classes created lots of interest from organizations that have realized that this “hacking for x…” problemsolving methodology is equally applicable to solving public safety energy policy community and social issues internationally and within our own communities this fall a series of new “hacking for x…” classes will address these deserving communities these include hacking for impact helping ngo’s and nonprofits at berkeley hacking for energy at columbia hacking for urban resilience cities at stanford hacking for journalism at stanford if you’re interested in learning how to apply a “hacking for x…” class in your workplace or school we’ve partnered with the  incubator in washington dc to offer a day “hacking for x…” certification course  july for those interested in learning how sign up here it takes a village while i authored this blog post these classes are a team project the teaching team consisted of joe felter a retired army special forces colonel with research and teaching appointments at stanford’s center for international security and cooperation cisac the hoover institution and

president florizone dean charlebois dr hewitt and dr kilfoil for the invitation to speak today and thank you for the honorary degree i’m honored to speak at a university whose motto is pray and work it’s pretty close to the one i had as an entrepreneur which was – pray it will work — first my congratulations your degree is a big deal this is your day not mine at worst a commencement speaker is all that stands between you and lunch at best i can give you something to think about as you embark on the next chapter in your life — what i wondered would i have said to a group of graduates living on the edge of a revolution the day writing was invented or the year after gutenberg printed the first book or when radio reached into the homes of millions  what advice would i have given to those about to enter a world no one had ever experienced whether you like it or not or know it or not you’re coming of age at just that extraordinary time in human development let me be honest about my bias  i love technology i’ve spent my life at the center of innovation in silicon valley –  doing eight startups in  years and the last  years in academia teaching others innovation and entrepreneurship i was present at the creation of the first microprocessors participated in the pc revolution built video games and shipped software on the first internet browsers and i’ve watched how in a blink of an eye technology went from products used by the very few to ending up in the pockets of billions bringing social change and corporate disruption but nothing absolutely nothing i’ve experienced will come close to what you’re going to see only a few generations have been granted the role of determining whether a revolution in communication will allow our better angels – or our darker angels – to win you leave here with incredible opportunity but also with immense responsibility — half the world now owns a smartphone on an average day you’ll look at your phone over  times you’ve gone through college interacting with your friends and connecting to the world using facebook instagram whatsapp snapchat twitter tinder pandora pinterest uber youtube and other apps i don’t even know living “phone forward” and connecting to the world through this software seems normal – to you you communicate interact and network with each other in a way that’s unique in the history of our species faster with infinitely more data in shorter bursts with more connections to more people and places we now know that the way we consume information changes our brains whether new forms of communication physically change our gray matter or just cause us to use different parts of it is still open to debate but clearly our brains process information differently depending on the form of communication we’re engaged in your brains have been rewired to process all this netbased information your brains are dealing with the world in a different way than humans ever have that kind of profound shift has occurred only six times in the entire year history of homo sapiens and you here today are the vanguard of the seventh wave each time this happened the human race made major leaps forward your generation all of you graduating today are our unintended science experiment have we have given you a gift or a curse let’s look at what happened the six other times our brains were rewired — if you remember from your anthropology class modern humans emerged about  years ago and with them spoken language for the next  years we passed information on to one another via stories you sat by a fire looked at the stars and listened to a storyteller recount creation myths hero myths and stories for entertainment and your imagination was engaged as you filled in the details over thousands of years these storytellers rewired their own brains into something different from those who were simply listening storytellers trained to memorize outrageously long narratives more than most humans alive today can storytellers had new brains — after more than  years of telling stories something unprecedented happened a few merchants in the mideast created writing at first to keep track of crops i think it’s appropriate to remind a university class that some of the oldest written inscriptions were not only about crops but also the celebration of beer with written text the minds of the readers required a whole new way of processing information we now had to first learn how to read and then we had to understand what the words were trying to tell us readers and writers of language had new brains the written word also meant that information could now be standardized our better angels blossomed we could formalize laws create religious texts and communicate orders to coordinate activities farther than the spoken word could travel written language enabled the creation of large societies and with them governments our darker angels also found ways to use the written word – to dominate and oppress others — but in  gutenberg rocked the world when he invented the printing press until the middle of the th century most people couldn’t read the mass production of books changed that within  years books created an information explosion across europe – ’s of thousands of titles and ’s of millions of copies of books our better angels soared as printed books became the internet of the renaissance readers of books now had new brains and mass production of printed books fueled a reconfiguration of our society not just our brains with the printing press it only took a couple of months to spread martin luther’s  theses over much of northern europe the result was the protestant reformation which ushered in a new era of political intellectual and cultural change our darker angels were frightened by the free and unfettered access to information – and banned books – and burned heretics that challenged church and state dogma — it took about two centuries from the appearance of the book to the emergence of what we would now call newspapers – mass communication had arrived the first weekly newspapers appeared in italy and germany and quickly spread through europe in canada the first newspaper ever was right here – the halifax gazette by the end of the th century mass circulation papers had developed the characteristics that your parents would recognize today—headlines illustrations entertaining stories – all designed to shortcut critical thinking and stir passion and emotion to sell newspapers and of course advertising now newspaper readers had a daily or weekly stream of “clickbait” headlines readers of newspapers had new brains — the next wave was radio it gave us instantaneous communication to national audiences  advertisers immediately figured out how to turn those engaged audiences into consumers and some governments learned how to turn radio into a weapon of mass deception radio meant that we could now hear the voices of storytellers again as our brains were newly engaged our imaginations were required to translate the spoken words into mental pictures listeners to radio had new brains — it wasn’t more than  years from widespread radio that television came onto the scene tv was something different than just radio with voices our better angels shined a light into homes and battlefields across the world it changed for the better how we viewed race gender and class but our darker angels dimmed our imaginations we could gaze all evening and disengage our brains viewers of television had new – and slightly diminished –  brains for decades the phrase “as seen on tv” sold as many products as it obliterated much critical thinking not only did this work for commercial products but it also extended to politicians  a handsome young telegenic politician could capture a country — and that brings us to today i don’t have to explain the internet to you you live it you’re immersed in it but let me take a minute to contrast it with the world i grew up in i spent my first seventeen years in a city where there were just three major tv channels three major newspapers and no internet if i wanted to look something up i had to go to library  if i wanted to connect with a friend i used a hardwired phone at a desk at home or paid for each call by physically putting money into a phone in a booth  and that was in new york city  the rest of the world had much much less the net is like we invented writing the printing press radio tv and the internet in the same decade  that’s the world you’re graduating into – immersed in social media with infinite facts and continuous news the seventh wave in communication and brain rewiring has arrived you think and process things differently from how your parents grandparents and any other humans who have ever lived when each of the other six waves initially arrived the early adopters were the more agile outliers but ultimately governments and companies figured out how to master the new technology and individuals lost as the power of the state and power of profit controlled the new media the same is true for the internet today china russia north korea and other countries have locked their citizens behind a great firewall they control what their citizens can see and access yet at the same time facebook google twitter and the rest of social media capture more personal information on you than any government security agency — except their goal is to profit from your presence so what does this mean for you you’ve been in a university where information distribution in your classroom was not a democracy there were voices of expertise and authority you had certified data providers called professors you didn’t vote on whether you believed what you were taught in fact you were graded on how well you understood it but you’re entering a world where you won’t have such certainty let me give you an example of the challenges you are going to face in a  internet world on a personal level as a citizen and in your career you deal in streams of shortform information –  characters pictures and messages that disappear the question for you is how will you deal with issues that are more complex than soundbites and require deep dives every generation has had to deal with “fake news” – deliberate misinformation spread by storytelling books newspaper radio and tv it had different names in the past — “yellow journalism” propaganda misinformation but unlike in previous generations fake news today is like a social disease – you catch it from your “friends” and the feeling of validity that comes from hearing something from someone you know makes social media much more powerful than what you see on tv or read in a newspaper in your generation facebook is one of the leading sources of fake news and that’s a shame since facebook is not a news source it doesn’t originate news it’s just a distributor of news – one designed to get you to spend time on their site click on their ads and gather your personal information today ap and bloomberg already have bots that write sports stories and earnings reports soon machines will make the news by optimizing stories for clicks before long computers will create fake videos – and we won’t be able to tell the difference between what was created by a human and what’s computer generated what kind of skills will you need to operate in a world of real and fake manufactured data coming from friends will you vote for people who value facts or manufacture them will you let darker angels win as you add fire to the flame or will you seek out and spread real news we’ve become digital junkies information consumption and engagement with social media means these platforms have become your emotional drug dealers “likes” and thumbs up and posting on social media are addictive at times like a chemical dependency they provide immediate rewards after each interaction they prey on the “fear of missing out” – of the moment or event your sense of identity and your values are now validated by a crowd research shows that talking about your own views generates more emotional rewards than listening to conflicting ones this becomes a selfreinforcing system as you seek out sources of information and other people that support your world view  it creates a polarized world addiction is one of our perpetual dark angels you need a purposedriven life to survive in a world where social media is monetizing both your emotions and your time spent looking at ads finally the net has the power to pull us apart as well as bring us together each wave in the last  years – storytelling writing books newspapers radio tv and the net – started with the optimistic view that if we could communicate faster and more efficiently it would bring out the better angels of our nature we could be more cohesive we could be smarter we could learn new things that would help us make the world a better place all these things happened and yet… at each step forward our darker angels found a way to use these tools too in spite of that today the human race is in a better place than in any time in human history each advancement in our capabilities to communicate gave us the ability to reject a world dominated by violence and ignorance for a world where knowledge and cooperation drove civilization forward — most revolutions are not obvious when they happen when the first scribe wrote on a tablet no one said “this is the day everything changes”  when the first bible came off gutenberg’s press no one said “there will be billions of these” i do not believe that any of you would exchange places with any other generation but the question is whether you’ll tell your children that this decade was the beginning of a new dark age or whether it was the time of something new and wonderful when it was the time the internet and social media allowed us to work faster and more collaboratively when scientific discoveries and technological breakthroughs were integrated into the fabric of society faster than they had ever been before and when how businesses operated changed forever — now graduates of  as you turn back to your phones light a path for the better angels the world is counting on you thank you if you can’t see the video click here share thisprintemailtweetwhatsapptelegramshare on

company managers there are now a few books that specifically address founders needs alexander osterwalder’s business model generation is the first book that allows you to answer “what’s your business model” intelligently and with precision make sure this one is on your shelf osterwalders followon book value proposition design describes how to get productmarket fit right  it’s another “must have” for your bookshelf eric ries was the best student i ever had he took the customer development process combined it with agile engineering and actually did the first implementation in a startup his insights about the combined customer developmentagile process and its implications past startups into large corporations is a sea change in thinking his book the lean startup is a “must have” for your shelf ben horowitz’s the hard thing about hard things is a series essays about what ceo face in the “build” phase – the transition from searching for a business model into a company it’s impossible to implement any of this if you don’t understand agile development extreme programming explained by one of the pioneers of agile kent beck is a great tutorial if you don’t understand values principles and practices in xp it makes customer development almost impossible if you’re in a large company the other side of innovation makes sense of how to actually insert innovation into an execution organization  if you’re starting a medical device company biodesignthe process of  innovating medical technologies is a must have it has a great customer discovery process talking to humans is a great

established company the innovators dna rings true about the skills founders need to have crossing the chasm made me understand that there are repeatable patterns in early stage companies it started my search for the repeatable set of patterns that preceded the chasm  the tipping point has made me realize that marketing communications strategies for companies in new markets often follow the tipping point blue ocean strategy is a great way to look at what i’ve called “market type” technological revolutions and financial capital – carlota perez the other side of innovation – vijay govindarajan  chris trimble the innovator’s dilemma  the innovator’s solution by clayton m christensen the innovator’s dna mastering the five skills of disruptive innovators – jeff dyer hal gregersen clayton m

analysis and offer tactical marketing campaign advice do more faster identifies issues that firsttime entrepreneurs encounter and offer useful advice getting real is webfocussed wasserman’s founders dilemma is essential reading to building a great startup team these books are classics but timeless the entrepreneurial mindset articulates the critically important idea that there are different types of startup opportunities  the notion of three market types springs from here and christensen’s work  the book provides a framework for the early marketingsales strategies essential in a startup  delivering profitable value talks more about value propositions and value delivery systems than you ever want to hear again  however this is one of the books you struggle through and then realize you learned something valuable schumpeter’s book theory of economic development is famous for his phrase “creative destruction”  and its relevance to entrepreneurship peter drucker’s concept of the corporation was the first insiders view of how a decentralized company gm works his practice of management defined “management by objective” and innovation and entrepreneurship is a classic while written for a corporate audience read it for the sources of innovation if you write software you already know about fred brooks classic text the mythical man month if you manage a software company you need to read it so you don’t act like dilbert’s pointyhaired boss peppers and rogers the one to one future opened my eyes to concepts of lifetime value most profitable customers and the entire customer lifecycle of “get keep and grow” bill davidow’s marketing high technology introduced me to the concept of “whole product” and the unique needs of mainstream customers michael porter is the father of competitive strategy his books competitive strategy competitive advantage and on competition are still the standards the marketing playbook – john

entrepreneurship in the enterprise how large companies can stay innovative and entrepreneurial has been the holy grail for authors of business books business schools consulting firms etc  there’s some great work from lots of authors in this area but i’d start by reading the other side of innovation next i’d read the alchemy of growth to understand the three horizons of innovation and the future of mangement and consider its implications  rita mcgrath’s the end of competitive advantage shows companies how to take advantage of transient competitive advantage  stanley mcchrystal’s team of teams is a real world example of chapter  of the four steps to the epiphany  ed catmull’s description of the pixar innovation process in creativity inc is a great synthesis of how founders in startup innovate translated into a corporate continuous innovation process then i’d read the short harvard business review articles eric von hippel work on new product introduction methodologies and the notion of “lead users” offer many parallels with customer discovery and validation but like most books on the subject it’s written from the point of view of a large company von hippel’s four steps of  goal generation and team formation  trend research  lead user pyramid networking and  lead user workshop and idea improvement is a more rigorous and disciplined approach then suggested in our book the four steps to the epiphany  if you’re a midlevel manager in a company or government agency trying to figure out how to your ideas adopted you need to own a copy of rebelswork – it will save your sanity and corporate cultures is a classic about the stories heroes values and rituals that build a corporate culture books the other side of innovation – vijay govindarajan  chris trimble the alchemy of growth

garvinlynne levesque oct  the innovators dna jeffrey dyer hal gregersen clayton christensen dec  “war as strategy” books the metaphor that business is war is both a cliché and points to a deeper truth  many basic business concepts competition leadership strategy versus tactics logistics etc have their roots in military affairs the difference is that in business no one dies  at some time in your business life you need to study war or become a casualty  sun tzu covered all the basics of strategy in the art of war until the advent of technology temporarily superseded him also in the same vein try the book of five rings by miyamoto musashi  these two books have unfortunately turned into business clichés but they are still timeless reading  carl von clausewitz’s on war is a th century western attempt to understand war the “boyd” book the fighter pilot who changed the art of war is a biography and may seem out of place here but john boyd’s ooda loop is at the core of customer development and the pivot read it and then look at all the web sites for boyd papers particularly patterns of conflict the new lanchester strategy is so offbeat that it tends to be ignored  its ratios of what you require to attack or defend a market keep coming up so often in real life that i’ve found it hard to ignore the art of war by sun tzu translated by thomas cleary or the one by griffith the book of five rings by miyamoto musashi on war by carl von clausewitz’s  everyman’s library series boyd the fighter pilot who changed the art of war by robert coram andor the mind of war john boyd and american security by grant t hammond lanchester strategy an introduction by taoka andor new lanchester strategy sales and marketing strategy for the weak new lanchester strategy by shinichi yano kenichi sato connie prener marketing communications books ries and trout positioning books can be read in a plane ride yet after all these years they are still a smack on the side of the head  regis mckenna has always been a favorite of mine however as you read relationship marketing separate out the examples regis uses into either startups or large sustainable businesses  what worked in one won’t necessarily work in another  read these books first before you dive into the st century stuff like seth godin seth godin “gets deeply” the profound changes the internet is having in the way we think about customers and communicating with them  godin’s all marketers are liars talks about the power of storytelling in marketing his permission marketing book crystallized a direct marketing technique permission marketing which was simply impossible to achieve preinternet  read his ideavirus after you’ve read permission marketing made to stick gives you the tools to make your messages “sticky” i put sway here because great marketers know how to find these irrational behaviors lakoff’s book don’t think of an elephant while written for a political audience has some valuable insights on framing communications positioning the battle for your mind the th anniversary edition and the  immutable laws of marketing violate them at your own risk by al ries jack trout all marketers are liars by seth godin made to stick why some ideas survive and others die by chip and dan heath relationship marketing successful strategies for the age of the customer by regis mckenna permission marketing turning strangers into friends and friends into customers and unleashing the ideavirus  by seth godin don’t think of an elephant by george lakoff sway the irresistible pull of irrational behavior by ori brafman sales lean analytics is a great discussion about metrics that matter for webmobile startups predictable revenue is one of those short smart tactical books that you need to read if you have a direct sales force thomas freese is the master of consultative selling both his books are a great start in understanding how a pro sells cracking the sales management code provides a best practice approach to on how to effectively manage a sales force jeff thull’s mastering the complex sale has a lot of elements of customer discovery and validation but skip the first  pages many of the ideas of customer validation are based on the principles articulated by bosworth heiman and rackham bostworth’s solution selling and it’s successor the new solution selling are must reads for any executive launching a new product  its articulation of the hierarchy of buyers needs as well its description of how to get customers to articulate their needs makes this a “must read” particularly those selling to businesses yet in his new book what great salespeople do he says ignore those books follow this advice heiman’s books are a bit more tactical and are part of a comprehensive sales training program from his company millerheiman  if you are in sales or have a sales background you can skip these  but if you aren’t they are all worth reading for the basic “blocking and tackling” advice  the only bad news is that heiman writes like a loud salesman – but the advice is sound rackham’s spin selling is another series of books about major account large ticket item sales with again the emphasis on selling the solution not features  lets get real is of the sandler school of selling another school of business to business sales methodology jill konrath has great strategies and insights for large sales baseline selling uses baseball metaphors but it’s an effective explanation of how to do consultative selling i sure could have used the complete idiots guide to cold calling

kill you but most books and lawyers speak in their own arcane language david weekly’s an introduction to stock and options should be your first read unfortunately its kindle only  the entrepreneurs guide to business law is the one book you ought to have on your shelf  while not written explicitly for silicon valley startups it demystifies the most common areas you need to know term sheets and

options etc gordon bells’ book hightech venturesis incomprehensible on the first second or third read  yet it is simply the best “operating manual” for startups that has been written  the only glaring flaw is bell’s assumption that a market exists for the product and that marketing’s job is data sheets and trade shows  read it in doses for insight and revelation and make notes think of reading the bible rather than reading it straight through high tech start up the complete handbook for creating successful new high tech companies by john l nesheim engineering your startup a guide for the hightech entrepreneur by michael l bair hightech ventures the guide for entrepreneurial success by gordon bell startup textbooks if you take an entrepreneurship class in a business school or university you’ll probably encounter one of these textbooksthe reason you don’t see them on the desks of working entrepreneurs is that at  they’re all priced for a captive student audience some do

design these are the two books i refer entrepreneurs to who want to build a killer customer presentation the advice may not work for all audiences but it’s a great place to start cooper’s book the inmates are running the asylum is about product design it had the same impact on me as moore’s crossing the chasm – “why of course that’s what’s wrong”  it’s important and articulate slideology

collins the same author who wrote built to last both are books that “you should be so lucky” to read  what differentiates good companies versus great  how do you institutionalize core values into a company that enable it to create value when the current management is long gone  when i first read these i thought they were only for companies that were lucky enough to get big  upon reflection these books were the inspiration for the “missionoriented culture”  read these two books together ironically the best hr stuff for anyone in a startup to read is not a book  it is the work james baron at stanford has done    download his slides on the stanford project on emerging companies  baron’s book strategic human resources – is a classic hr textbook finally if you are working at a startup and

notes from those presentations are available anywhere in printable form very enjoyable series – thank you likelike reply bear on september   at  pm said please please please remove the overwhelming multitude of embedded videos from this page that are actually loading and cuing videos to play the embedded youtube videos are perfectly fine because youtube makes embedding smart and easy and their method of embedding is light in its resource demands however the additional videos that you have embedded from other hosting platforms like videopress and vimeo are resource hogs and they are causing this page either to take minutes to load or to cause the browser firefox chrome others to crash in memory instead please provide links to these videos that launch in a new page or in unique viewer alternatively you could also use a plugin to create a video gallery or unique player in wordpress the previous recommended solution link to video and open in new page or window though is easier and quicker to implement please note that this problem was addressed to you in the comments by someone else almost  years ago and has obviously either not merited the attention it deserves or has simply not been corrected for reasons unknown please see “kevin van horn on december   at  am said” just because a new macbook or pc with   gb of ram and its i i cpu can handle the demands of the massive data on this page does not mean that lesser endowed macbooks laptops ipads android tablets iphones or android phones can without adding the noscript plugin to the firefox browser and interrupting the loading of the page the incredible resource demands of all of these embedded videos causes firefox to crash in memory over and over and over again the chrome browser has a similar experience regardless of the device laptop tablet or smartphone the net effect of the huge amount of data and its requisite memory and processor demands is that the access to your content has been put behind an exclusive wall for an elite minority of users with the requisite higher end devices and that your much wider audience for this content has been effectively blocked from accessing it what is the point of sharing knowledge to a gated community we very much want to hear what you have to say and learn what you have to teach but the chosen method of sharing it on this page has effectively made that

hacking for diplomacy lean launchpad nsf national science foundation teaching   comments » hacking for defense  stanford  – lessons learned presentations posted on june   by steveblank we just finished our second hacking for defense class at stanford eight teams presented their lessons learned presentations hacking for defense is a battletested problemsolving methodology that runs at silicon valley speed it combines the same lean startup methodology used by the national science foundation to commercialize science with the rapid problem sourcing and curation methodology developed on the battlefields in afghanistan and iraq by colonel pete newell and the us army’s rapid equipping force goals for the hacking for defense class our primary goal was to teach students entrepreneurship while they engaged in a national public service today if college students want to give back to their country they think of teach for america the peace corps or americorps or perhaps the us digital service or the gsa’s f few consider opportunities to make the world safer with the department of defense intelligence community or other government agencies our second goal was to teach our sponsors the innovators inside the department of defense dod and intelligence community ic that there is a methodology that can help them understand and better respond to rapidly evolving asymmetric threats that if we could get teams to rapidly discover the real problems in the field using lean methods and only then articulate the requirements to solve them could defense acquisition programs operate at speed and urgency and deliver timely and needed solutions finally we also wanted to show our sponsors in the department of defense and intelligence community that civilian students can make a meaningful contribution to problem understanding and rapid prototyping of solutions to realworld problems the class here’s a brief description of the lean methodology our students used if you can’t see the video click here our mantra to the students was that we wanted them to learn about “deployment not demos” our observation is that the dod has more technology demos than they need but often lack deep problem understanding  our goal was to have the students first deeply understand their sponsors problem – before they started building solutions as you can imagine with a roomful of technologists this was tough further we wanted the students to understand all parts of the mission model canvas not just the beneficiaries and the value proposition we wanted them to learn what it takes to get their productservice deployed to the field not give yet another demo to a general this meant that the minimal viable products the students built were focused on maximizing their learning of what to build not just building prototypes our sponsors did remind us that at times getting a solution deployed meant that someone did have to see a demo the hacking for defense class was designed as “fundamental research” to be shared broadly and the results are not subject to restriction for proprietary or national security reasons in the  weeks the students have hacking for defense hardware and software prototypes don’t advance beyond a technology readiness level  and remain outside the scope of us export control regulations and restrictions on foreign national participation results eight teams spoke to over  beneficiaries requirements writers program managers warfighters legal security customers etc seven out of the eight teams realized that the problem as given by the sponsor really wasn’t the problem their sponsors agreed received from a problem sponsor midlive stream broadcast “we are working funding for this team now” over half the student teams have decided to continue working on national security projects after this class this is the end each of the eight teams presented a minute video to provide context about their problem and then gave an minute presentation of their lessons learned over the weeks each of their slide presentation follow their customer discovery journey all the teams used the mission model canvas customer development and agile engineering to build minimal viable products but all of their journeys were unique the teams presented in front of several hundred people in person and online st century frogman if you can’t see the video click here

defense is now offered at eight universities in addition to stanford – georgetown  university of pittsburgh boise state uc san diego james madison university university of southern mississippi and later this year university of southern california and columbia university we established hacking for defenseorg a nonprofit to train educators and to provide a single point of contact for connecting the dodic sponsor problems to these universities the department of defense has expanded their use of hacking for defense to include a classified version and corporate partners are expanding their efforts to support the course and to create their own internal hacking for defense courses another surprise was how applicable the “hacking for x…” methodology is for other problems working with the state department we offered a hacking for diplomacy class at stanford both the defense and diplomacy classes created lots of interest from organizations that have realized that this “hacking for x…” problemsolving methodology is equally applicable to solving public safety energy policy community and social issues internationally and within our own communities this fall a series of new “hacking for x…” classes will address these deserving communities these include hacking for impact helping ngo’s and nonprofits at berkeley hacking for energy at columbia hacking for urban resilience cities at stanford hacking for journalism at stanford if you’re interested in learning how to apply a “hacking for x…” class in your workplace or school we’ve partnered with the  incubator in washington dc to offer a day “hacking for x…” certification course  july for those interested in learning how sign up here it takes a village while i authored this blog post these classes are a team project the teaching team consisted of joe felter a retired army special forces colonel with research and teaching appointments at stanford’s center for international security and cooperation cisac the hoover institution and the dept of management science and engineering joe is the incoming deputy assistant secretary of defense for south and southeast asia pete newell is a retired army colonel currently a senior visiting research fellow at the national defense university’s center for technology and national security policy and ceo of bmnt partners steve weinstein a year veteran of silicon valley technology companies and hollywood media companies  steve is ceo of movielabs the joint rd lab of all the major motion picture studios our teaching assistants were all prior students issac matthews

loading filed under customer development hacking for defense lean launchpad   comments » herding cats – using lean to work together posted on march   by steveblank when colonel peter newell headed up the army’s rapid equipping force ref he used lean methods on the battlefields of iraq and afghanistan to provide immediate technology solutions to urgent problems today his company bmnt does for government and commercial customers what the rapid equipping force did for the us army pete and i created the hacking for defense class with joe felter and tom byers one of the problems our students run into is that there are always multiple beneficiaries and stakeholders associated with a problem often with conflicting value propositions and missions  so how do you figure out whose needs to satisfy here’s pete’s view of how you do it unlike businesses government organizations don’t sell products and they don’t earn revenue instead they have missions to accomplish and very hard problems to solve  they use a variant of the business model canvas –  the mission model canvas – to map their hypotheses and they get of the building to do beneficiary discovery a beneficiary can be a soldier program manager commanding general government contractor stakeholder customer etc  and just like in a commercial business they are trying to determine whether the value proposition solves the problem and helps the beneficiary accomplish their mission discovery for both business and government is similar in that the only way to do it is to turn assumptions into facts by generating hypotheses developing minimum viable products and getting out of the building to test those mvp’s in the trenches where the customers and beneficiaries work early in the discovery process teams are faced with a cacophony of personalities and organizations often they struggle with understanding which person or group represents a beneficiary supporter advocate or potential key partner it’s only through repetitive hypothesis testing that they begin to sort them all out it’s in the trenches however where things become different multiple beneficiaries multiple conflicts unlike their commercial counterparts government problem solvers are often faced with multiple beneficiaries associated with a problem often with conflicting value propositions as these differences become apparent teams must make decisions about the value proposition tradeoffs between conflicting beneficiaries – sometimes even pivoting completely in favor of one beneficiary to the detriment of another during last year’s hacking for defense class at stanford team aqualink experienced the conflicting beneficiaries’ problem  the result was a significant pivot of both beneficiary and value proposition aqualink started with a problem given to them from the chief medical officer of the navy seals – they had no way to understand chronic longterm health issues divers face divers work  to  feet underwater for  hours but navy doctors currently have no way to monitor divers’ core temperature maximum dive pressure blood pressure pulse and the rebreather air consumption or the dive computer dive profile data having all this new data would give a diver early warning of hypothermia or the bends more importantly the data would allow the medical director to individually assess the short and longterm health of each diver and medical researchers would have access to detailed physiological data the medical director tasked the team with building a wearable sensor system and developing apps that would allow divers to monitor their own physiological conditions while underwater and to download it for later analysis in the first week of the class this team got out of the building suited up in full navy diving gear and did customer discovery by spending an hour in the life of the beneficiary but as the students on the aqualink team spoke to the seal team divers another one of their beneficiaries they experienced an existential crisis most of the divers were “ambivalent” read hostile about the introduction of a vitals monitoring platform “if you gave to us at  it would end up on the bottom of the ocean by ” having worked so hard to get into the seals no diver wanted doctors telling them they could no longer dive after further questioning the team discovered the reason the divers were spending so much time underwater – they often did not know where they were to find out they had to get a gps fix this meant their minisub called the seal delivery vehicle had to rise to within  feet of the ocean surface so the gps antenna could broach the surface and to do so they had to surface slowly to avoid giving the divers the bends the divers told our student team “screw the health sensors build us a gps sensor that can be deployed from  feet underwater” now the team had a dilemma they would have to decide which beneficiary to focus on – the seal team medical director who was the sponsor of their problem or the operators of the delivery vehicle and divers within seal delivery vehicle team one along with their immediate chains of command in sdvt and naval special warfare group  when they went back to the medical director with their findings he was surprised as they were  “never knew that’s why they spent all that time down there  heck yes fix their problem first” understanding the problem context and problem ecosystem as aqualink shows getting out of the building – interviewing the beneficiaries drawing their workflows and mapping a dayin theirlife – will give you a more complete picture of the context in which a proposed problem exists talking to multiple beneficiaries will lead to better understanding of the entire ecosystem of the problem often this will show that the problem you have been given is merely a symptom of a larger problem or is the result of a different problem the solution is to cross check the results of your discovery between different beneficiaries often you’ll find that they seldom have a complete understanding of one another’s workflows and pain points but instead are championing the solution to a mere symptom of a different problem share what you learned in discovery among the different beneficiaries this will arm you with the tools needed to get them or their leadership to agree on the right problem that needs to be solved first in many cases this will lead to your first pivot the goal is to sort out who has a value proposition that must be addressed first the power of beneficiaries helping one another while discovery with multiple beneficiaries can be confusing and exhausting there is immense power when all the beneficiaries work together therefore the goal of customer discovery is not just to understand the pains and gains of individual beneficiaries but to find a shared purpose between all of them once they understand they share the same goal they can solve pain points or create gains for each other using the resources they already control a “shared” sense of purpose is a very powerful step in the pathway towards a deployable solution when the department of energy asked bmnt to build a training program for getting veterans into advanced manufacturing jobs we saw the power of a shared purpose between multiple beneficiaries first hand the problem we were asked to solve is that of the  veterans who leave military service every month many remain unemployed or underemployed yet at the same time the number of unfilled advanced manufacturing jobs in the us is expected to climb to over a million by  from a business perspective obtaining technically qualified talent is among the top constraints to growth in the us seems like it would be a match made in heaven right  not so fast… while we initially thought the beneficiaries of the effort were the veterans we quickly discovered there were other beneficiaries in advanced manufacturing we found these additional beneficiaries had different pains and gains which in turn required different value propositions to solve their problems our customer discovery taught us that there were three additional beneficiaries universities needed to grow their enrollments our discovery showed us universities were willing to create programming for advanced manufacturing but first needed to see a business case for how it would increase their enrollment to make it a worthwhile effort industry needed to attract and hire qualified employees we learned that technically qualified employees within industry were in such demand that the number one way to get qualified employees was to pilfer them from others government agencies needed to help their communities build skilled labor pools to attract new industries and we learned that our initial beneficiary veterans leaving service didn’t need internships or lowpaying jobs but needed jobs that paid enough to support their families we found each of these beneficiaries had a shared purpose and each of them had a value proposition that would create a gain or relieve a pain point for another beneficiary these were big ideas we found that as these overlapping value propositions emerged we used the results to get the beneficiaries to come together in a workshop designed to jointly create a shared minimum viable product that they could then use to test within their own organizations bringing the groups together in a workshop also served to align value propositions between beneficiaries by demonstrating that there was a way to create a single program that served all their needs and we created an environment that allowed each beneficiary to discover that the other beneficiaries were partners they could work with in the future what was the impact of bringing the beneficiaries together in a workshop and creating this beneficiary ecosystem for advanced manufacturing lawrence livermore national lab llnl created a veterans’ jobs program they teamed with a local college to create internships that allowed veterans to work during the summer  in turn the local college created additional advanced manufacturing classes to meet llnl’s technical needs and the regional workforce investment board provided funding in fort riley the army base in kansas the military teamed with kansas state university to create an advanced manufacturing program kansas state created a series of advanced manufacturing classes soldiers leaving the service can take these courses at a nearby campus beginning up to six months before they leave service an unexpected consequence is that today there are soldiers from fort riley using advanced manufacturing processes to create parts for vehicles and equipment at the army base lessons learned government problem solvers will often be faced with multiple beneficiaries with different value propositions share what you learn from different beneficiaries with each other to sort out which has a value proposition that must be addressed first the benefit of having multiple beneficiaries is that their strengths can be used to help one another create gains and relieve pains for one another creating a shared sense of empowerment from working together smooths the pathway towards scaling the right solution share thisprintemailtweetwhatsapptelegramshare on tumblrpocketlike thislike loading filed under customer development hacking for defense lean launchpad   comments » don’t let process distract you from finding the strategy posted on february   by steveblank when you’re up to your neck in alligators don’t forget the goal was to drain the swamp i love teaching because i learn something new every class this time it was “don’t let process distract you from finding the strategy” the latest “aha” moment for me when i was at columbia university teaching an intensive day version of the lean launchpadicorps class  the goal of the class is to expose students to the basics of the lean methodology – business model design customer development and agile engineering in this short version of the class students in teams of four spend half their day out of the classroom testing their hypotheses by talking to customers and building minimum viable products  the teams come back into the class and present what they found and then they get out and talk to more customers  repeat for  days  all teams talk to at least  customers partners stakeholders and some manage to reach more than  one of the teams wanted to create a new woman’s clothing brand the good news is that they were passionate smart and committed  the not so good news is that other than having been customers none of them had ever been in the fashion business but hey no problem  they had the lean startup model to follow they could figure it out by simply talking to customers and stores that carry unique fashion brands  how hard can this be by the second day the team appeared to be making lots of progress –  they had talked to many women about their clothing line and had marched up and down ny stores talking to buyers in clothing boutiques  they built detailed value proposition canvases for each customer segment young urban professional woman students etc –  trying to match customer pains gains and jobs to be done with their value proposition their new clothing line they were busily testing their hypotheses about customer segments and value proposition seeing if they could find productmarket fit in listening to them it dawned on me that i had fallen victim to teaching process rather than helping the teams gain insight i asked them to remind the class what business they were in  “we’re creating a clothing fashion brand” was the reply  i asked “and how much fashion brand expertise do you have as a team” “none we’re using customer discovery to quickly acquire it”  on the surface it sounded like a good answer but then i asked “has anyone on your team asked if any of your  classmates are in the apparelfashion business”  after a moment of reflection they did just that and eight of their classmates raised their hands i asked “do you think you might want to do customer discovery first on the domain experts in your own class”  a small lightbulb appeared over their heads a day later after interviewing their classmates the team discovered that when creating a woman’s clothing brand the clothing itself has less to do with success than the brand does and the one critical element in creating a brand is getting written about by a small group less than  of “brand influencers” reviewers editors etc in fashion magazines and blogs whoah… the big insight was that how you initially “get” these key influencers – not customers or stores – is the critical part of creating a clothing fashion brand this meant understanding these influencers was more important than anything else on the business model canvas the team immediately added brand influencers to their business model canvas created a separate value proposition canvas for them and started setting up customer discovery interviews the lessons this team was entering an existing market the team had already drawn the petal diagram mapping the competitive landscape in an existing market there is a track record for how new entrants create a brand get traction and scale many of the key insights about the business model and value proposition canvases are already known in an existing market going through customer discovery talking to customers buyers distribution channel etc without first asking “are there any insights that can be gained by understanding the incumbent strategies can be a trap for the unwary” ironically when i was entrepreneur i knew and practiced this when i started a new venture in existing markets i would spend part of my initial customer discovery attending conferences reading analysts’ reports and talking to domain experts to understand current market entry strategies none of this obligated me to follow the path of other companies at times i took this information and created a different strategy to disrupt the incumbents but as an educator i was getting trapped in teaching the process not the strategy the fashion brand team’s experience was a great wakeup call from now on my first question to startups in an existing market is “tell me the critical success factors of the existing incumbents” lessons learned in an existing market draw a petal diagram with adjacent companies focus part of your initial customer discovery on learning competitive insights describe how those companies entered the market what was critical   share

posted on january   by steveblank on the last day congress was in session in  democrats and republicans agreed on a bill that increased innovation and research for the country for me seeing congress pass this bill the american innovation and competitiveness act was personally satisfying it made the program i helped start the national science foundation innovation corps icorps a permanent part of the nation’s science ecosystem icorps uses lean startup methods to teach scientists how to turn their discoveries into entrepreneurial jobproducing businesses  icorps bridges the gap between public support of basic science and private capital funding of new commercial ventures it’s a model for a government program that’s gotten the balance between publicprivate partnerships just right over  teams of our nation’s best scientists have been through the program the bill directs the expansion of icorps to additional federal agencies and academic institutions as well as through state and local governments  the new icorps authority also supports prototype or proofofconcept development activities which will better enable researchers to commercialize their innovations the bill also explicitly says that turning federal research into companies is a national goal to promote economic growth and benefit society for the first time congress has recognized the importance of governmentfunded entrepreneurship and commercialization education training and mentoring programs specifically saying that this will improve the nation’s competitiveness and finally this bill acknowledges that networks of entrepreneurs and mentors are critical in getting technologies translated from the lab to the marketplace this bipartisan legislation was crafted by senators cory gardner r–co and gary peters d–mi senator john thune r–sd chairs the senate commerce and science committee that crafted s  after years of contention over reauthorizing the national science foundation house science committee chairman lamar smith and ranking member eddie bernice johnson worked to negotiate the agreement that enabled both the house and the senate to pass this bill while i was developing the class at stanford it was my counterparts at the nsf who had the vision to make the class a national program  thanks to errol arkilic don millard babu dasgupta anita lasalle as well as current program leaders lydia mcclure steven konsek and the over  instructors at the  universities who teach the program across the us but i haven’t forgotten that before everyone else thought that teaching scientists how to build companies using lean methods might be a good for the country there was one congressman who got it first  in  representative dan lipinski dil cochair of the house stem education caucus got on an airplane and flew to stanford to see the class firsthand for the first few years lipinski was a lonely voice in congress saying that we’ve found a better way to train our scientists to create companies and jobs this bill is a reauthorization of the  america creating opportunities to meaningfully promote excellence in technology education and science competes act which set out policies that govern the nsf the national institute of standards and technology nist and federal programs on innovation manufacturing and science and math education reauthorization bills don’t fund an agency but they provide policy guidance  it resolved partisan differences over how nsf should conduct peer review and manage research icorps is the  accelerator that helps scientists bridge the commercialization gap between their research in their labs and widescale commercial adoption and use why this matters while a few of the icorps teams are in webmobilecloud most are working on advanced technology projects that don’t make techcrunch you’re more likely to see their papers in material science robotics diagnostics medical devices computer hardware etc in science or nature icorps uses everything we know about building lean startups and evidencebased entrepreneurship to connect innovation to entrepreneurship it’s curriculum is built on a framework of business model design customer development and agile engineering – and its emphasis on evidence lessons learned versus demos makes it the worlds most advanced accelerator it’s success is measured not only by the technologies that leave the labs but how many us scientists and engineers we train as entrepreneurs and how many of them pass on their knowledge to students icorps is our secret weapon to integrate american innovation and entrepreneurship into every us university lab every time i go to washington and spend time at the national science foundation or national institute of health i’m reminded why the us leads the world in support of basic and applied science  it’s not just the money we pour into these programs  billionyear but the people who have dedicated themselves to make the world a better place

state department posted on december   by steveblank “being in silicon valley a lot of my friends want to work for google or apple but this class showed me that the problems in public service were even more challenging and rewarding i used to watch the news about syrian refugees and feel that i was just a bystander to a hopeless situation but this class helped me realize i can have an impact and be part of the solution” hacking for diplomacy student we just held our final week of the hacking for diplomacy class teaching students entrepreneurship and “lean startup” principles while they engaged in national public service applying advanced technologies to solve global challenges seven student teams delivered their final lessons learned presentations documenting their intellectual journey over just  short weeks in front of several hundred people in person and online and what a journey it’s been in this class we partnered with sponsors in the state department including office of space and advanced technology bureau of politicalmilitary affairs bureau of conflict and stabilization operations bureau of counterterrorism and countering violent extremism bureau of population refugees and migration office of assistance to europe central asia  the americas office of assistance to the near east office to monitor and combat trafficking in persons our sponsors treated our students like serious problem solvers who could contribute unique technical skills and unfettered customer access in exchange the sponsors got access to fresh ideas new technology and a new perspective on serious problems by the end of the class our sponsors inside state had experienced a practical example of a new and powerful methodology which could help them better understand and deal with complicated international problems and apply technology where appropriate and finally our students learned that they could serve their country without having to put on a uniform today if college students want to give back to their country most think of teach for america the peace corps or americorps or perhaps if you wanted to offer your technical skills the us digital service or the gsa’s f few consider opportunities to make the world safer with the state department department of defense intelligence community or other government agencies this post is a continuation of a series see all the posts about hacking for diplomacy here lessons learned – not a demo day silicon valley folks are familiar with demo days – presentations where the message is “here’s how smart we are right now” that’s nice but it doesn’t let the audience know “is that how smart you were three months ago did you get smarter or dumber what did you learn” hacking for diplomacy lessons learned presentations are different each team presents a twominute video to provide context about their problem and then presents for eight minutes about the lessons learned over their ten weeks in the class as an example team trace worked with the state department office to monitor and combat trafficking in persons the team was challenged to help companies push policies of responsible business lower down the supply chain the key thing to note in this presentation is not only that the team came up with a solution but also how in talking to  people their understanding of the problem evolved and as it did so did their solution see slides  and  if you can’t see the video click here if you can’t see the presentation click here team hacking ct was sponsored by bureau of counterterrorism and countering violent extremism with the goal of deterring individuals from joining violent extremist groups after  interviews the team realized that a bottomup approach focusing on support for friends and family of those at risk for radicalization might be effective if you can’t see the video click here if you can’t see the presentation click here getting lean each of the teams used the lean startup methodology for those new to lean the process has three key components first students took the problems they got from their state department sponsors and transformed those into what we call hypotheses for instance one problem was “we need to improve coordination among all the organizations trying to help syrian refugees” that’s a big unwieldy problem students had to break it down into a series of hypotheses they had to identify who were the beneficiaries and stakeholders and think about what specific service they were going to provide them how they were going to get it to them and who was going to pay for it  to help them do that we have them map their nine critical hypotheses onto a single sheet of paper called the mission model canvas then in step two the teams got out of the classroom to test these hypotheses through interviews with people in the real world every team spoke to close to  potential “beneficiaries” partners and stakeholders including ngos tech company executives supply chain managers foreign service officers in embassies around the world and even refugees while the students were interviewing they also employed the third piece of the lean methodology building the solution incrementally and iteratively these solutions called minimal viable products mvp’s are what allow the teams to become extremely agile and responsive as teams talk to stakeholders they gather evidence to either validate invalidate or modify their hypotheses if they find out that their assumptions are wrong and almost all do they pivot that is they make fundamental changes to their hypotheses instead of blindly proceeding forward simply executing a plan this ability to gather data build and test mvps and then change course is what gives lean it’s tremendous speed and agility to deliver rapid solutions that are needed and wanted as an example team aggregate db was working with the state department bureau of conflict and stabilization operations cso cso helps embassies and diplomats to visualize understand and stabilize conflict the team’s challenge was to get helps embassies and diplomats get more information about informal leader networks getting out of the building and talking to  people gave the team got a firsthand view of the downside when an embassy does not have access to the right local contacts slides   if you can’t see the video click here if you can’t see the presentation click here as they developed mvps our students took these solutions out into the real world for feedback at first the solutions were nothing more than drawings wireframes or powerpoint slides as they came to understand their problems more deeply they refined their solutions into the final products we saw for example team  – fatal journeys worked with the state department bureau of population refugees and migration the team’s challenge how to get more data on missing or perished refugees in this presentation note how the team’s understanding of the problem evolved over the course of talking to  people they realized there was a missing link between key stakeholders that limited identification of perished refugees and prevented emotional and legal closure for their families the team pivoted three times as they gained deeper and deeper insight into their problem with each pivot their solution radically changed their first pass of problemsolution understanding is on slides  but then they get additional insight in slides  finally slides  is their third and final iteration if you can’t see the video click here if you can’t see the presentation click here hacking for diplomacy was profiled this week in the la times we’ve also had la times beijing bureau chief julie makinen who is on a jsk journalism fellowship at stanford helping coach students this quarter on interviewing and research techniques julie has been sharing her impressions of the class on this blog here’s her last installment in the netflix age suspense is an increasingly rare commodity if we’re intrigued by an hour of “house of cards” we need not delay gratification – we can just queue up the next episode and push play but following stanford’s hacking for diplomacy class over the last  weeks has been like watching a tv drama the oldfashioned way there were cliffhangers every time and you had to wait seven days to find out what would happen next the class which meets just once a week but requires massive outside work is run not as a traditional lecture where professors drone on in front of passive students — just the opposite it’s the students standing up in front discussing what they’ve found out in the past seven days what progress they’ve made what obstacles they’ve run smack into the teachers sit in the back row and lob questions and critiques forth — sometimes very direct critiques that format keeps students and teachers alike on the edge of their seats conflicts and misunderstandings within student teams — and between students and sponsors — cropped up as the students tried to learn about the state department their sponsors problem and lean startup methodology all at once students teachers and interviewees said surprising intriguing even stunning things some days you could see teams going off the rails but instead of just shouting at your screen “no don’t go down that alley” a professor would actually speak up from the back with something blunt like “you’re way off track and we’re firing your idea” and just when you thought a team had struck upon a brilliant notion for a product they’d report back during the next session that everyone they put it in front of hated it i started looking forward to each thursday at  pm like my parents looked forward to watching “dragnet” as kids because the suspense was killing me thursday’s season finale did not disappoint teams that just two or three weeks ago seemed to be foundering pulled off some amazing comebacks take team exodus which had spent a substantial part of the quarter focused on how to match private companies seeking to assist syrian refugees with ngos working in the field late in the term the students scrapped that idea after finding competitors who were already deeply engaged in that space they did a major pivot and decided to concentrate directly on refugees as customers — building on all they had learned during their first eight weeks of interviewing and research in week  they decided to build an ai chatbot on facebook’s messenger platform to allow refugees to ask questions like “where can i get clothing” the bot will tap into a network of ngos to source answers a very basic prototype built primarily by team member kian katanforoosh a master’s student in computer science and management science  engineering is already up and running on the eve of thursday’s class team members katie joseff and berk coker had a call with the united nations’ refugee agency unhcr and learned that the organization was very interested in working with the students to bring an arabic chatbot to the field most likely starting in jordan “at the end our team kind of came out of the weeds” said joseff an undergrad majoring in human biology “we finally got to the thing that steve blank talks about – where you can see the whites of a customer’s eyes and they just really want the product you’re talking about” team exodus coordinating information to better serve refugees if you can’t see the video click here if you can’t see the presentation click here watching the students’ process and progress was an eyeopener even for many state department sponsors and privatesector mentors team space evaders who in week  seemed to be vying for the title of team whose proposed products generated the most yawns from potential customers had an “ahha” moment and decided instead of focusing on tracking objects already in space they’d pivot and concentrate on objects that will be launched in the future they’re proposing a “debris footprint” that would rate satellites before they’re sent into orbit on how much space junk they could generate the team hopes that this could lead to international design standards to reduce space debris “they had a fundamental insight – don’t track ’em solve it before they even get into space” said jonathan margolis deputy assistant secretary of state for science space and health who came all the way from washington to meet with the team and sit in on the class in week  “it’s a reconceptualization of a problem we’ve really been struggling with” team members dave gabler a master’s student in business and public policy with an air force background and matthew kaseman an army vet and freshman in aerospace engineering said the next step is to produce a white paper that fleshes out the mathematical formulas that could underpin a ratings system then take that to academic and industry conferences “that would help start a public discussion and push the debate” said gabler “the math is probably the easy part” said pablo quintanilla a former foreign service officer and current head of public policy for asia for salesforce who served as mentor for the space evaders team “there’s so much more to the behavioral side – who in the international space community will adopt this” quintanilla said that working with space evaders drove home for him the merits of forming diverse teams to tackle problems besides gabler and kaseman the student team included kate boudreau a junior majoring in biomedical computation and tyler dammann a junior in computer science “this crossfunctionality and working across disciplines is really effective” quintanilla said “i feel like this is living proof that you should work everywhere like this” team space evaders reducing space junk if you can’t see the video click here if you can’t see the presentation click here professor jeremy weinstein a coinstructor for the class who recently served as deputy us ambassador to the united nations acknowledged that  weeks is a really short time frame for the students to make any meaningful impact but unlike an internship where a lone student “plugs into an existing bureaucratic hierarchy and rules” the hacking for diplomacy students had the advantage of being able to work in teams — and approach the problem more as outsiders “the students don’t have to play by the same rules as insiders they can ask the nonpc questions” said weinstein “to be ignorant of the rules is a blessing at times — if you can do it respectfully” getting students to have a healthy appreciation for how government policy is made — sometimes painfully slowly — is part of the educational process and so perhaps is getting bureaucrats to be more open to fresh ideas “there’s not going to be a flip of the switch” in state as a result of this class weinstein said “there is some skepticism but i think more broadly we’ve won some people over” thursday’s wrapup session attracted a diverse audience including representatives from leading silicon valley tech companies as well as diplomats from france britain and denmark susan alzner head of the un nongovernmental liaison service’s new york office said after watching the student presentations she wants to take the customer discovery and interview methodology back to her agency “the un has lots of small teams of people who often believe they already know the solution to a problem … and the un does way too much consultation digitally interviews are critical it’s so elaborate to see these students doing  interviews to understand a problem but it’s so important to orient yourself before making a plan to do something” team hacking  peacekeeping better data on and decisionmaking about peacekeeping forces if you can’t see the video click here if you can’t see the presentation click here weinstein noted that scaling up hacking for diplomacy may not be as easy as expanding hacking for defense simply because “there are millions of people who work in the department of defense… while the size of the state department foreign service corps is smaller than the total number of people who play in military bands” that means there are fewer people who can serve as sponsors at the same time the class could tap a wider array of sponsor organizations “scale maybe has to look different — we can look to the state department but also unhcr the foreign ministry of the uk other international organizations” weinstein said “you have to think of a different array of partners” most of the state department sponsors for this year’s class weinstein noted were not political appointees but career foreign service officers or career civil servants “they are the glue that holds the agency together and they are key to getting anything implemented in government and so the buyin is there” he said “but they also need permission they need a blessing to experiment with radically different ideas and you need political cover in these bureaucracies to do this kind of work” “i hope” he added “we’ll have that cover in a subsequent administration more than cover endorsement enthusiasm excitement” our teaching team like the students’ efforts the teaching of this class was also a team project i was joined by jeremy weinstein former deputy to the us ambassador to the united nations and a stanford professor of political science zvika krieger the state department’s representative to silicon valley and senior advisor for technology and innovation retired us army col joe felter who cocreated hacking for defense and is a senior research scholar at the center for international security and cooperation at stanford and steve weinstein chief executive of movielabs who teaches entrepreneurship at stanford and uc berkeley our teaching assistants were shazad mohamed sam gussman and roland gillah we were fortunate to get a team of seven mentors currently or formerly served in the state department and selflessly volunteered their time to help coach the teams each team also got a mentor from the tech industry who helped guide them through creating their final products of course huge thanks to the stanford students who gave their all through this class going forward while our previous hacking for defense class gave us a hint that doing the same for diplomacy would work we’re a little stunned about how well this class with the state department went a surprising number of students have decided to continue working on foreign policy projects after this class with the state department or with ngo’s other colleges and universities have raised their hands and said they want to offer hacking for diplomacy or potentially a usaid hacking for development class at their school meanwhile our hacking for defense class continues to scale through hdiorg the non profit we set up to curate the problems from our sponsors jido arcyber awg usmc nsa afnwc socom th ranger regiment ustranscom cyber force protection brigade national defense university and the center for technology and national

lean launchpad class at uc berkeley’s engineering school where many of the teams embedded machine learning technology into their products it struck me as i watched the teams try to find how their technology would solve real customer problems is that machine learning is following a similar pattern of previous technical infrastructure innovations early entrants get sold to corporate acquirers at inflated prices for their teams their technology and their tools later entrants who miss that wave have to build real products that people want to buy —– i’ve lived through several technology infrastructure waves the unix business the first ai and vr waves in the ’s the workstation wave multimedia wave the first internet wave each of those had a set of common characteristics that the gartner group characterizes as the hype cycle  the five stages of the hype cycle are stage  the technology trigger a potential technology breakthrough kicks things off early proofofconcept stories and media interest trigger significant publicity often no usable products exist and commercial viability is unproven stage  peak of inflated expectations early publicity produces a number of success stories—often accompanied by scores of failures some companies take action most don’t stage  trough of disillusionment interest wanes as experiments and implementations fail to deliver producers of the technology shake out or fail investments continue only if the surviving providers improve their products to the satisfaction of early adopters stage  slope of enlightenment more instances of how the technology can benefit the enterprise start to crystallize and become more widely understood second and thirdgeneration products appear from technology providers more enterprises fund pilots conservative companies remain cautious stage  plateau of productivity mainstream adoption starts to take off criteria for assessing provider viability are more clearly defined the technology’s broad market applicability and relevance are clearly paying off shiny object meets first mover advantage what’s become apparent in the last few technology hype cycles is that for startups and their investors there is a short multiyear window of opportunity at the peak of inflated expectations to sell a startup at an inflated price this occurs because large technology companies google facebook ibm microsoft twitter apple salesforce intel et al and increasingly other nontech firms are in an arms race to stay relevant for example according to cbinsights nearly  machine intelligence have been acquired since  with over  being bought so far in  most often the first acquisitions in a hype cycle are for the “shiny objects” – the technology the team and the tools the acquired technical teams usually start up or complement the company’s research group in a specific new technology area if you’re a startup or their investors getting acquired at this point in the hype cycle is exactly where you want to be – short time in business large acquisition price value based on a frenzy perceived scarcity of expertise and fear of a competitor getting the key talent history shows that the acquirers often overpay buying this expertise early while these acquisitions have teams of great researchers they rarely contribute actual revenue generating products because most never reached that stage when they were acquired  the irony is that the acquisitions made later in the hype cycle – when companies have built real products that customers want are the ones that generate revenue and profit for the acquirer i had all that in mind as we watched our teams present machine learning meets lean – berkeley lean launchpad class each of our teams in this class followed the canonical lean model articulate your hypotheses using the business model canvas get of the building and test those hypotheses using customer development validate learning by building minimal viable products and getting them in front of customers each week the teams got out of the classroom and talked to  customers testing a new part of the business model canvas  and after week two they had to build and then update their minimal viable product weekly and present what they learned each week in an minute presentations the presentations below are their final lessons learned presentations along with a minute video summary salesstash three berkeley phd computer science students and an mba working on machine learning how can you not hit out of the park on day one this team epitomized rapid learning once their initial assumptions ran into the wall of actual customer feedback they rapidly built multiple minimum viable products mvps and kept pivoting until they found productmarket fit ie a customer segment that was grabbing the product out of their hands if you can’t see the video click here if you can’t see the presentation click here delphi before this class this team had spent three months in an incubator building the product after talking to only one customer after  week two of the class they realized they had wasted three months building something no one actually wanted what they next learned was pretty amazing if you can’t see the video click here if you can’t see the presentation click here homeslice homeslice had a great journey they came together over a personal pain – the inability to afford a house in silicon valley their initial plan was to provide fractional ownership to solve that problem but they found that first serving an adjacent market – slices of investment properties – could serve as a launchpad for their initial idea of fractional home ownership if you can’t see the video click here if you can’t see the presentation click here exit strategy exit strategy was

startups guide slidesvideos an mvp is not a cheaper product it’s about smart learning posted on july   by steveblank a minimum viable product mvp is not always a smallercheaper version of your final product defining the goal for a mvp can save you tons of time money and grief drones over the heartland i ran into a small startup at stanford who wants to fly unmanned aerial vehicles drones with a hyperspectral camera over farm fields to collect hyperspectral images these images would be able to tell farmers how healthy their plants were whether there were diseases or bugs whether there was enough fertilizer and enough water the camera has enough resolution to see individual plants knowing this means farms can make better forecasts of how much their fields will produce whether they should treat specific areas for pests and put fertilizer and water only where it was needed drones were better than satellites because of higher resolution and the potential for making more passes over the fields and better than airplanes because of lower cost all of this information would help farmers increase yields making more money and reduce costs by using less water and fertilizerchemicals but only applying where it was needed their plan was to be a data service provider in an emerging business called “precision agriculture” they would go out to a farmer fields on a weekly basis fly the drones collect and process the data and then give it to the farmers in an easy understandable form customer discovery on farms i don’t know what it is about stanford but this was the fourth or fifth startup i’ve seen in precision agriculture that used drones robotics hightech sensors etc this team got my attention when they said “let us tell you about our conversations with potential customers”  i listened and as they described their customer interviews it seemed like they had found that – yes farmers do understand that not being able to see what was going on in detail on their fields was a problem – and yes – having data like this would be great – in theory so the team decided that this felt like a real business they wanted to build  and now they were out raising money to build a prototype minimum viable product mvp all good smart team real domain experts in hyperspectral imaging drone design good start on customer discovery beginning to think about productmarket fit etc lean is not an engineering process they showed me their goals and budget for their next step what they wanted was a happy early customer who recognized the value of their data and is willing to be an evangelist great goal they concluded that the only way to get a delighted early customer was to build a minimum viable product mvp they believed that the mvp needed to  demonstrate a drone flight  make sure their software could stitch together all the images of a field and then  present the data to the farmer in a way he could use it and they logically concluded that the way to do this was to buy a drone buy a hyperspectral camera buy the software for image processing spend months of engineering time integrating the camera platform and software together etc  they showed me their barebones budget for doing all this logical and wrong keep your eyes on the prize the team confused the goal of the mvp seeing if they could find a delighted farmer who would pay for the data with the process of getting to the goal they had the right goal but the wrong mvp to test it here’s why the teams’ hypothesis was that they could deliver actionable data that farmers would pay for period since the startup defined itself as a data services company at the end of the day the farmer couldn’t care less whether the data came from satellites airplanes drones or magic as long as they had timely information that meant that all the work about buying a drone a camera software and time integrating it all was wasted time and effort – now they did not need to test any of that yet there’s plenty of existence proofs that low cost drones can be equipped to carry cameras they had defined the wrong mvp to test first what they needed to spend their time is first testing is whether farmers cared about the data so i asked “would it be cheaper to rent a camera and plane or helicopter and fly over the farmers field hand process the data and see if that’s the information farmers would pay for  couldn’t you do that in a day or two for a tenth of the money you’re looking for”  oh… they thought about it for a while and laughed and said “we’re engineers and we wanted to test all the cool technology but you want us to test whether we first have a product that customers care about and whether it’s a business we can do that” smart team they left thinking about how to redefine their mvp lessons learned a minimum viable product is not always a smallercheaper version of your final product think about cheap hacks to test the goal great founders keep their eye on the

it is very important for entrepreneurs to be reminded of this simple but important principle the purpose of your mvp is to test your core value proposition you often do not have to engineer a solution to do this in our consulting business we often have to remind our entrepreneurs and startups that there are often very easy ways to do this that is why when building a software company a mvp can be a video landing page clickable wireframe etc thanks for reminding entrepreneurs to a talk to customers and b determine value through an mvp that tests the core value proposition of the product likelike

an mvp in practice the way i think of it and mvp allows you to black box important components of the value proposition within these black boxes are highly processes that are extremely unscalable in the longterm but with a near  startup phase renting a plane or helicopter and handtuning the data is great shortterm alternative to robots and software building a great landing page is a great complementary exercise as well likelike reply epmentor on july   at  am said thanks steve the great french vineyards of bordeaux eg chateau lafite rothschild have done what you describe for years

sometimes i guess it’s because i subconsciously want to delay the testing with customers in this case checking whether the farmers want the data bc of fears of failure this is a lesson that i’d definitely take to my heart likelike reply skmurphy inc » mvp are you building a death star on july   at  am said … an mvp is not a cheaper product it’s about smart learning … likelike reply ‘minimum

you for this article the article talks about the right mvp for the question that needs to be tested fair enough i am wondering how do you qualifyquantify the test from the mvp in this case i assume it would be money that the farmer paid and probably the easy by which he paid correct me if i am wrong how do you judge the results from an mvp no of users who are actively using the mvpfunctional mvp or number of people who are exiting about the mvp assuming that the mvp is a non functional mockup likelike reply erik larson erikdlarson on july   at  am said what a great reminder thanks steve building on what alex said a nonfunctional mvp can only really give you good negative information ie if no one is excited about the picture of your baby then that is a strong negative signal but if lots of people are excited that is often only a weak positive signal…enough reason to build a functional mvp and useful guidance about what it should do but not much more than that for a functional mvp having lots of people use it is often only a weak positive signal and having only a few people use it is a weak negative signal especially early on however you have a strong negative signal if no one is really excited about it and you have a strong positive signal if you find a clearly identifiable group of users who are really excited about it regardless of how many people use it think about steve’s article in a bb context he’s saying getting one evangelical customer from a functional mvp is a good goal in my experience you can usually tell within the first  to  maybe  customers in bb if you have a clear target customer up front in consumer usually the first  to  maybe  if no one is really excited that should give you pause if someone is really excited that should give you confidence to continue likelike reply alex on july   at  pm said hey erik that reply was helpful however there is one thing that i dont get – why is a clearly identifiable group which is small but exited about your mvp a strong signal little confused about the definition of clearly identifiable group as in say i did the test with  people and out of that  people were very excited and say out of the  excited people  people were one group of people – say group a but looking at number of people in group a in the set of  people i noticed that group a consists of  people in that case i dont really have a clearly indentifiable group as  is pretty low i am guessing you are talking about the case when the  ratio is pretty close to one no matter how nitche the group is and the total size of the market is defined by the number of such people in the world likelike reply yong on july   at  pm said great case study steve appreciate your coaching internet change our life in pre internet era this might be

wish i read this  months ago we did the exact opposite got caught up in the dev process and lost our focus on the “prize” we spent  months working on nifty features and forgot to ask both the customer and the enduser if they found value in what we were creating now we are struggling to salvage what we have and restart testing for value still optimistic but we had a very expensive lesson it’s very easy to lose focus if you stay in your comfort zone and avoid regular reality checks likelike reply themba mkandla on july   at  pm said what an eye opener it certainly is a great example that is very practical will always refer to it when things get cloudy as they often do when working on business ideas likelike reply cspoerry on july   at  pm said very interesting article – as always thanks steve i still struggle to see how the mvp and the entire lean startup framework applies to addons of a core product or to services that are not core yet to a business model for example a mobile app built by a bank that locates its branches and atms you can do ab testing of course and it provides great leanings but it does not seem to converge to a “successful startup” inside of this bank happy to further discuss if there is an opportunity to likelike reply juicycanvas juicycanvas on july   at  pm said these days if u do a decent kickstarter or indiegogo campaign  which includes a product walkthrough  targeted landing pages showing a clear value prop  key screenshots  then top it off with followup customer discovery… that should give u a ton of data and prove viability although we skipped the ks and landing pages when we started juicycanvascom and had to build an mvp first because we were not solving pain points – but rather offering a fun new creative experience which could only truly be understood when used but we were foolish and lucky kids dont try this at home likelike reply meb on july   at  am said they could probably have saved even more money by just cold calling farmers and say “hey farmer i can sell you weekly data xyz of your farm land for price w want to make an order” renting a plane and manually sorting through data is expensive and you would need to “try sell” to more than one farmer to get reliable data if your idea is an ipo idea then it should be enough in most cases to just explain your idea to get orders my guess is that people overdo the mvp for several reasons these ive seen in real life and been guilty of myself sometimes  the idea is feels so good that there is no chance its gonna fail building a “cheap”  mvp is ok in this case even though they could have validated it much cheaper with a simple landing page and picture  the idea has sparked adrenaline feel good emotions and they forget all logic and proven methods of moving forward in the most pragmatic way  the notion of an mvpcust deva startup method is not even known to the founder  they have tried cust dev before and always had their idea fail which they should but arent happy for they start distrusting the method and say “fck cust dev i just need to burn the boats and start building then i have no other option than winning cust dev is too boring” likelike reply joshua jacobs on july   at  am said meb i think you identified some excellent points simply cold calling would identify the first set of criteria customers are looking for to make their purchasing decision if the custom isn’t convinced over the phone create some sample reports still not convinced create a mockup and run a webex or sample video all for less that the price of the first flyover and real data crunching as reason number  for avoiding the direct path to customer insight i would propose fear of discovery especially fear of discovering no one wants what you’re developing likelike reply lilia on july   at  am said i suspect  is all too common i like  and  added by joshua and saul  founders are engineers and think that customer development requires skills they don’t have possibly true so they skip the task completely and move onto building for an engineer building a product is more natural than talking about the product does anybody else think concept of mvp clashes with “ideas are worthless execution is everything” if the idea is about convenience it can be a chickenandegg problem since mvp is meant to validate an idea but not execution for example many refer to manual data processing and emailing in mvp phase but what if timeliness realtime of a solution is a core feature of the product likelike reply saul lieberman on july   at  pm said i think josh’s no  fear of discovering that you might have to make a big change is probably very powerful likelike reply lilia on july   at  pm said thanks for a great story steve startup founders need a formula for defining an mvp without getting offtrack like a set of questions or a checklist that gets them to the desired shortcut idea something like lean canvas exercise would help hmm i think i want to work on this seed

reply adam on july   at  am said i agree one case and thought experiment let’s think a bit backwards and imagine we are in  before fitbit jawbone up nike fuelband etc came to market with activity trackers that sync up to your computermobile phone what would be the mvp for such a product step counters are out on the market for  years hundreds of thousands were entering the steps on websites and competed with each other the key value proposition of these fancy wireless activity trackers is the experience with syncing and providing visual insights and the gamification around it likelike reply stefano on july   at  pm said i don’t think this is a case of a wrong mvp this is a jobstobedone example of picking the wrong… job as you wrote data is what farmer wanted not the way to get them anything else is addressing the wrong job mvp is about identifying the minimum set of features that make a product viable this is still far from marketable noone should ever consider market a mvp seriously that’s the agile disillusion of being earlier in the market with the level of competition that exists now being out in the market with product that is just viable and not fully “lovable”

regularly to a variety of folks i forwarded your drone blog to potential customers for their thoughts about your example startup while i know that drones and farming are used here as an example of startup technique i thought you and your stanford team might enjoy some comments from my sister and her husband who who are megafamily farmers in ohio their son matt is a recent graduate of nebraska employed there collecting some of the same data…on foot i am waiting for his comments and will forward if you are interested my point is the same i always have used�talk to the ‘consumer’ first�sometimes they don’t know what they want until you hand it to them but they will always shorten your development time hey family does this idea below have any fundamental value in your farming worlds i have been conversationally toying with the possibility of drone application of fertilizerschemicals with some of the folks at dayton development coalition and this stirred up the thought again yeah pretty much they forgot to ask the farmers if they cared about the data for sure some farmers would care and love it but many many fewer would be willing to pay for that service a lot fewer farmers do not let go of their money easily for anything i don�t foresee drones taking matt�s job away from him anytime soon it�s hard enough getting farmers to let go of money for what matt does let alone a techno drone btw if our experience the techies have a very hard time getting the info into a form that the farmers can actually use they can rarely make it �user friendly� that is a huge

kindle these were massive projects with huge backend engineering and operations with huge bigbang launches is there a rubric for determining when a project can benefit from an mvp vs when a big bang release is more appropriate is it possible that some projects will only be successful on scale and that aiming for an mvp is sometimes a bad idea likelike reply john haro johnharo on july   at  am said great point however  apple and amazon have considerable resources… they can afford to stumble and they can afford to take many years iphone took many many years to develop and quietly test the

risk of venturing further into hypotheticals… could google have failed smaller in those cases where it does fail could apple amazon … have been more successful with a leanmvp strategy do opportunities that aren’t a good fit for mvp approaches demand bigger budgets and higher failure tolerance likelike reply lilia tovbin on july   at  pm said if you are appleamazongoogle you have enough data to base your business decisions on and enough resources to build a viable product so you don’t really need an mvp they also have their brand to protect so have to be more sensitive to quality of the products they introduce “do opportunities that aren’t a good fit for mvp approaches demand bigger budgets …” not necessarily in the case of reinventing an existing product or idea your cost to market is actually lower – innovation is expensive imitation is cheap and effective mvp is a method for learning validating who your customers are and what they want and willing to pay for while keeping the cost to a minimum likelike reply lilia tovbin on july   at  am said i can think of  factors that determine a need for an mvp  whether the product idea is new or just a variationimprovementextension of an already validated product many founders say “i can do this better and cheaper than company x” and improve upon an existing product that already has a proven market  whether business survival or even existence depends on the success of the product or not in cases of startups not validating a product is intolerable risk compared to launching of another product for a big established company

trying to solve if the problem is that there is no way to get high resolution data the plane  helicopter idea is a good one but if the plane  helicopter thing is already being done as one commenter

to find out by steve blank steve blank is a retired silicon valley serial entrepreneur turned educator who developed the customer development methodology that changes the way startups are built his book the four steps to the epiphany launched the lean startup movement sgblank author the startup owners manual architect icorps nih curriculumsgblank by bob dorf bob dorf is a leader in lean startup and customer development he coauthored the globally bestselling startup owner’s manual with lean startup creator steve blank detailing every startupbuilding step in  languages bobdorf coauthor the startup owners manualbobdorf  comments credit shutterstock images editors note this post is part of a series featuring excerpts from the recently published book the startup owners manual written by serial entrepreneursturnededucators steve blank and bob dorf come back each week for more howtos from this page guide     once your business model canvas is done its time for your team to get out of the building to test your hypotheses you need to answer three key questions  do we really understand the customers problem or need do enough people care about the problem or need to deliver a huge business and will they care enough to tell their friends to grow our business quickly  regardless of whether you have a physical or webmobile product customer development experiments are short simple objective passfail tests  start by asking yourself what do i want to learn and whats the simplest passfail test i can run to learn finally think about how do i design a passfail experiment to run this simple test  the goal of these tests is not just to collect customer data or get a pass on the test its something more profound and intangible entrepreneurial insight did anyone end your sales call by saying too bad you dont sell x because we could use a ton of those thats the kind of feedback youre looking for  how to test a webmobile concept  the problem phase is markedly different for webmobile startups where feedback comes far faster the best strategy is to use a lowfidelity minimum viable product mvp that can be as simple as a landing page with your value proposition benefits summary and a call to action to learn more answer a short survey or preorder it could be even a quick website prototype built in powerpoint or with a simple landingpage creation tool your goal is something basicno fancy ui logos or animation   and no matter what theres no substitute for facetoface discovery with customers to see their reaction to the problem or the solution do their eyes light up or glaze over you may have to do all this for each side in multisided markets where the issues differ for buyers and sellersusers and payers  get the mvp live as quickly as possible often the day you start the company to see if anybody shares your vision of the customer needproblem your websiteprototype should describe the problem in words or pictures does your office look like this show screen shots of the potential solution pay your bills this way encourages users to sign up to learn more  measure how many people care about the problem or need and how deeply they care the most obvious indicator is the percentage of invitees who register to learn more next you need to learn if visitors think their friends have the same need or problem so include widgets for forwarding sharing and tweeting the mvp  focus on the conversion rates if the mvp gets  page views and  or  signups its time to stop and analyze why if  of the people who saw an adword or textlink to the mvp signed up youre almost certainly on to something big what percentage of people invited to the test actually came what percentage of people in each test a provided their email address b referred or forwarded the mvp to friends or c engaged further in a survey blog or other feedback activity of those who answered survey questions how many declared the problem very important as opposed to somewhat important  consider using multiple mvps  many startups develop multiple lowfidelity websites to test different problem descriptions for example a simple online accounts payable package can be simultaneously tested three different ways as fastpay ezpay and flexipay each addresses three different accounts payable problemsspeed ease of use and flexibility each landing page would be different stressing the ease of use problem for example  how to test a physical product  start with at least  target customerspeople you know directly next expand the list by scouring your cofounders and employees address books socialnetwork lists etc add names from friends investors founders lawyers recruiters accountants and more  in contrast with a product presentation a problem presentation is designed to elicit information from customers the presentation summarizes your hypotheses about customers problems and about how theyre solving the problem today it also offers some potential solutions to test whether your assumptions are correct  hopefully youll never get to use your presentation your goal is to get the customers to talk not you this is the biggest idea in customer development remember you arent trying to convince anyone youre right youre there to listen presenting in this context really means inviting the customers responses so after describing your assumed list of problems pause and ask the customers what they think the problems are whether youre missing any problems how they would rank the problems and which are mustsolve rather than nicetosolve youve hit the jackpot when the customer tells you she will do anything to solve the problem  what if a customer tells you that the issues you thought were important really arent youve just obtained great data while it may not be what you wanted to hear its wonderful to have that knowledge early on  summarize this discussion by asking two questions whats the biggest pain in how you work if you could wave a magic wand and change anything about what you do what would it be these are the ipo questions understand the answers to these questions and your startup is going public casually ask how much does this problem cost you in terms of lost revenue lost customers lost time frustration etcfinally introduce a taste of your proposed solution not a set of features but only the big idea pause and watch the customers reactions do they even understand what the words mean is the solution evident enough that they say if you could do that all my problems would be solved alternatively do they say what do you mean then do you have to explain it for  minutes and they still dont understand once again the point is not to deliver a sales pitch but to get their reaction and a healthy discussion  be ready to learn  some of your hypotheses might be shot down in flames in the first hour or two for example most entrepreneurs would change something if they invited  friends to an mvp problem page and not a single one clicked or signed up imagine your surprise if you bought a list of  mothers of toddlers and just three accepted your invitation to join toddlermomcom  in businesstobusiness companies experience the customer at work or at the very least observe it your goal should be to know the customer youre pursuing and every aspect of his or her business so deeply and intimately that they start to think of you and talk to you as if you were one of them  after testing the customer problem or need and gaining a complete understanding of the customer its time to expose the product itself to potential customers for the first time not to sell to them but to get their feedback well discuss that more in the next excerpt the opinions expressed here by inccom columnists are their own not those of inccom published on jun

de steve blank y constituye una metodología precursora de lean startup otra de las grandes metodologías actualesel libro centra su foco en el desarrollo de la empresa y proyecto orientado totalmente al cliente basando su lógica en la gran incertidumbre con la que tienen que lidiar los emprendedores de muy diversos sectoresvamos a ser francos y a atrevernos a decir que no es un libro hecho para todos aunque si es un libro que todos los emprendedores o futuros emprendedores deberían leer probablemente después de la lectura de business model generation ya que ofrece una serie de conocimiento tan elaborado que se pueden extraer lecciones valiosísimas aunque no se llegue finalmente a aplicar la metodologíaes un libro duro de leer denso con mucha información y con constantes rupturas respecto al pensamiento tradicional como por ejemplo el típico desarrollo orientado al producto que hemos seguido durante tanto tiempomás allá del conjunto que supone la metodología de customer development el libro se desarrolla ciertos temas de muchos interés como la curva de adopción del ciclo de vida de tecnología early adopters the chasm mas market… el aprendizaje basado en la dualidad de hipótesis sobre el problema y solución o los  mercados diferentes que puede abordar una startupcomo son temas que ya hemos abordado en emprenderalia customer development o que abordaremos más adelante no vamos a tratarlos en esta reseña pero los destacamos por su valioso contenido dentro del librolos  pasos hacia la epifanía customer developmentla metodología de customer development se basa en  pasos básicos sobre los que se puede iterar las veces que sea necesario antes de pasar al siguiente muy en la línea de pivotar o perserverar que defiende la metodología de lean startupel primer paso se llama customer discovery y se trata de testear una serie de hipótesis antes de lanzarnos a desarrollar nada lo que buscamos es saber si realmente hemos encontrado un problema que cierto número de personasorganizaciones necesitan resolver y si la solución que proponemos es una solución válida para ellos esta fase se centra sobre todo en la dupla problemasolución realizando muchos contactos con posibles clientes early adopters para aprender de ellos siempre respecto a nuestras hipótesis en este paso se puede usar la filosofía de mvp producto viable mínimo alternativamente a sistemas de cuestionarios el segundo paso se llama customer validation y se centra en crear un roadmap de ventas que sea repetible y que esté enfocado en los early adopters que serán los que nos perdonen las carencias de un producto no acabado o ni siquiera empezado para asegurarnos de que realmente podemos vender nuestro producto como solución a su problema si salimos airosos de estos  primeros pasos podemos asegurar que tenemos un modelo de negocio válidoel tercer paso se llama customer creation y es una fase más cercana a los que estamos acostumbrados ya que trata de generar demanda de nuestro producto para alimentar a nuestros canales de ventas en esta fase debemos acabar de definir el mercado que estamos abordando ya que las acciones a realizar serán muy diferentes damos el salto al mass market por lo que empiezan los grandes gastos de marketing y ventasel cuarto y último paso es company building que consiste en afianzar nuestra estructura empresarial cambiando el caos típico de las startups por una estructura en departamentos orientados ya no respecto al cliente sino a su propia misióncomo vemos la empresa realiza un crecimiento progresivo según aumentan las necesidades reales así nos evitamos quemar dinero en las primeras fases del proyecto cuando todavía ni sabemos si existirá un mercado para nuestro producto ni si estamos solucionando un problema que vale la pena solucionaren conclusión un libro potentísimo lleno de conocimiento fundamental para emprendedores y que recomendamos totalmente desde emprenderalia un must have que se dicepuedes

parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in
