back to about us our history our history and culture are based on the original values laid down by the hambro family namely providing the highest levels of investment management and service to our clients ever since our inception we have sought to maintain these values and have grown organically attracting some of the most experienced investment managers in the industry to join us waverton investment management was originally founded as j o hambro investment management johim in  by richard hambro for the first fourteen years the company was owned by the hambro family and senior management in  johim was acquired by the credit suisse group although it remained an independently managed entity in  credit suisse agreed to sell johim to bermuda national limited since renamed somers limited and to the existing management team thus reestablishing our credentials as an independent ownermanaged investment management house our original investment philosophy and focus on individual client service remain unchanged and directors  and employees of the firm have an equity stake in the business thus aligning ourselves with the interests of our clients it was agreed by the board following the acquisition from credit suisse that we would change our name from johim to waverton investment management in recognition of the new structure of the firm waverton was already the name used for the majority of our existing funds as well as being the name of the hambro family home in gloucestershire built originally by jocelyn hambro waverton therefore preserves our link to our founding principles embraced by the hambro family but at the same time acknowledges the independent ownership of the firm going forward our business remains as always the discretionary management of
