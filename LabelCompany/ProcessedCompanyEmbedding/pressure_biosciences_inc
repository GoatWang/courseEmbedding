together the companies today announced a strategic product licensing manufacturing comarketing and collaborative research and development agreement the agreement under the terms of the agreement pbi has been licensed by tdi to manufacture and sell a highly innovative line of chemicals used in the preparation of tissues for scientific analysis the tdi reagents the tdi reagents were designed for use in combination with pbis pressure cycling technology pct the companies believe that the combination of pct and the tdi reagents can fill a large existing need in life science research for an automated method for rapid extraction and recovery of intact functional proteins associated with cell membranes in tissue samples membrane proteins are vital to the development of new vaccines therapeutics and diagnostics as they are involved in many important cell functions including cell signaling response and transportation mechanisms in many cases these proteins are tightly bound within the membrane making them very difficult to extract for scientific study traditional extraction methods use aggressive chemical and mechanical means which can destroy the structure and function of proteins tdis reagents in combination with the thermodynamic action of pct effectively stabilize both the structure and function of membrane proteins as they are released from tissue samples currently scientists are typically limited to studying the nonfunctional fragments of membrane proteins commented dr luke v schneider tdis chief scientific officer however with the combination of pct and tdi reagents they now have an economical and straightforward method to effectively extract and study intact and functional proteins from cell membranes membrane proteins are the target for about  of pharmaceutical research and this new method may thus result in the discovery of important new biomarkers and the subsequent development or improvement of vital therapeutic and diagnostic products mr jeffrey n peterson ceo of tdi said our team has very strong chemical engineering expertise which gave us an immediate appreciation for the thermodynamic processes that drive pbis powerful and innovative pressure cycling technology mr peterson continued we are most impressed with the quality of pbis engineering science and management teams their enviable list of current customers the number of potential pct applications and with their business vision and focus these characteristics and their growing reputation in the life sciences research field make them an ideal partner for target discovery dr nate lawrence vice president of marketing for pbi said the companies plan to develop additional products incorporating the tdi reagents for other tissue processing and extraction applications we believe that this will further extend this powerful new ability to access and leverage the research value of membrane proteins the tdi reagents will be packaged in readytouse kits we believe that these kits are complementary to our existing line of proteosolve™ kits and will help drive additional sales of our patented barocycler instruments and consumables dr lawrence continued we plan to collaborate with tdi in the marketing and promotion of the tdi reagents in industry publications at scientific meetings on each companys website through common collaborator studies and at key industry trade shows to that end we will be assisting tdi in the first public presentation of these exciting new tdi reagents demonstrated in a pctbased application at us hupos th annual conference in

statements contained in this press release regarding pbis intentions hopes beliefs expectations or predictions of the future are forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  such forward looking statements include statements regarding the advantages of pct in processing tissue samples including the extraction and recovery of intact functional proteins contained in cellular membranes that the companies will develop additional products incorporating the tdi reagents that membrane protein biomarkers are involved in cellular signaling response and transportation mechanisms and are vital to life science research that the tdi reagents in combination with pct effectively stabilize the structure and function of membrane proteins that pct can release proteins from cellular membranes through thermodynamic action that vital therapeutics and diagnostics can be created from the combination of pct and tdi reagents that there is a large and existing need for automated methods for the rapid extraction of proteins in tissue samples and the number of research laboratories studying c elegans these statements are based upon pbis current expectations forecasts and assumptions that are subject to risks uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from those indicated by these forwardlooking statements these risks uncertainties and other factors include but are not limited to possible difficulties delays and additional costs in the implementation of pbis strategies that may adversely affect the commercialization of pct and pctdependent products including a plan to attract customers for tdi reagents produced and marketed by pbi due to differences in strategies between tdi and pbi the collaboration may not result in successful joint marketing and promotion of products utilizing tdi reagents with pct changes in customer needs and technological innovations other scientists may not achieve the same pct results reported by tdi pbis sales force may not successfully sell the pct product line and the tdi reagents because scientists may not perceive the advantages of pct for releasing and analyzing cell membrane proteins the potential market for cell membrane protein extraction by pct may be substantially smaller than anticipated by pbi and due to unforeseen costs or delays the company may require additional working capital to fund its operations before  additional risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
