countries citimortgage originates real estate mortgages historyedit the citigroup logo –present the citigroup logo – citigroup was formed on october   following the  billion merger of citicorp and travelers group to create the worlds largest financial services organization the history of the company is thus divided into the workings of several firms that over time amalgamated into citicorp a multinational banking corporation operating in more than  countries or travelers group whose businesses covered credit services consumer finance brokerage and insurance as such the company history dates back to the founding of the city bank of new york later citibank in  bank handlowy in  smith barney in  banamex in  salomon brothers in  citicorp –edit city bank of new york was chartered by new york state on june   with  million of capital serving a group of new york merchants the bank opened for business on september  of that year and samuel osgood was elected as the first president of the company the companys name was changed to the national city bank of new york in  after it joined the new us national banking system and it became the largest american bank by  it became the first contributor to the federal reserve bank of new york in  and the following year it inaugurated the first overseas branch of a us bank in buenos aires although the bank had since the midth century been active in plantation economies such as the cuban sugar industry the  purchase of us overseas bank international banking corporation helped it become the first american bank to surpass  billion in assets and it became the largest commercial bank in the world in  as it grew the bank became a leading innovator in financial services becoming the first major us bank to offer compound interest on savings  unsecured personal loans  customer checking accounts  and the negotiable certificate of deposit  the bank changed its name to the first national city bank of new york in  which was shortened in  to first national city bank on the th anniversary of the companys foundation the company organically entered the leasing and credit card sectors and its introduction of us dollar–denominated certificates of deposit in london marked the first new negotiable instrument in market since  the bank introduced its first national city charge service credit card—popularly known as the everything card and later to become mastercard—in  in  under the leadership of ceo walter b wriston first national city bank and its holding company first national city corporation was renamed as citibank na and citicorp respectively shortly afterward the bank launched the citicard which pioneered the use of hour atms john s reed was elected ceo in  and citi became a founding member of the chaps clearing house in london under his leadership the next  years would see citibank become the largest bank in the united states and the largest issuer of credit cards and charge cards in the world and expand its global reach to over  countries travelers group –edit the corporate logo of travelers inc – prior to merger with citicorp travelers group at the time of merger was a diverse group of financial concerns that had been brought together under ceo sandy weill its roots came from commercial credit a subsidiary of control data corporation that was taken private by weill in november  after taking charge of the company earlier that year two years later weill mastered the buyout of primerica—a conglomerate that had already bought life insurer a l williams as well as stock broker smith barney the new company took the primerica name and employed a crossselling strategy such that each of the entities within the parent company aimed to sell each others services its nonfinancial businesses were spun off in september  travelers insurance which had suffered from poor real estate investments and sustained significant losses in the aftermath of hurricane andrew formed a strategic alliance with primerica that would lead to its amalgamation into a single company in december  with the acquisition the group became travelers inc property  casualty and life  annuities underwriting capabilities were added to the business meanwhile the distinctive travelers red umbrella logo which was also acquired in the deal was applied to all the businesses within the newly named organization during this period travelers acquired shearson lehman—a retail brokerage and asset management firm that was headed by weill until —and merged it with smith barney ownership of salomon brothers –edit in november  travelers group which had been renamed again in april  when they merged with aetna property and casualty inc acquired salomon brothers a major bond dealer and bulge bracket investment bank in a  billion transaction this deal complemented travelerssmith barney well as salomon was focused on fixedincome and institutional clients whereas smith barney was strong in equities and retail salomon brothers absorbed smith barney into the new securities unit termed salomon smith barney a year later the division incorporated citicorps former securities operations as well the salomon smith barney name was abandoned in october  after a series of financial scandals that tarnished the banks reputation merger of citicorp and travelers –edit on april   the merger between citicorp and travelers group was announced to the world creating a  billion firm with assets of almost  billion the deal would enable travelers to market mutual funds and insurance to citicorps retail customers while giving the banking divisions access to an expanded client base of investors and insurance buyers although presented as a merger the deal was actually more like a stock swap with travelers group purchasing the entirety of citicorp shares for  billion and issuing  new citigroup shares for each citicorp share through this mechanism existing shareholders of each company owned about half of the new firm while the new company maintained citicorps citi brand in its name it adopted travelers distinctive red umbrella as the new corporate logo which was used until  the chairmen of both parent companies john s reed and sandy weill respectively were announced as cochairmen and coceos of the new company citigroup inc although the vast difference in management styles between the two immediately presented question marks over the wisdom of such a setup the remaining provisions of the glass–steagall act—enacted following the great depression—forbade banks to merge with insurance underwriters and meant citigroup had between two and five years to divest any prohibited assets however weill stated at the time of the merger that they believed that over that time the legislation will changewe have had enough discussions to believe this will not be a problem indeed the passing of the grammleachbliley act in november  vindicated reed and weills views opening the door to financial services conglomerates offering a mix of commercial banking investment banking insurance underwriting and brokerage joe plumeri worked on the postmerger integration of the two companies and was appointed ceo of citibank north america by weill and reed he oversaw its network of  retail branches j paul newsome an analyst with cibc oppenheimer said hes not the spitandpolish executive many people expected hes rough on the edges but citibank knows the bank as an institution is in trouble—it cant get away anymore with passive selling—and plumeri has all the passion to throw a glass of cold water on the bank investment news speculated that a successful tenure at citibank might lead to a promotion to head up all of citicorp plumeri boosted the units earnings from  million to  million in one year an increase of nearly  he unexpectedly retired from citibank however in january  in  citigroup acquired associates first capital corporation for about  billion in stock which until  had been owned by gulfwestern now part of national amusements and later by ford the associates was widely criticized for predatory lending practices and citi eventually settled with the federal trade commission by agreeing to pay  million to customers who had been victims of a variety of predatory practices including flipping mortgages packing mortgages with optional credit insurance and deceptive marketing practices in  citigroup made additional acquisitions european american bank in july for  billion and banamex assisted by independent adviser windsor capital investments limited in august for  billion spinoff of travelers edit the current logo for travelers companies the company spun off its travelers property and casualty insurance underwriting business in  the spin off was prompted by the insurance units drag on citigroup stock price because travelers earnings were more seasonal and vulnerable to large disasters particularly the september   attacks on the world trade center in downtown new york city it was also difficult to sell this kind of insurance directly to customers since most industrial customers are accustomed to purchasing insurance through a broker the travelers property casualty corporation merged with the st paul companies inc in  forming the st paul travelers companies citigroup retained the life insurance and annuities underwriting business however it sold those businesses to metlife in  citigroup still sells life insurance through citibank but it no longer underwrites insurance in spite of divesting travelers insurance citigroup retained travelers signature red umbrella logo as its own until february  when citigroup agreed to sell the logo back to st paul travelers which renamed itself travelers companies citigroup also decided to adopt the corporate brand citi for itself and virtually all its subsidiaries except primerica and banamex subprime mortgage crisis edit heavy exposure to troubled mortgages in the form of collateralized debt obligation cdos compounded by poor risk management led citigroup into trouble as the subprime mortgage crisis worsened  the company had used elaborate mathematical risk models which looked at mortgages in particular geographical areas but never included the possibility of a national housing downturn or the prospect that millions of mortgage holders would default on their mortgages trading head thomas maheras was close friends with senior risk officer david bushnell which undermined risk oversight as treasury secretary robert rubin was said to be influential in lifting the regulations that allowed travelers and citicorp to merge in  then on the board of directors of citigroup rubin and charles prince were said to be influential in pushing the company towards mbs and cdos in the subprime mortgage market starting in june  senior vice president richard m bowen iii the chief underwriter of citigroups consumer lending group began warning the board of directors about the extreme risks being taken on by the mortgage operation that could potentially result in massive losses the group bought and sold  billion of residential mortgages annually bowens responsibility was essentially to serve as the quality control supervisor ensuring the units creditworthiness when bowen first blew the whistle in   of the mortgages were defective the amount of bad mortgages began increasing throughout  and eventually exceeded  of the volume many of the mortgages were not only defective but were fraudulent bowen attempted to rouse the board via weekly reports and other communications on november   bowen emailed citigroup chairman robert rubin and the banks chief financial officer head auditor and the chief risk management officer to again expose the risk and potential losses claiming that the groups internal controls had broken down and requesting an outside investigation of his business unit the subsequent investigation revealed that at the consumer lending group had suffered a breakdown of internal controls since  regardless of the findings of the investigation bowens charges were ignored despite the fact that withholding such information from shareholders violated the sarbanes–oxley act sox which he had pointed out citigroup ceo charles prince signed a certification that the bank was in compliance with sox despite bowen revealing this wasnt so citigroup eventually stripped bowen of most of his responsibilities and informing him that his physical presence was no longer required at the bank the financial crisis inquiry commission asked him to testify about citigroups role in the mortgage crisis and he did so appearing as one of the first witnesses before the commission in april  as the crisis began to unfold citigroup announced on april   that it would eliminate  jobs or about  percent of its workforce in a broad restructuring designed to cut costs and bolster its long underperforming stock even after securities and brokerage firm bear stearns ran into serious trouble in summer  citigroup decided the possibility of trouble with its cdos was so tiny less than  of  that they excluded them from their risk analysis with the crisis worsening

stabilize the company and forestall a further deterioration in the companys value on november   the us government announced a massive stimulus package for citigroup designed to rescue the company from bankruptcy while giving the government a major say in its operations a joint statement by the us treasury department the federal reserve and the federal deposit insurance corp announced with these

analysis of the global distribution of wealth and consumers in it they state that global imbalances have grown to the extent as to justify talking of a plutonomy and demand for a renewed understanding

share the managerial aristocracy like in the gilded age the roaring twenties and the thriving nineties needs to commandeer a vast chunk of that rising profit share either through capital income or

citigroup logo – citigroup was formed on october   following the  billion merger of citicorp and travelers group to create the worlds largest financial services organization the history of the company is thus divided into the workings of several firms that over time amalgamated into citicorp a multinational banking corporation operating in more than  countries or travelers group whose businesses covered credit services consumer finance brokerage and insurance as such the company history dates back to the founding of the city bank of new york later citibank in  bank handlowy in  smith barney in  banamex in  salomon brothers in  citicorp –edit city bank of new york was chartered by new york state on june   with  million of capital serving a group of new york merchants the bank opened for business on september  of that year and samuel osgood was elected as the first president of the company the companys name was changed to the national city bank of new york in  after it joined the new us national banking system and it became the largest american bank by  it became the first contributor to the federal reserve bank of new york in  and the following year it inaugurated the first overseas branch of a us bank in buenos aires although the bank had since the midth century been active in plantation economies such as the cuban sugar industry the  purchase of us overseas bank international banking corporation helped it become the first american bank to surpass  billion in assets and it became the largest commercial bank in the world in  as it grew the bank became a leading innovator in financial services becoming the first major us bank to offer compound interest on savings  unsecured personal loans  customer checking accounts  and the negotiable certificate of deposit  the bank changed its name to the first national city bank of new york in  which was shortened in  to first national city bank on the th anniversary of the companys foundation the company organically entered the leasing and credit card sectors and its introduction of us dollar–denominated certificates of deposit in london marked the first new negotiable instrument in market since  the bank introduced its first national city charge service credit card—popularly known as the everything card and later to become mastercard—in  in  under the leadership of ceo walter b wriston first national city bank and its holding company first national city corporation was renamed as citibank na and citicorp respectively shortly afterward the bank launched the citicard which pioneered the use of hour atms john s reed was elected ceo in  and citi became a founding member of the chaps clearing house in london under his leadership the next  years would see citibank become the largest bank in the united states and the largest issuer of credit cards and charge cards in the world and expand its global reach to over  countries travelers group –edit the corporate logo of travelers inc – prior to merger with citicorp travelers group at the time of merger was a diverse group of financial concerns that had been brought together under ceo sandy weill its roots came from commercial credit a subsidiary of control data corporation that was taken private by weill in november  after taking charge of the company earlier that year two years later weill mastered the buyout of primerica—a conglomerate that had already bought life insurer a l williams as well as stock broker smith barney the new company took the primerica name and employed a crossselling strategy such that each of the entities within the parent company aimed to sell each others services its nonfinancial businesses were spun off in september  travelers insurance which had suffered from poor real estate investments and sustained significant losses in the aftermath of hurricane andrew formed a strategic alliance with primerica that would lead to its amalgamation into a single company in december  with the acquisition the group became travelers inc property  casualty and life  annuities underwriting capabilities were added to the business meanwhile the distinctive travelers red umbrella logo which was also acquired in the deal was applied to all the businesses within the newly named organization during this period travelers acquired shearson lehman—a retail brokerage and asset management firm that was headed by weill until —and merged it with smith barney ownership of salomon brothers –edit in november  travelers group which had been renamed again in april  when they merged with aetna property and casualty inc acquired salomon brothers a major bond dealer and bulge bracket investment bank in a  billion transaction this deal complemented travelerssmith barney well as salomon was focused on fixedincome and institutional clients whereas smith barney was strong in equities and retail salomon brothers absorbed smith barney into the new securities unit termed salomon smith barney a year later the division incorporated citicorps former securities operations as well the salomon smith barney name was abandoned in october  after a series of financial scandals that tarnished the banks reputation merger of citicorp and travelers –edit on april   the merger between citicorp and travelers group was announced to the world creating a  billion firm with assets of almost  billion the deal would enable travelers to market mutual funds and insurance to citicorps retail customers while giving the banking divisions access to an expanded client base of investors and insurance buyers although presented as a merger the deal was actually more like a stock swap with travelers group purchasing the entirety of citicorp shares for  billion and issuing  new citigroup shares for each citicorp share through this mechanism existing shareholders of each company owned about half of the new firm while the new company maintained citicorps citi brand in its name it adopted travelers distinctive red umbrella as the new corporate logo which was used until  the chairmen of both parent companies john s reed and sandy weill respectively were announced as cochairmen and coceos of the new company citigroup inc although the vast difference in management styles between the two immediately presented question marks over the wisdom of such a setup the remaining provisions of the glass–steagall act—enacted following the great depression—forbade banks to merge with insurance underwriters and meant citigroup had between two and five years to divest any prohibited assets however weill stated at the time of the merger that they believed that over that time the legislation will changewe have had enough discussions to believe this will not be a problem indeed the passing of the grammleachbliley act in november  vindicated reed and weills views opening the door to financial services conglomerates offering a mix of commercial banking investment banking insurance underwriting and brokerage joe plumeri worked on the postmerger integration of the two companies and was appointed ceo of citibank north america by weill and reed he oversaw its network of  retail branches j paul newsome an analyst with cibc oppenheimer said hes not the spitandpolish executive many people expected hes rough on the edges but citibank knows the bank as an institution is in trouble—it cant get away anymore with passive selling—and plumeri has all the passion to throw a glass of cold water on the bank investment news speculated that a successful tenure at citibank might lead to a promotion to head up all of citicorp plumeri boosted the units earnings from  million to  million in one year an increase of nearly  he unexpectedly retired from citibank however in january  in  citigroup acquired associates first capital corporation for about  billion in stock which until  had been owned by gulfwestern now part of national amusements and later by ford the associates was widely criticized for predatory lending practices and citi eventually settled with the federal trade commission by agreeing to pay  million to customers who had been victims of a variety of predatory practices including flipping mortgages packing mortgages with optional credit insurance and deceptive marketing practices in  citigroup made additional acquisitions european american bank in july for  billion and banamex assisted by independent adviser windsor capital investments limited in august for  billion spinoff of travelers edit the current logo for travelers companies the company spun off its travelers property and casualty insurance underwriting business in  the spin off was prompted by the insurance units drag on citigroup stock price because travelers earnings were more seasonal and vulnerable to large disasters particularly the september   attacks on the world trade center in downtown new york city it was also difficult to sell this kind of insurance directly to customers since most industrial customers are accustomed to purchasing insurance through a broker the travelers property casualty corporation merged with the st paul companies inc in  forming the st paul travelers companies citigroup retained the life insurance and annuities underwriting business however it sold those businesses to metlife in  citigroup still sells life insurance through citibank but it no longer underwrites insurance in spite of divesting travelers insurance citigroup retained travelers signature red umbrella logo as its own until february  when citigroup agreed to sell the logo back to st paul travelers which renamed itself travelers companies citigroup also decided to adopt the corporate brand citi for itself and virtually all its subsidiaries except primerica and banamex subprime mortgage crisis edit heavy exposure to troubled mortgages in the form of collateralized debt obligation cdos compounded by poor risk management led citigroup into trouble as the subprime mortgage crisis worsened  the company had used elaborate mathematical risk models which looked at mortgages in particular geographical areas but never included the possibility of a national housing downturn or the prospect that millions of mortgage holders would default on their mortgages trading head thomas maheras was close friends with senior risk officer david bushnell which undermined risk oversight as treasury secretary robert rubin was said to be influential in lifting the regulations that allowed travelers and citicorp to merge in  then on the board of directors of citigroup rubin and charles prince were said to be influential in pushing the company towards mbs and cdos in the subprime mortgage market starting in june  senior vice president richard m bowen iii the chief underwriter of citigroups consumer lending group began warning the board of directors about the extreme risks being taken on by the mortgage operation that could potentially result in massive losses the group bought and sold  billion of residential mortgages annually bowens responsibility was essentially to serve as the quality control supervisor ensuring the units creditworthiness when bowen first blew the whistle in   of the mortgages were defective the amount of bad mortgages began increasing throughout  and eventually exceeded  of the volume many of the mortgages were not only defective but were fraudulent bowen attempted to rouse the board via weekly reports and other communications on november   bowen emailed citigroup chairman robert rubin and the banks chief financial officer head auditor and the chief risk management officer to again expose the risk and potential losses claiming that the groups internal controls had broken down and requesting an outside investigation of his business unit the subsequent investigation revealed that at the consumer lending group had suffered a breakdown of internal controls since  regardless of the findings of the investigation bowens charges were ignored despite the fact that withholding such information from shareholders violated the sarbanes–oxley act sox which he had pointed out citigroup ceo charles prince signed a certification that the bank was in compliance with sox despite bowen revealing this wasnt so citigroup eventually stripped bowen of most of his responsibilities and informing him that his physical presence was no longer required at the bank the financial crisis inquiry commission asked him to testify about citigroups role in the mortgage crisis and he did so appearing as one of the first witnesses before the commission in april  as the crisis began to unfold citigroup announced on april   that it would eliminate  jobs or about  percent of its workforce in a broad restructuring designed to cut costs and bolster its long underperforming stock even after securities and brokerage firm bear stearns ran into serious trouble in summer  citigroup decided the possibility of trouble with its cdos was so tiny less than  of  that they excluded them from their risk analysis with the crisis worsening citigroup announced on january   that it was considering cutting another  percent to  percent of its  memberworkforce collapse  us government intervention edit by november  citigroup was insolvent despite its receipt of  billion in taxpayer funded federal troubled asset relief program

eventually staff cuts totaled over  employees its stock market value dropped to  billion down from  billion two years earlier shares of citigroup common stock traded well below  on the new york stock exchange as a result late in the evening on november   citigroup and federal regulators approved a plan to stabilize the company and forestall a further deterioration in the companys value on november   the us government announced a massive stimulus package for citigroup designed to rescue the company from bankruptcy while giving the government a major say in its operations a joint statement by the

clients from  a team of global strategists at citigroup wrote an analysis of the global distribution of wealth and consumers in it they state that global imbalances have grown to the extent as to justify talking of a plutonomy and demand for a renewed understanding of how this impacts consumption the authors cite data showing that the top  households in the us economy account for about  of the total income in  which is roughly equal to the share of the bottom  of households put together moreover in terms of wealth they demonstrate even more inequality such that the top  of households also account for  of net worth greater than the bottom  of households put together it gets better or worse depending on your political stripe  the top  of households account for  of financial net worth more than the bottom  of households put together of the current plutonomies namely united states united kingdom and canada they describe six key drivers an ongoing biotechnological revolution capitalistfriendly governments and tax regimes globalization that rearranges global supply chains with mobile wellcapitalized elites and immigrants greater financial complexity and innovation the rule of law and patent protection are all well in the report the authors advocate to maintain unequal distribution of wealth in the sense that …society and governments need to be amenable to disproportionately allowencourage the few to retain that fatter profit share the managerial aristocracy like in the gilded age the roaring twenties and the thriving nineties needs to commandeer a vast chunk of that rising profit share either through capital income or simply paying itself a lot moreover the authors say that in industrialize countries there seems to be a relationship between income concentration plutonomy and the household savings rates such that the latter tend to fall in plutonomies the ultimate objective of their report is to examine how to make money of this the report has

citigroup logo – citigroup was formed on october   following the  billion merger of citicorp and travelers group to create the worlds largest financial services organization the history of the company is thus divided into the workings of several firms that over time amalgamated into citicorp a multinational banking corporation operating in more than  countries or travelers group whose businesses covered credit services consumer finance brokerage and insurance as such the company history dates back to the founding of the city bank of new york later citibank in  bank handlowy in  smith barney in  banamex in  salomon brothers in  citicorp –edit city bank of new york was chartered by new york state on june   with  million of capital serving a group of new york merchants the bank opened for business on september  of that year and samuel osgood was elected as the first president of the company the companys name was changed to the national city bank of new york in  after it joined the new us national banking system and it became the largest american bank by  it became the first contributor to the federal reserve bank of new york in  and the following year it inaugurated the first overseas branch of a us bank in buenos aires although the bank had since the midth century been active in plantation economies such as the cuban sugar industry the  purchase of us overseas bank international banking corporation helped it become the first american bank to surpass  billion in assets and it became the largest commercial bank in the world in  as it grew the bank became a leading innovator in financial services becoming the first major us bank to offer compound interest on savings  unsecured personal loans  customer checking accounts  and the negotiable certificate of deposit  the bank changed its name to the first national city bank of new york in  which was shortened in  to first national city bank on the th anniversary of the companys foundation the company organically entered the leasing and credit card sectors and its introduction of us dollar–denominated certificates of deposit in london marked the first new negotiable instrument in market since  the bank introduced its first national city charge service credit card—popularly known as the everything card and later to become mastercard—in  in  under the leadership of ceo walter b wriston first national city bank and its holding company first national city corporation was renamed as citibank na and citicorp respectively shortly afterward the bank launched the citicard which pioneered the use of hour atms john s reed was elected ceo in  and citi became a founding member of the chaps clearing house in london under his leadership the next  years would see citibank become the largest bank in the united states and the largest issuer of credit cards and charge cards in the world and expand its global reach to over  countries travelers group –edit the corporate logo of travelers inc – prior to merger with citicorp travelers group at the time of merger was a diverse group of financial concerns that had been brought together under ceo sandy weill its roots came from commercial credit a subsidiary of control data corporation that was taken private by weill in november  after taking charge of the company earlier that year two years later weill mastered the buyout of primerica—a conglomerate that had already bought life insurer a l williams as well as stock broker smith barney the new company took the primerica name and employed a crossselling strategy such that each of the entities within the parent company aimed to sell each others services its nonfinancial businesses were spun off in september  travelers insurance which had suffered from poor real estate investments and sustained significant losses in the aftermath of hurricane andrew formed a strategic alliance with primerica that would lead to its amalgamation into a single company in december  with the acquisition the group became travelers inc property  casualty and life  annuities underwriting capabilities were added to the business meanwhile the distinctive travelers red umbrella logo which was also acquired in the deal was applied to all the businesses within the newly named organization during this period travelers acquired shearson lehman—a retail brokerage and asset management firm that was headed by weill until —and merged it with smith barney ownership of salomon brothers –edit in november  travelers group which had been renamed again in april  when they merged with aetna property and casualty inc acquired salomon brothers a major bond dealer and bulge bracket investment bank in a  billion transaction this deal complemented travelerssmith barney well as salomon was focused on fixedincome and institutional clients whereas smith barney was strong in equities and retail salomon brothers absorbed smith barney into the new securities unit termed salomon smith barney a year later the division incorporated citicorps former securities operations as well the salomon smith barney name was abandoned in october  after a series of financial scandals that tarnished the banks reputation merger of citicorp and travelers –edit on april   the merger between citicorp and travelers group was announced to the world creating a  billion firm with assets of almost  billion the deal would enable travelers to market mutual funds and insurance to citicorps retail customers while giving the banking divisions access to an expanded client base of investors and insurance buyers although presented as a merger the deal was actually more like a stock swap with travelers group purchasing the entirety of citicorp shares for  billion and issuing  new citigroup shares for each citicorp share through this mechanism existing shareholders of each company owned about half of the new firm while the new company maintained citicorps citi brand in its name it adopted travelers distinctive red umbrella as the new corporate logo which was used until  the chairmen of both parent companies john s reed and sandy weill respectively were announced as cochairmen and coceos of the new company citigroup inc although the vast difference in management styles between the two immediately presented question marks over the wisdom of such a setup the remaining provisions of the glass–steagall act—enacted following the great depression—forbade banks to merge with insurance underwriters and meant citigroup had between two and five years to divest any prohibited assets however weill stated at the time of the merger that they believed that over that time the legislation will changewe have had enough discussions to believe this will not be a problem indeed the passing of the grammleachbliley act in november  vindicated reed and weills views opening the door to financial services conglomerates offering a mix of commercial banking investment banking insurance underwriting and brokerage joe plumeri worked on the postmerger integration of the two companies and was appointed ceo of citibank north america by weill and reed he oversaw its network of  retail branches j paul newsome an analyst with cibc oppenheimer said hes not the spitandpolish executive many people expected hes rough on the edges but citibank knows the bank as an institution is in trouble—it cant get away anymore with passive selling—and plumeri has all the passion to throw a glass of cold water on the bank investment news speculated that a successful tenure at citibank might lead to a promotion to head up all of citicorp plumeri boosted the units earnings from  million to  million in one year an increase of nearly  he unexpectedly retired from citibank however in january  in  citigroup acquired associates first capital corporation for about  billion in stock which until  had been owned by gulfwestern now part of national amusements and later by ford the associates was widely criticized for predatory lending practices and citi eventually settled with the federal trade commission by agreeing to pay  million to customers who had been victims of a variety of predatory practices including flipping mortgages packing mortgages with optional credit insurance and deceptive marketing practices in  citigroup made additional acquisitions european american bank in july for  billion and banamex assisted by independent adviser windsor capital investments limited in august for  billion spinoff of travelers edit the current logo for travelers companies the company spun off its travelers property and casualty insurance underwriting business in  the spin off was prompted by the insurance units drag on citigroup stock price because travelers earnings were more seasonal and vulnerable to large disasters particularly the september   attacks on the world trade center in downtown new york city it was also difficult to sell this kind of insurance directly to customers since most industrial customers are accustomed to purchasing insurance through a broker the travelers property casualty corporation merged with the st paul companies inc in  forming the st paul travelers companies citigroup retained the life insurance and annuities underwriting business however it sold those businesses to metlife in  citigroup still sells life insurance through citibank but it no longer underwrites insurance in spite of divesting travelers insurance citigroup retained travelers signature red umbrella logo as its own until february  when citigroup agreed to sell the logo back to st paul travelers which renamed itself travelers companies citigroup also decided to adopt the corporate brand citi for itself and virtually all its subsidiaries except primerica and banamex subprime mortgage crisis edit heavy exposure to troubled mortgages in the form of collateralized debt obligation cdos compounded by poor risk management led citigroup into trouble as the subprime mortgage crisis worsened  the company had used elaborate mathematical risk models which looked at mortgages in particular geographical areas but never included the possibility of a national housing downturn or the prospect that millions of mortgage holders would default on their mortgages trading head thomas maheras was close friends with senior risk officer david bushnell which undermined risk oversight as treasury secretary robert rubin was said to be influential in lifting the regulations that allowed travelers and citicorp to merge in  then on the board of directors of citigroup rubin and charles prince were said to be influential in pushing the company towards mbs and cdos in the subprime mortgage market starting in june  senior vice president richard m bowen iii the chief underwriter of citigroups consumer lending group began warning the board of directors about the extreme risks being taken on by the mortgage operation that could potentially result in massive losses the group bought and sold  billion of residential mortgages annually bowens responsibility was essentially to serve as the quality control supervisor ensuring the units creditworthiness when bowen first blew the whistle in   of the mortgages were defective the amount of bad mortgages began increasing throughout  and eventually exceeded  of the volume many of the mortgages were not only defective but were fraudulent bowen attempted to rouse the board via weekly reports and other communications on november   bowen emailed citigroup chairman robert rubin and the banks chief financial officer head auditor and the chief risk management officer to again expose the risk and potential losses claiming that the groups internal controls had broken down and requesting an outside investigation of his business unit the subsequent investigation revealed that at the consumer lending group had suffered a breakdown of internal controls since  regardless of the findings of the investigation bowens charges were ignored despite the fact that withholding such information from shareholders violated the sarbanes–oxley act sox which he had pointed out citigroup ceo charles prince signed a certification that the bank was in compliance with sox despite bowen revealing this wasnt so citigroup eventually stripped bowen of most of his responsibilities and informing him that his physical presence was no longer required at the bank the financial crisis inquiry commission asked him to testify about citigroups role in the mortgage crisis and he did so appearing as one of the first witnesses before the commission in april  as the crisis began to unfold citigroup announced on april   that it would eliminate  jobs or about  percent of its workforce in a broad restructuring designed to cut costs and bolster its long underperforming stock even after securities and brokerage firm bear stearns ran into serious trouble in summer  citigroup decided the possibility of trouble with its cdos was so tiny less than  of  that they excluded them from their risk analysis with the crisis worsening citigroup announced on january   that it was considering cutting another  percent to  percent of its  memberworkforce collapse  us government intervention edit by november  citigroup was insolvent despite its receipt of  billion in taxpayer funded federal troubled asset relief program

eventually staff cuts totaled over  employees its stock market value dropped to  billion down from  billion two years earlier shares of citigroup common stock traded well below  on the new york stock exchange as a result late in the evening on november   citigroup and federal regulators approved a plan to stabilize the company and forestall a further deterioration in the companys value on november   the us government announced a massive stimulus package for citigroup designed to rescue the company from bankruptcy while giving the government a major say in its operations a joint statement by the

clients from  a team of global strategists at citigroup wrote an analysis of the global distribution of wealth and consumers in it they state that global imbalances have grown to the extent as to justify talking of a plutonomy and demand for a renewed understanding of how this impacts consumption the authors cite data showing that the top  households in the us economy account for about  of the total income in  which is roughly equal to the share of the bottom  of households put together moreover in terms of wealth they demonstrate even more inequality such that the top  of households also account for  of net worth greater than the bottom  of households put together it gets better or worse depending on your political stripe  the top  of households account for  of financial net worth more than the bottom  of households put together of the current plutonomies namely united states united kingdom and canada they describe six key drivers an ongoing biotechnological revolution capitalistfriendly governments and tax regimes globalization that rearranges global supply chains with mobile wellcapitalized elites and immigrants greater financial complexity and innovation the rule of law and patent protection are all well in the report the authors advocate to maintain unequal distribution of wealth in the sense that …society and governments need to be amenable to disproportionately allowencourage the few to retain that fatter profit share the managerial aristocracy like in the gilded age the roaring twenties and the thriving nineties needs to commandeer a vast chunk of that rising profit share either through capital income or simply paying itself a lot moreover the authors say that in industrialize countries there seems to be a relationship between income concentration plutonomy and the household savings rates such that the latter tend to fall in plutonomies the ultimate objective of their report is to examine how to make money of this the report has

citigroup logo – citigroup was formed on october   following the  billion merger of citicorp and travelers group to create the worlds largest financial services organization the history of the company is thus divided into the workings of several firms that over time amalgamated into citicorp a multinational banking corporation operating in more than  countries or travelers group whose businesses covered credit services consumer finance brokerage and insurance as such the company history dates back to the founding of the city bank of new york later citibank in  bank handlowy in  smith barney in  banamex in  salomon brothers in  citicorp –edit city bank of new york was chartered by new york state on june   with  million of capital serving a group of new york merchants the bank opened for business on september  of that year and samuel osgood was elected as the first president of the company the companys name was changed to the national city bank of new york in  after it joined the new us national banking system and it became the largest american bank by  it became the first contributor to the federal reserve bank of new york in  and the following year it inaugurated the first overseas branch of a us bank in buenos aires although the bank had since the midth century been active in plantation economies such as the cuban sugar industry the  purchase of us overseas bank international banking corporation helped it become the first american bank to surpass  billion in assets and it became the largest commercial bank in the world in  as it grew the bank became a leading innovator in financial services becoming the first major us bank to offer compound interest on savings  unsecured personal loans  customer checking accounts  and the negotiable certificate of deposit  the bank changed its name to the first national city bank of new york in  which was shortened in  to first national city bank on the th anniversary of the companys foundation the company organically entered the leasing and credit card sectors and its introduction of us dollar–denominated certificates of deposit in london marked the first new negotiable instrument in market since  the bank introduced its first national city charge service credit card—popularly known as the everything card and later to become mastercard—in  in  under the leadership of ceo walter b wriston first national city bank and its holding company first national city corporation was renamed as citibank na and citicorp respectively shortly afterward the bank launched the citicard which pioneered the use of hour atms john s reed was elected ceo in  and citi became a founding member of the chaps clearing house in london under his leadership the next  years would see citibank become the largest bank in the united states and the largest issuer of credit cards and charge cards in the world and expand its global reach to over  countries travelers group –edit the corporate logo of travelers inc – prior to merger with citicorp travelers group at the time of merger was a diverse group of financial concerns that had been brought together under ceo sandy weill its roots came from commercial credit a subsidiary of control data corporation that was taken private by weill in november  after taking charge of the company earlier that year two years later weill mastered the buyout of primerica—a conglomerate that had already bought life insurer a l williams as well as stock broker smith barney the new company took the primerica name and employed a crossselling strategy such that each of the entities within the parent company aimed to sell each others services its nonfinancial businesses were spun off in september  travelers insurance which had suffered from poor real estate investments and sustained significant losses in the aftermath of hurricane andrew formed a strategic alliance with primerica that would lead to its amalgamation into a single company in december  with the acquisition the group became travelers inc property  casualty and life  annuities underwriting capabilities were added to the business meanwhile the distinctive travelers red umbrella logo which was also acquired in the deal was applied to all the businesses within the newly named organization during this period travelers acquired shearson lehman—a retail brokerage and asset management firm that was headed by weill until —and merged it with smith barney ownership of salomon brothers –edit in november  travelers group which had been renamed again in april  when they merged with aetna property and casualty inc acquired salomon brothers a major bond dealer and bulge bracket investment bank in a  billion transaction this deal complemented travelerssmith barney well as salomon was focused on fixedincome and institutional clients whereas smith barney was strong in equities and retail salomon brothers absorbed smith barney into the new securities unit termed salomon smith barney a year later the division incorporated citicorps former securities operations as well the salomon smith barney name was abandoned in october  after a series of financial scandals that tarnished the banks reputation merger of citicorp and travelers –edit on april   the merger between citicorp and travelers group was announced to the world creating a  billion firm with assets of almost  billion the deal would enable travelers to market mutual funds and insurance to citicorps retail customers while giving the banking divisions access to an expanded client base of investors and insurance buyers although presented as a merger the deal was actually more like a stock swap with travelers group purchasing the entirety of citicorp shares for  billion and issuing  new citigroup shares for each citicorp share through this mechanism existing shareholders of each company owned about half of the new firm while the new company maintained citicorps citi brand in its name it adopted travelers distinctive red umbrella as the new corporate logo which was used until  the chairmen of both parent companies john s reed and sandy weill respectively were announced as cochairmen and coceos of the new company citigroup inc although the vast difference in management styles between the two immediately presented question marks over the wisdom of such a setup the remaining provisions of the glass–steagall act—enacted following the great depression—forbade banks to merge with insurance underwriters and meant citigroup had between two and five years to divest any prohibited assets however weill stated at the time of the merger that they believed that over that time the legislation will changewe have had enough discussions to believe this will not be a problem indeed the passing of the grammleachbliley act in november  vindicated reed and weills views opening the door to financial services conglomerates offering a mix of commercial banking investment banking insurance underwriting and brokerage joe plumeri worked on the postmerger integration of the two companies and was appointed ceo of citibank north america by weill and reed he oversaw its network of  retail branches j paul newsome an analyst with cibc oppenheimer said hes not the spitandpolish executive many people expected hes rough on the edges but citibank knows the bank as an institution is in trouble—it cant get away anymore with passive selling—and plumeri has all the passion to throw a glass of cold water on the bank investment news speculated that a successful tenure at citibank might lead to a promotion to head up all of citicorp plumeri boosted the units earnings from  million to  million in one year an increase of nearly  he unexpectedly retired from citibank however in january  in  citigroup acquired associates first capital corporation for about  billion in stock which until  had been owned by gulfwestern now part of national amusements and later by ford the associates was widely criticized for predatory lending practices and citi eventually settled with the federal trade commission by agreeing to pay  million to customers who had been victims of a variety of predatory practices including flipping mortgages packing mortgages with optional credit insurance and deceptive marketing practices in  citigroup made additional acquisitions european american bank in july for  billion and banamex assisted by independent adviser windsor capital investments limited in august for  billion spinoff of travelers edit the current logo for travelers companies the company spun off its travelers property and casualty insurance underwriting business in  the spin off was prompted by the insurance units drag on citigroup stock price because travelers earnings were more seasonal and vulnerable to large disasters particularly the september   attacks on the world trade center in downtown new york city it was also difficult to sell this kind of insurance directly to customers since most industrial customers are accustomed to purchasing insurance through a broker the travelers property casualty corporation merged with the st paul companies inc in  forming the st paul travelers companies citigroup retained the life insurance and annuities underwriting business however it sold those businesses to metlife in  citigroup still sells life insurance through citibank but it no longer underwrites insurance in spite of divesting travelers insurance citigroup retained travelers signature red umbrella logo as its own until february  when citigroup agreed to sell the logo back to st paul travelers which renamed itself travelers companies citigroup also decided to adopt the corporate brand citi for itself and virtually all its subsidiaries except primerica and banamex subprime mortgage crisis edit heavy exposure to troubled mortgages in the form of collateralized debt obligation cdos compounded by poor risk management led citigroup into trouble as the subprime mortgage crisis worsened  the company had used elaborate mathematical risk models which looked at mortgages in particular geographical areas but never included the possibility of a national housing downturn or the prospect that millions of mortgage holders would default on their mortgages trading head thomas maheras was close friends with senior risk officer david bushnell which undermined risk oversight as treasury secretary robert rubin was said to be influential in lifting the regulations that allowed travelers and citicorp to merge in  then on the board of directors of citigroup rubin and charles prince were said to be influential in pushing the company towards mbs and cdos in the subprime mortgage market starting in june  senior vice president richard m bowen iii the chief underwriter of citigroups consumer lending group began warning the board of directors about the extreme risks being taken on by the mortgage operation that could potentially result in massive losses the group bought and sold  billion of residential mortgages annually bowens responsibility was essentially to serve as the quality control supervisor ensuring the units creditworthiness when bowen first blew the whistle in   of the mortgages were defective the amount of bad mortgages began increasing throughout  and eventually exceeded  of the volume many of the mortgages were not only defective but were fraudulent bowen attempted to rouse the board via weekly reports and other communications on november   bowen emailed citigroup chairman robert rubin and the banks chief financial officer head auditor and the chief risk management officer to again expose the risk and potential losses claiming that the groups internal controls had broken down and requesting an outside investigation of his business unit the subsequent investigation revealed that at the consumer lending group had suffered a breakdown of internal controls since  regardless of the findings of the investigation bowens charges were ignored despite the fact that withholding such information from shareholders violated the sarbanes–oxley act sox which he had pointed out citigroup ceo charles prince signed a certification that the bank was in compliance with sox despite bowen revealing this wasnt so citigroup eventually stripped bowen of most of his responsibilities and informing him that his physical presence was no longer required at the bank the financial crisis inquiry commission asked him to testify about citigroups role in the mortgage crisis and he did so appearing as one of the first witnesses before the commission in april  as the crisis began to unfold citigroup announced on april   that it would eliminate  jobs or about  percent of its workforce in a broad restructuring designed to cut costs and bolster its long underperforming stock even after securities and brokerage firm bear stearns ran into serious trouble in summer  citigroup decided the possibility of trouble with its cdos was so tiny less than  of  that they excluded them from their risk analysis with the crisis worsening citigroup announced on january   that it was considering cutting another  percent to  percent of its  memberworkforce collapse  us government intervention edit by november  citigroup was insolvent despite its receipt of  billion in taxpayer funded federal troubled asset relief program

eventually staff cuts totaled over  employees its stock market value dropped to  billion down from  billion two years earlier shares of citigroup common stock traded well below  on the new york stock exchange as a result late in the evening on november   citigroup and federal regulators approved a plan to stabilize the company and forestall a further deterioration in the companys value on november   the us government announced a massive stimulus package for citigroup designed to rescue the company from bankruptcy while giving the government a major say in its operations a joint statement by the us treasury department the federal reserve and the federal deposit insurance corp announced with these transactions the us government is taking the actions necessary to strengthen the financial system

clients from  a team of global strategists at citigroup wrote an analysis of the global distribution of wealth and consumers in it they state that global imbalances have grown to the extent as to justify talking of a plutonomy and demand for a renewed understanding of how this impacts consumption the authors cite data showing that the top  households in the us economy account for about  of the total income in  which is roughly equal to the share of the bottom  of households put together moreover in terms of wealth they demonstrate even more inequality such that the top  of households also account for  of net worth greater than the bottom  of households put together it gets better or worse depending on your political stripe  the top  of households account for  of financial net worth more than the bottom  of households put together of the current plutonomies namely united states united kingdom and canada they describe six key drivers an ongoing biotechnological revolution capitalistfriendly governments and tax regimes globalization that rearranges global supply chains with mobile wellcapitalized elites and immigrants greater financial complexity and innovation the rule of law and patent protection are all well in the report the authors advocate to maintain unequal distribution of wealth in the sense that …society and governments need to be amenable to disproportionately allowencourage the few to retain that fatter profit share the managerial aristocracy like in the gilded age the roaring twenties and the thriving nineties needs to commandeer a vast chunk of that rising profit share either through capital income or simply paying itself a lot moreover the authors say that in industrialize countries there seems to be a relationship between income concentration plutonomy and the household savings rates such that the latter tend to fall in plutonomies the ultimate objective of their report is to examine how to make money of this the report has

citigroup logo – citigroup was formed on october   following the  billion merger of citicorp and travelers group to create the worlds largest financial services organization the history of the company is thus divided into the workings of several firms that over time amalgamated into citicorp a multinational banking corporation operating in more than  countries or travelers group whose businesses covered credit services consumer finance brokerage and insurance as such the company history dates back to the founding of the city bank of new york later citibank in  bank handlowy in  smith barney in  banamex in  salomon brothers in  citicorp –edit city bank of new york was chartered by new york state on june   with  million of capital serving a group of new york merchants the bank opened for business on september  of that year and samuel osgood was elected as the first president of the company the companys name was changed to the national city bank of new york in  after it joined the new us national banking system and it became the largest american bank by  it became the first contributor to the federal reserve bank of new york in  and the following year it inaugurated the first overseas branch of a us bank in buenos aires although the bank had since the midth century been active in plantation economies such as the cuban sugar industry the  purchase of us overseas bank international banking corporation helped it become the first american bank to surpass  billion in assets and it became the largest commercial bank in the world in  as it grew the bank became a leading innovator in financial services becoming the first major us bank to offer compound interest on savings  unsecured personal loans  customer checking accounts  and the negotiable certificate of deposit  the bank changed its name to the first national city bank of new york in  which was shortened in  to first national city bank on the th anniversary of the companys foundation the company organically entered the leasing and credit card sectors and its introduction of us dollar–denominated certificates of deposit in london marked the first new negotiable instrument in market since  the bank introduced its first national city charge service credit card—popularly known as the everything card and later to become mastercard—in  in  under the leadership of ceo walter b wriston first national city bank and its holding company first national city corporation was renamed as citibank na and citicorp respectively shortly afterward the bank launched the citicard which pioneered the use of hour atms john s reed was elected ceo in  and citi became a founding member of the chaps clearing house in london under his leadership the next  years would see citibank become the largest bank in the united states and the largest issuer of credit cards and charge cards in the world and expand its global reach to over  countries travelers group –edit the corporate logo of travelers inc – prior to merger with citicorp travelers group at the time of merger was a diverse group of financial concerns that had been brought together under ceo sandy weill its roots came from commercial credit a subsidiary of control data corporation that was taken private by weill in november  after taking charge of the company earlier that year two years later weill mastered the buyout of primerica—a conglomerate that had already bought life insurer a l williams as well as stock broker smith barney the new company took the primerica name and employed a crossselling strategy such that each of the entities within the parent company aimed to sell each others services its nonfinancial businesses were spun off in september  travelers insurance which had suffered from poor real estate investments and sustained significant losses in the aftermath of hurricane andrew formed a strategic alliance with primerica that would lead to its amalgamation into a single company in december  with the acquisition the group became travelers inc property  casualty and life  annuities underwriting capabilities were added to the business meanwhile the distinctive travelers red umbrella logo which was also acquired in the deal was applied to all the businesses within the newly named organization during this period travelers acquired shearson lehman—a retail brokerage and asset management firm that was headed by weill until —and merged it with smith barney ownership of salomon brothers –edit in november  travelers group which had been renamed again in april  when they merged with aetna property and casualty inc acquired salomon brothers a major bond dealer and bulge bracket investment bank in a  billion transaction this deal complemented travelerssmith barney well as salomon was focused on fixedincome and institutional clients whereas smith barney was strong in equities and retail salomon brothers absorbed smith barney into the new securities unit termed salomon smith barney a year later the division incorporated citicorps former securities operations as well the salomon smith barney name was abandoned in october  after a series of financial scandals that tarnished the banks reputation merger of citicorp and travelers –edit on april   the merger between citicorp and travelers group was announced to the world creating a  billion firm with assets of almost  billion the deal would enable travelers to market mutual funds and insurance to citicorps retail customers while giving the banking divisions access to an expanded client base of investors and insurance buyers although presented as a merger the deal was actually more like a stock swap with travelers group purchasing the entirety of citicorp shares for  billion and issuing  new citigroup shares for each citicorp share through this mechanism existing shareholders of each company owned about half of the new firm while the new company maintained citicorps citi brand in its name it adopted travelers distinctive red umbrella as the new corporate logo which was used until  the chairmen of both parent companies john s reed and sandy weill respectively were announced as cochairmen and coceos of the new company citigroup inc although the vast difference in management styles between the two immediately presented question marks over the wisdom of such a setup the remaining provisions of the glass–steagall act—enacted following the great depression—forbade banks to merge with insurance underwriters and meant citigroup had between two and five years to divest any prohibited assets however weill stated at the time of the merger that they believed that over that time the legislation will changewe have had enough discussions to believe this will not be a problem indeed the passing of the grammleachbliley act in november  vindicated reed and weills views opening the door to financial services conglomerates offering a mix of commercial banking investment banking insurance underwriting and brokerage joe plumeri worked on the postmerger integration of the two companies and was appointed ceo of citibank north america by weill and reed he oversaw its network of  retail branches j paul newsome an analyst with cibc oppenheimer said hes not the spitandpolish executive many people expected hes rough on the edges but citibank knows the bank as an institution is in trouble—it cant get away anymore with passive selling—and plumeri has all the passion to throw a glass of cold water on the bank investment news speculated that a successful tenure at citibank might lead to a promotion to head up all of citicorp plumeri boosted the units earnings from  million to  million in one year an increase of nearly  he unexpectedly retired from citibank however in january  in  citigroup acquired associates first capital corporation for about  billion in stock which until  had been owned by gulfwestern now part of national amusements and later by ford the associates was widely criticized for predatory lending practices and citi eventually settled with the federal trade commission by agreeing to pay  million to customers who had been victims of a variety of predatory practices including flipping mortgages packing mortgages with optional credit insurance and deceptive marketing practices in  citigroup made additional acquisitions european american bank in july for  billion and banamex assisted by independent adviser windsor capital investments limited in august for  billion spinoff of travelers edit the current logo for travelers companies the company spun off its travelers property and casualty insurance underwriting business in  the spin off was prompted by the insurance units drag on citigroup stock price because travelers earnings were more seasonal and vulnerable to large disasters particularly the september   attacks on the world trade center in downtown new york city it was also difficult to sell this kind of insurance directly to customers since most industrial customers are accustomed to purchasing insurance through a broker the travelers property casualty corporation merged with the st paul companies inc in  forming the st paul travelers companies citigroup retained the life insurance and annuities underwriting business however it sold those businesses to metlife in  citigroup still sells life insurance through citibank but it no longer underwrites insurance in spite of divesting travelers insurance citigroup retained travelers signature red umbrella logo as its own until february  when citigroup agreed to sell the logo back to st paul travelers which renamed itself travelers companies citigroup also decided to adopt the corporate brand citi for itself and virtually all its subsidiaries except primerica and banamex subprime mortgage crisis edit heavy exposure to troubled mortgages in the form of collateralized debt obligation cdos compounded by poor risk management led citigroup into trouble as the subprime mortgage crisis worsened  the company had used elaborate mathematical risk models which looked at mortgages in particular geographical areas but never included the possibility of a national housing downturn or the prospect that millions of mortgage holders would default on their mortgages trading head thomas maheras was close friends with senior risk officer david bushnell which undermined risk oversight as treasury secretary robert rubin was said to be influential in lifting the regulations that allowed travelers and citicorp to merge in  then on the board of directors of citigroup rubin and charles prince were said to be influential in pushing the company towards mbs and cdos in the subprime mortgage market starting in june  senior vice president richard m bowen iii the chief underwriter of citigroups consumer lending group began warning the board of directors about the extreme risks being taken on by the mortgage operation that could potentially result in massive losses the group bought and sold  billion of residential mortgages annually bowens responsibility was essentially to serve as the quality control supervisor ensuring the units creditworthiness when bowen first blew the whistle in   of the mortgages were defective the amount of bad mortgages began increasing throughout  and eventually exceeded  of the volume many of the mortgages were not only defective but were fraudulent bowen attempted to rouse the board via weekly reports and other communications on november   bowen emailed citigroup chairman robert rubin and the banks chief financial officer head auditor and the chief risk management officer to again expose the risk and potential losses claiming that the groups internal controls had broken down and requesting an outside investigation of his business unit the subsequent investigation revealed that at the consumer lending group had suffered a breakdown of internal controls since  regardless of the findings of the investigation bowens charges were ignored despite the fact that withholding such information from shareholders violated the sarbanes–oxley act sox which he had pointed out citigroup ceo charles prince signed a certification that the bank was in compliance with sox despite bowen revealing this wasnt so citigroup eventually stripped bowen of most of his responsibilities and informing him that his physical presence was no longer required at the bank the financial crisis inquiry commission asked him to testify about citigroups role in the mortgage crisis and he did so appearing as one of the first witnesses before the commission in april  as the crisis began to unfold citigroup announced on april   that it would eliminate  jobs or about  percent of its workforce in a broad restructuring designed to cut costs and bolster its long underperforming stock even after securities and brokerage firm bear stearns ran into serious trouble in summer  citigroup decided the possibility of trouble with its cdos was so tiny less than  of  that they excluded them from their risk analysis with the crisis worsening citigroup announced on january   that it was considering cutting another  percent to  percent of its  memberworkforce collapse  us government intervention edit by november  citigroup was insolvent despite its receipt of  billion in taxpayer funded federal troubled asset relief program

eventually staff cuts totaled over  employees its stock market value dropped to  billion down from  billion two years earlier shares of citigroup common stock traded well below  on the new york stock exchange as a result late in the evening on november   citigroup and federal regulators approved a plan to stabilize the company and forestall a further deterioration in the companys value on november   the us government announced a massive stimulus package for citigroup designed to rescue the company from bankruptcy while giving the government a major say in its operations a joint statement by the us treasury department the federal reserve and the federal deposit insurance corp announced with these transactions the us government is taking the actions necessary to strengthen the financial system

the government from selling its shares for a profit expansion of retail banking operations edit in  citi was the first bank to introduce digitized smart banking branches in washington dc new york

clients from  a team of global strategists at citigroup wrote an analysis of the global distribution of wealth and consumers in it they state that global imbalances have grown to the extent as to justify talking of a plutonomy and demand for a renewed understanding of how this impacts consumption the authors cite data showing that the top  households in the us economy account for about  of the total income in  which is roughly equal to the share of the bottom  of households put together moreover in terms of wealth they demonstrate even more inequality such that the top  of households also account for  of net worth greater than the bottom  of households put together it gets better or worse depending on your political stripe  the top  of households account for  of financial net worth more than the bottom  of households put together of the current plutonomies namely united states united kingdom and canada they describe six key drivers an ongoing biotechnological revolution capitalistfriendly governments and tax regimes globalization that rearranges global supply chains with mobile wellcapitalized elites and immigrants greater financial complexity and innovation the rule of law and patent protection are all well in the report the authors advocate to maintain unequal distribution of wealth in the sense that …society and governments need to be amenable to disproportionately allowencourage the few to retain that fatter profit share the managerial aristocracy like in the gilded age the roaring twenties and the thriving nineties needs to commandeer a vast chunk of that rising profit share either through capital income or simply paying itself a lot moreover the authors say that in industrialize countries there seems to be a relationship between income concentration plutonomy and the household savings rates such that the latter tend to fall in plutonomies the ultimate objective of their report is to examine how to make money of this the report has

citigroup logo – citigroup was formed on october   following the  billion merger of citicorp and travelers group to create the worlds largest financial services organization the history of the company is thus divided into the workings of several firms that over time amalgamated into citicorp a multinational banking corporation operating in more than  countries or travelers group whose businesses covered credit services consumer finance brokerage and insurance as such the company history dates back to the founding of the city bank of new york later citibank in  bank handlowy in  smith barney in  banamex in  salomon brothers in  citicorp –edit city bank of new york was chartered by new york state on june   with  million of capital serving a group of new york merchants the bank opened for business on september  of that year and samuel osgood was elected as the first president of the company the companys name was changed to the national city bank of new york in  after it joined the new us national banking system and it became the largest american bank by  it became the first contributor to the federal reserve bank of new york in  and the following year it inaugurated the first overseas branch of a us bank in buenos aires although the bank had since the midth century been active in plantation economies such as the cuban sugar industry the  purchase of us overseas bank international banking corporation helped it become the first american bank to surpass  billion in assets and it became the largest commercial bank in the world in  as it grew the bank became a leading innovator in financial services becoming the first major us bank to offer compound interest on savings  unsecured personal loans  customer checking accounts  and the negotiable certificate of deposit  the bank changed its name to the first national city bank of new york in  which was shortened in  to first national city bank on the th anniversary of the companys foundation the company organically entered the leasing and credit card sectors and its introduction of us dollar–denominated certificates of deposit in london marked the first new negotiable instrument in market since  the bank introduced its first national city charge service credit card—popularly known as the everything card and later to become mastercard—in  in  under the leadership of ceo walter b wriston first national city bank and its holding company first national city corporation was renamed as citibank na and citicorp respectively shortly afterward the bank launched the citicard which pioneered the use of hour atms john s reed was elected ceo in  and citi became a founding member of the chaps clearing house in london under his leadership the next  years would see citibank become the largest bank in the united states and the largest issuer of credit cards and charge cards in the world and expand its global reach to over  countries travelers group –edit the corporate logo of travelers inc – prior to merger with citicorp travelers group at the time of merger was a diverse group of financial concerns that had been brought together under ceo sandy weill its roots came from commercial credit a subsidiary of control data corporation that was taken private by weill in november  after taking charge of the company earlier that year two years later weill mastered the buyout of primerica—a conglomerate that had already bought life insurer a l williams as well as stock broker smith barney the new company took the primerica name and employed a crossselling strategy such that each of the entities within the parent company aimed to sell each others services its nonfinancial businesses were spun off in september  travelers insurance which had suffered from poor real estate investments and sustained significant losses in the aftermath of hurricane andrew formed a strategic alliance with primerica that would lead to its amalgamation into a single company in december  with the acquisition the group became travelers inc property  casualty and life  annuities underwriting capabilities were added to the business meanwhile the distinctive travelers red umbrella logo which was also acquired in the deal was applied to all the businesses within the newly named organization during this period travelers acquired shearson lehman—a retail brokerage and asset management firm that was headed by weill until —and merged it with smith barney ownership of salomon brothers –edit in november  travelers group which had been renamed again in april  when they merged with aetna property and casualty inc acquired salomon brothers a major bond dealer and bulge bracket investment bank in a  billion transaction this deal complemented travelerssmith barney well as salomon was focused on fixedincome and institutional clients whereas smith barney was strong in equities and retail salomon brothers absorbed smith barney into the new securities unit termed salomon smith barney a year later the division incorporated citicorps former securities operations as well the salomon smith barney name was abandoned in october  after a series of financial scandals that tarnished the banks reputation merger of citicorp and travelers –edit on april   the merger between citicorp and travelers group was announced to the world creating a  billion firm with assets of almost  billion the deal would enable travelers to market mutual funds and insurance to citicorps retail customers while giving the banking divisions access to an expanded client base of investors and insurance buyers although presented as a merger the deal was actually more like a stock swap with travelers group purchasing the entirety of citicorp shares for  billion and issuing  new citigroup shares for each citicorp share through this mechanism existing shareholders of each company owned about half of the new firm while the new company maintained citicorps citi brand in its name it adopted travelers distinctive red umbrella as the new corporate logo which was used until  the chairmen of both parent companies john s reed and sandy weill respectively were announced as cochairmen and coceos of the new company citigroup inc although the vast difference in management styles between the two immediately presented question marks over the wisdom of such a setup the remaining provisions of the glass–steagall act—enacted following the great depression—forbade banks to merge with insurance underwriters and meant citigroup had between two and five years to divest any prohibited assets however weill stated at the time of the merger that they believed that over that time the legislation will changewe have had enough discussions to believe this will not be a problem indeed the passing of the grammleachbliley act in november  vindicated reed and weills views opening the door to financial services conglomerates offering a mix of commercial banking investment banking insurance underwriting and brokerage joe plumeri worked on the postmerger integration of the two companies and was appointed ceo of citibank north america by weill and reed he oversaw its network of  retail branches j paul newsome an analyst with cibc oppenheimer said hes not the spitandpolish executive many people expected hes rough on the edges but citibank knows the bank as an institution is in trouble—it cant get away anymore with passive selling—and plumeri has all the passion to throw a glass of cold water on the bank investment news speculated that a successful tenure at citibank might lead to a promotion to head up all of citicorp plumeri boosted the units earnings from  million to  million in one year an increase of nearly  he unexpectedly retired from citibank however in january  in  citigroup acquired associates first capital corporation for about  billion in stock which until  had been owned by gulfwestern now part of national amusements and later by ford the associates was widely criticized for predatory lending practices and citi eventually settled with the federal trade commission by agreeing to pay  million to customers who had been victims of a variety of predatory practices including flipping mortgages packing mortgages with optional credit insurance and deceptive marketing practices in  citigroup made additional acquisitions european american bank in july for  billion and banamex assisted by independent adviser windsor capital investments limited in august for  billion spinoff of travelers edit the current logo for travelers companies the company spun off its travelers property and casualty insurance underwriting business in  the spin off was prompted by the insurance units drag on citigroup stock price because travelers earnings were more seasonal and vulnerable to large disasters particularly the september   attacks on the world trade center in downtown new york city it was also difficult to sell this kind of insurance directly to customers since most industrial customers are accustomed to purchasing insurance through a broker the travelers property casualty corporation merged with the st paul companies inc in  forming the st paul travelers companies citigroup retained the life insurance and annuities underwriting business however it sold those businesses to metlife in  citigroup still sells life insurance through citibank but it no longer underwrites insurance in spite of divesting travelers insurance citigroup retained travelers signature red umbrella logo as its own until february  when citigroup agreed to sell the logo back to st paul travelers which renamed itself travelers companies citigroup also decided to adopt the corporate brand citi for itself and virtually all its subsidiaries except primerica and banamex subprime mortgage crisis edit heavy exposure to troubled mortgages in the form of collateralized debt obligation cdos compounded by poor risk management led citigroup into trouble as the subprime mortgage crisis worsened  the company had used elaborate mathematical risk models which looked at mortgages in particular geographical areas but never included the possibility of a national housing downturn or the prospect that millions of mortgage holders would default on their mortgages trading head thomas maheras was close friends with senior risk officer david bushnell which undermined risk oversight as treasury secretary robert rubin was said to be influential in lifting the regulations that allowed travelers and citicorp to merge in  then on the board of directors of citigroup rubin and charles prince were said to be influential in pushing the company towards mbs and cdos in the subprime mortgage market starting in june  senior vice president richard m bowen iii the chief underwriter of citigroups consumer lending group began warning the board of directors about the extreme risks being taken on by the mortgage operation that could potentially result in massive losses the group bought and sold  billion of residential mortgages annually bowens responsibility was essentially to serve as the quality control supervisor ensuring the units creditworthiness when bowen first blew the whistle in   of the mortgages were defective the amount of bad mortgages began increasing throughout  and eventually exceeded  of the volume many of the mortgages were not only defective but were fraudulent bowen attempted to rouse the board via weekly reports and other communications on november   bowen emailed citigroup chairman robert rubin and the banks chief financial officer head auditor and the chief risk management officer to again expose the risk and potential losses claiming that the groups internal controls had broken down and requesting an outside investigation of his business unit the subsequent investigation revealed that at the consumer lending group had suffered a breakdown of internal controls since  regardless of the findings of the investigation bowens charges were ignored despite the fact that withholding such information from shareholders violated the sarbanes–oxley act sox which he had pointed out citigroup ceo charles prince signed a certification that the bank was in compliance with sox despite bowen revealing this wasnt so citigroup eventually stripped bowen of most of his responsibilities and informing him that his physical presence was no longer required at the bank the financial crisis inquiry commission asked him to testify about citigroups role in the mortgage crisis and he did so appearing as one of the first witnesses before the commission in april  as the crisis began to unfold citigroup announced on april   that it would eliminate  jobs or about  percent of its workforce in a broad restructuring designed to cut costs and bolster its long underperforming stock even after securities and brokerage firm bear stearns ran into serious trouble in summer  citigroup decided the possibility of trouble with its cdos was so tiny less than  of  that they excluded them from their risk analysis with the crisis worsening citigroup announced on january   that it was considering cutting another  percent to  percent of its  memberworkforce collapse  us government intervention edit by november  citigroup was insolvent despite its receipt of  billion in taxpayer funded federal troubled asset relief program

eventually staff cuts totaled over  employees its stock market value dropped to  billion down from  billion two years earlier shares of citigroup common stock traded well below  on the new york stock exchange as a result late in the evening on november   citigroup and federal regulators approved a plan to stabilize the company and forestall a further deterioration in the companys value on november   the us government announced a massive stimulus package for citigroup designed to rescue the company from bankruptcy while giving the government a major say in its operations a joint statement by the us treasury department the federal reserve and the federal deposit insurance corp announced with these transactions the us government is taking the actions necessary to strengthen the financial system

the government from selling its shares for a profit expansion of retail banking operations edit in  citi was the first bank to introduce digitized smart banking branches in washington dc new york

clients from  a team of global strategists at citigroup wrote an analysis of the global distribution of wealth and consumers in it they state that global imbalances have grown to the extent as to justify talking of a plutonomy and demand for a renewed understanding of how this impacts consumption the authors cite data showing that the top  households in the us economy account for about  of the total income in  which is roughly equal to the share of the bottom  of households put together moreover in terms of wealth they demonstrate even more inequality such that the top  of households also account for  of net worth greater than the bottom  of households put together it gets better or worse depending on your political stripe  the top  of households account for  of financial net worth more than the bottom  of households put together of the current plutonomies namely united states united kingdom and canada they describe six key drivers an ongoing biotechnological revolution capitalistfriendly governments and tax regimes globalization that rearranges global supply chains with mobile wellcapitalized elites and immigrants greater financial complexity and innovation the rule of law and patent protection are all well in the report the authors advocate to maintain unequal distribution of wealth in the sense that …society and governments need to be amenable to disproportionately allowencourage the few to retain that fatter profit share the managerial aristocracy like in the gilded age the roaring twenties and the thriving nineties needs to commandeer a vast chunk of that rising profit share either through capital income or simply paying itself a lot moreover the authors say that in industrialize countries there seems to be a relationship between income concentration plutonomy and the household savings rates such that the latter tend to fall in plutonomies the ultimate objective of their report is to examine how to make money of this the report has

provisions of section a of the securities exchange act of  as amended dtc was created to hold securities for its participating organizations participants and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between participants through electronic book entries thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of certificates participants include securities brokers and dealers including the underwriter banks trust companies and clearing corporations indirect access to the dtc system is also available to others such as banks brokers dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a participant either directly or indirectly indirect participants certificate owners that are not participants or indirect participants but desire to

owners have accounts with respect to the bookentry certificates similarly are required to make bookentry transfers and receive and transmit such payments on behalf of their respective certificate owners accordingly although certificate owners will not possess definitive certificates the rules provide a mechanism by which certificate owners through their participants and indirect participants will receive payments and will be able to transfer their interest because dtc can only act on behalf of participants who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and on behalf of certain banks the ability of a certificate owner to pledge bookentry certificates to persons or entities that do not participate in the dtc system or to otherwise act with respect to such certificates may be limited due to the absence of physical certificates for the book entry certificates in addition under a bookentry format certificate owners may experience delays in their receipt of payments since

percentage for any distribution date occurring prior to the distribution date in   will be equal to  the lockout distribution percentage for any distribution date occurring after the first  years

properties acquired by foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure any such advance a pi advance pi advances are required to be made only to the extent they are deemed by the applicable master servicer to be recoverable from related late collections insurance proceeds or liquidation proceeds the purpose of making such pi advances is to maintain a regular cash flow to the certificateholders rather than to guarantee or insure against losses neither master servicer will not be required to make any pi advances with respect to reductions in the amount of the monthly payments on the mortgage loans due to bankruptcy proceedings or the application of the relief act all pi advances will be reimbursable to the applicable master servicer from late collections insurance proceeds and liquidation proceeds from the mortgage loan as to which such unreimbursed pi advance was made in addition any pi advances previously made in respect of any mortgage loan that are deemed by the applicable master servicer to be nonrecoverable from related late collections insurance proceeds or liquidation proceeds may be reimbursed to such master servicer out of any funds in the certificate account prior to the distributions on the certificates in the event either master servicer fails in its obligation to make any such advance the trustee will be obligated to make any such advance to the extent required

in each case until the certificate principal balance of such class has been reduced to zero thereafter such realized losses and any extraordinary trust fund expenses will be allocated on any distribution date among the class a certificates on a pro rata basis excess special hazard losses excess bankruptcy losses excess fraud losses and extraordinary losses collectively excess losses will be allocated on any distribution date among all the certificates other than the class xs certificates on a pro rata basis any allocation of a realized loss to a certificate will be made by reducing the certificate principal balance thereof by the amount so allocated as of the distribution date in the month following the calendar month in which such realized loss was incurred an allocation of a realized loss on a pro rata basis among two or more classes of certificates means an allocation to each such class of certificates on the basis of its then outstanding certificate principal balance prior to giving effect to distributions to be made on such distribution date with respect to any defaulted mortgage loan that is finally liquidated through foreclosure sale disposition s of the related mortgaged property if acquired on behalf of the certificateholders by deed inlieu of foreclosure or otherwise the amount of loss realized if any will equal the portion of the unpaid principal balance remaining if any plus interest thereon through the last day of the month in which such mortgage loan was finally liquidated after application of all amounts recovered net of amounts reimbursable to the master servicer for pi advances servicing fees and servicing advances towards interest and principal owing on the mortgage loan such amount of loss realized and any special hazard losses fraud losses and bankruptcy losses are referred to herein as realized losses in the event that realized losses are incurred that are covered by subordination such losses will be allocated to the most subordinate class of certificates then outstanding the priorities for distribution of cash flows described herein in certain circumstances may result in cash flow shortfalls to any class of subordinate certificates even if it is not the most subordinate class of certificates then outstanding however the interest portion of any such shortfall would be distributable as unpaid interest distribution amount on future distribution dates as cash flows allow to the extent of available funds and the principal portion of any such shortfall would not result in a reduction of the certificate principal balance of such class in such event the percentage interest represented by such class would increase relative to the respective certificate principal balances of the more subordinate classes of certificates with respect to the most subordinate class of the certificates outstanding at the time any realized loss is incurred the total amount of the realized loss allocated to such class may be greater than the concurrent reduction in the certificate principal balance thereof because such reduction will not reflect any undistributed interest distribution amount on such class such undistributed interest distribution amount on the most subordinate class of the certificates outstanding will not be distributable on any future distribution date as a result it is possible that the total amount of realized losses that may be allocated to any class of subordinate certificates may exceed the initial certificate principal balance thereof in order to maximize the likelihood of distribution in full of the senior interest distribution amount and the senior principal distribution amount on each distribution date holders of senior certificates have a right to distributions of the available distribution amount that is prior to the rights of the holders of the subordinate certificates to the extent necessary to satisfy the senior interest distribution amount and the senior principal distribution amount the application of the senior prepayment percentage when it exceeds the senior percentage to determine the senior principal distribution amount will accelerate the amortization of the class a certificates relative to the actual amortization of the mortgage loans to the extent that the class a certificates are amortized faster than the mortgage loans in the absence of offsetting realized losses allocated to the subordinate certificates the percentage interest evidenced by the class a certificates in the trust fund will be decreased with a corresponding increase in the percentage interest in the trust fund evidenced by the subordinate certificates thereby increasing relative to their respective certificate principal balances the subordination

certain issues relevant to or are not applicable to securities such as the class xs certificates in addition there is considerable uncertainty concerning the application of the oid regulations to remic regular certificates that provide for payments based on a variable rate such as the class xs certificates prospective purchasers of the class xs certificates are advised to consult their tax advisors concerning the tax treatment of such certificates if the method of computing original issue discount described in the prospectus results in a negative amount for any period with respect to any certificateholder in particular the holders of the class xs certificates the amount of original issue discount allocable to such period would be zero and such certificateholder will be permitted to offset such amounts only against the respective future income if any from such certificate although uncertain a certificateholder may be permitted to deduct a loss to the extent that his or her respective remaining basis in such certificate exceeds the maximum amount of future payments to which such certificateholder is entitled assuming no further prepayments of the mortgage loans although the matter is not free from doubt any such loss might be treated as a capital loss the oid regulations suggest that original issue discount with respect to securities such as the class xs certificates that represent multiple uncertificated remic regular interests in which ownership interests will be issued simultaneously to the same buyer should be computed on an aggregate method in the absence of further guidance from the irs original issue discount with respect to the uncertificated regular interests represented by the class xs certificates will be reported to the irs and the certificateholders on an aggregate method based on a single overall constant yield and the prepayment assumption stated above treating all such uncertificated regular interests as a single debt instrument as set forth in the oid regulations the oid regulations in some circumstances permit the holder of a debt instrument to recognize original issue discount under a method that differs from that of the issuer accordingly it is possible that holders of offered certificates issued with original issue discount may be able to select a method for recognizing original issue discount that differs from that used in preparing reports to certificateholders and the irs prospective purchasers of offered certificates issued with original issue discount are advised to consult their tax advisors concerning the tax treatment of such certificates in this regard certain classes of certificates may be treated for federal income tax purposes as having been issued with a premium certificateholders may elect to amortize such premium under a constant yield method in which case such amortizable premium will generally be allocated among the interest payments on such certificates and will be applied as an offset against such interest payments see federal income tax consequencesremicstaxation of owners of remic regular certificatespremium in the prospectus the offered

transferors may remain liable for any taxes due with respect to the income on the residual certificates all transfers of the residual certificates will be subject to certain restrictions under the terms of the agreement that are intended to reduce the possibility of any such transfer being disregarded to the extent that the residual certificates constitute noneconomic residual interests the holders of the residual certificates will be required to report taxable income and pay tax with respect to the early accrual periods of the remics term that significantly exceeds the amount of cash distributions received by such holders from the remic with respect to such periods furthermore the tax on such income will exceed the cash distributions with respect to such periods s consequently holders of residual certificates should have other sources of funds sufficient to pay any federal income taxes due in the earlier years of the remic as a result of their ownership of class r certificates in addition the required inclusion of this amount of taxable income during the remics earlier accrual periods and the deferral of corresponding tax losses or deductions until later accrual periods or until the ultimate sale or disposition of a residual certificate or possibly later under the wash sale rules of section  of the code may cause the aftertax rate of return of a holder of a residual certificate to be zero or negative even where such holders pretax rate of return is positive that is on a present value basis the resulting tax liabilities of a holder of a

ceo walter b wriston first national city bank and its holding company first national city corporation was renamed as citibank na and citicorp respectively shortly afterward the bank launched the citicard which pioneered the use of hour atms john s reed was elected ceo in  and citi became a founding member of the chaps clearing house in london under his leadership the next  years would see citibank become the largest bank in the united states and the largest issuer of credit cards and charge cards in the world and expand its global reach to over  countries travelers group –edit the corporate logo of travelers inc – prior to merger with citicorp travelers group at the time of merger was a diverse group of financial concerns that had been brought together under ceo sandy weill its roots came from commercial credit a subsidiary of control data corporation that was taken private by weill in november  after taking charge of the company earlier that year two years later weill mastered the buyout of primerica—a conglomerate that had already bought life insurer a l williams as well as stock broker smith barney the new company took the primerica name and employed a crossselling strategy such that each of the entities within the parent company aimed to sell each others services its nonfinancial businesses were spun off in september  travelers insurance which had suffered from poor real estate investments and sustained significant losses in the aftermath of hurricane andrew formed a strategic alliance with primerica that would lead to its amalgamation into a single company in december  with the acquisition the group became travelers inc property  casualty and life  annuities underwriting capabilities were added to the business meanwhile the distinctive travelers red umbrella logo which was also acquired in the deal was applied to all the businesses within the newly named organization during this period travelers acquired shearson lehman—a retail brokerage and asset management firm that was headed by weill until —and merged it with smith barney ownership of salomon brothers –edit in november  travelers group which had been renamed again in april  when they merged with aetna property and casualty inc acquired salomon brothers a major bond dealer and bulge bracket investment bank in a  billion transaction this deal complemented travelerssmith barney well as salomon was focused on fixedincome and institutional clients whereas smith barney was strong in equities and retail salomon brothers absorbed smith barney into the new securities unit termed salomon smith barney a year later the division incorporated citicorps former securities operations as well the salomon smith barney name was abandoned in october  after a series of financial scandals that tarnished the banks reputation merger of citicorp and travelers –edit on april   the merger between citicorp and travelers group was announced to the world creating a  billion firm with assets of almost  billion the deal would enable travelers to market mutual funds and insurance to citicorps retail customers while giving the banking divisions access to an expanded client base of investors and insurance buyers although presented as a merger the deal was actually more like a stock swap with travelers group purchasing the entirety of citicorp shares for  billion and issuing  new citigroup shares for each citicorp share through this mechanism existing shareholders of each company owned about half of the new firm while the new company maintained citicorps citi brand in its name it adopted travelers distinctive red umbrella as the new corporate logo which was used until  the chairmen of both parent companies john s reed and sandy weill respectively were announced as cochairmen and coceos of the new company citigroup inc although the vast difference in management styles between the two immediately presented question marks over the wisdom of such a setup the remaining provisions of the glass–steagall act—enacted following the great depression—forbade banks to merge with insurance underwriters and meant citigroup had between two and five years to divest any prohibited assets however weill stated at the time of the merger that they believed that over that time the legislation will changewe have had enough discussions to believe this will not be a problem indeed the passing of the grammleachbliley act in november  vindicated reed and weills views opening the door to financial services conglomerates offering a mix of commercial banking investment banking insurance underwriting and brokerage joe plumeri worked on the postmerger integration of the two companies and was appointed ceo of citibank north america by weill and reed he oversaw its network of  retail branches j paul newsome an analyst with cibc oppenheimer said hes not the spitandpolish executive many people expected hes rough on the edges but citibank knows the bank as an institution is in trouble—it cant get away anymore with passive selling—and plumeri has all the passion to throw a glass of cold water on the bank investment news speculated that a successful tenure at citibank might lead to a promotion to head up all of citicorp plumeri boosted the units earnings from  million to  million in one year an increase of nearly  he unexpectedly retired from

victims of a variety of predatory practices including flipping mortgages packing mortgages with optional credit insurance and deceptive marketing practices in  citigroup made additional acquisitions european american bank in july for  billion and banamex assisted by independent adviser windsor capital investments limited in august for  billion spinoff of travelers edit the current logo for travelers companies the company spun off its travelers property and casualty insurance underwriting business in  the spin off was prompted by the insurance units drag on citigroup stock price because travelers earnings were more seasonal and vulnerable to large disasters particularly the september   attacks on the world trade center in downtown new york city it was also difficult to sell this kind of insurance directly to customers since most industrial customers are accustomed to purchasing insurance through a broker the travelers property casualty corporation merged with the st paul companies inc in  forming the st paul travelers companies citigroup retained the life insurance and annuities underwriting business however it sold those businesses to metlife in  citigroup still sells life insurance through citibank but it no longer underwrites insurance in spite of divesting travelers insurance citigroup retained travelers signature red umbrella logo as its own until february  when

the banks chief financial officer head auditor and the chief risk management officer to again expose the risk and potential losses claiming that the groups internal controls had broken down and requesting an outside investigation of his business unit the subsequent investigation revealed that at the consumer lending group had suffered a breakdown of internal controls since  regardless of the findings of the investigation bowens charges were ignored despite the fact that withholding such information from shareholders violated the sarbanes–oxley act sox which he had pointed out citigroup ceo charles prince signed a certification that the bank was in compliance with sox despite bowen revealing this wasnt so citigroup eventually stripped bowen of most of his responsibilities and

travelers group to create the worlds largest financial services organization the history of the company is thus divided into the workings of several firms that over time amalgamated into citicorp a multinational banking corporation operating in more than  countries or travelers group whose businesses covered credit services consumer finance brokerage and insurance as such the company history dates back to the founding of the city bank of new york later citibank in  bank handlowy in  smith barney in  banamex in  salomon brothers in  citicorp –edit city bank of new york was chartered by new york state on june   with  million of capital serving a group of new york merchants the bank opened for business on september  of that year and samuel osgood was elected as the first president of the company the companys name was changed to the national city bank of new york in  after it joined the new us national banking system and it became the largest american bank by  it became the first contributor to the federal reserve bank of new york in  and the following year it inaugurated the first overseas branch of a us bank in buenos aires although the bank had since the midth century been active in plantation economies such as the cuban sugar industry the  purchase of us overseas bank international banking corporation helped it become the first american bank to surpass  billion in assets and it became the largest commercial bank in the world in  as it grew the bank became a leading innovator in financial services becoming the first major us bank to offer compound interest on savings  unsecured personal loans  customer checking accounts  and the negotiable certificate of deposit  the bank changed its name to the first national city bank of new york in  which was shortened in  to first national city bank on the th anniversary of the companys foundation the company organically entered the leasing and credit card sectors and its introduction of us dollar–denominated certificates of deposit in london marked the first new negotiable instrument in market since  the bank introduced its first national city charge service credit card—popularly known as the everything card and later to become mastercard—in  in  under the leadership of ceo walter b wriston first national city bank and its holding company first national city corporation was renamed as citibank na and citicorp respectively shortly afterward the bank launched the citicard which pioneered the use of hour atms john s reed was elected ceo in  and citi became a founding member of the chaps clearing house in london under his leadership the next  years would see citibank become the largest bank in the united states and the largest issuer of credit cards and charge cards in the world and expand its global reach to over  countries travelers group –edit the corporate logo of travelers inc – prior to merger with citicorp travelers group at the time of merger was a diverse group of financial concerns that had been brought together under ceo sandy weill its roots came from commercial credit a subsidiary of control data corporation that was taken private by weill in november  after taking charge of the company earlier that year two years later weill mastered the buyout of primerica—a conglomerate that had already bought life insurer a l williams as well as stock broker smith barney the new company took the primerica name and employed a crossselling strategy such that each of the entities within the parent company aimed to sell each others services its nonfinancial businesses were spun off in september  travelers insurance which had suffered from poor real estate investments and sustained significant losses in the aftermath of hurricane andrew formed a strategic alliance with primerica that would lead to its amalgamation into a single company in december  with the acquisition the group became travelers inc property  casualty and life  annuities underwriting capabilities were added to the business meanwhile the distinctive travelers red umbrella logo which was also acquired in the deal was applied to all the businesses within the newly named organization during this period travelers acquired shearson lehman—a retail brokerage and asset management firm that was headed by weill until —and merged it with smith barney ownership of salomon brothers –edit in november  travelers group which had been renamed again in april  when they merged with aetna property and casualty inc acquired salomon brothers a major bond dealer and bulge bracket investment bank in a  billion transaction this deal complemented travelerssmith barney well as salomon was focused on fixedincome and institutional clients whereas smith barney was strong in equities and retail salomon brothers absorbed smith barney into the new securities unit termed salomon smith barney a year later the division incorporated citicorps former securities operations as well the salomon smith barney name was abandoned in october  after a series of financial scandals that tarnished the banks reputation merger of citicorp and travelers –edit on april   the merger between citicorp and travelers group was announced to the world creating a  billion firm with assets of almost  billion the deal would enable travelers to market mutual funds and insurance to citicorps retail customers while giving the banking divisions access to an expanded client base of investors and insurance buyers although presented as a merger the deal was actually more like a stock swap with travelers group purchasing the entirety of citicorp shares for  billion and issuing  new citigroup shares for each citicorp share through this mechanism existing shareholders of each company owned about half of the new firm while the new company maintained citicorps citi brand in its name it adopted travelers distinctive red umbrella as the new corporate logo which was used until  the chairmen of both parent companies john s reed and sandy weill respectively were announced as cochairmen and coceos of the new company citigroup inc although the vast difference in management styles between the two immediately presented question marks over the wisdom of such a setup the remaining provisions of the glass–steagall act—enacted following the great depression—forbade banks to merge with insurance underwriters and meant citigroup had between two and five years to divest any prohibited assets however weill stated at the time of the merger that they believed that over that time the legislation will changewe have had enough discussions to believe this will not be a problem indeed the passing of the grammleachbliley act in november  vindicated reed and weills views opening the door to financial services conglomerates offering a mix of commercial banking investment banking insurance underwriting and brokerage joe plumeri worked on the postmerger integration of the two companies and was appointed ceo of citibank north america by weill and reed he oversaw its network of  retail branches j paul newsome an analyst with cibc oppenheimer said hes not the spitandpolish executive many people expected hes rough on the edges but citibank knows the bank as an institution is in trouble—it cant get away anymore with passive selling—and plumeri has all the passion to throw a glass of cold water on the bank investment news speculated that a successful tenure at citibank might lead to a promotion to head up all of citicorp plumeri boosted the units earnings from  million to  million in one year an increase of nearly  he unexpectedly retired from citibank however in january  in  citigroup acquired associates first capital corporation for about  billion in stock which until  had been owned by gulfwestern now part of national amusements and later by ford the associates was widely criticized for predatory lending practices and citi eventually settled with the federal trade commission by agreeing to pay  million to customers who had been victims of a variety of predatory practices including flipping mortgages packing mortgages with optional credit insurance and deceptive marketing practices in  citigroup made additional acquisitions european american bank in july for  billion and banamex assisted by independent adviser windsor capital investments limited in august for  billion spinoff of travelers edit the current logo for travelers companies the company spun off its travelers property and casualty insurance underwriting business in  the spin off was prompted by the insurance units drag on citigroup stock price because travelers earnings were more seasonal and vulnerable to large disasters particularly the september   attacks on the world trade center in downtown new york city it was also difficult to sell this kind of insurance directly to customers since most industrial customers are accustomed to purchasing insurance through a broker the travelers property casualty corporation merged with the st paul companies inc in  forming the st paul travelers companies citigroup retained the life insurance and annuities underwriting business however it sold those businesses to metlife in  citigroup still sells life insurance through citibank but it no longer underwrites insurance in spite of divesting travelers insurance citigroup retained travelers signature red umbrella logo as its own until february  when citigroup agreed to sell the logo back to st paul travelers which renamed itself travelers companies citigroup also decided to adopt the corporate brand citi for itself and virtually all its subsidiaries except primerica and banamex subprime mortgage crisis edit heavy exposure to troubled mortgages in the form of collateralized debt obligation cdos compounded by poor risk management led citigroup into trouble as the subprime mortgage crisis worsened  the company had used elaborate mathematical risk models which looked at mortgages in particular geographical areas but never included the possibility of a national housing downturn or the prospect that millions of mortgage holders would default on their mortgages trading head thomas maheras was close friends with senior risk officer david bushnell which undermined risk oversight as treasury secretary robert rubin was said to be influential in lifting the regulations that allowed travelers and citicorp to merge in  then on the board of directors of citigroup rubin and charles prince were said to be influential in pushing the company towards mbs and cdos in the subprime mortgage market starting in june  senior vice president richard m bowen iii the chief underwriter of citigroups consumer lending group began warning the board of directors about the extreme risks being taken on by the mortgage operation that could potentially result in massive losses the group bought and sold  billion of residential mortgages annually bowens responsibility was essentially to serve as the quality control supervisor ensuring the units creditworthiness when bowen first blew the whistle in   of the mortgages were defective the amount of bad mortgages began increasing throughout  and eventually exceeded  of the volume many of the mortgages were not only defective but were fraudulent bowen attempted to rouse the board via weekly reports and other communications on november   bowen emailed citigroup chairman robert rubin and the banks chief financial officer head auditor and the chief risk management officer to again expose the risk and potential losses claiming that the groups internal controls had broken down and requesting an outside investigation of his business unit the subsequent investigation revealed that at the consumer lending group had suffered a breakdown of internal controls since  regardless of the findings of the investigation bowens charges were ignored despite the fact that withholding such information from shareholders violated the sarbanes–oxley act sox which he had pointed out citigroup ceo charles prince signed a certification that the bank was in compliance with sox despite bowen revealing this wasnt so citigroup eventually stripped bowen of most of his responsibilities and informing him that his physical presence was no longer required at the bank the financial crisis inquiry commission asked him to testify about citigroups role in the mortgage crisis and he did so appearing as one of the first witnesses before the commission in april  as the crisis began to unfold citigroup announced on april   that it would eliminate  jobs or about  percent of its workforce in a broad restructuring designed to cut costs and bolster its long underperforming stock even after securities and brokerage firm bear stearns ran

the latter tend to fall in plutonomies the ultimate objective of their report is to examine how to make money of this the report has also figured in michael moores capitalism a love story while his portrayal of the report has been criticized by the authors later reports by the same principal author mainly confirmed the previous findings tarp fundingedit in a new york times oped michael lewis and david einhorn described the november   billion guarantee as an undisguised gift without any real crisis motivating it according to new york attorney general andrew cuomo citigroup paid hundreds of millions of dollars in bonuses to more than  of its employees after it had received its  billion tarp funds in late  this included  employees each receiving  million in bonuses  employees each receiving  million bonuses  each receiving  million in bonuses and  each receiving bonuses of  million to more than  million as a result of the criticism and the us governments majority holding of citigroups common shares compensation and bonuses were restricted from february  until december  terra securities scandaledit in november  it became public that citigroup was heavily involved in the terra securities scandal which involved investments by eight municipalities of norway in various hedge funds in the united states bond market the funds were sold by terra securities asa to the municipalities while the products were delivered by citigroup terra securities asa filed for bankruptcy november   the day after they received a letter from the financial supervisory authority of norway announcing withdrawal of permissions to operate the letter stated the supervisory authority contends that citigroups presentation as well as the presentation from terra securities asa appears insufficient and misleading because central elements like information about potential extra payments and the size of these are omitted allegations of theft from customer accountsedit in august  citigroup agreed to pay nearly  million in refunds and fines to settle accusations by california attorney general jerry brown that it wrongly took funds from the accounts of credit card customers citigroup paid  million of restitution to roughly  customers nationwide a threeyear investigation found that citigroup from  to  used an improper computerized sweep feature to move positive balances from card accounts into the banks general fund without telling cardholders brown said that citigroup knowingly stole from its customers mostly poor people and the recently deceased when it designed and implemented the sweepswhen a whistleblower uncovered the scam and brought it to his superiors in  they buried the information and continued the illegal practice potential restructuring and liquidation by regulatorsedit in september  former wall street reporter ron suskind stated that treasury secretary timothy geithner ignored a  order from president barack obama to break up citigroup in an enormous restructuring and liquidation processpage needed according to suskind obama wanted to restructure the bank into several leaner and smaller companies while geithner was executing stress tests of american financial institutions robert kuttner wrote in his  book a presidency in peril that in spring  geithner and chief economic adviser larry summers believed that they could not seize liquidate and break up citigroup because they lacked the legal authority or the tools to do sopage needed the treasury department denied suskinds account in an email to the media stating this account is simply untrue the directive given by the president in march  was to develop a contingency plan for tough restructurings if the government ended up owning large shares of institutions at the conclusion of the stress tests that secretary geithner worked aggressively to put in place as part of the administrations financial stability plan while treasury began work on those contingency plans there was fortunately never a need to put them in place shareholder rejection of executive compensation planedit at citis  annual shareholders meeting on april  citis executive compensation package was rejected with approximately  of the votes being against approval the nonbinding vote was required under the doddfrank act which requires corporations to hold advisory shareholder votes on their executive compensation plans many shareholders expressed concerns about citis failed  fed stress test and lack of longterm performancebased metrics in its executive compensation plan one of the largest and most activist of the shareholders voting no the california public employees retirement system stated citi has not anchored rewards to performance a citigroup shareholder filed a lawsuit days after the vote claiming citi executives breached their fiduciary duties in response richard parsons former chairman of citigroup called the vote a serious matter a spokeswoman for citi said citis board of directors takes the shareholder vote seriously and along with senior management will consult with representative shareholders to understand their concerns and that the compensation committee of the board will carefully consider their shareholder input as we move forward accusations of futures market manipulationedit in january  bank regulators fined citigroup  million on account of five traders from the bank having manipulated us treasury futures more than  times between july  and december  citigroup was criticized for failing to adequately supervise its traders and for not having systems in place to detect spoofing which involves entering fake orders designed to fool others into thinking prices are poised to rise or fall communicationsedit lobbyingedit between  and  citigroup spent nearly  million lobbying the federal government as of  citigroup was the th largest political campaign contributor in the us out of all organizations according to the center for responsive politics from  to  members of the firm donated over   of which went to democrats and  of which went to republicans matthew vadum a senior editor at the conservative capital research center acknowledged these figures but pointed out that citigroup had been a longtime donor to leftwing pressure groups and referred to a capital research center foundation watch  study of fortune  foundation giving where citigroups foundation gave  times more money to groups on the left than to groups on the right during tax year  in  citigroup’s pac contributed  to campaigns of various members of congress ie  members of the house including  democrats where donations averaged about  per candidate of the  democrats supporting the  spending bill  had received campaign cash from citigroup’s pac at some point since  citigroup’s  donations favored republicans only slightly the bank’s pac had been nearly as generous to democrats as republicans –  to the democratic congressional campaign committee the maximum and  to the new democrat coalition a group of moderate democrats most of whom voted for the  spending package citibank’s pac made donations to both the campaigns and the leadership pacs of many top democrats who voted for the  spending bill including steny hoyer md house democratic whip and representatives jim himes dconn and debbie wasserman schultz dflorida public and governmental relationsedit in  former chairman richard parsons hired longtime washington dc lobbyist richard f hohlt to advise him and the company about relations with the us government though not to lobby for the company while some speculated anonymously that the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic would have been a particular focus of hohlts attention hohlt said hed had no contact with the government insurance corporation some former regulators found room to criticize hohlts involvement with citigroup because of his earlier involvement with the financialservices industry during the savings and loan crisis of the s hohlt responded that though mistakes were made in the earlier episode hed never been investigated by any government agency and his experience gave him reason to be back in the operating room as parties address the more recent crisis in  the company named edward skyler formerly in new york city government and at bloomberg lp to its senior public and governmental relations

citigroup logo – citigroup was formed on october   following the  billion merger of citicorp and travelers group to create the worlds largest financial services organization the history of the company is thus divided into the workings of several firms that over time amalgamated into citicorp a multinational banking corporation operating in more than  countries or travelers group whose businesses covered credit services consumer finance brokerage and insurance as such the company history dates back to the founding of the city bank of new york later citibank in  bank handlowy in  smith barney in  banamex in  salomon brothers in  citicorp –edit city bank of new york was chartered by new york state on june   with  million of capital serving a group of new york merchants the bank opened for business on september  of that year and samuel osgood was elected as the first president of the company the companys name was changed to the national city bank of new york in  after it joined the new us national banking system and it became the largest american bank by  it became the first contributor to the federal reserve bank of new york in  and the following year it inaugurated the first overseas branch of a us bank in buenos aires although the bank had since the midth century been active in plantation economies such as the cuban sugar industry the  purchase of us overseas bank international banking corporation helped it become the first american bank to surpass  billion in assets and it became the largest commercial bank in the world in  as it grew the bank became a leading innovator in financial services becoming the first major us bank to offer compound interest on savings  unsecured personal loans  customer checking accounts  and the negotiable certificate of deposit  the bank changed its name to the first national city bank of new york in  which was shortened in  to first national city bank on the th anniversary of the companys foundation the company organically entered the leasing and credit card sectors and its introduction of us dollar–denominated certificates of deposit in london marked the first new negotiable instrument in market since  the bank introduced its first national city charge service credit card—popularly known as the everything card and later to become mastercard—in  in  under the leadership of ceo walter b wriston first national city bank and its holding company first national city corporation was renamed as citibank na and citicorp respectively shortly afterward the bank launched the citicard which pioneered the use of hour atms john s reed was elected ceo in  and citi became a founding member of the chaps clearing house in london under his leadership the next  years would see citibank become the largest bank in the united states and the largest issuer of credit cards and charge cards in the world and expand its global reach to over  countries travelers group –edit the corporate logo of travelers inc – prior to merger with citicorp travelers group at the time of merger was a diverse group of financial concerns that had been brought together under ceo sandy weill its roots came from commercial credit a subsidiary of control data corporation that was taken private by weill in november  after taking charge of the company earlier that year two years later weill mastered the buyout of primerica—a conglomerate that had already bought life insurer a l williams as well as stock broker smith barney the new company took the primerica name and employed a crossselling strategy such that each of the entities within the parent company aimed to sell each others services its nonfinancial businesses were spun off in september  travelers insurance which had suffered from poor real estate investments and sustained significant losses in the aftermath of hurricane andrew formed a strategic alliance with primerica that would lead to its amalgamation into a single company in december  with the acquisition the group became travelers inc property  casualty and life  annuities underwriting capabilities were added to the business meanwhile the distinctive travelers red umbrella logo which was also acquired in the deal was applied to all the businesses within the newly named organization during this period travelers acquired shearson lehman—a retail brokerage and asset management firm that was headed by weill until —and merged it with smith barney ownership of salomon brothers –edit in november  travelers group which had been renamed again in april  when they merged with aetna property and casualty inc acquired salomon brothers a major bond dealer and bulge bracket investment bank in a  billion transaction this deal complemented travelerssmith barney well as salomon was focused on fixedincome and institutional clients whereas smith barney was strong in equities and retail salomon brothers absorbed smith barney into the new securities unit termed salomon smith barney a year later the division incorporated citicorps former securities operations as well the salomon smith barney name was abandoned in october  after a series of financial scandals that tarnished the banks reputation merger of citicorp and travelers –edit on april   the merger between citicorp and travelers group was announced to the world creating a  billion firm with assets of almost  billion the deal would enable travelers to market mutual funds and insurance to citicorps retail customers while giving the banking divisions access to an expanded client base of investors and insurance buyers although presented as a merger the deal was actually more like a stock swap with travelers group purchasing the entirety of citicorp shares for  billion and issuing  new citigroup shares for each citicorp share through this mechanism existing shareholders of each company owned about half of the new firm while the new company maintained citicorps citi brand in its name it adopted travelers distinctive red umbrella as the new corporate logo which was used until  the chairmen of both parent companies john s reed and sandy weill respectively were announced as cochairmen and coceos of the new company citigroup inc although the vast difference in management styles between the two immediately presented question marks over the wisdom of such a setup the remaining provisions of the glass–steagall act—enacted following the great depression—forbade banks to merge with insurance underwriters and meant citigroup had between two and five years to divest any prohibited assets however weill stated at the time of the merger that they believed that over that time the legislation will changewe have had enough discussions to believe this will not be a problem indeed the passing of the grammleachbliley act in november  vindicated reed and weills views opening the door to financial services conglomerates offering a mix of commercial banking investment banking insurance underwriting and brokerage joe plumeri worked on the postmerger integration of the two companies and was appointed ceo of citibank north america by weill and reed he oversaw its network of  retail branches j paul newsome an analyst with cibc oppenheimer said hes not the spitandpolish executive many people expected hes rough on the edges but citibank knows the bank as an institution is in trouble—it cant get away anymore with passive selling—and plumeri has all the passion to throw a glass of cold water on the bank investment news speculated that a successful tenure at citibank might lead to a promotion to head up all of citicorp plumeri boosted the units earnings from  million to  million in one year an increase of nearly  he unexpectedly retired from citibank however in january  in  citigroup acquired associates first capital corporation for about  billion in stock which until  had been owned by gulfwestern now part of national amusements and later by ford the associates was widely criticized for predatory lending practices and citi eventually settled with the federal trade commission by agreeing to pay  million to customers who had been victims of a variety of predatory practices including flipping mortgages packing mortgages with optional credit insurance and deceptive marketing practices in  citigroup made additional acquisitions european american bank in july for  billion and banamex assisted by independent adviser windsor capital investments limited in august for  billion spinoff of travelers edit the current logo for travelers companies the company spun off its travelers property and casualty insurance underwriting business in  the spin off was prompted by the insurance units drag on citigroup stock price because travelers earnings were more seasonal and vulnerable to large disasters particularly the september   attacks on the world trade center in downtown new york city it was also difficult to sell this kind of insurance directly to customers since most industrial customers are accustomed to purchasing insurance through a broker the travelers property casualty corporation merged with the st paul companies inc in  forming the st paul travelers companies citigroup retained the life insurance and annuities underwriting business however it sold those businesses to metlife in  citigroup still sells life insurance through citibank but it no longer underwrites insurance in spite of divesting travelers insurance citigroup retained travelers signature red umbrella logo as its own until february  when citigroup agreed to sell the logo back to st paul travelers which renamed itself travelers companies citigroup also decided to adopt the corporate brand citi for itself and virtually all its subsidiaries except primerica and banamex subprime mortgage crisis edit heavy exposure to troubled mortgages in the form of collateralized debt obligation cdos compounded by poor risk management led citigroup into trouble as the subprime mortgage crisis worsened  the company had used elaborate mathematical risk models which looked at mortgages in particular geographical areas but never included the possibility of a national housing downturn or the prospect that millions of mortgage holders would default on their mortgages trading head thomas maheras was close friends with senior risk officer david bushnell which undermined risk oversight as treasury secretary robert rubin was said to be influential in lifting the regulations that allowed travelers and citicorp to merge in  then on the board of directors of citigroup rubin and charles prince were said to be influential in pushing the company towards mbs and cdos in the subprime mortgage market starting in june  senior vice president richard m bowen iii the chief underwriter of citigroups consumer lending group began warning the board of directors about the extreme risks being taken on by the mortgage operation that could potentially result in massive losses the group bought and sold  billion of residential mortgages annually bowens responsibility was essentially to serve as the quality control supervisor ensuring the units creditworthiness when bowen first blew the whistle in   of the mortgages were defective the amount of bad mortgages began increasing throughout  and eventually exceeded  of the volume many of the mortgages were not only defective but were fraudulent bowen attempted to rouse the board via weekly reports and other communications on november   bowen emailed citigroup chairman robert rubin and the banks chief financial officer head auditor and the chief risk management officer to again expose the risk and potential losses claiming that the groups internal controls had broken down and requesting an outside investigation of his business unit the subsequent investigation revealed that at the consumer lending group had suffered a breakdown of internal controls since  regardless of the findings of the investigation bowens charges were ignored despite the fact that withholding such information from shareholders violated the sarbanes–oxley act sox which he had pointed out citigroup ceo charles prince signed a certification that the bank was in compliance with sox despite bowen revealing this wasnt so citigroup eventually stripped bowen of most of his responsibilities and informing him that his physical presence was no longer required at the bank the financial crisis inquiry commission asked him to testify about citigroups role in the mortgage crisis and he did so appearing as one of the first witnesses before the commission in april  as the crisis began to unfold citigroup announced on april   that it would eliminate  jobs or about  percent of its workforce in a broad restructuring designed to cut costs and bolster its long underperforming stock even after securities and brokerage firm bear stearns ran into serious trouble in summer  citigroup decided the possibility of trouble with its cdos was so tiny less than  of  that they excluded them from their risk analysis with the crisis worsening citigroup announced on january   that it was considering cutting another  percent to  percent of its  memberworkforce collapse  us government intervention edit by november  citigroup was insolvent despite its receipt of  billion in taxpayer funded federal troubled asset relief program funds on november   citigroup announced plans for about  new job cuts on top of  cuts already made during  in a huge job cull resulting from four quarters of consecutive losses and reports that it was unlikely to be in profit again before  the same day on wall street markets responded with shares falling and dropping the companys market capitalization to  billion down from  billion two years prior eventually staff cuts totaled over  employees its stock market value dropped to  billion down from  billion two years earlier shares of citigroup common stock traded well below  on the new york stock exchange as a result late in the evening on november   citigroup and federal regulators approved a plan to stabilize the company and forestall a further deterioration in the companys value on november   the us government announced a massive stimulus package for citigroup designed to rescue the company from bankruptcy while giving the government a major say in its operations a joint statement by the us treasury department the federal reserve and the federal deposit insurance corp announced with these transactions the us government is taking the actions necessary to strengthen the financial system and protect us taxpayers and the us economy the arrangement called for the government to back about  billion in loans and securities and directly invest about  billion in the company the treasury provided  billion in troubled asset relief program tarp funds in addition to  billion given in october the treasury department the federal reserve and the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic agreed to cover  of the losses on citigroups  billion portfolio after citigroup absorbed the first  billion in losses the treasury would assume the first  billion in losses the fdic would absorb the next  billion then the federal reserve would assume the rest of the risk the assets remained on citigroups balance sheet the technical term for this arrangement is ring fencing in return the bank gave the us treasury  billion of preferred shares and warrants to acquire common stock the government obtained wide powers over banking operations citigroup agreed to try to modify mortgages using standards set up by the fdic after the collapse of indymac bank with the goal of keeping as many homeowners as possible in their houses executive salaries would be capped as a condition of the federal assistance citigroups dividend payment was reduced to  per share according to the wall street journal the government aid provided to citi in  was provided to prevent a worldwide chaos and panic by the potential collapse of its global transactions services now tts division according to the article former ceo pandit said if citigroup was allowed to unravel into bankruptcy  governments around the world would be trying to figure out how to pay their employees in  jane fraser the ceo of citi private bank stopped paying its bankers with commission for selling investment products in a move to bolster citi private banks reputation as an independent wealth management adviser as opposed to a product pusher creation of citi holdings edit on january   citigroup announced its intention to reorganize itself into two operating units citicorp for its retail and institutional client business and citi holdings for its brokerage and asset management citigroup will continue to operate as a single company for the time being but citi holdings managers will be tasked to take advantage of valueenhancing disposition and combination opportunities as they emerge and eventual spinoffs or mergers involving either operating unit were not ruled out citi holdings consists of citi businesses that citi wants to sell and are not considered part of citis core businesses the majority of its

 late in  the government sold its remaining stock holding in the company yielding an overall net profit to taxpayers of  billion a special irs tax exception given to citi allowed the us treasury to sell its shares at a profit while it still owned citigroup shares which eventually netted  billion according to treasury spokeswoman nayyera haq this irs tax rule was designed to stop corporate raiders from using loss corporations to evade taxes and was never intended to address the unprecedented situation where the government owned shares in banks and it was certainly not written to prevent the government from selling its shares for a profit expansion of retail banking operations edit in  citi was the first bank to introduce digitized smart banking branches in washington dc new york

clients from  a team of global strategists at citigroup wrote an analysis of the global distribution of wealth and consumers in it they state that global imbalances have grown to the extent as to justify talking of a plutonomy and demand for a renewed understanding of how this impacts consumption the authors cite data showing that the top  households in the us economy account for about  of the total income in  which is roughly equal to the share of the bottom  of households put together moreover in terms of wealth they demonstrate even more inequality such that the top  of households also account for  of net worth greater than the bottom  of households put together it gets better or worse depending on your political stripe  the top  of households account for  of financial net worth more than the bottom  of households put together of the current plutonomies namely united states united kingdom and canada they describe six key drivers an ongoing biotechnological revolution capitalistfriendly governments and tax regimes globalization that rearranges global supply chains with mobile wellcapitalized elites and immigrants greater financial complexity and innovation the rule of law and patent protection are all well in the report the authors advocate to maintain unequal distribution of wealth in the sense that …society and governments need to be amenable to disproportionately allowencourage the few to retain that fatter profit share the managerial aristocracy like in the gilded age the roaring twenties and the thriving nineties needs to commandeer a vast chunk of that rising profit share either through capital income or simply paying itself a lot moreover the authors say that in industrialize countries there seems to be a relationship between income concentration plutonomy and the household savings rates such that the latter tend to fall in plutonomies the ultimate objective of their report is to examine how to make money of this the report has

and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible
