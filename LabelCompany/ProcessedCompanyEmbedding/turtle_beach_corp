graphical editing system that supported the breakthrough ensoniq mirage sampling keyboard the mirage was the first low cost sampling device that allowed musicians to play realistic choirs pianos horns and other instruments in their performances the software called vision connected the mirage to a pc and used the pcs screen and graphics to make the programming and editing of sounds much easier ensoniq decided to resell vision through their dealer network and turtle beach softworks became a profitable company over the following years the company developed a few other programs that supported ensoniq equipment but realized that they needed to develop more generalized products they retooled their product into samplevision which initially supported the akai s but was designed with an extensible framework allowing other samplers to be supported the samplevision series was among the first to offer a macintoshlike user experience on the pc which at that time did not have microsoft windows to provide its gui in  turtle beach began to work on developing its first hardware product a hard disk based audio editing system among the first of its kind the product was named the k digital recording system and was released in  its card kpc was based on a motorola  dsp chip and offered non linear playlist editing of stereo audio files the k system was popular among radio stations and mastering studios because it replayed exactly the same digital stream that it recorded in  turtle beach began developing its second pc sound card this card used high quality ad and da a high quality synthesizer from emu and an onboard dsp chip this product was called multisound the multisound product competed with more established products of the day from advanced gravis now defunct ad

breakthrough ensoniq mirage sampling keyboard the mirage was the first low cost sampling device that allowed musicians to play realistic choirs pianos horns and other instruments in their performances the software called vision connected the mirage to a pc and used the pcs screen and graphics to make the programming and editing of sounds much easier ensoniq decided to resell vision through their dealer network and turtle beach softworks became a profitable company over the following years the company developed a few other programs that supported ensoniq equipment but realized that they needed to develop more generalized products they retooled their product into samplevision which initially supported the akai s but was designed with an extensible framework allowing other samplers to be supported the samplevision series was among the first to offer a macintoshlike user experience on the pc which at that time did not have microsoft windows to provide its gui in  turtle beach began to

turtle beach  was founded in  as turtle beach softworks by cofounders roy smith and robert hoke the companys first product was a graphical editing system that supported the breakthrough ensoniq mirage sampling keyboard the mirage was the first low cost sampling device that allowed musicians to play realistic choirs pianos horns and other instruments in their performances the software called vision connected the mirage to a pc and used the pcs screen and graphics to make the programming and editing of sounds much easier ensoniq decided to resell vision through their dealer network and turtle beach softworks became a profitable company over the following years the company developed a few other programs that supported ensoniq equipment but realized that they needed to develop more generalized products they retooled their product into samplevision which initially supported the akai s but was designed with an extensible framework allowing other samplers to be supported the samplevision series was among the first to offer a macintoshlike user experience on the pc which at that time did not have microsoft windows to provide its gui in  turtle beach began to work on developing its first hardware product a hard disk based audio editing system among the first of its kind the product was named the k digital recording system and was released in  its card kpc was based on a motorola  dsp chip and offered non linear playlist editing of stereo audio files the k system was popular among radio stations and mastering studios because it replayed exactly the same digital stream that it recorded in  turtle beach began developing its second pc sound card this card used high quality ad and da a high quality synthesizer from emu and an onboard dsp chip this product was called multisound the multisound product competed with more established products of the day from advanced gravis now defunct ad lib inc now defunct creative labs and media vision ccrmas music kit and dsp tools running on motorola  dsp initially developed for nextcube system was later ported on nextstep with turtle beach fijipinnacle dsp cards turtle beach was then acquired by integrated circuit systems ics a maker of clock chips for the pc market ics wanted to broaden its market to include the new multimedia chips and peripherals deciding to buy existing lines rather than build anew with the addition of icss resources turtle beach offered a full line of pc peripherals releasing  new products within the  months following the sale the multisound monterey the tahiti maui audio advantage sound cards rounded out its hardware product line with products at every price point on the software side the company released wave for windows a sound editing program that was ahead of its time but also ahead of the hardware curve quad the first multitrack recording application for the pc and several other software titles as often occurs with corporate acquisitions the original founders were soon no longer with the company martin goldberg and prabhat jain were brought in to run the company and after moving its operations to san jose ics sold turtle beach to voyetra technologies inc in  voyetras midi orchestrator plus software bundled with sound blaster cards from creative voyetra founded by synthesizer pioneer carmine bonanno in  had developed drivers and software for nearly every sound card manufacturer in the world during the early s the purchase of turtle beach allowed voyetra to leverage its close ties with pc manufacturers by providing sound cards bundled with voyetra software and drivers after the purchase the company changed its name to voyetra turtle beach inc and sold millions of sound cards to dell computer under the turtle beach brand turtle beach also acquired value medias distribution channels founded by prabhat jain in  this enabled it to sell its hardware products into the larger usa distribution channels in  voyetra turtle beach developed audiotron one of the first standalone internet audio receivers the device enjoyed tremendous success in the first year of its release but was soon faced with tremendous competition from similar products turtle beach opted out of the network audio market in  recently turtle beach has diversified its product line to include usb audio devices video capture products and a wide variety of headphones including the ear force line of multichannel pc and gaming headphones headsetsedit turtle beach has an extensive line of headsets their current line has headsets for current and previous generation consoles such as the xbox one playstation  xbox  playstation  they also sell headsets compatible with pcmac and mobile platforms and nintendo consoles current lineupedit ear force

windows x officially and can be used on windows nt  and windows  using peter halls drivers the sound quality and feature set offered by multisound classic was truly revolutionary at the time but creative labs acquired emu in  and the supply of xr chips stopped the card had to be redesigned accordingly creating the tahiti a detailed analysis of the multisounds hardware is here multisound tahiti – multisound classic derivative without the oncard synthesis motorola  chipset multisound monterey – multisound monterey was the first costreduced version of the multisound in essence the
