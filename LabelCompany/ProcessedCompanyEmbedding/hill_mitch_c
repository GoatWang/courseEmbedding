survivescomparecardssponsoredwhite housejeff sessions wants to mend his tattered relationship with president trumpcongresscan mitch mcconnell save the republican health care billalex altmanjun  one of washingtons unwritten rules is this simple maxim never underestimate mitch mcconnellyet even the senate republican leader regarded by both parties as one of capitol hills craftiest tacticians proved unable to steer a wildly unpopular health care bill through the senate this week on his own crushing timetable facing resistance from moderates and conservatives in the gop conference not to mention an outcry from powerful outside groups ranging from medical associations to the koch brothers mcconnell announced that he would delay the vote until after the july  recesslegislation of this complexity almost always takes longer than anyone else would hope the kentuckian told reporters in the capitol on tuesday afternoon were still working toward getting at least  people in a comfortable placemcconnells daunting challenge was compounded on monday by a report from the nonpartisan congressional budget office it estimated the senates bill while saving the federal government some  billion over the next decade would also swell the ranks of the uninsured by  million people and result in about  million losing medicaid coverage even as mcconnell vowed to hold a final vote before the senate skipped town this week allies urged him to take his foot off the gas plowing ahead in the face of colleagues opposition would be a mistake said ron johnson of wisconsin one of several republican senators to criticize the bill if leader mcconnell says failure is not an option dont set yourself up for failurerelatedcongresssenate delays health care vote due to lack of supportcongresssenate delays health care vote due to lack of supportwith  republicans in the senate and no democratic support mcconnell had room for only two defections under budgeting rules the bill requires  votes for passage with vice president mike pence breaking the tie at least five republicans signaled they would oppose a motion to bring the bill to the floor its a terrible bill republican sen rand paul mcconnells kentucky colleague told reporters on monday night its worse to pass a bad bill than pass no billdespite the setback republicans and democrats alike say it would be foolish to count mcconnell out the senate bill drafted in private by a small group of republicans is an opening bid not a finished product now the process moves to the bartering stage and mcconnell has some  billion—the amount of additional cash the senate can spend before running afoul of budgeting rules—with which to sweeten the dealalready the bill was being written with an eye toward winning the votes of recalcitrant republicans for example one way the draft legislation would slash medicaid spending is by transferring funds from states that spend lots of money per medicaid enrollee to more parsimonious states but it carves out a special exception for sparsely populated states—including alaska whose republican senator lisa murkowski has expressed reservations about the planmore side deals may now be in the offing moderate republicans who represent swaths of appalachia like west virginia sen shelley moore capito and ohios rob portman are seeking more federal dollars to help combat the opioid crisis ravaging their states the pair had sought some  billion for the project over the next decade so far the senate bill allots  billionthe bills conservative critics have different concerns smallgovernment republicans like utahs mike lee and ted cruz of texas who have said they arent ready to support the bill might be swayed by freemarket initiatives like healthsavings accounts there are a host of tools we can use cruz said monday that would have a significant impact on premiumsall this horse trading is a familiar if unsavory component of threading major legislation through congress to attract the necessary votes to pass obamacare democrats tucked in statespecific giveaways to senators and made costly concessions to the insurance and pharmaceutical lobbies those moves drew republican ire some gop senators who are prepared to swallow mcconnells bill warn they might bolt if a similar process unfolds nowgetting the affordable care act passed and sign took obama and his allies  months as mcconnell alluded to in his press conference tuesday the gop leader is trying to repeat the feat in an relative eye blink weve got a lot of discussions going on mcconnell insisted and were still optimistic were going to get therehe has defied precedent before it was mcconnell who orchestrated his partys blanket obstruction to barack obamas agenda mcconnell who devised the plan to deny a vote to supreme court nominee merrick garland and mcconnell who steered the gop back to the majority despite its dismal brand as his allies laud and opponents lament he is as effective as he is ruthlessso if the forces of washington seem arrayed against him—not to mention the sheer complexity of a bill that would upend onesixth of the us economy—republicans are taking solace from that ironclad washington adage i would not bet against mitch mcconnell house speaker paul ryan insisted tuesday he will find out soon if his colleagues still agreewith reporting by philip
