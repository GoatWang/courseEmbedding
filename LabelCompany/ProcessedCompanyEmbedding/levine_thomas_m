hall on october   posted in product liability in a recent decision the circuit court for spotsylvania county virginia found that omegaflex a manufacturer of corrugated stainless steel tubing csst which is used in residential gas supply systems was entitled to the protection of virginia’s statute of repose in a product liability lawsuit the decision is significant because it is the second decision secured on behalf of omegaflex in virginia proving that csst gas piping is not within the meaning of the “equipment and machinery” exception to virginia’s statute of repose omegaflex secured its first dismissal on this issue in  when the circuit court for the city of richmond dismissed a product liability action filed against omegaflex − more than five years after its product was installed in both actions the courts have held that csst gas piping is afforded the protection of virginia’s statute of repose thereby limiting the product liability exposure of manufacturers of csst
