attempts to distract stockholders from its unqualified handpicked nominees in effort to take control of the farmer bros board and company news provided by farmer bros co nov 0 20 8 et share this article ft worth texas nov 0 20 prnewswire  farmer bros co nasdaq farm the company or farmer bros today issued the following statement in response to a letter published by the carol farmer waite stockholder group the waite group farmer bros is led by an independent and highly qualified board of directors with superior industry and operational expertise that is driving the companys successful turnaround plan and delivering superior value to all farmer bros stockholders contrary to the waite groups false assertions randy e clark and christopher p mottern are trained accountants with each having been certified as a cpa in addition to their many years serving as ceos and in other senior executive roles in the food industry mr clark was appointed and elected to the board due to his leadership as a former ceo extensive background and experience in the foodservice business and his accounting and financial expertise among other skills and qualifications in 202 jeanne farmer grossman current director and sister of carol farmer waite recommended mr clark to the thenchairman of the board guenter w berger who subsequently brought mr clark to the attention of the nominating committee mr clarks qualifications include receiving a cpa certification in 978 and receiving a masters in science of accounting from kent state earning a doctorate in organizational leadership from pepperdine university teaching accounting and marketing at the masters college in santa clarita california and accounting at pepperdine consulting for multiple private equity groups in the food industry since  serving in chief executive and other leadership roles at a number of companies in the food industry such as president and chief executive officer of border foods inc as chief executive officer of fruit patch inc as president and chief executive officer of mike yurosek  son llc and as vice president sales marketing and production with william bolthouse farms mr mottern was appointed and elected to the board due to his leadership as a former ceo experience in the foodservice business including directly relevant expertise in the coffee industry and his financial and accounting experience which allowed him to serve on the audit committee he qualifies as an audit committee financial expert under applicable sec rules due to his many years of experience as a chief executive officer controller and finance executive in these roles mr mottern has been responsible for or overseen the preparation and reporting of financial statements for decades mr mottern was brought to the attention of the nominating committee and the board by leading independent search consultant leadership capital partners llc in 20 the board conducted a lengthy interview process in which eight candidates were considered and vetted by the full board which included directors who were appointed by the previous farmer family regime or were longterm employees of farmer bros as well as jeanne farmer grossman sister of carol farmer waite mr motterns qualifications include receiving a cpa certification from the state of connecticut in 97 after receiving an undergraduate degree in accounting from the university of connecticut working at peat marwick  mitchell public accountants a predecessor to kpmg serving in controller or vice president finance roles at a number of companies in the food and beverage industry such as heublein wines and ej gallo serving as president and chief executive officer for five years and a board member for seven year for peets coffee  tea inc along with holding chief executive and other leadership roles at food and beverage industry companies such as heublein wines and capri sun inc serving as a board member for companies including bell carter foods flexible packaging international and coen inc where he was also finance committee chairman the waite group ignores the decades of directly relevant finance and accounting expertise brought to the board by messrs clark and mottern instead the waite group bases its letter on the companys use of is versus was when referring to messrs clarks and motterns cpa status in their biographies     in stark contrast the waite groups nominees lack the qualifications or experience necessary to protect the interests of all stockholders and have deep personal ties to the farmer family that would undermine the independence of the board jennifer gonzalezyousef is a personal friend of suzanna waite wife of jonathan waite and the daughterinlaw of carol farmer waite and would bring no skills or expertise to the board that are not already better represented by its current directors tom mortensen is a former farmer bros employee having joined when roy e farmer led the company has no clevel experience and would be unable to serve on any of the boards standing committees as he would not be considered independent under nasdaq standards john samore jr served on the board from  to  overlapping with carol farmer waites tenure on the board for two years and during his tenure farmer bros experienced declines in both revenue and profitability as well as a  decline in stock pricei the waite group is attempting to distract stockholders from the fact that it has offered no plan for the future of farmer bros and that it is singularly focused on taking over the board for personal interest and without paying a control premium to all farmer bros stockholders the waite group misleads stockholders by claiming that the election of its nominees will constitute a minority on the board when in reality three of the seven directors currently on the board are either a member of the farmer family or serve on the board as a result of farmer family actions or requests the election of any of the waite groups nominees combined with farmer family representatives already on the board and the potential resignation of at least one current board member if the waite group nominees are elected would effectively change control of the board and farmer bros about farmer bros cofounded in 92 farmer bros co is a national coffee roaster wholesaler and distributor of coffee tea and culinary products the
