the us important information the central europe russia and turkey fund inc is a nondiversified closedend investment company seeking long term capital appreciation through investment primarily in equity or equitylinked securities of issuers domiciled in central europe russia and turkey because the fund is nondiversified it can take larger positions in fewer issuers than a diversified fund increasing its potential risk the european equity fund inc is a diversified closedend investment company seeking longterm capital appreciation through investment primarily in equity or equitylinked securities of issuers domiciled in countries that are members of the european union the new germany fund inc is a diversified closedend investment company seeking capital appreciation primarily through investment in equity or equitylinked securities of small and midcap german companies the fund may invest up to  of its assets in large cap german companies and up to  in nongerman companies with no more than  in any single country investing in foreign securities particularly those of emerging markets presents certain risks such as currency fluctuations political and economic changes and market risks any fund that concentrates in a particular segment of the market or a particular region will generally be more volatile than a fund that invests more broadly the shares of most closedend funds including the funds are not continuously offered once issued shares of closedend funds are bought and sold in the open market through a stock exchange shares of closedend funds frequently trade at a discount to net asset value the price of a fund’s shares is determined by a number of factors several of which are beyond the control of the fund therefore a fund cannot predict whether its shares will trade at below or above net asset value investments in funds involve risk additional risks of the fund are associated with international investing such as currency fluctuations political and economic changes market risks government regulations and differences in liquidity which may increase the volatility of your investment foreign security markets generally exhibit greater price volatility and are less liquid than the us market additionally the fund focuses its investments in certain geographical regions thereby increasing their vulnerability to developments in those regions and potentially subjecting the funds’ shares to greater price volatility some funds have more risk than others these include funds such as the funds that allow exposure to or otherwise concentrate investments in certain sectors geographic regions security types market capitalization or foreign securities eg political or economic instability which can be accentuated in emerging market countries the european union the united states and other countries have imposed sanctions on russia as a result of the russian military intervention in the ukraine these sanctions have adversely affected russian individuals russian issuers and the russian economy russia in turn has imposed sanctions targeting western individuals businesses and products including food products the various sanctions have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect not only the russian economy but also the economies of many countries in europe including germany and other countries in central europe potential developments in the ukraine and the continuation of current sanctions or the imposition of additional sanctions may materially adversely affect the value of the funds’ portfolios this press

capital appreciation through investment primarily in equity or equitylinked securities of issuers domiciled in central europe russia and turkey because the fund is nondiversified it can take larger positions in fewer issuers than a diversified fund increasing its potential riskinvesting in foreign securities particularly those of emerging markets presents certain risks such as currency fluctuations political and economic changes and market risks any fund that concentrates in a particular segment of the market or in a particular geographical region will generally be more volatile than a fund that invests more broadlythe shares of most closedend funds including the fund are not continuously offered once issued shares of closedend funds are bought and sold in the open market shares of closedend funds frequently trade at a discount to net asset value the price of a fund’s shares is determined by a number of factors several of which are beyond the control of the fund therefore a fund cannot predict whether its shares will trade at below or above net asset valueinvestments in funds involve risk additional risks of the fund are associated with international investing such as currency fluctuations political and economic changes market risks government regulations and differences in liquidity which may increase the volatility of your investment foreign security markets generally exhibit greater price volatility and are less liquid than the us market additionally the fund focuses its investments in certain geographical regions thereby increasing its vulnerability to developments in those regions and potentially subjecting the fund’s shares to greater price volatility some funds have more risk than others these include funds such as the fund that allow exposure to or otherwise concentrate investments in certain sectors geographic regions security types market capitalization or foreign securities eg political or economic instability which can
