we dont have to spend the extra to ship the most critical parts by fedex and priority mail none of our competitors do we just feel that its the right thing to do most folks that need lift chair parts

notes on okin parts okin note   the deltadrive set is the most common okin electrical setup used in lift chairs today  purchasing this set is a good choice if you don�t know � or want to know � what the problem with your chair is you just want it fixed the first time or you may just want to update your chair to the latest electronics and head off any problems  either way if you presently have the deltadrive motor on your chair this set should solve the problem okin note  the betadrive set is very common in berkline chairs but other manufacturers have used them from time to time  the decision to replace the complete set is the same as for the deltadrive in note  above  note please be sure that the motor on your chair has a shaft about �� long and has a white moving block  if your motor is all black with a black block this motor will not work� please call for options if you have the black block on your motor okin note   the  motor is a brand new motor direct from the factory and as mentioned in note  above is now the most common okin motor used in lift chairs  there should be a sticker on the side of your motor that says deltadrive if so this is the motor you need okin note   the betadrive motor shown here has a shaft about �� long and has a white moving block  if the motor you have is all black with a black block this motor will not work please call for options if you have the black block on your motor  also the  motor is designed for lift chairs only if you need a motor like this for a power recliner or theater chair please give us a call most of the time theater and recliner chairs use a faster geared motor than a lift chair we have those in stock also although they aren�t listed on the website to reduce confusion i hope� okin note   the  and  hand controls are the most common okin hand controls in use today  the  has a one piece cord that �disappears� down through a hole in the chair and normally plugs in underneath the chair to a short cord off the motor  it has a round plug with a  degree angle that has five pins in a semicircle  the  has a quick disconnect plug that normally unplugs in the side or magazine pocket of the chair  it has a straight plug with five pins in a semicircle and it plugs into another cord that is already in the side pocket of the chair most have a small plastic lever that folds over the plugs to lock them into place  if you have a chair with an okin system and it has a hand control like the one pictured either one of these will work as they are both wired the same  the way to tell which one you need is to just follow the cord from the part you hold in your hand down past the coiled part and see if there is a straight plug a few inches from the coiled part  or does the cord disappear down through a hole in the chair   the  is the newer design and was developed as a way to easily change the hand control without having to turn the chair over  another selling feature is that if you have grandchildren over and they like playing on the chair then you can easily unplug the control so they won�t play with it of course it�s ok with us if you let them play with the chair � grandkids are great for our business� okin note   this is the extension cable only that the  hand control plugs into in the side pocket of the chair and goes on down to plug into the short cord off the motor  normally the only reason to replace this cord is if it has gotten pinched by the chair mechanism okin note   this is a very common hand control used on more expensive la z boy lift chairs  however be sure that your old hand control has a sticker with the number  on the back  note the hand control we ship is made by the same company that makes the controls for la z boy  there are other chair manufacturers that use this same control so to keep the control manufacturer from having to make separate faceplates for each manufacturer their replacement controls have the relaxor name on the front which is the trademark name of the manufacturer of the hand controls that way they can keep their costs down by not having to make controls for each user  the only difference you may notice is that this control lights up all the time like a night light  some people love it some dont but there is no way to cut the light off i have asked for that feature and their engineers are taking it under advisement  nevertheless it has proven to be a great replacement for the original control okin note   this is also a common hand control used on la z boy lift chairs  however be sure that  you have a la z boy chair and  check that your old hand control has a sticker with the number  on the back  la z boy has used controls that look very similar to this control but it has different numbers on the back like  and  please give us a call if you have this type of hand control as the  will not work with those controls okin note   this is the most common okin transformer used on both lift chairs and some power recliners  if your chair has a cord coming out from under the chair that plugs into the transformer with a plug that has a flat blade and a round blade this is the transformer you will need  sometimes transformers have the numbers spa or spb on them if yours has that designation then this  is the one you need  the  power cord below is included with the  transformer when you order it okin note   this is the power cord only for the   transformer above  note don�t order this cord if you don�t also already have a  transformer� many folks that are missing the transformer off their chair usually due to the chair being moved put into storage etc mistakenly think that they only need the power cord to get their chair going again when what they really need is the transformer� the cord coming from the chair with the small flat blade and round blade plugs into the transformer  and then the  transformer plugs into the wall okin note   this transformer is mainly used by berkline and la z boy and also by other smaller manufacturers  it has a female plug on the output side that takes a three pin connector okin note   this transformer is almost always used on berkline chairs and other manufacturers with some type of heat andor massage system  it has a female plug on the output side with a six pin connector okin note   this transformer is for united kingdom use only it will not work for chairs located in the usa  it has battery backup and the receptacle for the plug coming from the chair that has a flat blade and a round blade okin note   this transformer is for european countries only it will not work for chairs located in the usa  it has battery backup and the receptacle for the plug coming from the chair that has a flat blade and a round blade okin note   this transformer is for australia only it will not work for chairs located in the usa  it has battery backup and the receptacle for the plug coming from the chair that has a flat blade and a round blade okin note   this is the cord that goes from the transformer to the motor it has a male plug that has a flat blade and a round blade that goes into the transformer and a female plug on the other end with a receptacle for that same flat blade and round blade okin note   this cord is also like   above in that it goes from the transformer to the motor  however it has a rectifier built into the cord that changes the voltage from ac current to dc current  it is mostly used on chairs with a betadrive motor many of those chairs have an ac transformer it won�t have a battery backup the betadrive motor needs dc current so that is the reason for the rectifier  if you change transformers to the newer  switchable acdc transformer you will not need this type cord � you can use the  above okin note   this is also a cord like the ones above that go from the transformer to the motor but this cord has a three pin male plug that plugs into the transformer and a female plug on the other end that takes a flat blade and a round blade plug from the motor okin note   this is the plastic nut usually either white or yellow in color that is inside the actuator tube where you can�t really see it  the worm screw goes through the middle of the nut and the nut has threads on the outside that the stroke tube screws onto as the motor turns the worm screw the nut rides up and down the worm screw pushing and pulling the stroke tube and making the chair go up and down  important note please check the manufacturer of your motor okin or dewert before ordering this part  the part shown here will only work in an okin motor  it will not fit a dewert motor  installation instructions are listed on the okin section of the  troubleshooting tips page on our website okin note   this is the white plastic moving block about � x � that the chair mounts to on a betadrive system if you have a black block you will need our part   below as the block moves up and down the stationary motor shaft the chair goes up and down  there are primarily two white moving blocks used in the usa the difference is in the thread size in the block where the worm screw goes through the center of the block  the way to tell which you need is to look for the slots in the aluminum shaft one on the top and one on the bottom of the shaft shine a light into the slot and see the black worm screw  using a tape measure or ruler pick out a tread on the worm screw and count how many threads or turns there are to the next inch on the ruler� it will be either  threads our part   or  threads our part   per inch  the  thread per inch size is by far the most common but there are enough  thread blocks in use to make sure that you make the effort to get the right measurement  it is very important that you check the thread size before you order a moving block because if you order the wrong one and try to install it on your motor we cant take it back  installation instructions are listed on the okin section of the  troubleshooting tips page on our website okin note   this black moving block fits an okin betadrive motor used on la z boy chairs  the motor for this block will normally have the notation  on it  please note the replacement part you will receive from us will have a white colored block okin doesnt sell many of these blocks and the last time they did a production run they used white material instead of black  installation instructions are listed on the okin section of the  troubleshooting tips page on our website okin note   this is the stroke tube the metal tube that goes in and out of the motor assembly with a metal connector our part   included  note that the tube has left hand threads it tightens by turning it counterclockwise and loosens by turning it clockwise  this part includes the tube and the connector on the end it does not include the spindle nut  inside the actuator arm okin note   there are the connectors on the end of the stroke tube a clevis pin goes through this piece and the chair lift mechanism to hold that end of the motor on the chair  the metal connector  and the plastic connector  are interchangeable most older deltadrive motors used the plastic connector but if you order a new deltadrive motor it will come with the metal connector  the plastic one is not all bad however if the person using the chair has a tendency to hit the wall with the back of the chair then not knowing it is against the wall keep holding down the hand control  �something has to give� in that situation and sometimes the plastic connector will break saving something worse happening�  it�s not designed to break but sometimes it just works out that way okin note   these are recessed controls that are normally found in power recliners and theater chairs they are built into either the arm of the chair or sofa or under the arm on the side of the chair  there are several different styles of these recessed controls but they all have a round five pin connector on the end of the cord  the  has a rectangular housing and is held on by two screws the screw holes measure   center to center the  has an oval shaped housing and is also held on by two screws  the screw holes measure   center to center the  has a round housing with a diameter of   okin note   a new motor like this is only available from your local la z boy showroom dealer there are no new aftermarket replacements for this motor system  however if your motor assy is not working because of an electrical issue example the transformer only clicks when the button is pushed or the motor is not making any noise or attempt to run we may be able to get this assy repaired for you  we have a repair co that we have been using for many years that can repair most electrical problems with the unit  the repair cost usually runs    you can send it to us with a note letting us know the problem with the unit and we will send it out for repair  repair time normally takes  weeks  if the motor assy is physically broken example the clevis on the back of the motor is broken or the motor sounds like it is running but the stroke tube isnt moving there is no repair available  okin note   this technically is a dewert part not an okin but we show it here because several la z boy chairs use both dewert and okin parts together there are several different motors that have the mcz designation la z boy makes several style chairs that have three mcz motors installed all different  note because of the way la z boy chairs are designed it is very difficult to determine whether the problem with a chair that has a motor not running is because of the motor or the control box wire harness  a new motor like this is only available from your local la z boy showroom dealer there are no new aftermarket replacements for this motor system okin note   the  and  controls were parts that la z boy got from overseas sources  those controls arent available anymore so la z boy found another source the only problem was that to make the new control work with the chairs a kit had to be developed  this kit consists of a new hand control a new control box a new transformer some jumper wires and an instruction booklet  that is why the cost is so much when all you really wanted was a hand control or a control box  normally this takes care of most electrical problems with the chair as when this kit is installed basically all critical parts will be new under the chair except the motors  unfortunately we can no longer order these parts directly from la z boy la z boy has had a price adjustment early in february  on their repair parts basically they tripled their parts prices to their dealers i have been in the service business for over  years and i have never seen a price increase like that you should be able to get this retro kit directly from a local la z boy showroom dealer okin note   the  has a three pin quick disconnect type control that plugs into an extension cord in the side or magazine pocket of the chair that extension cord goes on down to plug into the motor with a five pin connector  the  is not being made anymore but our  okin quick disconnect control will easily replace the  the only real difference besides what it looks like is that the  has a five pin quick disconnect however the  also comes with the extension cable attached that goes down to the motor  all you need to do is to remove the extension cable that is now attached to your chair and replace it with the extension cable that we send with the   you possibly could order the  from the factory they did still have a few but our control is almost one half the cost of the la z boy control and it seems to work better  this explanation may seem complicated but when you get the new control it will all make sense if you still have problems just call or email us and we can help okin note   while not an okin part per se this style transformer was used in many chairs with okin electronics to power the heat and massage functions if present  chairs that had this system almost always had two separate transformers this one for the heatmassage and another to make the chair go up  down  please note to determine whether you need the older style  or the newer style  transformer you need to take a look at the plug coming out from your chair that will plug into the transformer  specifically look to see if it has a small pin in the middle of the plug  if it has a small pin in the middle of that plug you will need the  if it doesnt have that small pin you will need the  okin note   this is the extension cable that goes from the side pocket of the chair down to the control box wiring harness under the chair  it is designed for the   la z boy hand control and has an eight pin female connector on the end that the hand control plugs into and an eight pin male connector that plugs into the control box hubbell motor system complete note hubbell special products discontinued operations in october  so we have a very limited number of component parts  please

hand control and fits pretty much any lift chair that has a hubbell motor it is best to order this if your chair has anything except a  prong connector where the hand control cord attaches to the motor cord you could always �hard wire� the old hand control to the new motor but if the motor is bad the hand control won�t be far behind�  hubbell note   this is the same as the motor above but it is the motor assembly only without the hand control  as long as you have a lift chair with a four prong connector the two outside prongs have a flat side so it can�t be plugged in wrong and the hand control is in good shape then this motor assembly is the one you need  note this model motor wont fit any other application except a lift chair bed motors treadmill motors etc have different mounting that keep this motor from fitting those units  hubbell note   this hand control comes standard with a four prong connector and the two outside prongs have a flat side so it can�t be plugged in wrong  note the four prongs mentioned here refer to the connector not the number of wires dont just see three wires and assume you have a three wire connector most newer motors have a four prong connector but only have three wires attached you will need to unplug the connectors and count the number of prongs to be sure you order the correct control  if you have an older model hand control with a three prong connector and the two outside prongs have a flat side then order the three prong one below  if it is even older and it has any other type connector four prong with flat pins connector with orange terminals or even a six prong square connector etc then you can still use this hand control you will need to �hard wire� it to the motor cord with crimp connectors we have instructions on how to do this in the hubbell section of our troubleshooting tips page  hubbell note   chairs with hubbell motors that have a heatmassage system are sort of rare but there are still a few out there  the connections on this control for the heat and massage are the ones most commonly used but some older chairs will not plug in to these connectors� for those you will have to �hard wire� your heat and the massage wires to the new control  the main connector to the lift chair motor is a four prong connector like  above  hubbell note   before you order either the capacitor or limit switch be sure to read over our troubleshooting tips section for the hubbell motors we hardly ever sell either of these parts so check carefully before you think this might be the problem  these do go bad but rarely�  hubbell note   we now finally have the gear sets in stock for the hubbell motors we used to get them directly from the factory but since it has now closed we had find another source  for anyone who has done tool and die or plastic fabrication work you know that the molds for making the gears are very expensive and two molds had to be made for each set doubling the cost  that extra expense is being passed on to us in each set of gears that is made that is why the cost is so high before you call and ask�  important note as you can see above there is more than one set of gears for hubbell motors even though most all hubbell motors say mc the way you tell the difference is in the number of teeth on the gears  part   is mainly for lift chair motors it has  teeth on the gear pictured on the left the one that goes around the worm screw and  teeth on the smaller inner gear on the one pictured on the right  the other gear sets shown fit most other type hubbell applications beds treadmills dental chairs etc those sets have different numbers of teeth on the inner gear on the one pictured on the right  it is very important that you check the number of teeth on your gears before you order a replacement set because if you order the wrong set and try to install them on your motor we cant take them back  for applications other than lift chairs you may have to replace the gears as that may be your only option to get the motor back running again but for lift chair motors you may want to weigh the cost of a set of gears against the price of a new motor with a six month warranty � the choice is entirely up to you  we have installation instructions for the gear sets under the hubbell section of our  troubleshooting tips page on our website hubbell note   this stroke tube will only fit hubbell motors on lift chairs please dont think that you can make it work if your hubbell motor goes on anything but a lift chair   we have installation instructions for the stroke

is a good choice if you don�t know � or want to know � what the problem with your chair is you just want it fixed the first time or you may just want to update your chair to the latest electronics and head off any problems  either way if you presently have the deltadrive motor on your chair this set should solve the problem okin note  the betadrive set is very common in berkline chairs but other manufacturers have used them from time to time  the decision to replace the complete set is the same as for the deltadrive in note  above  note please be sure that the motor on your chair has a shaft about �� long and has a white moving block  if your motor is all black with a black block this motor will not work� please call for options if you have the black block on your motor okin note   the  motor is a brand new motor direct from the factory and as mentioned in note  above is now the most common okin motor used in lift chairs  there should be a sticker on the side of your motor that says deltadrive if so this is the motor you need okin note   the betadrive motor shown here has a shaft about �� long and has a white moving block  if the motor you have is all black with a black block this motor will not work please call for options if you have the black block on your motor  also the  motor is designed for lift chairs only if you need a motor like this for a power recliner or theater chair please give us a call most of the time theater and recliner chairs use a faster geared motor than a lift chair we have those in stock also although they aren�t listed on the website to reduce confusion i hope� okin note   the  and  hand controls are the most common okin hand controls in use today  the  has a one piece cord that �disappears� down through a hole in the chair and normally plugs in underneath the chair to a short cord off the motor  it has a round plug with a  degree angle that has five pins in a semicircle  the  has a quick disconnect plug that normally unplugs in the side or magazine pocket of the chair  it has a straight plug with five pins in a semicircle and it plugs into another cord that is already in the side pocket of the chair most have a small plastic lever that folds over the plugs to lock them into place  if you have a chair with an okin system and it has a hand control like the one pictured either one of these will work as they are both wired the same  the way to tell which one you need is to just follow the cord from the part you hold in your hand down past the coiled part and see if there is a straight plug a few inches from the coiled part  or does the cord disappear down through a hole in the chair   the  is the newer design and was developed as a way to easily change the hand control without having to turn the chair over  another selling feature is that if you have grandchildren over and they like playing on the chair then you can easily unplug the control so they won�t play with it of course it�s ok with us if you let them play with the chair � grandkids are great for our business� okin note   this is the extension cable only that the  hand control plugs into in the side pocket of the chair and goes on down to plug into the short cord off the motor  normally the only reason to replace this cord is if it has gotten pinched by the chair mechanism okin note   this is a very common hand control used on more expensive la z boy lift chairs  however be sure that your old hand control has a sticker with the number  on the back  note the hand control we ship is made by the same company that makes the controls for la z boy  there are other chair manufacturers that use this same control so to keep the control manufacturer from having to make separate faceplates for each manufacturer their replacement controls have the relaxor name on the front which is the trademark name of the manufacturer of the hand controls that way they can keep their costs down by not having to make controls for each user  the only difference you may notice is that this control lights up all the time like a night light  some people love it some dont but there is no way to cut the light off i have asked for that feature and their engineers are taking it under advisement  nevertheless it has proven to be a great replacement for the original control okin note   this is also a common hand control used on la z boy lift chairs  however be sure that  you have a la z boy chair and  check that your old hand control has a sticker with the number  on the back  la z boy has used controls that look very similar to this control but it has different numbers on the back like  and  please give us a call if you have this type of hand control as the  will not work with those controls okin note   this is the most common okin transformer used on both lift chairs and some power recliners  if your chair has a cord coming out from under the chair that plugs into the transformer with a plug that has a flat blade and a round blade this is the transformer you will need  sometimes transformers have the numbers spa or spb on them if yours has that designation then this  is the one you need  the  power cord below is included with the  transformer when you order it okin note   this is the power cord only for the   transformer above  note don�t order this cord if you don�t also already have a  transformer� many folks that are missing the transformer off their chair usually due to the chair being moved put into storage etc mistakenly think that they only need the power cord to get their chair going again when what they really need is the transformer� the cord coming from the chair with the small flat blade and round blade plugs into the transformer  and then the  transformer plugs into the wall okin note   this transformer is mainly used by berkline and la z boy and also by other smaller manufacturers  it has a female plug on the output side that takes a three pin connector okin note   this transformer is almost always used on berkline chairs and other manufacturers with some type of heat andor massage system  it has a female plug on the output side with a six pin connector okin note   this transformer is for united kingdom use only it will not work for chairs located in the usa  it has battery backup and the receptacle for the plug coming from the chair that has a flat blade and a round blade okin note   this transformer is for european countries only it will not work for chairs located in the usa  it has battery backup and the receptacle for the plug coming from the chair that has a flat blade and a round blade okin note   this transformer is for australia only it will not work for chairs located in the usa  it has battery backup and the receptacle for the plug coming from the chair that has a flat blade and a round blade okin note   this is the cord that goes from the transformer to the motor it has a male plug that has a flat blade and a round blade that goes into the transformer and a female plug on the other end with a receptacle for that same flat blade and round blade okin note   this cord is also like   above in that it goes from the transformer to the motor  however it has a rectifier built into the cord that changes the voltage from ac current to dc current  it is mostly used on chairs with a betadrive motor many of those chairs have an ac transformer it won�t have a battery backup the betadrive motor needs dc current so that is the reason for the rectifier  if you change transformers to the newer  switchable acdc transformer you will not need this type cord � you can use the  above okin note   this is also a cord like the ones above that go from the transformer to the motor but this cord has a three pin male plug that plugs into the transformer and a female plug on the other end that takes a flat blade and a round blade plug from the motor okin note   this is the plastic nut usually either white or yellow in color that is inside the actuator tube where you can�t really see it  the worm screw goes through the middle of the nut and the nut has threads on the outside that the stroke tube screws onto as the motor turns the worm screw the nut rides up and down the worm screw pushing and pulling the stroke tube and making the chair go up and down  important note please check the manufacturer of your motor okin or dewert before ordering this part  the part shown here will only work in an okin motor  it will not fit a dewert motor  installation instructions are listed on the okin section of the  troubleshooting tips page on our website okin note   this is the white plastic moving block about � x � that the chair mounts to on a betadrive system if you have a black block you will need our part   below as the block moves up and down the stationary motor shaft the chair goes up and down  there are primarily two white moving blocks used in the usa the difference is in the thread size in the block where the worm screw goes through the center of the block  the way to tell which you need is to look for the slots in the aluminum shaft one on the top and one on the bottom of the shaft shine a light into the slot and see the black worm screw  using a tape measure or ruler pick out a tread on the worm screw and count how many threads or turns there are to the next inch on the ruler� it will be either  threads our part   or  threads our part   per inch  the  thread per inch size is by far the most common but there are enough  thread blocks in use to make sure that you make the effort to get the right measurement  it is very important that you check the thread size before you order a moving block because if you order the wrong one and try to install it on your motor we cant take it back  installation instructions are listed on the okin section of the  troubleshooting tips page on our website okin note   this black moving block fits an okin betadrive motor used on la z boy chairs  the motor for this block will normally have the notation  on it  please note the replacement part you will receive from us will have a white colored block okin doesnt sell many of these blocks and the last time they did a production run they used white material instead of black  installation instructions are listed on the okin section of the  troubleshooting tips page on our website okin note   this is the stroke tube the metal tube that goes in and out of the motor assembly with a metal connector our part   included  note that the tube has left hand threads it tightens by turning it counterclockwise and loosens by turning it clockwise  this part includes the tube and the connector on the end it does not include the spindle nut  inside the actuator arm okin note   there are the connectors on the end of the stroke tube a clevis pin goes through this piece and the chair lift mechanism to hold that end of the motor on the chair  the metal connector  and the plastic connector  are interchangeable most older deltadrive motors used the plastic connector but if you order a new deltadrive motor it will come with the metal connector  the plastic one is not all bad however if the person using the chair has a tendency to hit the wall with the back of the chair then not knowing it is against the wall keep holding down the hand control  �something has to give� in that situation and sometimes the plastic connector will break saving something worse happening�  it�s not designed to break but sometimes it just works out that way okin note   these are recessed controls that are normally found in power recliners and theater chairs they are built into either the arm of the chair or sofa or under the arm on the side of the chair  there are several different styles of these recessed controls but they all have a round five pin connector on the end of the cord  the  has a rectangular housing and is held on by two screws the screw holes measure   center to center the  has an oval shaped housing and is also held on by two screws  the screw holes measure   center to center the  has a round housing with a diameter of   okin note   a new motor like this is only available from your local la z boy showroom dealer there are no new aftermarket replacements for this motor system  however if your motor assy is not working because of an electrical issue example the transformer only clicks when the button is pushed or the motor is not making any noise or attempt to run we may be able to get this assy repaired for you  we have a repair co that we have been using for many years that can repair most electrical problems with the unit  the repair cost usually runs    you can send it to us with a note letting us know the problem with the unit and we will send it out for repair  repair time normally takes  weeks  if the motor assy is physically broken example the clevis on the back of the motor is broken or the motor sounds like it is running but the stroke tube isnt moving there is no repair available  okin note   this technically is a dewert part not an okin but we show it here because several la z boy chairs use both dewert and okin parts together there are several different motors that have the mcz designation la z boy makes several style chairs that have three mcz motors installed all different  note because of the way la z boy chairs are designed it is very difficult to determine whether the problem with a chair that has a motor not running is because of the motor or the control box wire harness  a new motor like this is only available from your local la z boy showroom dealer there are no new aftermarket replacements for this motor system okin note   the  and  controls were parts that la z boy got from overseas sources  those controls arent available anymore so la z boy found another source the only problem was that to make the new control work with the chairs a kit had to be developed  this kit consists of a new hand control a new control box a new transformer some jumper wires and an instruction booklet  that is why the cost is so much when all you really wanted was a hand control or a control box  normally this takes care of most electrical problems with the chair as when this kit is installed basically all critical parts will be new under the chair except the motors  unfortunately we can no longer order these parts directly from la z boy la z boy has had a price adjustment early in february  on their repair parts basically they tripled their parts prices to their dealers i have been in the service business for over  years and i have never seen a price increase like that you should be able to get this retro kit directly from a local la z boy showroom dealer okin note   the  has a three pin quick disconnect type control that plugs into an extension cord in the side or magazine pocket of the chair that extension cord goes on down to plug into the motor with a five pin connector  the  is not being made anymore but our  okin quick disconnect control will easily replace the  the only real difference besides what it looks like is that the  has a five pin quick disconnect however the  also comes with the extension cable attached that goes down to the motor  all you need to do is to remove the extension cable that is now attached to your chair and replace it with the extension cable that we send with the   you possibly could order the  from the factory they did still have a few but our control is almost one half the cost of the la z boy control and it seems to work better  this explanation may seem complicated but when you get the new control it will all make sense if you still have problems just call or email us and we can help okin note   while not an okin part per se this style transformer was used in many chairs with okin electronics to power the heat and massage functions if present  chairs that had this system almost always had two separate transformers this one for the heatmassage and another to make the chair go up  down  please note to determine whether you need the older style  or the newer style  transformer you need to take a look at the plug coming out from your chair that will plug into the transformer  specifically look to see if it has a small pin in the middle of the plug  if it has a small pin in the middle of that plug you will need the  if it doesnt have that small pin you will need the  okin note   this is the extension cable that goes from the side pocket of the chair down to the control box wiring harness under the chair  it is designed for the   la z boy hand control and has an eight pin female connector on the end that the hand control plugs into and an eight pin male connector that plugs into the control box hubbell motor system

that has a hubbell motor it is best to order this if your chair has anything except a  prong connector where the hand control cord attaches to the motor cord you could always �hard wire� the old hand control to the new motor but if the motor is bad the hand control won�t be far behind�  hubbell note   this is the same as the motor above but it is the motor assembly only without the hand control  as long as you have a lift chair with a four prong connector the two outside prongs have a flat side so it can�t be plugged in wrong and the hand control is in good shape then this motor assembly is the one you need  note this model motor wont fit any other application except a lift chair bed motors treadmill motors etc have different mounting that keep this motor from fitting those units  hubbell note   this hand control comes standard with a four prong connector and the two outside prongs have a flat side so it can�t be plugged in wrong  note the four prongs mentioned here refer to the connector not the number of wires dont just see three wires and assume you have a three wire connector most newer motors have a four prong connector but only have three wires attached you will need to unplug the connectors and count the number of prongs to be sure you order the correct control  if you have an older model hand control with a three prong connector and the two outside prongs have a flat side then order the three prong one below  if it is even older and it has any other type connector four prong with flat pins connector with orange terminals or even a six prong square connector etc then you can still use this hand control you will need to �hard wire� it to the motor cord with crimp connectors we have instructions on how to do this in the hubbell section of our troubleshooting tips page  hubbell note   chairs with hubbell motors that have a heatmassage system are sort of rare but there are still a few out there  the connections on this control for the heat and massage are the ones most commonly used but some older chairs will not plug in to these connectors� for those you will have to �hard wire� your heat and the massage wires to the new control  the main connector to the lift chair motor is a four prong connector like  above  hubbell note   before you order either the capacitor or limit switch be sure to read over our troubleshooting tips section for the hubbell motors we hardly ever sell either of these parts so check carefully before you think this might be the problem  these do go bad but rarely�  hubbell note   we now finally have the gear sets in stock for the hubbell motors we used to get them directly from the factory but since it has now closed we had find another source  for anyone who has done tool and die or plastic fabrication work you know that the molds for making the gears are very expensive and two molds had to be made for each set doubling the cost  that extra expense is being passed on to us in each set of gears that is made that is why the cost is so high before you call and ask�  important note as you can see above there is more than one set of gears for hubbell motors even though most all hubbell motors say mc the way you tell the difference is in the number of teeth on the gears  part   is mainly for lift chair motors it has  teeth on the gear pictured on the left the one that goes around the worm screw and  teeth on the smaller inner gear on the one pictured on the right  the other gear sets shown fit most other type hubbell applications beds treadmills dental chairs etc those sets have different numbers of teeth on the inner gear on the one pictured on the right  it is very important that you check the number of teeth on your gears before you order a replacement set because if you order the wrong set and try to install them on your motor we cant take them back  for applications other than lift chairs you may have to replace the gears as that may be your only option to get the motor back running again but for lift chair motors you may want to weigh the cost of a set of gears against the price of a new motor with a six month warranty � the choice is entirely up to you  we have installation instructions for the gear sets under the hubbell section of our  troubleshooting tips page on our website hubbell note   this stroke tube will only fit hubbell motors on lift chairs please dont think that you can make it work if your hubbell motor goes on anything but a lift chair   we have installation instructions for the stroke tube under the hubbell section of our

comments about this web site hand controls    medical center supply                           shown below are the most common hand controls now in use on lift chairs  the only real way to tell which control you need for your chair is to pay attention to the plug that attaches to the motor or transformer and compare that plug with the illustrations below oddly enough the part you actually hold in your hand is not the most important factor in determining which control you need all basic updown switches pretty much work the same  the key is how it attaches to the other electronics  shipping within the continental usa is included in the prices quoted  we stock these parts in our warehouse for quick shipment  if you have any questions on whether a particular part will fit your needs  please let us know  if you need something not listed either call or email us  either way we will need the chair manufacturer serial  detailed description of part needed etc and we will do the research and get back with you promptly you may have to look on the law tag sewn to the bottom of the footboard for the chair manufacturer and on the frame behind the chair for the serial   need help deciding where the problem is  then please click here for our troubleshooting guide which shows common problems and their possible solutions free shipping in the continental usa on all lift chair parts see below below we list the way we normally ship our parts we dont have to spend the extra to ship the most critical parts by fedex and priority mail none of our competitors do we just feel that its the

shopping cart we can download the order in our accounting system and get the parts shipped out quickly  in fact most online orders sent in by  ct will be shipped out the same day  orders that are called in have to be manually processed and it normally takes an extra day to be input and shipped  while we truly dont mind if you call in with questions etc please dont call in your order expecting to get it quicker that way  one exception  if you need the part overnight and you are willing to pay the shipping expense for express mail or fedex you can all in by pm ct and most orders can be

prongs have a flat side so it can�t be plugged in wrong  note the four prongs mentioned here refer to the connector not the number of wires dont just see three wires and assume you have a three wire connector most newer motors have a four prong connector but only have three wires attached you will need to unplug the connectors and count the number of prongs to be sure you order the correct control  if you have an older model hand control with a three prong round connector and the two outside prongs have a flat side then order the three prong one below  if it is even older and it has any other type connector four prong with flat pins connector with orange terminals or even a six prong square connector etc then you can still use this hand control you will need to �hard wire� it to the motor cord with crimp connectors we have instructions on how to do this in the hubbell section of our troubleshooting tips page note   chairs with hubbell motors that have a heatmassage system are sort of rare but there are still a few out there  the connections on this control for the heat and massage are the ones most commonly used but some older chairs will not plug in to these connectors� for those you will have to �hard wire� your heat and the massage wires to the new control note   this hand control is used with a von weise low volt motor system  the connector on the end of the hand control cord has a small square four prong plug  note the control you will receive will look a little different than the one pictured but will work the same except that the replacement control will not be lighted  the original control pictured is not available any longer neither is any other component of the low volt von weise electronics set but we found a company that could manufacture this replacement hand control note   the  and  hand controls are the most common okin hand controls in use today  the  has a one piece cord that �disappears� down through a hole in the chair and normally plugs in underneath the chair to a short cord off the motor  it has a round plug with a  degree angle that has five pins in a semicircle  the  has a quick disconnect plug that normally unplugs in the side or magazine pocket of the chair  it has a straight plug with five pins in a semicircle and it plugs into another cord that is already in the side pocket of the chair most have a small plastic lever that folds over the plugs to lock them into place  if you have a chair with an okin system and it has a hand control like the one pictured either one of these will work as they are both wired the same  the way to tell which one you need is to just follow the cord from the part you hold in your hand down past the coiled part and see if there is a straight plug a few inches from the coiled part  or does the cord disappear down through a hole in the chair   the  is the newer design and was developed as a way to easily change the hand control without having to turn the chair over  another selling feature is that if you have grandchildren over and they like playing on the chair then you can easily unplug the control so they won�t play with it of course it�s ok with us if you let them play with the chair � grandkids are great for our business� note   this is the extension cable only that the  hand control plugs into in the side pocket of the chair and goes on down to plug into the short cord off the motor  normally the only reason to replace this cord is if it has gotten pinched by the chair mechanism note   this control is for chairs that have a dual motor system one motor controls the up  down motion of the chair the other motor controls the back action  this control has a round five pin plug like the    but has two rows of buttons note   this control looks like our   but it has a round plug with seven pins this is a very rare hand control that we hardly ever sell so be sure that your plug has the seven pin connector before you order note   this is a very common hand control used on more expensive la z boy lift chairs  however be sure that your old hand control has a sticker with the number  on the back  note the hand control we ship is made by the same company that makes the controls for la z boy  there are other chair manufacturers that use this same control so to keep the control manufacturer from having to make separate faceplates for each manufacturer their replacement controls have the relaxor name on the front which is the trademark name of the manufacturer of the hand controls that way they can keep their costs down by not having to make controls for each user  the only difference you may notice is that this control lights up all the time like a night light  some people love it some dont but there is no way to cut the light off i have asked for that feature and their engineers are taking it under advisement  nevertheless it has proven to be a great replacement for the original control note   this is also a common hand control used on la z boy lift chairs  however be sure that  you have a la z boy chair and  check that your old hand control has a sticker with the number  on the back  la z boy has used controls that look very similar to this control but it has different numbers on the back like  and  please give us a call if you have this type of hand control as the  will not work with those controls note   this is just as pictured it is only used on golden chairs designed with an infinite position back  please note that the chair has to be designed for the infinite position function just ordering this control and installing it on a standard chair will not give the chair the infinite position function note   the  and  hand controls are the most common dewert hand controls in use today  the  has a one piece cord that �disappears� down through a hole in the chair and normally plugs in underneath the chair to the motor assembly  it has a round plug with a  degree angle that has five pins in a semicircle  the  has a quick disconnect plug that normally unplugs in the side or magazine pocket of the chair  it has a straight plug with five pins in a semicircle and it plugs into another cord that is already in the side pocket of the chair most have a small plastic lever that folds over the plugs to lock them into place  the  control usually has a white tag around the wire of the hand control close to the plug end that has pn  or pn   the way to tell which one you need is to just follow the cord from the part you hold in your hand down past the coiled part and see if there is a straight plug a few inches from the coiled part  or does the cord disappear down through a hole in the chair   the  is the newer design and was developed as a way to easily change the hand control without having to turn the chair over  another selling feature is that if you have grandchildren over and they like playing on the chair then you can easily unplug the control so they won�t play with it of course it�s ok with us if you let them play with the chair � grandkids are great for our business�  if you want to upgrade to the quick disconnect feature you can simply order the  control and the   extension cable below this will give chairs with the older style one piece cord the convenience of the quick disconnect setup  note if you think you have the   type hand control then please look at note  below to be sure you get the correct version for your chair note   the  is for pride chairs made after november  with okin or fbs electronics  the hand control looks almost identical to the   above except it has a six terminal switch inside to accommodate the okin system  the way to tell the difference between the  and  is as follows  look at either the transformer or the motor if either of these has the word dewert on it then you need the  hand control if it has okin or fbs on either you need the   control   the  control usually has a white tag around the wire of the hand control close to the plug end that has pn  or pn  the  has a white tag that says pn kc note   this is the extension cable only that only the  hand control plugs into in the side pocket of the chair and goes on down to plug into the short cord off the motor  normally the only reason to replace this cord is if it has gotten pinched by the chair mechanism  note this extension cable will only work for chairs that have the dewert electrical system it will not work with chairs that have the okin or fbs or other compatible systems nor will it work for the   hand control above note   the  and qd controls are for chairs with heat and massage systems the controls have a large paddle switch for up  down and below they have two smaller switches red and white for the heat and massage  as with the      controls in note  above the  has a one piece cord that �disappears� down through a hole in the chair and normally plugs in underneath the chair to the motor assembly  it has a round plug with a  degree angle that has five pins in a semicircle  the qd has a quick disconnect plug that normally unplugs in the side or magazine pocket of the chair  it has a straight plug with five pins in a semicircle and it plugs into another cord that is already in the side pocket of the chair most have a small plastic lever that folds over the plugs to lock them into place  the way to tell which one you need is to just follow the cord from the part you hold in your hand down past the coiled part and see if there is a straight plug a few inches from the coiled part qd or does the cord disappear down through a hole in the chair  note   the  and qd controls are for chairs with an infinite control system for the chair back the controls have a large paddle switch for up  down and below they have a smaller white switch  that moves side to side to lay the back down  as with the    controls in note  above the  has a one piece cord that �disappears� down through a hole in the chair and normally plugs in underneath the chair to the motor assembly  it has a round plug with a  degree angle that has five pins in a semicircle  the qd has a quick disconnect plug that normally unplugs in the side or magazine pocket of the chair  it has a straight plug with five pins in a semicircle and it plugs into another cord that is already in the side pocket of the chair most have a small plastic lever that folds over the plugs to lock them into place  the way to tell which one you need is to just follow the cord from the part you hold in your hand down past the coiled part and see if there is a straight plug a few inches from the coiled part qd or does the cord disappear down through a hole in the chair  note   these controls are generally used on only the highend very expensive pride chairs  each has a grey control housing with a black thumb switch for the up  down and below that are four push switches a top red switch for heat and three white switches below that for the massage and intensity  the   has nothing above the black up  down switch while the  has a white infinite button control above the black updown switch just compare the pictures to your control to see which one you have  note if you have the   please call us for options on what parts you will need to get the chair back running again note   please read this note very carefully as this change from pride has caused a great deal of confusion  the control pictured here is is the newest style hand control from pride it is a grey control with push buttons for up  down plus a lock button  it attaches to a control box  which then attaches to an okin transformer and an okin deltadrive motor  however pride has had many production problems with this setup it seems either the hand control was failing or more often the control box it plugged into went bad  they tried several different solutions but finally settled on using a standard okin quick disconnect control our part   and eliminating the control box  what you need to do is to completely remove the control box from the chair first find the control box usually it is mounted behind the chair or underneath the chair toward the rear  if you dont see it just follow either the wire from the hand control or the wire coming from the transformer both plug into wires off the control box  unplug all the wires coming from that box and remove the box from the chair  then you take the cord coming from the transformer toward the chair and plug it in to a short two prong cord off the actuator that nothing is currently plugged into  then you plug the new hand control cord to the other cord coming out of the motor  everything then is plugged directly to the motor which is how all the other major chair manufacturers wire their chairs  with this new configuration the hand control isnt lighted but it is a much simpler setup with much less to go wrong with it  please understand that you wont be getting the grey hand control that is pictured but if you take the  that we send you and you follow the instructions above this should take care of the problem  note   these are recessed controls that are normally found in power recliners and theater chairs they are built into either the arm of the chair or sofa or under the arm on the side of the chair  there are several different styles of these recessed controls but they all have a round five pin connector on the end of the cord  the  has a rectangular housing and is held on by two screws the screw holes measure   center to center the  has an oval shaped housing and is also held on by two screws  the screw holes measure   center to center the  has a round housing with a diameter of   note   the  has a three pin quick disconnect type control that plugs into an extension cord in the side or magazine pocket of the chair that extension cord goes on down to plug into the motor with a five pin connector  the  is not being made anymore but our  okin quick disconnect control will easily replace the  the only real difference besides what it looks like is that the  has a five pin quick disconnect however the  also comes with the extension cable attached that goes down to the motor  all you need to do is to remove the extension cable that is now attached to your chair and replace it with the extension cable that we send with the   you could order the  from the factory they still have a few but our control is almost one half the cost of the la z boy control and it seems to work better  this explanation may seem complicated but when you get the new control it will all make sense if you still have problems just call or email us and we can help note   the  and  controls were parts that la z boy got from overseas sources  those controls arent available anymore so la z boy found another source the only problem was that to make the new control work with the chairs a kit had to be developed  this kit consists of a new hand control a new control box a new transformer some jumper wires and an instruction booklet  that is why the cost is so much when all you really wanted was a hand control or a control box  normally this takes care of most electrical problems with the chair as when this kit is installed basically all critical parts will be new under the chair except the motors  unfortunately we can no longer order these parts directly from la z boy la z boy has had a price adjustment early in february  on their repair parts basically they tripled their parts prices to their dealers i have been in the service business for over  years and i have never seen a price increase like that you should be able to get this retro kit directly from a local la z boy showroom dealer note    the   and qd controls are for chairs with both heat and massage and infinite control systems the control has a large paddle switch for up  down and below they have a smaller white switch  that moves side to side to lay the back down and two smaller switches red and white for the heat and massage  the qd has a  quick disconnect seven pin plug that normally unplugs in the side or magazine pocket of the chair  the  has a long one piece cord with a five pin plug that goes down through a hole in the chair and plugs in to the control box underneath the chair  before you order please look at the plug on the end of your hand control cord and order the control that matches the notes above note   after so long a time we now have these recessed controls in stock these are used on berkline and other manufacturers power recliners and theater chairs  as shown they have a telephone type plug for the recessed control and it plugs into our part  jldp power supply note   this is the newest style hand control sold by golden technologies  it has features such as memory buttons and a button to make the chair go into the tv watching position  please note this hand control cannot be substituted for a standard two button hand control just because you want these features on your chair the chair would need the rest of the electronics designed for this control note   this hand control is manufactured by tranquil ease and is sometimes used with chairs that have an okin or equivalent system  the back of the control will list a model  hlpr on the control  it has a one piece cord with a nine pin screw on connector that looks like what would screw into the back of a computer note   please read this note very carefully as this change from pride has caused a great deal of confusion  this hand control was manufactured by tranquil ease and is sometimes used with chairs that have an okin or equivalent system  this control has been discontinued from the manufacturer and is no longer available  we replace this control with our part   hand control  it has two buttons for up  down but does not have the lockunlock button  please note there were two versions of this hand control  one has the one piece cord with the round plug with five pins the  will be an exact replacement for that version  the other version has a six pin rectangular connector that plugs into a control box under the chair and then there is a cord that comes out of that control box to go to the motor  in that case all you need to do is to eliminate the control box and plug the new hand control directly to the cord from the motor the new hand control does not require the control box to operate note   this is a newer style hand control that golden started using a few years ago when all the lift chair manufacturers started using lighted hand controls  note  if you are not a fan of the lighted control you can use our part   control which is what golden used for many years before they went to this one  as you can see it is a black control with two white buttons it doesnt light up or have the wood grain finish but it is a good bit cheaper than this newer control  we have both in stock so it all comes down to your preference note   this is the extension cable that goes from the side pocket of the chair down to the control box wiring harness under the chair  it is designed for the   la z boy hand control and has an eight pin female connector on the end that the hand control plugs into and an eight pin male connector that plugs into the control box note   this is the new style deluxe heat  massage and infinite hand control with two small buttons on the top of the control for heat seat and heat back  most of these units dont have any markings on the back of the hand control but it is distinguishable in that it has a  pin connector with thumb screws that screw into a control box under the chair note   this hand control was manufactured by tranquil ease and was sometimes used with chairs that have an okin or equivalent system  this control is nearly identical to our part   control but it had a cord with a round quick disconnect plug that plugged into another cord that went down to plug into the control box under the chair  the back of the control will list a model  gt on the control  this control is not being manufactured any longer but you can use the  control and run the  hand control cord down and plug it directly into the control box you will just not have the quick disconnect any longer note   please read this note very carefully as this change from pride has caused a great deal of confusion  please note that there are are two six button hand controls that have been used on pride chairs that look exactly alike but are not interchangeable  there are two ways to tell which hand control you need  look at the serial  on the chair if the serial  is before lxxxxxxx where the small xs could be any number or letters then the  is the correct control  if it is after lxxxxxxx then the part  a will be the correct one   you can also look at the control box that the hand control extension cable plugs into and see what number is on that box if it has cmb on the box then the  will be the correct one if it has any other number on the box then the a will be the correct one  note   there have been several different versions of this hand control some had up  down some had fwd and back but as long as your hand control has this shape and the buttons are in these approximate positions it will be the correct one we always ship the most current version  the hand control has a round plug with eight pins and it plugs into the control box under the chair note   this is prides newest hand control for basic upsown lift chairs  the hand control is slim design with two buttons that light up  it has a round plug with  pins and a straight connector   contact

most common okin electrical setup used in lift chairs today  purchasing this set is a good choice if you don�t know � or want to know � what the problem with your chair is you just want it fixed the first time or you may just want to update your chair to the latest electronics and head off any problems  either way if you presently have the deltadrive motor on your chair this set should solve the problem okin note  the betadrive set is very common in berkline chairs but other manufacturers have used them from time to time  the decision to replace the complete set is the same as for the deltadrive in note  above  note please be sure that the motor on your chair has a shaft about �� long and has a white moving block  if your motor is all black with a black block this motor will not work� please call for options if you have the black block on your motor okin note   the  motor is a brand new motor direct from the factory and as mentioned in note  above is now the most common okin motor used in lift chairs  there should be a sticker on the side of your motor that says deltadrive if so this is the motor you need okin note   the  is the okin motor that pride is using on their newer model chairs  it has proven to be one of the most durable and reliable actuators ever used on lift chairs  it is possible for this motor to go bad but in reality unless you hear the motor running or gears grinding but the actuator is not moving it is very unlikely that this motor is the problem in the chair   the great majority of the time you will find the problem is in the hand control especially if your chair has the  hand control on the pride page on our website okin note   the betadrive motor shown here has a shaft about �� long and has a white moving block  if the motor you have is all black with a black block this motor will not work please call for options if you have the black block on your motor  also the  motor is designed for lift chairs only if you need a motor like this for a power recliner or theater chair please give us a call most of the time theater and recliner chairs use a faster geared motor than a lift chair we have those in stock also although they aren�t listed on the website to reduce confusion i hope� okin note   the  and  hand controls are the most common okin hand controls in use today  the  has a one piece cord that �disappears� down through a hole in the chair and normally plugs in underneath the chair to a short cord off the motor  it has a round plug with a  degree angle that has five pins in a semicircle  the  has a quick disconnect plug that normally unplugs in the side or magazine pocket of the chair  it has a straight plug with five pins in a semicircle and it plugs into another cord that is already in the side pocket of the chair most have a small plastic lever that folds over the plugs to lock them into place  if you have a chair with an okin system and it has a hand control like the one pictured either one of these will work as they are both wired the same  the way to tell which one you need is to just follow the cord from the part you hold in your hand down past the coiled part and see if there is a straight plug a few inches from the coiled part  or does the cord disappear down through a hole in the chair   the  is the newer design and was developed as a way to easily change the hand control without having to turn the chair over  another selling feature is that if you have grandchildren over and they like playing on the chair then you can easily unplug the control so they won�t play with it of course it�s ok with us if you let them play with the chair � grandkids are great for our business� okin note   this is the extension cable only that the  hand control plugs into in the side pocket of the chair and goes on down to plug into the short cord off the motor  normally the only reason to replace this cord is if it has gotten pinched by the chair mechanism okin note   this is a very common hand control used on more expensive la z boy lift chairs  however be sure that  you have a la z boy chair and  check that your old hand control has a sticker with the number  on the back  please give us a call if you have this type of hand control but you don�t have a la z boy chair� we probably have another control that will work but if you don�t have a la z boy chair this control won�t work okin note   this is also a common hand control used on la z boy lift chairs  however be sure that  you have a la z boy chair and  check that your old hand control has a sticker with the number  on the back  la z boy has used controls that look very similar to this control but it has different numbers on the back like  and  please give us a call if you have this type of hand control as the  will not work with those controls okin note   this is the most common okin transformer used on both lift chairs and some power recliners  if your chair has a cord coming out from under the chair that plugs into the transformer with a plug that has a flat blade and a round blade this is the transformer you will need  sometimes transformers have the numbers spa or spb on them if yours has that designation then this  is the one you need  the  power cord below is included with the  transformer when you order it okin note   this is the power cord only for the   transformer above  note don�t order this cord if you don�t also already have a  transformer� many folks that are missing the transformer off their chair usually due to the chair being moved put into storage etc mistakenly think that they only need the power cord to get their chair going again when what they really need is the transformer� the cord coming from the chair with the small flat blade and round blade plugs into the transformer  and then the  transformer plugs into the wall okin note   this transformer is mainly used by berkline and la z boy and also by other smaller manufacturers  it has a female plug on the output side that takes a three pin male connector okin note   this transformer is almost always used on berkline chairs and with other manufacturers with some type of heat andor massage system  it has a female plug on the output side with a six pin connector okin note   this transformer is for united kingdom use only it will not work for chairs located in the usa  it has battery backup and the receptacle for the plug coming from the chair that has a flat blade and a round blade okin note   this transformer is for european countries only it will not work for chairs located in the usa  it has battery backup and the receptacle for the plug coming from the chair that has a flat blade and a round blade okin note   this transformer is for australia only it will not work for chairs located in the usa  it has battery backup and the receptacle for the plug coming from the chair that has a flat blade and a round blade okin note   this is the cord that goes from the transformer to the motor it has a male plug that has a flat blade and a round blade that goes into the transformer and a female plug on the other end with a receptacle for that same flat blade and round blade okin note   this cord is also like   above in that it goes from the transformer to the motor  however it has a rectifier built into the cord that changes the voltage from ac current to dc current  it is mostly used on chairs with a betadrive motor many of those chairs have an ac transformer it won�t have a battery backup the betadrive motor needs dc current so that is the reason for the rectifier  if you change transformers to the newer  switchable acdc transformer you will not need this type cord � you can use the  above okin note   this is also a cord like the ones above that go from the transformer to the motor but this cord has a three pin male plug that plugs into the transformer and a female plug on the other end that takes a flat blade and a round blade plug from the motor okin note   this is the plastic nut usually either white or yellow in color that is inside the actuator tube where you can�t really see it  the worm screw goes through the middle of the nut and the nut has threads on the outside that the stroke tube screws onto as the motor turns the worm screw the nut rides up and down the worm screw pushing and pulling the stroke tube and making the chair go up and down  important note please check the manufacturer of your motor okin or dewert before ordering this part  the part shown here will only work in an okin motor  it will not fit a dewert motor  installation instructions are listed on the okin section of the  troubleshooting tips page on our website okin note   this is the white plastic moving block about � x � that the chair mounts to on a betadrive system if you have a black block you will need our part   below as the block moves up and down the stationary motor shaft the chair goes up and down  there are primarily two white moving blocks used in the usa the difference is in the thread size in the block where the worm screw goes through the center of the block  the way to tell which you need is to look for the slots in the aluminum shaft one on the top and one on the bottom of the shaft shine a light into the slot and see the black worm screw  using a tape measure or ruler pick out a tread on the worm screw and count how many threads or turns there are to the next inch on the ruler� it will be either  threads our part   or  threads our part   per inch  the  thread per inch size is by far the most common but there are enough  thread blocks in use to make sure that you make the effort to get the right measurement  it is very important that you check the thread size before you order a moving block because if you order the wrong one and try to install it on your motor we cant take it back  installation instructions are listed on the okin section of the  troubleshooting tips page on our website okin note   this black moving block fits an okin betadrive motor used on la z boy chairs  the motor for this block will have the notation  on it  installation instructions are listed on the okin section of the  troubleshooting tips page on our website okin note   this is the stroke tube the metal tube that goes in and out of the motor assembly with a metal connector our part   included  note that the tube has left hand threads it tightens by turning it counterclockwise and loosens by turning it clockwise  this part includes the tube and the connector on the end it does not include the spindle nut  inside the actuator arm okin note   there are the connectors on the end of the stroke tube a clevis pin goes through this piece and the chair lift mechanism to hold that end of the motor on the chair  the metal connector  and the plastic connector  are interchangeable most older deltadrive motors used the plastic connector but if you order a new deltadrive motor it will come with the metal connector  the plastic one is not all bad however if the person using the chair has a tendency to hit the wall with the back of the chair then not knowing it is against the wall keep holding down the hand control  �something has to give� in that situation and sometimes the plastic connector will break saving something worse happening�  it�s not designed to break but sometimes it just works out that way okin note   these are recessed controls that are normally found in power recliners and theater chairs they are built into either the arm of the chair or sofa or under the arm on the side of the chair  there are several different styles of these recessed controls but they all have a round five pin connector on the end of the cord  the  has a rectangular housing and is held on by two screws the screw holes measure   center to center the  has an oval shaped housing and is also held on by two screws  the screw holes measure   center to center the  has a round housing with a diameter of   okin note   this deltadrive motor is primarily used in the heavy duty dual motor lift system of goldens pr although it has been found on other manufacturers equipment as well  it looks much like the  deltadrive above but it has only one cord coming off the motor and that cord has a round plug with seven pins  it plugs into the chairs control box okin note   this omegadrive motor is used for the back recline feature primarily on goldens relaxor    series chairs although it has been found on other manufacturers equipment as well   it will have okins part   on a sticker on the motor housing  it has only one cord coming off the motor with a flat pin and a round pin and it plugs into the chairs control box okin note   this omegadrive motor is used for the back recline feature primarily on goldens relaxor    series chairs although it has been found on other manufacturers equipment as well   it will have okins part   on a sticker on the motor housing  it has only one cord coming off the motor with a flat pin and a round pin and it plugs into the chairs control box okin note   this control box is used on several model chairs although mainly found on goldens pr   heavy duty chairs  it is needed to run both the lift motors together okin note   while not an okin part per se this style transformer was used in many chairs with okin electronics to power the heat and massage functions if present  chairs that had this system almost always had two separate transformers this one for the heatmassage and another to make the chair go up  down  please note to determine whether you need the older style  or the newer style  transformer you need to take a look at the plug coming out from your chair that will plug into the transformer  specifically look to see if it has a small pin in the middle of the plug  if it has a small pin in the middle of that plug you will need the  if it doesnt have that small pin you will need the  okin note   this transformer is mainly used in power recliner and power theater chairs  it is very similar to the  transformer above except on the output end the  output connection is integrated into the plastic housing whereas the  has a cord coming from the housing that the flat bladeround blade connector plugs into  the  also does not have an emergency backup system okin note   this is just as pictured it is only used on golden chairs designed with an infinite position back  please note that the chair has to be designed for the infinite position function just ordering this control and installing it on a standard chair will not give the chair the infinite position function okin note   after so long a time we now have these recessed controls in stock these are used on berkline and other manufacturers power recliners and theater chairs  as shown they have a telephone type plug for the recessed control and it plugs into our part  jldp power supply okin note   we  finally  have these power supplies in stock  these are used on berkline and other manufacturers power recliners and theater chairs  as shown they have a telephone type plug for the recessed control our part  jldk and a two pin plug for the actuator  also this part will replace the power supplies on the units with ciar parts even though it doesnt look anything like the ciar units okin note   this actuator normally fits on berkline and other manufacturers power recliners and theater chairs  it has a two pin white connector that plugs into our jldp power supply  also this part will replace the actuator on the units with ciar parts okin note   this is a heavy duty transformer used by a few of the chair manufacturers  it has a female five pin plug although many times the manufacturers use a three pin plug from the chair to the transformer okin note   this deltadrive motor is mainly used as the main updown motor on goldens dual motor chairs although other manufacturers have used it from time to time  the motor will have either three cords coming out of the housing or it will have two cords and another small two prong socket built into the top of the motor housing  usually it will have either the numbers  or a  number

you need for your chair is to take the switch housing apart and compare the switch inside with the illustrations below note be sure the chair is unplugged before you take apart the switch housing   be sure to notice the tabs on the switch sides that the screws go through to attach the switch to the housing some are straight and even with the top of the switch housing others have the tabs indented

continental usa on all lift chair parts see below below we list the way we normally ship our parts we dont have to spend the extra to ship the most critical parts by fedex and priority mail none of

you decide where to buy the parts you need however if you need them even sooner just give us a call and we can figure the shipping charges for express mail or fedex express we only charge you what the delivery companies charge us  we arent looking to charge outrageous shipping charges to people that are already in a bind and need some help a personal note to our parts customers  i realize that for

when parts are ordered online through our shopping cart we can download the order in our accounting system and get the parts shipped out quickly  in fact most online orders sent in by  ct will be

order  hand control click here for control     information notes on switches note   the swsse is the most commonly used switch on pride lift chairs  the switch has three terminals that normally come out to the side of the switch although some other manufacturers bend them down and the mounting tabs on the switch housing the ones that the screws go through are even with the top of the switch housing  note before you order the switch please follow the testing steps on our troubleshooting tips page to see if the switch is the problem and not the wiring in the hand control  the wiring in the control oftentimes shorts out and the symptoms are identical to having a bad switch  please also remember that if a switch is installed even for a few seconds we cant take it back as the switch terminals will have been scratched up it has been used and no one wants to buy a used part note   the sws is only used on fairly old lift chairs it hasnt been used on a chair that i know of since the mid s  it has also never been used on a pride lift chair  if you have a pride lift chair with a switch like this then it will be the swsse above  the switch has three terminals that normally come out to the bottom of the switch  and the mounting tabs on the switch housing the ones that the screws go through are indented down about  of an inch from top of the switch housing this is to make it sit higher in the switch housing and is the main difference between this and the swsse above   note before you order the switch please follow the testing steps on our troubleshooting tips page to see if the switch is the problem and not the wiring in the hand control  the wiring in the control oftentimes shorts out and the symptoms are identical to having a bad switch  please also remember that if a switch is installed even for a few seconds we cant take it back as as the switch terminals will have been scratched up it has been used and no one wants to buy a used part note   this is a rocker switch as opposed to the paddle switches above and hasnt been used in lift chairs for several years now  it comes with three terminals that are designed for solder connections some manufacturers use this switch with push on connectors and with a little ingenuity you could make that work although if you have a solder gun it would be very easy to just cut the connectors off and solder the wires to the terminals  as far as i know this is the only rocker switch available for any model of lift chair  if you have a question as to whether this one will work you can always order the complete hand control we show on the hubbell page on our website and hard wire the plug to your motor  please also remember that if a switch is installed even for a few seconds we cant take it back as as the switch terminals will have been scratched up it has been used and no one wants to buy a used part note   this a black switch with five gold terminals that pushes onto a circuit board inside the switch housing  we used to get these switches from hubbell but since they went bankrupt a few years ago we havent found another source for them  your only real option is to just order the complete hand control we show on the hubbell page on our website  many of the controls that have these switches already have a four prong connector where it attaches to the motor you you can just order the  four prong control a few older units have the three prong connector we show below that one on the hubbell page  any older that that you will need to hard wire the control to your motor   contact

center supply                           when lift chairs really came into their own in the mids hubbell special products was the manufacturer of choice for motorized lift systems  in later years as the west germans developed low voltage systems many of the manufacturers opted to go with the newer technology although several manufacturers still used hubbell as their standard option  there are however still many thousands of chairs operating everyday with hubbell systems installed note hubbell special products discontinued operations in october  so we have a very limited number of component

mail shipping hubbell mc stroke tube qty price             information notes on hubbell parts hubbell note   this comes as a set with both the motor and hand control and fits pretty much any lift chair that has a hubbell motor it is best to order this if your chair has anything except a  prong connector where the hand control cord attaches to the motor cord you could always �hard wire� the old hand control to the new motor but if the motor is bad the hand control won�t be far behind�  hubbell note   this is the same as the motor above but it is the motor assembly only without the hand control  as long as you have a lift chair with a four prong connector the two outside prongs have a flat side so it can�t be plugged in wrong and the hand control is in good shape then this motor assembly is the one you need  note this model motor wont fit any other application except a lift chair bed motors treadmill motors etc have different mounting that keep this motor from fitting those units  hubbell note   this hand control comes standard with a four prong connector and the two outside prongs have a flat side so it can�t be plugged in wrong  note the four prongs mentioned here refer to the connector not the number of wires dont just see three wires and assume you have a three wire connector most newer motors have a four prong connector but only have three wires attached you will need to unplug the connectors and count the number of prongs to be sure you order the correct control  if you have an older model hand control with a three prong connector and the two outside prongs have a flat side then order the three prong one below  if it is even older and it has any other type connector four prong with flat pins connector with orange terminals or even a six prong square connector etc then you can still use this hand control you will need to �hard wire� it to the motor cord with crimp connectors we have instructions on how to do this in the hubbell section of our troubleshooting tips page  hubbell note   chairs with hubbell motors that have a heatmassage system are sort of rare but there are still a few out there  the connections on this control for the heat and massage are the ones most commonly used but some older chairs will not plug in to these connectors� for those you will have to �hard wire� your heat and the massage wires to the new control  the main connector to the lift chair motor is a four prong connector like  above hubbell note   before you order either the capacitor or limit switch be sure to read over our troubleshooting tips section for the hubbell motors we hardly ever sell either of these parts so check carefully before you think this might be the problem  these do go bad but rarely�  hubbell note   we now finally have the gear sets in stock for the hubbell motors we used to get them directly from the factory but since it has now closed we had find another source  for anyone who has done tool and die or plastic fabrication work you know that the molds for making the gears are very expensive and two molds had to be made for each set doubling the cost  that extra expense is being passed on to us in each set of gears that is made that is why the cost is so high before you call and ask�  important note as you can see above there is more than one set of gears for hubbell motors even though most all hubbell motors say mc the way you tell the difference is in the number of teeth on the gears  part   is mainly for lift chair motors it has  teeth on the gear pictured on the left the one that goes around the worm screw and  teeth on the smaller inner gear on the one pictured on the right  the other gear sets shown fit most other type hubbell applications beds treadmills dental chairs etc those sets have different numbers of teeth on the inner gear on the one pictured on the right  it is very important that you check the number of teeth on your gears before you order a replacement set because if you order the wrong set and try to install them on your motor we cant take them back  for applications other than lift chairs you may have to replace the gears as that may be your only option to get the motor back running again but for lift chair motors you may want to weigh the cost of a set of gears against the price of a new motor with a six month warranty � the choice is entirely up to you  we have installation instructions for the gear sets under the hubbell section of our  troubleshooting tips page on our website hubbell note   this stroke tube will only fit hubbell motors on lift chairs please dont think that you can make it work if your hubbell motor goes on anything but a lift chair   we have installation instructions for the stroke tube under the hubbell section of our

                        la z boy incorporated founded in  is one of the oldest furniture manufacturers in the united states  their plant located in monroe mi makes furniture for every room in the home la z boy originally used electrical components manufactured by emerson electric which arent available anymore from there on they have used electrical components made by both okin and dewert both west german companies  in fact la z boy has used the most diverse combinations of electrical systems than any other chair manufacturer by far  below we have listed the most common repair parts used on la z boy chairs along with the factory list prices and our discounted pricing  if you dont see what you are looking for either call or email us  most of  these parts are for the basic updown liftrecline chairs without heat andor massage functions  parts for chairs with heat and massage are readily available at least for the newer model chairs but there are so many variations that it would be impossible to list them all here shipping within the continental usa is included in the prices quoted  we stock these parts in our warehouse for quick shipment  if you have any questions on whether a particular part will fit your needs  please let us know  if you need something not listed either call or email us  either way we will need the chair manufacturer serial  detailed description of part needed etc and we will do the research and get back with you promptly you may have to look on the law tag sewn to the bottom of the footboard for the chair manufacturer and on the frame behind the chair for the serial  need help deciding where the problem is  then please click here for our troubleshooting guide which shows common problems and their possible solutions free shipping in the continental usa on all lift chair parts see below below we list the way we normally ship our parts we dont have to spend the extra to ship the most critical parts by fedex and priority mail none of our competitors do we just feel that its the right thing to do most folks that need lift chair parts need them right now not several days or weeks later  we hope you take this in consideration when you decide where to buy the parts you need however if you need them even sooner just give us a call and we can figure the shipping charges for express mail or fedex express we only charge you what the delivery companies charge us  we arent looking to charge outrageous shipping charges to people that are already in a bind and need some help a personal note to our parts customers  i realize that for most of you repairing lift chairs is not your primary occupation many of you are attempting this for the first time  i just want to assure you that the vast majority of the parts we list here can easily be installed by almost anyone please keep in mind that the last statement was made by a service technician that made his living by doing service calls  i also want you to feel comfortable doing business with us and our company  we invite you to click here to read about us and the way we try to do business  you can also click here to read some of the testimonials that folks have sent in after they have completed their repairs  if you have a question about our parts warranty or parts return policy you can click here to go to our guidelines page  i invite you to take a look at the information on the links above  and then you can make a decision if we are the kind of people that you want to do business with a note about ordering parts online  we have had many customers who call in to the shop to place their parts orders  when i ask why they called in to order they normally say that they thought they would get it quicker if they called it in  actually the opposite is true when parts are ordered online through our shopping cart we can download the order in our accounting system and get the parts shipped out quickly  in fact most online orders sent in by  ct will be shipped out the same day  orders that are called in have to be manually processed and it normally takes an extra day to be input and shipped  while we truly dont mind if you call in with questions etc please dont call in your order expecting to get it quicker that way  one exception  if you need the part overnight and you are willing to pay the shipping expense for express mail or fedex you can all in by pm ct and most orders can be shipped out that day   okin lift systems complete priority mail shipping   product description retail    your    price ordering okin deltadrive lift system complete

set is the most common okin electrical setup used in lift chairs today  purchasing this set is a good choice if you don�t know � or want to know � what the problem with your chair is you just want it fixed the first time or you may just want to update your chair to the latest electronics and head off any problems  either way if you presently have the deltadrive motor on your chair this set should solve the problem okin note  the betadrive set is very common in berkline chairs but other manufacturers have used them from time to time  the decision to replace the complete set is the same as for the deltadrive in note  above  note please be sure that the motor on your chair has a shaft about �� long and has a white moving block  if your motor is all black with a black block this motor will not work� please call for options if you have the black block on your motor okin note   the  motor is a brand new motor direct from the factory and as mentioned in note  above is now the most common okin motor used in lift chairs  there should be a sticker on the side of your motor that says deltadrive if so this is the motor you need okin note   the betadrive motor shown here has a shaft about �� long and has a white moving block  if the motor you have is all black with a black block this motor will not work please call for options if you have the black block on your motor  also the  motor is designed for lift chairs only if you need a motor like this for a power recliner or theater chair please give us a call most of the time theater and recliner chairs use a faster geared motor than a lift chair we have those in stock also although they aren�t listed on the website to reduce confusion i hope� okin note   the  and  hand controls are the most common okin hand controls in use today  the  has a one piece cord that �disappears� down through a hole in the chair and normally plugs in underneath the chair to a short cord off the motor  it has a round plug with a  degree angle that has five pins in a semicircle  the  has a quick disconnect plug that normally unplugs in the side or magazine pocket of the chair  it has a straight plug with five pins in a semicircle and it plugs into another cord that is already in the side pocket of the chair most have a small plastic lever that folds over the plugs to lock them into place  if you have a chair with an okin system and it has a hand control like the one pictured either one of these will work as they are both wired the same  the way to tell which one you need is to just follow the cord from the part you hold in your hand down past the coiled part and see if there is a straight plug a few inches from the coiled part  or does the cord disappear down through a hole in the chair   the  is the newer design and was developed as a way to easily change the hand control without having to turn the chair over  another selling feature is that if you have grandchildren over and they like playing on the chair then you can easily unplug the control so they won�t play with it of course it�s ok with us if you let them play with the chair � grandkids are great for our business� okin note   this is the extension cable only that the  hand control plugs into in the side pocket of the chair and goes on down to plug into the short cord off the motor  normally the only reason to replace this cord is if it has gotten pinched by the chair mechanism okin note   this is a very common hand control used on more expensive la z boy lift chairs  however be sure that your old hand control has a sticker with the number  on the back  note the hand control we ship is made by the same company that makes the controls for la z boy  there are other chair manufacturers that use this same control so to keep the control manufacturer from having to make separate faceplates for each manufacturer their replacement controls have the relaxor name on the front which is the trademark name of the manufacturer of the hand controls that way they can keep their costs down by not having to make controls for each user  the only difference you may notice is that this control lights up all the time like a night light  some people love it some dont but there is no way to cut the light off i have asked for that feature and their engineers are taking it under advisement  nevertheless it has proven to be a great replacement for the original control okin note   this is also a common hand control used on la z boy lift chairs  however be sure that  you have a la z boy chair and  check that your old hand control has a sticker with the number  on the back  la z boy has used controls that look very similar to this control but it has different numbers on the back like  and  please give us a call if you have this type of hand control as the  will not work with those controls okin note   this is the most common okin transformer used on both lift chairs and some power recliners  if your chair has a cord coming out from under the chair that plugs into the transformer with a plug that has a flat blade and a round blade this is the transformer you will need  sometimes transformers have the numbers spa or spb on them if yours has that designation then this  is the one you need  the  power cord below is included with the  transformer when you order it okin note   this is the power cord only for the   transformer above  note don�t order this cord if you don�t also already have a  transformer� many folks that are missing the transformer off their chair usually due to the chair being moved put into storage etc mistakenly think that they only need the power cord to get their chair going again when what they really need is the transformer� the cord coming from the chair with the small flat blade and round blade plugs into the transformer  and then the  transformer plugs into the wall okin note   this transformer is mainly used by berkline and la z boy and also by other smaller manufacturers  it has a female plug on the output side that takes a three pin connector okin note   this transformer is almost always used on berkline chairs and other manufacturers with some type of heat andor massage system  it has a female plug on the output side with a six pin connector okin note   this transformer is for united kingdom use only it will not work for chairs located in the usa  it has battery backup and the receptacle for the plug coming from the chair that has a flat blade and a round blade okin note   this transformer is for european countries only it will not work for chairs located in the usa  it has battery backup and the receptacle for the plug coming from the chair that has a flat blade and a round blade okin note   this transformer is for australia only it will not work for chairs located in the usa  it has battery backup and the receptacle for the plug coming from the chair that has a flat blade and a round blade okin note   this is the cord that goes from the transformer to the motor it has a male plug that has a flat blade and a round blade that goes into the transformer and a female plug on the other end with a receptacle for that same flat blade and round blade okin note   this cord is also like   above in that it goes from the transformer to the motor  however it has a rectifier built into the cord that changes the voltage from ac current to dc current  it is mostly used on chairs with a betadrive motor many of those chairs have an ac transformer it won�t have a battery backup the betadrive motor needs dc current so that is the reason for the rectifier  if you change transformers to the newer  switchable acdc transformer you will not need this type cord � you can use the  above okin note   this is also a cord like the ones above that go from the transformer to the motor but this cord has a three pin male plug that plugs into the transformer and a female plug on the other end that takes a flat blade and a round blade plug from the motor okin note   this is the plastic nut usually either white or yellow in color that is inside the actuator tube where you can�t really see it  the worm screw goes through the middle of the nut and the nut has threads on the outside that the stroke tube screws onto as the motor turns the worm screw the nut rides up and down the worm screw pushing and pulling the stroke tube and making the chair go up and down  important note please check the manufacturer of your motor okin or dewert before ordering this part  the part shown here will only work in an okin motor  it will not fit a dewert motor  installation instructions are listed on the okin section of the  troubleshooting tips page on our website okin note   this is the white plastic moving block about � x � that the chair mounts to on a betadrive system if you have a black block you will need our part   below as the block moves up and down the stationary motor shaft the chair goes up and down  there are primarily two white moving blocks used in the usa the difference is in the thread size in the block where the worm screw goes through the center of the block  the way to tell which you need is to look for the slots in the aluminum shaft one on the top and one on the bottom of the shaft shine a light into the slot and see the black worm screw  using a tape measure or ruler pick out a tread on the worm screw and count how many threads or turns there are to the next inch on the ruler� it will be either  threads our part   or  threads our part   per inch  the  thread per inch size is by far the most common but there are enough  thread blocks in use to make sure that you make the effort to get the right measurement  it is very important that you check the thread size before you order a moving block because if you order the wrong one and try to install it on your motor we cant take it back  installation instructions are listed on the okin section of the  troubleshooting tips page on our website okin note   this black moving block fits an okin betadrive motor used on la z boy chairs  the motor for this block will normally have the notation  on it  please note the replacement part you will receive from us will have a white colored block okin doesnt sell many of these blocks and the last time they did a production run they used white material instead of black  installation instructions are listed on the okin section of the  troubleshooting tips page on our website okin note   this is the stroke tube the metal tube that goes in and out of the motor assembly with a metal connector our part   included  note that the tube has left hand threads it tightens by turning it counterclockwise and loosens by turning it clockwise  this part includes the tube and the connector on the end it does not include the spindle nut  inside the actuator arm okin note   there are the connectors on the end of the stroke tube a clevis pin goes through this piece and the chair lift mechanism to hold that end of the motor on the chair  the metal connector  and the plastic connector  are interchangeable most older deltadrive motors used the plastic connector but if you order a new deltadrive motor it will come with the metal connector  the plastic one is not all bad however if the person using the chair has a tendency to hit the wall with the back of the chair then not knowing it is against the wall keep holding down the hand control  �something has to give� in that situation and sometimes the plastic connector will break saving something worse happening�  it�s not designed to break but sometimes it just works out that way okin note   these are recessed controls that are normally found in power recliners and theater chairs they are built into either the arm of the chair or sofa or under the arm on the side of the chair  there are several different styles of these recessed controls but they all have a round five pin connector on the end of the cord  the  has a rectangular housing and is held on by two screws the screw holes measure   center to center the  has an oval shaped housing and is also held on by two screws  the screw holes measure   center to center the  has a round housing with a diameter of   okin note   a new motor like this is only available from your local la z boy showroom dealer there are no new aftermarket replacements for this motor system  however if your motor assy is not working because of an electrical issue example the transformer only clicks when the button is pushed or the motor is not making any noise or attempt to run we may be able to get this assy repaired for you  we have a repair co that we have been using for many years that can repair most electrical problems with the unit  the repair cost usually runs    you can send it to us with a note letting us know the problem with the unit and we will send it out for repair  repair time normally takes  weeks  if the motor assy is physically broken example the clevis on the back of the motor is broken or the motor sounds like it is running but the stroke tube isnt moving there is no repair available  okin note   this technically is a dewert part not an okin but we show it here because several la z boy chairs use both dewert and okin parts together there are several different motors that have the mcz designation la z boy makes several style chairs that have three mcz motors installed all different  note because of the way la z boy chairs are designed it is very difficult to determine whether the problem with a chair that has a motor not running is because of the motor or the control box wire harness  a new motor like this is only available from your local la z boy showroom dealer there are no new aftermarket replacements for this motor system okin note   the  and  controls were parts that la z boy got from overseas sources  those controls arent available anymore so la z boy found another source the only problem was that to make the new control work with the chairs a kit had to be developed  this kit consists of a new hand control a new control box a new transformer some jumper wires and an instruction booklet  that is why the cost is so much when all you really wanted was a hand control or a control box  normally this takes care of most electrical problems with the chair as when this kit is installed basically all critical parts will be new under the chair except the motors  unfortunately we can no longer order these parts directly from la z boy la z boy has had a price adjustment early in february  on their repair parts basically they tripled their parts prices to their dealers i have been in the service business for over  years and i have never seen a price increase like that you should be able to get this retro kit directly from a local la z boy showroom dealer okin note   the  has a three pin quick disconnect type control that plugs into an extension cord in the side or magazine pocket of the chair that extension cord goes on down to plug into the motor with a five pin connector  the  is not being made anymore but our  okin quick disconnect control will easily replace the  the only real difference besides what it looks like is that the  has a five pin quick disconnect however the  also comes with the extension cable attached that goes down to the motor  all you need to do is to remove the extension cable that is now attached to your chair and replace it with the extension cable that we send with the   you possibly could order the  from the factory they did still have a few but our control is almost one half the cost of the la z boy control and it seems to work better  this explanation may seem complicated but when you get the new control it will all make sense if you still have problems just call or email us and we can help okin note   while not an okin part per se this style transformer was used in many chairs with okin electronics to power the heat and massage functions if present  chairs that had this system almost always had two separate transformers this one for the heatmassage and another to make the chair go up  down  please note to determine whether you need the older style  or the newer style  transformer you need to take a look at the plug coming out from your chair that will plug into the transformer  specifically look to see if it has a small pin in the middle of the plug  if it has a small pin in the middle of that plug you will need the  if it doesnt have that small pin you will need the  okin note   this is the extension cable that goes from the side pocket of the chair down to the control box wiring harness under the chair  it is designed for the   la z boy hand control and has an eight pin female connector on the end that the hand control plugs into and an eight pin male connector that plugs into the control box hubbell motor system complete note hubbell special products discontinued operations in october  so we have a very limited number of component parts  please

hand control and fits pretty much any lift chair that has a hubbell motor it is best to order this if your chair has anything except a  prong connector where the hand control cord attaches to the motor cord you could always �hard wire� the old hand control to the new motor but if the motor is bad the hand control won�t be far behind�  hubbell note   this is the same as the motor above but it is the motor assembly only without the hand control  as long as you have a lift chair with a four prong connector the two outside prongs have a flat side so it can�t be plugged in wrong and the hand control is in good shape then this motor assembly is the one you need  note this model motor wont fit any other application except a lift chair bed motors treadmill motors etc have different mounting that keep this motor from fitting those units  hubbell note   this hand control comes standard with a four prong connector and the two outside prongs have a flat side so it can�t be plugged in wrong  note the four prongs mentioned here refer to the connector not the number of wires dont just see three wires and assume you have a three wire connector most newer motors have a four prong connector but only have three wires attached you will need to unplug the connectors and count the number of prongs to be sure you order the correct control  if you have an older model hand control with a three prong connector and the two outside prongs have a flat side then order the three prong one below  if it is even older and it has any other type connector four prong with flat pins connector with orange terminals or even a six prong square connector etc then you can still use this hand control you will need to �hard wire� it to the motor cord with crimp connectors we have instructions on how to do this in the hubbell section of our troubleshooting tips page  hubbell note   chairs with hubbell motors that have a heatmassage system are sort of rare but there are still a few out there  the connections on this control for the heat and massage are the ones most commonly used but some older chairs will not plug in to these connectors� for those you will have to �hard wire� your heat and the massage wires to the new control  the main connector to the lift chair motor is a four prong connector like  above  hubbell note   before you order either the capacitor or limit switch be sure to read over our troubleshooting tips section for the hubbell motors we hardly ever sell either of these parts so check carefully before you think this might be the problem  these do go bad but rarely�  hubbell note   we now finally have the gear sets in stock for the hubbell motors we used to get them directly from the factory but since it has now closed we had find another source  for anyone who has done tool and die or plastic fabrication work you know that the molds for making the gears are very expensive and two molds had to be made for each set doubling the cost  that extra expense is being passed on to us in each set of gears that is made that is why the cost is so high before you call and ask�  important note as you can see above there is more than one set of gears for hubbell motors even though most all hubbell motors say mc the way you tell the difference is in the number of teeth on the gears  part   is mainly for lift chair motors it has  teeth on the gear pictured on the left the one that goes around the worm screw and  teeth on the smaller inner gear on the one pictured on the right  the other gear sets shown fit most other type hubbell applications beds treadmills dental chairs etc those sets have different numbers of teeth on the inner gear on the one pictured on the right  it is very important that you check the number of teeth on your gears before you order a replacement set because if you order the wrong set and try to install them on your motor we cant take them back  for applications other than lift chairs you may have to replace the gears as that may be your only option to get the motor back running again but for lift chair motors you may want to weigh the cost of a set of gears against the price of a new motor with a six month warranty � the choice is entirely up to you  we have installation instructions for the gear sets under the hubbell section of our  troubleshooting tips page on our website hubbell note   this stroke tube will only fit hubbell motors on lift chairs please dont think that you can make it work if your hubbell motor goes on anything but a lift chair   we have installation instructions for the stroke tube under the hubbell section of our  troubleshooting tips page on our website  contact information telephone             toll free  or  fax toll free  or  postal address medical center supply

is a good choice if you don�t know � or want to know � what the problem with your chair is you just want it fixed the first time or you may just want to update your chair to the latest electronics and head off any problems  either way if you presently have the deltadrive motor on your chair this set should solve the problem okin note  the betadrive set is very common in berkline chairs but other manufacturers have used them from time to time  the decision to replace the complete set is the same as for the deltadrive in note  above  note please be sure that the motor on your chair has a shaft about �� long and has a white moving block  if your motor is all black with a black block this motor will not work� please call for options if you have the black block on your motor okin note   the  motor is a brand new motor direct from the factory and as mentioned in note  above is now the most common okin motor used in lift chairs  there should be a sticker on the side of your motor that says deltadrive if so this is the motor you need okin note   the betadrive motor shown here has a shaft about �� long and has a white moving block  if the motor you have is all black with a black block this motor will not work please call for options if you have the black block on your motor  also the  motor is designed for lift chairs only if you need a motor like this for a power recliner or theater chair please give us a call most of the time theater and recliner chairs use a faster geared motor than a lift chair we have those in stock also although they aren�t listed on the website to reduce confusion i hope� okin note   the  and  hand controls are the most common okin hand controls in use today  the  has a one piece cord that �disappears� down through a hole in the chair and normally plugs in underneath the chair to a short cord off the motor  it has a round plug with a  degree angle that has five pins in a semicircle  the  has a quick disconnect plug that normally unplugs in the side or magazine pocket of the chair  it has a straight plug with five pins in a semicircle and it plugs into another cord that is already in the side pocket of the chair most have a small plastic lever that folds over the plugs to lock them into place  if you have a chair with an okin system and it has a hand control like the one pictured either one of these will work as they are both wired the same  the way to tell which one you need is to just follow the cord from the part you hold in your hand down past the coiled part and see if there is a straight plug a few inches from the coiled part  or does the cord disappear down through a hole in the chair   the  is the newer design and was developed as a way to easily change the hand control without having to turn the chair over  another selling feature is that if you have grandchildren over and they like playing on the chair then you can easily unplug the control so they won�t play with it of course it�s ok with us if you let them play with the chair � grandkids are great for our business� okin note   this is the extension cable only that the  hand control plugs into in the side pocket of the chair and goes on down to plug into the short cord off the motor  normally the only reason to replace this cord is if it has gotten pinched by the chair mechanism okin note   this is a very common hand control used on more expensive la z boy lift chairs  however be sure that your old hand control has a sticker with the number  on the back  note the hand control we ship is made by the same company that makes the controls for la z boy  there are other chair manufacturers that use this same control so to keep the control manufacturer from having to make separate faceplates for each manufacturer their replacement controls have the relaxor name on the front which is the trademark name of the manufacturer of the hand controls that way they can keep their costs down by not having to make controls for each user  the only difference you may notice is that this control lights up all the time like a night light  some people love it some dont but there is no way to cut the light off i have asked for that feature and their engineers are taking it under advisement  nevertheless it has proven to be a great replacement for the original control okin note   this is also a common hand control used on la z boy lift chairs  however be sure that  you have a la z boy chair and  check that your old hand control has a sticker with the number  on the back  la z boy has used controls that look very similar to this control but it has different numbers on the back like  and  please give us a call if you have this type of hand control as the  will not work with those controls okin note   this is the most common okin transformer used on both lift chairs and some power recliners  if your chair has a cord coming out from under the chair that plugs into the transformer with a plug that has a flat blade and a round blade this is the transformer you will need  sometimes transformers have the numbers spa or spb on them if yours has that designation then this  is the one you need  the  power cord below is included with the  transformer when you order it okin note   this is the power cord only for the   transformer above  note don�t order this cord if you don�t also already have a  transformer� many folks that are missing the transformer off their chair usually due to the chair being moved put into storage etc mistakenly think that they only need the power cord to get their chair going again when what they really need is the transformer� the cord coming from the chair with the small flat blade and round blade plugs into the transformer  and then the  transformer plugs into the wall okin note   this transformer is mainly used by berkline and la z boy and also by other smaller manufacturers  it has a female plug on the output side that takes a three pin connector okin note   this transformer is almost always used on berkline chairs and other manufacturers with some type of heat andor massage system  it has a female plug on the output side with a six pin connector okin note   this transformer is for united kingdom use only it will not work for chairs located in the usa  it has battery backup and the receptacle for the plug coming from the chair that has a flat blade and a round blade okin note   this transformer is for european countries only it will not work for chairs located in the usa  it has battery backup and the receptacle for the plug coming from the chair that has a flat blade and a round blade okin note   this transformer is for australia only it will not work for chairs located in the usa  it has battery backup and the receptacle for the plug coming from the chair that has a flat blade and a round blade okin note   this is the cord that goes from the transformer to the motor it has a male plug that has a flat blade and a round blade that goes into the transformer and a female plug on the other end with a receptacle for that same flat blade and round blade okin note   this cord is also like   above in that it goes from the transformer to the motor  however it has a rectifier built into the cord that changes the voltage from ac current to dc current  it is mostly used on chairs with a betadrive motor many of those chairs have an ac transformer it won�t have a battery backup the betadrive motor needs dc current so that is the reason for the rectifier  if you change transformers to the newer  switchable acdc transformer you will not need this type cord � you can use the  above okin note   this is also a cord like the ones above that go from the transformer to the motor but this cord has a three pin male plug that plugs into the transformer and a female plug on the other end that takes a flat blade and a round blade plug from the motor okin note   this is the plastic nut usually either white or yellow in color that is inside the actuator tube where you can�t really see it  the worm screw goes through the middle of the nut and the nut has threads on the outside that the stroke tube screws onto as the motor turns the worm screw the nut rides up and down the worm screw pushing and pulling the stroke tube and making the chair go up and down  important note please check the manufacturer of your motor okin or dewert before ordering this part  the part shown here will only work in an okin motor  it will not fit a dewert motor  installation instructions are listed on the okin section of the  troubleshooting tips page on our website okin note   this is the white plastic moving block about � x � that the chair mounts to on a betadrive system if you have a black block you will need our part   below as the block moves up and down the stationary motor shaft the chair goes up and down  there are primarily two white moving blocks used in the usa the difference is in the thread size in the block where the worm screw goes through the center of the block  the way to tell which you need is to look for the slots in the aluminum shaft one on the top and one on the bottom of the shaft shine a light into the slot and see the black worm screw  using a tape measure or ruler pick out a tread on the worm screw and count how many threads or turns there are to the next inch on the ruler� it will be either  threads our part   or  threads our part   per inch  the  thread per inch size is by far the most common but there are enough  thread blocks in use to make sure that you make the effort to get the right measurement  it is very important that you check the thread size before you order a moving block because if you order the wrong one and try to install it on your motor we cant take it back  installation instructions are listed on the okin section of the  troubleshooting tips page on our website okin note   this black moving block fits an okin betadrive motor used on la z boy chairs  the motor for this block will normally have the notation  on it  please note the replacement part you will receive from us will have a white colored block okin doesnt sell many of these blocks and the last time they did a production run they used white material instead of black  installation instructions are listed on the okin section of the  troubleshooting tips page on our website okin note   this is the stroke tube the metal tube that goes in and out of the motor assembly with a metal connector our part   included  note that the tube has left hand threads it tightens by turning it counterclockwise and loosens by turning it clockwise  this part includes the tube and the connector on the end it does not include the spindle nut  inside the actuator arm okin note   there are the connectors on the end of the stroke tube a clevis pin goes through this piece and the chair lift mechanism to hold that end of the motor on the chair  the metal connector  and the plastic connector  are interchangeable most older deltadrive motors used the plastic connector but if you order a new deltadrive motor it will come with the metal connector  the plastic one is not all bad however if the person using the chair has a tendency to hit the wall with the back of the chair then not knowing it is against the wall keep holding down the hand control  �something has to give� in that situation and sometimes the plastic connector will break saving something worse happening�  it�s not designed to break but sometimes it just works out that way okin note   these are recessed controls that are normally found in power recliners and theater chairs they are built into either the arm of the chair or sofa or under the arm on the side of the chair  there are several different styles of these recessed controls but they all have a round five pin connector on the end of the cord  the  has a rectangular housing and is held on by two screws the screw holes measure   center to center the  has an oval shaped housing and is also held on by two screws  the screw holes measure   center to center the  has a round housing with a diameter of   okin note   a new motor like this is only available from your local la z boy showroom dealer there are no new aftermarket replacements for this motor system  however if your motor assy is not working because of an electrical issue example the transformer only clicks when the button is pushed or the motor is not making any noise or attempt to run we may be able to get this assy repaired for you  we have a repair co that we have been using for many years that can repair most electrical problems with the unit  the repair cost usually runs    you can send it to us with a note letting us know the problem with the unit and we will send it out for repair  repair time normally takes  weeks  if the motor assy is physically broken example the clevis on the back of the motor is broken or the motor sounds like it is running but the stroke tube isnt moving there is no repair available  okin note   this technically is a dewert part not an okin but we show it here because several la z boy chairs use both dewert and okin parts together there are several different motors that have the mcz designation la z boy makes several style chairs that have three mcz motors installed all different  note because of the way la z boy chairs are designed it is very difficult to determine whether the problem with a chair that has a motor not running is because of the motor or the control box wire harness  a new motor like this is only available from your local la z boy showroom dealer there are no new aftermarket replacements for this motor system okin note   the  and  controls were parts that la z boy got from overseas sources  those controls arent available anymore so la z boy found another source the only problem was that to make the new control work with the chairs a kit had to be developed  this kit consists of a new hand control a new control box a new transformer some jumper wires and an instruction booklet  that is why the cost is so much when all you really wanted was a hand control or a control box  normally this takes care of most electrical problems with the chair as when this kit is installed basically all critical parts will be new under the chair except the motors  unfortunately we can no longer order these parts directly from la z boy la z boy has had a price adjustment early in february  on their repair parts basically they tripled their parts prices to their dealers i have been in the service business for over  years and i have never seen a price increase like that you should be able to get this retro kit directly from a local la z boy showroom dealer okin note   the  has a three pin quick disconnect type control that plugs into an extension cord in the side or magazine pocket of the chair that extension cord goes on down to plug into the motor with a five pin connector  the  is not being made anymore but our  okin quick disconnect control will easily replace the  the only real difference besides what it looks like is that the  has a five pin quick disconnect however the  also comes with the extension cable attached that goes down to the motor  all you need to do is to remove the extension cable that is now attached to your chair and replace it with the extension cable that we send with the   you possibly could order the  from the factory they did still have a few but our control is almost one half the cost of the la z boy control and it seems to work better  this explanation may seem complicated but when you get the new control it will all make sense if you still have problems just call or email us and we can help okin note   while not an okin part per se this style transformer was used in many chairs with okin electronics to power the heat and massage functions if present  chairs that had this system almost always had two separate transformers this one for the heatmassage and another to make the chair go up  down  please note to determine whether you need the older style  or the newer style  transformer you need to take a look at the plug coming out from your chair that will plug into the transformer  specifically look to see if it has a small pin in the middle of the plug  if it has a small pin in the middle of that plug you will need the  if it doesnt have that small pin you will need the  okin note   this is the extension cable that goes from the side pocket of the chair down to the control box wiring harness under the chair  it is designed for the   la z boy hand control and has an eight pin female connector on the end that the hand control plugs into and an eight pin male connector that plugs into the control box hubbell motor system

mail shipping hubbell mc stroke tube qty price            information notes on hubbell parts hubbell note   this comes as a set with both the motor and hand control and fits pretty much any lift chair that has a hubbell motor it is best to order this if your chair has anything except a  prong connector where the hand control cord attaches to the motor cord you could always �hard wire� the old hand control to the new motor but if the motor is bad the hand control won�t be far behind�  hubbell note   this is the same as the motor above but it is the motor assembly only without the hand control  as long as you have a lift chair with a four prong connector the two outside prongs have a flat side so it can�t be plugged in wrong and the hand control is in good shape then this motor assembly is the one you need  note this model motor wont fit any other application except a lift chair bed motors treadmill motors etc have different mounting that keep this motor from fitting those units  hubbell note   this hand control comes standard with a four prong connector and the two outside prongs have a flat side so it can�t be plugged in wrong  note the four prongs mentioned here refer to the connector not the number of wires dont just see three wires and assume you have a three wire connector most newer motors have a four prong connector but only have three wires attached you will need to unplug the connectors and count the number of prongs to be sure you order the correct control  if you have an older model hand control with a three prong connector and the two outside prongs have a flat side then order the three prong one below  if it is even older and it has any other type connector four prong with flat pins connector with orange terminals or even a six prong square connector etc then you can still use this hand control you will need to �hard wire� it to the motor cord with crimp connectors we have instructions on how to do this in the hubbell section of our troubleshooting tips page  hubbell note   chairs with hubbell motors that have a heatmassage system are sort of rare but there are still a few out there  the connections on this control for the heat and massage are the ones most commonly used but some older chairs will not plug in to these connectors� for those you will have to �hard wire� your heat and the massage wires to the new control  the main connector to the lift chair motor is a four prong connector like  above  hubbell note   before you order either the capacitor or limit switch be sure to read over our troubleshooting tips section for the hubbell motors we hardly ever sell either of these parts so check carefully before you think this might be the problem  these do go bad but rarely�  hubbell note   we now finally have the gear sets in stock for the hubbell motors we used to get them directly from the factory but since it has now closed we had find another source  for anyone who has done tool and die or plastic fabrication work you know that the molds for making the gears are very expensive and two molds had to be made for each set doubling the cost  that extra expense is being passed on to us in each set of gears that is made that is why the cost is so high before you call and ask�  important note as you can see above there is more than one set of gears for hubbell motors even though most all hubbell motors say mc the way you tell the difference is in the number of teeth on the gears  part   is mainly for lift chair motors it has  teeth on the gear pictured on the left the one that goes around the worm screw and  teeth on the smaller inner gear on the one pictured on the right  the other gear sets shown fit most other type hubbell applications beds treadmills dental chairs etc those sets have different numbers of teeth on the inner gear on the one pictured on the right  it is very important that you check the number of teeth on your gears before you order a replacement set because if you order the wrong set and try to install them on your motor we cant take them back  for applications other than lift chairs you may have to replace the gears as that may be your only option to get the motor back running again but for lift chair motors you may want to weigh the cost of a set of gears against the price of a new motor with a six month warranty � the choice is entirely up to you  we have installation instructions for the gear sets under the hubbell section of our  troubleshooting tips page on our website hubbell note   this stroke tube will only fit hubbell motors on lift chairs please dont think that you can make it work if your hubbell motor goes on anything but a lift chair   we have installation instructions for the stroke tube under the hubbell section of our

comments about this web site hand controls    medical center supply                           shown below are the most common hand controls now in use on lift chairs  the only real way to tell which control you need for your chair is to pay attention to the plug that attaches to the motor or transformer and compare that plug with the illustrations below oddly enough the part you actually hold in your hand is not the most important factor in determining which control you need all basic updown switches pretty much work the same  the key is how it attaches to the other electronics  shipping within the continental usa is included in the prices quoted  we stock these parts in our warehouse for quick shipment  if you have any questions on whether a particular part will fit your needs  please let us know  if you need something not listed either call or email us  either way we will need the chair manufacturer serial  detailed description of part needed etc and we will do the research and get back with you promptly you may have to look on the law tag sewn to the bottom of the footboard for the chair manufacturer and on the frame behind the chair for the serial   need help deciding

shopping cart we can download the order in our accounting system and get the parts shipped out quickly  in fact most online orders sent in by  ct will be shipped out the same day  orders that are called in have to be manually processed and it normally takes an extra day to be input and shipped  while we truly dont mind if you call in with questions etc please dont call in your order expecting to get it quicker that way  one exception  if you need the part overnight and you are willing to pay the shipping expense for express mail or fedex you can all in by pm ct and most orders can be

prongs have a flat side so it can�t be plugged in wrong  note the four prongs mentioned here refer to the connector not the number of wires dont just see three wires and assume you have a three wire connector most newer motors have a four prong connector but only have three wires attached you will need to unplug the connectors and count the number of prongs to be sure you order the correct control  if you have an older model hand control with a three prong round connector and the two outside prongs have a flat side then order the three prong one below  if it is even older and it has any other type connector four prong with flat pins connector with orange terminals or even a six prong square connector etc then you can still use this hand control you will need to �hard wire� it to the motor cord with crimp connectors we have instructions on how to do this in the hubbell section of our troubleshooting tips page note   chairs with hubbell motors that have a heatmassage system are sort of rare but there are still a few out there  the connections on this control for the heat and massage are the ones most commonly used but some older chairs will not plug in to these connectors� for those you will have to �hard wire� your heat and the massage wires to the new control note   this hand control is used with a von weise low volt motor system  the connector on the end of the hand control cord has a small square four prong plug  note the control you will receive will look a little different than the one pictured but will work the same except that the replacement control will not be lighted  the original control pictured is not available any longer neither is any other component of the low volt von weise electronics set but we found a company that could manufacture this replacement hand control note   the  and  hand controls are the most common okin hand controls in use today  the  has a one piece cord that �disappears� down through a hole in the chair and normally plugs in underneath the chair to a short cord off the motor  it has a round plug with a  degree angle that has five pins in a semicircle  the  has a quick disconnect plug that normally unplugs in the side or magazine pocket of the chair  it has a straight plug with five pins in a semicircle and it plugs into another cord that is already in the side pocket of the chair most have a small plastic lever that folds over the plugs to lock them into place  if you have a chair with an okin system and it has a hand control like the one pictured either one of these will work as they are both wired the same  the way to tell which one you need is to just follow the cord from the part you hold in your hand down past the coiled part and see if there is a straight plug a few inches from the coiled part  or does the cord disappear down through a hole in the chair   the  is the newer design and was developed as a way to easily change the hand control without having to turn the chair over  another selling feature is that if you have grandchildren over and they like playing on the chair then you can easily unplug the control so they won�t play with it of course it�s ok with us if you let them play with the chair � grandkids are great for our business� note   this is the extension cable only that the  hand control plugs into in the side pocket of the chair and goes on down to plug into the short cord off the motor  normally the only reason to replace this cord is if it has gotten pinched by the chair mechanism note   this control is for chairs that have a dual motor system one motor controls the up  down motion of the chair the other motor controls the back action  this control has a round five pin plug like the    but has two rows of buttons note   this control looks like our   but it has a round plug with seven pins this is a very rare hand control that we hardly ever sell so be sure that your plug has the seven pin connector before you order note   this is a very common hand control used on more expensive la z boy lift chairs  however be sure that your old hand control has a sticker with the number  on the back  note the hand control we ship is made by the same company that makes the controls for la z boy  there are other chair manufacturers that use this same control so to keep the control manufacturer from having to make separate faceplates for each manufacturer their replacement controls have the relaxor name on the front which is the trademark name of the manufacturer of the hand controls that way they can keep their costs down by not having to make controls for each user  the only difference you may notice is that this control lights up all the time like a night light  some people love it some dont but there is no way to cut the light off i have asked for that feature and their engineers are taking it under advisement  nevertheless it has proven to be a great replacement for the original control note   this is also a common hand control used on la z boy lift chairs  however be sure that  you have a la z boy chair and  check that your old hand control has a sticker with the number  on the back  la z boy has used controls that look very similar to this control but it has different numbers on the back like  and  please give us a call if you have this type of hand control as the  will not work with those controls note   this is just as pictured it is only used on golden chairs designed with an infinite position back  please note that the chair has to be designed for the infinite position function just ordering this control and installing it on a standard chair will not give the chair the infinite position function note   the  and  hand controls are the most common dewert hand controls in use today  the  has a one piece cord that �disappears� down through a hole in the chair and normally plugs in underneath the chair to the motor assembly  it has a round plug with a  degree angle that has five pins in a semicircle  the  has a quick disconnect plug that normally unplugs in the side or magazine pocket of the chair  it has a straight plug with five pins in a semicircle and it plugs into another cord that is already in the side pocket of the chair most have a small plastic lever that folds over the plugs to lock them into place  the  control usually has a white tag around the wire of the hand control close to the plug end that has pn  or pn   the way to tell which one you need is to just follow the cord from the part you hold in your hand down past the coiled part and see if there is a straight plug a few inches from the coiled part  or does the cord disappear down through a hole in the chair   the  is the newer design and was developed as a way to easily change the hand control without having to turn the chair over  another selling feature is that if you have grandchildren over and they like playing on the chair then you can easily unplug the control so they won�t play with it of course it�s ok with us if you let them play with the chair � grandkids are great for our business�  if you want to upgrade to the quick disconnect feature you can simply order the  control and the   extension cable below this will give chairs with the older style one piece cord the convenience of the quick disconnect setup  note if you think you have the   type hand control then please look at note  below to be sure you get the correct version for your chair note   the  is for pride chairs made after november  with okin or fbs electronics  the hand control looks almost identical to the   above except it has a six terminal switch inside to accommodate the okin system  the way to tell the difference between the  and  is as follows  look at either the transformer or the motor if either of these has the word dewert on it then you need the  hand control if it has okin or fbs on either you need the   control   the  control usually has a white tag around the wire of the hand control close to the plug end that has pn  or pn  the  has a white tag that says pn kc note   this is the extension cable only that only the  hand control plugs into in the side pocket of the chair and goes on down to plug into the short cord off the motor  normally the only reason to replace this cord is if it has gotten pinched by the chair mechanism  note this extension cable will only work for chairs that have the dewert electrical system it will not work with chairs that have the okin or fbs or other compatible systems nor will it work for the   hand control above note   the  and qd controls are for chairs with heat and massage systems the controls have a large paddle switch for up  down and below they have two smaller switches red and white for the heat and massage  as with the      controls in note  above the  has a one piece cord that �disappears� down through a hole in the chair and normally plugs in underneath the chair to the motor assembly  it has a round plug with a  degree angle that has five pins in a semicircle  the qd has a quick disconnect plug that normally unplugs in the side or magazine pocket of the chair  it has a straight plug with five pins in a semicircle and it plugs into another cord that is already in the side pocket of the chair most have a small plastic lever that folds over the plugs to lock them into place  the way to tell which one you need is to just follow the cord from the part you hold in your hand down past the coiled part and see if there is a straight plug a few inches from the coiled part qd or does the cord disappear down through a hole in the chair  note   the  and qd controls are for chairs with an infinite control system for the chair back the controls have a large paddle switch for up  down and below they have a smaller white switch  that moves side to side to lay the back down  as with the    controls in note  above the  has a one piece cord that �disappears� down through a hole in the chair and normally plugs in underneath the chair to the motor assembly  it has a round plug with a  degree angle that has five pins in a semicircle  the qd has a quick disconnect plug that normally unplugs in the side or magazine pocket of the chair  it has a straight plug with five pins in a semicircle and it plugs into another cord that is already in the side pocket of the chair most have a small plastic lever that folds over the plugs to lock them into place  the way to tell which one you need is to just follow the cord from the part you hold in your hand down past the coiled part and see if there is a straight plug a few inches from the coiled part qd or does the cord disappear down through a hole in the chair  note   these controls are generally used on only the highend very expensive pride chairs  each has a grey control housing with a black thumb switch for the up  down and below that are four push switches a top red switch for heat and three white switches below that for the massage and intensity  the   has nothing above the black up  down switch while the  has a white infinite button control above the black updown switch just compare the pictures to your control to see which one you have  note if you have the   please call us for options on what parts you will need to get the chair back running again note   please read this note very carefully as this change from pride has caused a great deal of confusion  the control pictured here is is the newest style hand control from pride it is a grey control with push buttons for up  down plus a lock button  it attaches to a control box  which then attaches to an okin transformer and an okin deltadrive motor  however pride has had many production problems with this setup it seems either the hand control was failing or more often the control box it plugged into went bad  they tried several different solutions but finally settled on using a standard okin quick disconnect control our part   and eliminating the control box  what you need to do is to completely remove the control box from the chair first find the control box usually it is mounted behind the chair or underneath the chair toward the rear  if you dont see it just follow either the wire from the hand control or the wire coming from the transformer both plug into wires off the control box  unplug all the wires coming from that box and remove the box from the chair  then you take the cord coming from the transformer toward the chair and plug it in to a short two prong cord off the actuator that nothing is currently plugged into  then you plug the new hand control cord to the other cord coming out of the motor  everything then is plugged directly to the motor which is how all the other major chair manufacturers wire their chairs  with this new configuration the hand control isnt lighted but it is a much simpler setup with much less to go wrong with it  please understand that you wont be getting the grey hand control that is pictured but if you take the  that we send you and you follow the instructions above this should take care of the problem  note   these are recessed controls that are normally found in power recliners and theater chairs they are built into either the arm of the chair or sofa or under the arm on the side of the chair  there are several different styles of these recessed controls but they all have a round five pin connector on the end of the cord  the  has a rectangular housing and is held on by two screws the screw holes measure   center to center the  has an oval shaped housing and is also held on by two screws  the screw holes measure   center to center the  has a round housing with a diameter of   note   the  has a three pin quick disconnect type control that plugs into an extension cord in the side or magazine pocket of the chair that extension cord goes on down to plug into the motor with a five pin connector  the  is not being made anymore but our  okin quick disconnect control will easily replace the  the only real difference besides what it looks like is that the  has a five pin quick disconnect however the  also comes with the extension cable attached that goes down to the motor  all you need to do is to remove the extension cable that is now attached to your chair and replace it with the extension cable that we send with the   you could order the  from the factory they still have a few but our control is almost one half the cost of the la z boy control and it seems to work better  this explanation may seem complicated but when you get the new control it will all make sense if you still have problems just call or email us and we can help note   the  and  controls were parts that la z boy got from overseas sources  those controls arent available anymore so la z boy found another source the only problem was that to make the new control work with the chairs a kit had to be developed  this kit consists of a new hand control a new control box a new transformer some jumper wires and an instruction booklet  that is why the cost is so much when all you really wanted was a hand control or a control box  normally this takes care of most electrical problems with the chair as when this kit is installed basically all critical parts will be new under the chair except the motors  unfortunately we can no longer order these parts directly from la z boy la z boy has had a price adjustment early in february  on their repair parts basically they tripled their parts prices to their dealers i have been in the service business for over  years and i have never seen a price increase like that you should be able to get this retro kit directly from a local la z boy showroom dealer note    the   and qd controls are for chairs with both heat and massage and infinite control systems the control has a large paddle switch for up  down and below they have a smaller white switch  that moves side to side to lay the back down and two smaller switches red and white for the heat and massage  the qd has a  quick disconnect seven pin plug that normally unplugs in the side or magazine pocket of the chair  the  has a long one piece cord with a five pin plug that goes down through a hole in the chair and plugs in to the control box underneath the chair  before you order please look at the plug on the end of your hand control cord and order the control that matches the notes above note   after so long a time we now have these recessed controls in stock these are used on berkline and other manufacturers power recliners and theater chairs  as shown they have a telephone type plug for the recessed control and it plugs into our part  jldp power supply note   this is the newest style hand control sold by golden technologies  it has features such as memory buttons and a button to make the chair go into the tv watching position  please note this hand control cannot be substituted for a standard two button hand control just because you want these features on your chair the chair would need the rest of the electronics designed for this control note   this hand control is manufactured by tranquil ease and is sometimes used with chairs that have an okin or equivalent system  the back of the control will list a model  hlpr on the control  it has a one piece cord with a nine pin screw on connector that looks like what would screw into the back of a computer note   please read this note very carefully as this change from pride has caused a great deal of confusion  this hand control was manufactured by tranquil ease and is sometimes used with chairs that have an okin or equivalent system  this control has been discontinued from the manufacturer and is no longer available  we replace this control with our part   hand control  it has two buttons for up  down but does not have the lockunlock button  please note there were two versions of this hand control  one has the one piece cord with the round plug with five pins the  will be an exact replacement for that version  the other version has a six pin rectangular connector that plugs into a control box under the chair and then there is a cord that comes out of that control box to go to the motor  in that case all you need to do is to eliminate the control box and plug the new hand control directly to the cord from the motor the new hand control does not require the control box to operate note   this is a newer style hand control that golden started using a few years ago when all the lift chair manufacturers started using lighted hand controls  note  if you are not a fan of the lighted control you can use our part   control which is what golden used for many years before they went to this one  as you can see it is a black control with two white buttons it doesnt light up or have the wood grain finish but it is a good bit cheaper than this newer control  we have both in stock so it all comes down to your preference note   this is the extension cable that goes from the side pocket of the chair down to the control box wiring harness under the chair  it is designed for the   la z boy hand control and has an eight pin female connector on the end that the hand control plugs into and an eight pin male connector that plugs into the control box note   this is the new style deluxe heat  massage and infinite hand control with two small buttons on the top of the control for heat seat and heat back  most of these units dont have any markings on the back of the hand control but it is distinguishable in that it has a  pin connector with thumb screws that screw into a control box under the chair note   this hand control was manufactured by tranquil ease and was sometimes used with chairs that have an okin or equivalent system  this control is nearly identical to our part   control but it had a cord with a round quick disconnect plug that plugged into another cord that went down to plug into the control box under the chair  the back of the control will list a model  gt on the control  this control is not being manufactured any longer but you can use the  control and run the  hand control cord down and plug it directly into the control box you will just not have the quick disconnect any longer note   please read this note very carefully as this change from pride has caused a great deal of confusion  please note that there are are two six button hand controls that have been used on pride chairs that look exactly alike but are not interchangeable  there are two ways to tell which hand control you need  look at the serial  on the chair if the serial  is before lxxxxxxx where the small xs could be any number or letters then the  is the correct control  if it is after lxxxxxxx then the part  a will be the correct one   you can also look at the control box that the hand control extension cable plugs into and see what number is on that box if it has cmb on the box then the  will be the correct one if it has any other number on the box then the a will be the correct one  note   there have been several different versions of this hand control some had up  down some had fwd and back but as long as your hand control has this shape and the buttons are in these approximate positions it will be the correct one we always ship the most current version  the hand control has a round plug with eight pins and it plugs into the control box under the chair note   this is prides newest hand control for basic upsown lift chairs  the hand control is slim design with two buttons that light up  it has a round plug with  pins and a straight connector   contact

most common okin electrical setup used in lift chairs today  purchasing this set is a good choice if you don�t know � or want to know � what the problem with your chair is you just want it fixed the first time or you may just want to update your chair to the latest electronics and head off any problems  either way if you presently have the deltadrive motor on your chair this set should solve the problem okin note  the betadrive set is very common in berkline chairs but other manufacturers have used them from time to time  the decision to replace the complete set is the same as for the deltadrive in note  above  note please be sure that the motor on your chair has a shaft about �� long and has a white moving block  if your motor is all black with a black block this motor will not work� please call for options if you have the black block on your motor okin note   the  motor is a brand new motor direct from the factory and as mentioned in note  above is now the most common okin motor used in lift chairs  there should be a sticker on the side of your motor that says deltadrive if so this is the motor you need okin note   the  is the okin motor that pride is using on their newer model chairs  it has proven to be one of the most durable and reliable actuators ever used on lift chairs  it is possible for this motor to go bad but in reality unless you hear the motor running or gears grinding but the actuator is not moving it is very unlikely that this motor is the problem in the chair   the great majority of the time you will find the problem is in the hand control especially if your chair has the  hand control on the pride page on our website okin note   the betadrive motor shown here has a shaft about �� long and has a white moving block  if the motor you have is all black with a black block this motor will not work please call for options if you have the black block on your motor  also the  motor is designed for lift chairs only if you need a motor like this for a power recliner or theater chair please give us a call most of the time theater and recliner chairs use a faster geared motor than a lift chair we have those in stock also although they aren�t listed on the website to reduce confusion i hope� okin note   the  and  hand controls are the most common okin hand controls in use today  the  has a one piece cord that �disappears� down through a hole in the chair and normally plugs in underneath the chair to a short cord off the motor  it has a round plug with a  degree angle that has five pins in a semicircle  the  has a quick disconnect plug that normally unplugs in the side or magazine pocket of the chair  it has a straight plug with five pins in a semicircle and it plugs into another cord that is already in the side pocket of the chair most have a small plastic lever that folds over the plugs to lock them into place  if you have a chair with an okin system and it has a hand control like the one pictured either one of these will work as they are both wired the same  the way to tell which one you need is to just follow the cord from the part you hold in your hand down past the coiled part and see if there is a straight plug a few inches from the coiled part  or does the cord disappear down through a hole in the chair   the  is the newer design and was developed as a way to easily change the hand control without having to turn the chair over  another selling feature is that if you have grandchildren over and they like playing on the chair then you can easily unplug the control so they won�t play with it of course it�s ok with us if you let them play with the chair � grandkids are great for our business� okin note   this is the extension cable only that the  hand control plugs into in the side pocket of the chair and goes on down to plug into the short cord off the motor  normally the only reason to replace this cord is if it has gotten pinched by the chair mechanism okin note   this is a very common hand control used on more expensive la z boy lift chairs  however be sure that  you have a la z boy chair and  check that your old hand control has a sticker with the number  on the back  please give us a call if you have this type of hand control but you don�t have a la z boy chair� we probably have another control that will work but if you don�t have a la z boy chair this control won�t work okin note   this is also a common hand control used on la z boy lift chairs  however be sure that  you have a la z boy chair and  check that your old hand control has a sticker with the number  on the back  la z boy has used controls that look very similar to this control but it has different numbers on the back like  and  please give us a call if you have this type of hand control as the  will not work with those controls okin note   this is the most common okin transformer used on both lift chairs and some power recliners  if your chair has a cord coming out from under the chair that plugs into the transformer with a plug that has a flat blade and a round blade this is the transformer you will need  sometimes transformers have the numbers spa or spb on them if yours has that designation then this  is the one you need  the  power cord below is included with the  transformer when you order it okin note   this is the power cord only for the   transformer above  note don�t order this cord if you don�t also already have a  transformer� many folks that are missing the transformer off their chair usually due to the chair being moved put into storage etc mistakenly think that they only need the power cord to get their chair going again when what they really need is the transformer� the cord coming from the chair with the small flat blade and round blade plugs into the transformer  and then the  transformer plugs into the wall okin note   this transformer is mainly used by berkline and la z boy and also by other smaller manufacturers  it has a female plug on the output side that takes a three pin male connector okin note   this transformer is almost always used on berkline chairs and with other manufacturers with some type of heat andor massage system  it has a female plug on the output side with a six pin connector okin note   this transformer is for united kingdom use only it will not work for chairs located in the usa  it has battery backup and the receptacle for the plug coming from the chair that has a flat blade and a round blade okin note   this transformer is for european countries only it will not work for chairs located in the usa  it has battery backup and the receptacle for the plug coming from the chair that has a flat blade and a round blade okin note   this transformer is for australia only it will not work for chairs located in the usa  it has battery backup and the receptacle for the plug coming from the chair that has a flat blade and a round blade okin note   this is the cord that goes from the transformer to the motor it has a male plug that has a flat blade and a round blade that goes into the transformer and a female plug on the other end with a receptacle for that same flat blade and round blade okin note   this cord is also like   above in that it goes from the transformer to the motor  however it has a rectifier built into the cord that changes the voltage from ac current to dc current  it is mostly used on chairs with a betadrive motor many of those chairs have an ac transformer it won�t have a battery backup the betadrive motor needs dc current so that is the reason for the rectifier  if you change transformers to the newer  switchable acdc transformer you will not need this type cord � you can use the  above okin note   this is also a cord like the ones above that go from the transformer to the motor but this cord has a three pin male plug that plugs into the transformer and a female plug on the other end that takes a flat blade and a round blade plug from the motor okin note   this is the plastic nut usually either white or yellow in color that is inside the actuator tube where you can�t really see it  the worm screw goes through the middle of the nut and the nut has threads on the outside that the stroke tube screws onto as the motor turns the worm screw the nut rides up and down the worm screw pushing and pulling the stroke tube and making the chair go up and down  important note please check the manufacturer of your motor okin or dewert before ordering this part  the part shown here will only work in an okin motor  it will not fit a dewert motor  installation instructions are listed on the okin section of the  troubleshooting tips page on our website okin note   this is the white plastic moving block about � x � that the chair mounts to on a betadrive system if you have a black block you will need our part   below as the block moves up and down the stationary motor shaft the chair goes up and down  there are primarily two white moving blocks used in the usa the difference is in the thread size in the block where the worm screw goes through the center of the block  the way to tell which you need is to look for the slots in the aluminum shaft one on the top and one on the bottom of the shaft shine a light into the slot and see the black worm screw  using a tape measure or ruler pick out a tread on the worm screw and count how many threads or turns there are to the next inch on the ruler� it will be either  threads our part   or  threads our part   per inch  the  thread per inch size is by far the most common but there are enough  thread blocks in use to make sure that you make the effort to get the right measurement  it is very important that you check the thread size before you order a moving block because if you order the wrong one and try to install it on your motor we cant take it back  installation instructions are listed on the okin section of the  troubleshooting tips page on our website okin note   this black moving block fits an okin betadrive motor used on la z boy chairs  the motor for this block will have the notation  on it  installation instructions are listed on the okin section of the  troubleshooting tips page on our website okin note   this is the stroke tube the metal tube that goes in and out of the motor assembly with a metal connector our part   included  note that the tube has left hand threads it tightens by turning it counterclockwise and loosens by turning it clockwise  this part includes the tube and the connector on the end it does not include the spindle nut  inside the actuator arm okin note   there are the connectors on the end of the stroke tube a clevis pin goes through this piece and the chair lift mechanism to hold that end of the motor on the chair  the metal connector  and the plastic connector  are interchangeable most older deltadrive motors used the plastic connector but if you order a new deltadrive motor it will come with the metal connector  the plastic one is not all bad however if the person using the chair has a tendency to hit the wall with the back of the chair then not knowing it is against the wall keep holding down the hand control  �something has to give� in that situation and sometimes the plastic connector will break saving something worse happening�  it�s not designed to break but sometimes it just works out that way okin note   these are recessed controls that are normally found in power recliners and theater chairs they are built into either the arm of the chair or sofa or under the arm on the side of the chair  there are several different styles of these recessed controls but they all have a round five pin connector on the end of the cord  the  has a rectangular housing and is held on by two screws the screw holes measure   center to center the  has an oval shaped housing and is also held on by two screws  the screw holes measure   center to center the  has a round housing with a diameter of   okin note   this deltadrive motor is primarily used in the heavy duty dual motor lift system of goldens pr although it has been found on other manufacturers equipment as well  it looks much like the  deltadrive above but it has only one cord coming off the motor and that cord has a round plug with seven pins  it plugs into the chairs control box okin note   this omegadrive motor is used for the back recline feature primarily on goldens relaxor    series chairs although it has been found on other manufacturers equipment as well   it will have okins part   on a sticker on the motor housing  it has only one cord coming off the motor with a flat pin and a round pin and it plugs into the chairs control box okin note   this omegadrive motor is used for the back recline feature primarily on goldens relaxor    series chairs although it has been found on other manufacturers equipment as well   it will have okins part   on a sticker on the motor housing  it has only one cord coming off the motor with a flat pin and a round pin and it plugs into the chairs control box okin note   this control box is used on several model chairs although mainly found on goldens pr   heavy duty chairs  it is needed to run both the lift motors together okin note   while not an okin part per se this style transformer was used in many chairs with okin electronics to power the heat and massage functions if present  chairs that had this system almost always had two separate transformers this one for the heatmassage and another to make the chair go up  down  please note to determine whether you need the older style  or the newer style  transformer you need to take a look at the plug coming out from your chair that will plug into the transformer  specifically look to see if it has a small pin in the middle of the plug  if it has a small pin in the middle of that plug you will need the  if it doesnt have that small pin you will need the  okin note   this transformer is mainly used in power recliner and power theater chairs  it is very similar to the  transformer above except on the output end the  output connection is integrated into the plastic housing whereas the  has a cord coming from the housing that the flat bladeround blade connector plugs into  the  also does not have an emergency backup system okin note   this is just as pictured it is only used on golden chairs designed with an infinite position back  please note that the chair has to be designed for the infinite position function just ordering this control and installing it on a standard chair will not give the chair the infinite position function okin note   after so long a time we now have these recessed controls in stock these are used on berkline and other manufacturers power recliners and theater chairs  as shown they have a telephone type plug for the recessed control and it plugs into our part  jldp power supply okin note   we  finally  have these power supplies in stock  these are used on berkline and other manufacturers power recliners and theater chairs  as shown they have a telephone type plug for the recessed control our part  jldk and a two pin plug for the actuator  also this part will replace the power supplies on the units with ciar parts even though it doesnt look anything like the ciar units okin note   this actuator normally fits on berkline and other manufacturers power recliners and theater chairs  it has a two pin white connector that plugs into our jldp power supply  also this part will replace the actuator on the units with ciar parts okin note   this is a heavy duty transformer used by a few of the chair manufacturers  it has a female five pin plug although many times the manufacturers use a three pin plug from the chair to the transformer okin note   this deltadrive motor is mainly used as the main updown motor on goldens dual motor chairs although other manufacturers have used it from time to time  the motor will have either three cords coming out of the housing or it will have two cords and another small two prong socket built into the top of the motor housing  usually it will have either the numbers  or a  number

order  hand control click here for control     information notes on switches note   the swsse is the most commonly used switch on pride lift chairs  the switch has three terminals that normally come out to the side of the switch although some other manufacturers bend them down and the mounting tabs on the switch housing the ones that the screws go through are even with the top of the switch housing  note before you order the switch please follow the testing steps on our troubleshooting tips page to see if the switch is the problem and not the wiring in the hand control  the wiring in the control oftentimes shorts out and the symptoms are identical to having a bad switch  please also remember that if a switch is installed even for a few seconds we cant take it back as the switch terminals will have been scratched up it has been used and no one wants to buy a used part note   the sws is only used on fairly old lift chairs it hasnt been used on a chair that i know of since the mid s  it has also never been used on a pride lift chair  if you have a pride lift chair with a switch like this then it will be the swsse above  the switch has three terminals that normally come out to the bottom of the switch  and the mounting tabs on the switch housing the ones that the screws go through are indented down about  of an inch from top of the switch housing this is to make it sit higher in the switch housing and is the main difference between this and the swsse above   note before you order the switch please follow the testing steps on our troubleshooting tips page to see if the switch is the problem and not the wiring in the hand control  the wiring in the control oftentimes shorts out and the symptoms are identical to having a bad switch  please also remember that if a switch is installed even for a few seconds we cant take it back as as the switch terminals will have been scratched up it has been used and no one wants to buy a used part note   this is a rocker switch as opposed to the paddle switches above and hasnt been used in lift chairs for several years now  it comes with three terminals that are designed for solder connections some manufacturers use this switch with push on connectors and with a little ingenuity you could make that work although if you have a solder gun it would be very easy to just cut the connectors off and solder the wires to the terminals  as far as i know this is the only rocker switch available for any model of lift chair  if you have a question as to whether this one will work you can always order the complete hand control we show on the hubbell page on our website and hard wire the plug to your motor  please also remember that if a switch is installed even for a few seconds we cant take it back as as the switch terminals will have been scratched up it has been used and no one wants to buy a used part note   this a black switch with five gold terminals that pushes onto a circuit board inside the switch housing  we used to get these switches from hubbell but since they went bankrupt a few years ago we havent found another source for them  your only real option is to just order the complete hand control we show on the hubbell page on our website  many of the controls that have these switches already have a four prong connector where it attaches to the motor you you can just order the  four prong control a few older units have the three prong connector we show below that one on the hubbell page  any older that that you will need to hard wire the control to your motor   contact

mail shipping hubbell mc stroke tube qty price             information notes on hubbell parts hubbell note   this comes as a set with both the motor and hand control and fits pretty much any lift chair that has a hubbell motor it is best to order this if your chair has anything except a  prong connector where the hand control cord attaches to the motor cord you could always �hard wire� the old hand control to the new motor but if the motor is bad the hand control won�t be far behind�  hubbell note   this is the same as the motor above but it is the motor assembly only without the hand control  as long as you have a lift chair with a four prong connector the two outside prongs have a flat side so it can�t be plugged in wrong and the hand control is in good shape then this motor assembly is the one you need  note this model motor wont fit any other application except a lift chair bed motors treadmill motors etc have different mounting that keep this motor from fitting those units  hubbell note   this hand control comes standard with a four prong connector and the two outside prongs have a flat side so it can�t be plugged in wrong  note the four prongs mentioned here refer to the connector not the number of wires dont just see three wires and assume you have a three wire connector most newer motors have a four prong connector but only have three wires attached you will need to unplug the connectors and count the number of prongs to be sure you order the correct control  if you have an older model hand control with a three prong connector and the two outside prongs have a flat side then order the three prong one below  if it is even older and it has any other type connector four prong with flat pins connector with orange terminals or even a six prong square connector etc then you can still use this hand control you will need to �hard wire� it to the motor cord with crimp connectors we have instructions on how to do this in the hubbell section of our troubleshooting tips page  hubbell note   chairs with hubbell motors that have a heatmassage system are sort of rare but there are still a few out there  the connections on this control for the heat and massage are the ones most commonly used but some older chairs will not plug in to these connectors� for those you will have to �hard wire� your heat and the massage wires to the new control  the main connector to the lift chair motor is a four prong connector like  above hubbell note   before you order either the capacitor or limit switch be sure to read over our troubleshooting tips section for the hubbell motors we hardly ever sell either of these parts so check carefully before you think this might be the problem  these do go bad but rarely�  hubbell note   we now finally have the gear sets in stock for the hubbell motors we used to get them directly from the factory but since it has now closed we had find another source  for anyone who has done tool and die or plastic fabrication work you know that the molds for making the gears are very expensive and two molds had to be made for each set doubling the cost  that extra expense is being passed on to us in each set of gears that is made that is why the cost is so high before you call and ask�  important note as you can see above there is more than one set of gears for hubbell motors even though most all hubbell motors say mc the way you tell the difference is in the number of teeth on the gears  part   is mainly for lift chair motors it has  teeth on the gear pictured on the left the one that goes around the worm screw and  teeth on the smaller inner gear on the one pictured on the right  the other gear sets shown fit most other type hubbell applications beds treadmills dental chairs etc those sets have different numbers of teeth on the inner gear on the one pictured on the right  it is very important that you check the number of teeth on your gears before you order a replacement set because if you order the wrong set and try to install them on your motor we cant take them back  for applications other than lift chairs you may have to replace the gears as that may be your only option to get the motor back running again but for lift chair motors you may want to weigh the cost of a set of gears against the price of a new motor with a six month warranty � the choice is entirely up to you  we have installation instructions for the gear sets under the hubbell section of our  troubleshooting tips page on our website hubbell note   this stroke tube will only fit hubbell motors on lift chairs please dont think that you can make it work if your hubbell motor goes on anything but a lift chair   we have installation instructions for the stroke tube under the hubbell section of our
