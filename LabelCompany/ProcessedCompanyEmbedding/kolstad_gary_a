executive officer of carbo ceramics inc mr kolstad please go ahead gary a kolstad  carbo ceramics inc thank you and id like to welcome everyone to our first quarter  earnings call this morning ill review our business in the first quarter followed by a brief review of our financials and then an update on the outlook for our business before turning it over for questions we are pleased with the  sequential increase in revenue experienced in the first quarter of  this revenue increase is a result of our previously outlined strategy of developing higher growth opportunities which we believe will result in strong doubledigit revenue growth for carbo in  the exceptional strengths we have in technology experienced people and manufacturing assets support the execution of this strategy the increase in technology product sales in this challenging environment highlights the value of our technology platform technology product revenues increased sequentially led by sales of kryptosphere and our production assurance products including scaleguard industrial products and environmental revenue also grew sequentially industrial product revenue growth was driven by new client gains environmental revenue growth was driven primarily by increased rig activity and new client gains our frac sand revenues grew sequentially as a result of ramping up plant production and utilizing third party suppliers frac sand sales provide multiple benefits including producing positive cash generating revenue from idle railcars under lease and increasing client contact which increases sales opportunities for other products we successfully completed plant trials producing products other than base ceramic proppant executing on our strategy of utilizing our idled plant assets the success of these trials should lead to revenue generation we continue to develop opportunities with other companies in the industrial agricultural and oil and gas industries our cash burn was approximately  million in the first quarter of which approximately  million was associated with cash outlays that we do not expect to repeat in  including but not limited to railcar activation costs refinancing costs a debt amortization payment and certain property taxes we ended the quarter with  million in cash of which approximately  million is restricted cash associated with the lcs we have in place today we expect to see a reduction in our cash burn in the second quarter and anticipate continued improvement throughout the year targeting cash neutral operations on a  exit rate basis in addition we anticipate receiving approximately  million from our recent right  refinancing once postclosing administrative items are completed during the second quarter of  now turning to a brief overview of our first quarter financial results the revenues in the first quarter increased  compared to the same period in  the increase was primarily attributed to an increase in the technology product sales an increase in frac sand sales and an increase in environmental product sales these increases were partially offset by decreases in base ceramic proppant sales operating loss for the first quarter was  million as compared to  million in the same period of last year primarily due to the lack of severance charges in the first quarter of this year compared to last year our outlook we have set out a strategy for both revenue growth and profitability improvement our people are excited about our growth opportunities and are executing on them we expect to see continued expansion of our technology products industrial ceramic media frac sand and environmental businesses given the first quarter revenue and our outlook for the next couple of quarters we believe our  revenue will show strong doubledigit growth of at least  increase over  clients are adopting technologies that we have developed over the past several years to enhance their oil and gas production kryptosphere hd continues its adoption in the industry as the technology of choice for the toughest well conditions in the world kryptosphere ld sales have increased in recent quarters as certain clients are implementing technology into their completions to make better wells we believe sales of these technologies will continue to grow in  and currently expect another kryptosphere hd job in the second quarter we continue to grow our industrial footprint with our longstanding product offerings we also believe therere opportunities in the future to expand our product offerings to add additional revenue streams we anticipate increased levels of industrial sales throughout  we know that for many investors that this is a new market to understand as it is outside of our traditional oil and gas market therefore id like to spend some time to lay out the industrial opportunity we believe is in front of us and why we believe we will see increased levels in industrial sales for the foreseeable future although there are many end markets within the industrial market space ill only comment on three of them today we are focusing on the foundry the grinding and the mineral processing industrial market segments we like them because they are very large they are less cyclical than the oilfield and they fit our technology people and asset base very well the market size of these three segments is large and we estimate it at plus billion the addressable market that our existing product portfolio and manufacturing plant assets can target is estimated at about  of this or approximately  million so its a big opportunity that we are targeting this is why we believe we can grow the industrial business within our company at doubledigit rates for the foreseeable future the two businesses we are focused on to capture these opportunities are ceramic media and mineral processing for both of these businesses we have added personnel resources and set objectives on the ceramic media side were also expanding our product portfolio on the mineral processing side were entering into agreements with other companies to produce products for them in fact just this week we started producing a product for the agricultural industry there is also a tailwind that should make the foundry market a much bigger opportunity for us osha enacted regulations similar as they had previously enacted for the oilfield on reducing the permissible exposure limit or pel that goes into effect in the mid for foundries one way to comply with this regulation and improve recycle rates and quality of end product is to use ceramic media versus silicon media another area we think well have nice growth for us is the frac sand business and as part of our strategy return our overall operations to generating positive ebitda we are in the process of bringing our marshfield wisconsin sand facility to full utilization in the next one or two quarters to further increase our cash production and generate revenue from idle railcars under lease we continue to see growth in our environmental business with an increase in industry activity and market penetration of our products similar to our oilfield business we are executing on a strategy to expand product sales into industrial markets our strategy is to reduce our reliance on base ceramic proppant yet remain the industry leader we believe the worst of this industry down cycle is behind us while imports of low quality chinese ceramic have been virtually zero over the last eight quarters it appears some competitors are still pricing below cost however this is not a sustainable strategy over the long term given the successful industrial and mineral processing trials we completed at our plants in the first quarter of  we expect to generate revenue from our underutilized plants starting in q our dual approach of producing products for other companies and developing technology products for ourselves should bring opportunities to produce positive cash flow from assets that currently consume cash we are pleased with the progress weve made on our strategy to diversify and grow our revenue streams while this is not an overnight process we believe the resulting business composition will make carbo a stronger company and with that ill turn it over to questions questionandanswer session operator our first question comes from blake hutchinson of howard weil please go ahead blake hutchinson  scotia howard weil good morning guys gary a kolstad  carbo ceramics inc good morning blake hutchinson  scotia howard weil gary i think at the end of your preamble there you kind of laid out a goal to remain the leader in kind of the base ceramic proppant market but i guess as we look at the numbers in the interim a nice shootup in average pricing indicating the high level of content towards technologicallybased products and i dont think looking at the q that youve built much in terms of base ceramic inventory or it wouldnt look like it is there kind of a near or intermediate term very purposeful withholding of base ceramic proppant going on given current pricing levels gary a kolstad  carbo ceramics inc yeah thats more of a cash management issue quite honestly we think the second half and our clients are indicating to us might have higher levels of base ceramic consumption so we did that in the first quarter the second quarter or towards the end of the second quarter that might change for us a little bit just because we are seeing some signs that the second half will be higher than that but its really kind of cash management there and try and use inventory blake hutchinson  scotia howard weil so you want to do more of a justintime buildout if indeed the opportunity presents itself gary a kolstad  carbo ceramics inc yeah exactly blake hutchinson  scotia howard weil okay and then your reference to the plant trials i guess in industrial product i guess was that a more internal proveittoyourself type of operation or is this a demonstration done for kind of real commercial current opportunities gary a kolstad  carbo ceramics inc both but primarily the latter so we had to show our new clients lets say that we could produce the product for them and this is kind of exciting because it was kind of a drag to have these plants idle and its now fun to watch our organization and our people start to go find ideas and talk to people and like i said i think were starting this week or next week to produce an agricultural product so were excited about that we will do some products for ourselves our marketing and sales team is out there looking weve added personnel that are experienced in that arena and we have pending commitments with other companies to produce products for them and so were working it so you really didnt see the benefit of that in q at all i think we will start to see as i mentioned some revenue in q and i think that we will continue to grow that from now till forever blake hutchinson  scotia howard weil and is that – go ahead gary sorry gary a kolstad  carbo ceramics inc when you think about it – i mean if you can get plants working its a tremendous cost change for us right because if a plant is idle it still costs you money i mean you have certain expenditures there that dont go away but if we can get a plant or a line producing positive cash thats quite a turnaround for us just like the railcars will be a turnaround for us as the year progresses so when things start to produce cash instead of consume cash its a great thing but its exciting for me too our organization is excited about it and like i said we have several conversations with several companies some in oilfield like i said some in agriculture and some in industrial so were just at those days right now where were really starting to try and capture the opportunities blake hutchinson  scotia howard weil and i want to make sure were thinking about the opportunity set and the timing of it correctly i mean i think at the outset of this endeavor you talked about maybe it being till the yearend  or something like that and kind of binary where we might see a big result then but not much in between is this kind of a bit of an about face where maybe we can start kind of modeling in just a more gradual brightening of the process or is there still a bigger balloon out there towards the end in your opinion gary a kolstad  carbo ceramics inc well our style is not to get too carried away ahead of time right but we are – this is the first time we told you were actually producing something there in the second quarter that will generate revenue so i think a gentle upslope during  is probably the way to go and yeah plants should produce x amount of money each month right i remember back in the heyday what our toomsboro plant would produce per line now we dont expect to be at that back in the heyday but there is a lot of plants sitting around the us that produce industrial products or mineral processing for other people so we expect to join in that and theyre wonderful assets right and by the way the plants are agnostic as to what they do they dont care so i am excited about that and weve got our organization excited about it blake hutchinson  scotia howard weil great appreciate the time ill turn it back gary a kolstad  carbo ceramics inc you bet operator our next question comes from john watson of simmons please go ahead pardon me it looks like our next question is from bill dezellem of tieton capital management please go ahead sir william joseph dezellem  tieton capital management llc thank you a group of questions first of all how many different firms have tried the quantum product gary a kolstad  carbo ceramics inc lets see i think weve had three different clients try it and some upcoming jobs that will take place this year william joseph dezellem  tieton capital management llc and have any of those three done a second test after their first test gary a kolstad  carbo ceramics inc its going to happen weve been very – kept very tight control on this because were still proving out the test and the parameters and all that so we really – its a very slow steady planning progress for us but yeah well have a repeat i think later this year but its still – were really in testing mode on this not – weve seen incredible results in my opinion its amazing what were seeing and i think wed mentioned on previous calls our job now – i have complete confidence in the technology and i think so does our team and our clients that weve worked for what we need to do now is lower the cost of it and were working on that and allow it to become more mainstream lets say but its just amazing to me what were seeing and it confirms what a lot of us have thought over the years what happens to fracs to downhole william joseph dezellem  tieton capital management llc thats helpful i appreciate that gary and then in addition id like you to expand if you would on your comments that you have customers that have told you that theyre going to be expanding their ceramic consumption in the second half gary a kolstad  carbo ceramics inc well there is some places i think where clients have proven i think we might have said this in the q earnings release where some clients had used in real highstress area sand and it didnt work out and we dont mention their names or anything so there is demand in areas where the stress is just too great i think youre also seeing some clients go back to work that historically havent took a time out during this down cycle so some of them are new names in the past year and the thing about whats happening now given the size of things and there is another interesting thing thats happened in the industry is that given the growth in the frenetic pace of things and the new hires were seeing a lot of operational delays and it could be from downhole tools it could be to frac equipment it could be to various things but some of these wells which are large jobs for us – i mean weve seen wells that take six weeks two months to complete so thats why we have some stuff – actually i probably should say some but its q but were kind of say no we have to talk about that and move it out to q because we just see a lot of delays and a lot of operational problems in the industry right now which delays the usage but were confident about some things that clients have told us but were trying to kind of say that should be look over the next two quarters instead of put it in the second quarter william joseph dezellem  tieton capital management llc thank you and then i want to continue kind of on that path have you seen any refracs taking place the sand was initially used and has crushed and then as the pressures have increased downhole and then theyve come back and refracked and used a portion or a higher proportion of ceramics and if so can you talk about your experiences in that gary a kolstad  carbo ceramics inc what youve talked about is an historical thing that absolutely used to happen but with todays economics or perceived economics by ep operators and the mania to go as cheap as we can and all that stuff we dont see it in the current cycle if oil prices come up youd probably see it again but yeah thats a very – weve seen that pattern over cycles in the past but today i mean its lowest cost wins william joseph dezellem  tieton capital management llc and so gary today it is normal to not have a refrac taking place with ceramic just because of where were at in the cycle gary a kolstad  carbo ceramics inc yeah and theres not a lot of refracking going on right i mean that topic usually raises its head during down cycles and everybody thinks its going to be the savior and ive been through this so many times in my life at my former employer or where im at today this is always the topic that comes up during down cycles and the reality is its very few wells its certainly in the low singledigits william joseph dezellem  tieton capital management llc thank you and i do have one additional question the permian and the scoop what is the pressure tendencies in those areas meaning are they able to comfortably start with sand or are they pushing the envelope using the sand versus other basins gary a kolstad  carbo ceramics inc well we of course would encourage anything above  psi closure stress i mean we all know its going to crush – sand is going to crush but yeah the scoopstack or western oklahoma you are seeing more ceramic than you would in the permian but a lot of these are driven by where we – there has been a movement to whats happening in  months versus whats happening over the life of the well and there is no use fighting that i mean well still continue on with our religion of conductivity and worrying about eurs but at the same time we are going to expand other businesses in carbo to deal with the reality of oil price what it is and a focus of  months what it is and all that stuff but yeah there is a lot of wells as i always say there is  of the wells in the us will have closure stress above  psi the point at which the best white sand crushes – starts crushing william joseph dezellem  tieton capital management llc thanks for allowing all the questions gary a kolstad  carbo ceramics inc you bet operator our next question will now come from john watson of simmons please go ahead sir john watson  simmons  company international good morning guys gary a kolstad  carbo ceramics inc good morning ernesto bautista iii  carbo ceramics inc hi john john watson  simmons  company international a quick one on marshfield gary if im doing my math right stated nameplate is close to  million pounds a quarter can you say how close to full utilization you were in q gary a kolstad  carbo ceramics inc in q not very much no i cant remember what our output was there ernesto bautista iii  carbo ceramics inc yeah john i think we had mentioned in the past that we – and in our materials today that our intention was really to ramp that up we had exited the year with one crew at the plant one shift and were continuing to work that up toward full capacity gary a kolstad  carbo ceramics inc yeah and weve proved before too that even though the nameplate was  tons or  million tons that we can exceed that john watson  simmons  company international right and related to that are you considering expanding that plant once you reach full utilization is that a thought yet gary a kolstad  carbo ceramics inc i think we have other opportunities with other producers and that makes more sense for us instead of putting capital into an expansion john watson  simmons  company international okay makes sense and thanks for the revenue guidance that implies about  million of incremental revenues yearoveryear at the low end could you quantify how much of that increase you would expect to come from base ceramic versus sand versus other gary a kolstad  carbo ceramics inc it will come from – just remember in q of last year base ceramic was still pretty high better pricing all that stuff so no its going to come from the technology products – the ceramic technology products its going to come from oilfield sand its going to come from the environmental business they are all doing great and the industrial ceramic is gaining speed all of them saw yearonyear gains so thats where its going to come from and then whatever we can do in mineral processing is more  so no that – itll all be driven by the other businesses heres what makes me really happy about this year so last year at this time in q base ceramic was  of our business lets say and this year its something over  and yet we grew the company business  yearonyear so id tell you i really like what our team has done i like the direction were going and once again we kind of expect base ceramic to be better in the second half too but were putting our foot on the gas on everything else and that helps reduce our reliance and helps us with this crazy cyclicality and economic stress and all that stuff so im very proud of everybody in carbo for what theyve done that is an amazing turnaround in one year john watson  simmons  company international yeah it is and one quick one for you ernesto i know its contingent on earnings but if cash outlay was  million during q and  million is transitory then is  million in cash burn the right number for q or will it be lower than that and im excluding the  million ernesto bautista iii  carbo ceramics inc yeah john i think youre hitting the nail on the head we would probably guide to something mid to low teens with respect to cash burn going into q that improving in the second half of the year obviously we have a continued goal of getting to sort of a breakeven level as we exit or even positive as we exit the year so i think that that is correct and just to emphasize a couple of things obviously we have other cash that isnt reflected on the balance sheet currently there will be an infusion upon the completion of the postclosing conditions with respect to the refinancing transaction thats another  million that will come on the balance sheet and then obviously weve got opportunities to as weve discussed in the past monetize other assets at this point something that may be more of an opportunity here in the shorter term is potential to maybe monetize some of our international assets we did engage a firm to help us survey the market interestingly enough there is an interest level in the market for some of our international assets so i think well review that internally and determine exactly how we want to proceed but obviously if there is a good opportunity to monetize that then well take that into serious consideration john watson  simmons  company international perfect and one last one for me gary on the eagle ford well that you mentioned in the press release was carboair pumped on a standalone basis or was that in tandem with sand gary a kolstad  carbo ceramics inc i think that that will lead in with sands ernesto bautista iii  carbo ceramics inc yeah john watson  simmons  company international okay great well thank you all for the time i appreciate it ernesto bautista iii  carbo ceramics inc take care john thanks operator at this time there appear to be no more questions mr kolstad ill turn the call back to you for any closing remarks gary a kolstad  carbo ceramics inc okay thank you once again for joining us this morning i want to summarize a few key points we started  with another quarter of progress as we execute on that strategy to return the business to generating positive cash as we exit  we currently believe well see strong doubledigit revenue growth of at least  compared to  which would be led by our ceramic technology products industrial ceramic media frac sand and environmental businesses we will reduce cash burn in q and while the down cycle has been extremely challenging were very confident in our technology products and people and executing the strategy weve laid out and i think that makes us a stronger company moving forward so we look forward to seeing
