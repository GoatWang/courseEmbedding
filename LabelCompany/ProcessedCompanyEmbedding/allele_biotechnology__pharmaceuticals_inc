fiscal year  allele biotechnology and pharmaceuticals inc key developments allele biotechnology  pharmaceuticals plans to form a cell banking business for personalized medicine appoints mahendra rao and joseph paulauskis as the first members of its scientific advisory board for ipsc banking and cgmp production oct   allele biotechnology  pharmaceuticals inc announced plans to form a commercial business for the banking of human induced pluripotent stem cells ipscs by private individuals human ipscs are cells that can be grown to virtually infinite numbers and can become any cell in the human body features which hold great promise for therapies that can alleviate or cure human disease allele’s business model recognizes that an individual can have their own cells ready for future therapeutic use via the generation and storage of ipscs from that individual’s skin cells while this is similar to what is done with newborn cord blood ipscs can be generated from humans of any age the banking of human ipscs for potential future therapeutic use is a relatively new industry with unprecedented potential and allele is benefitting from expert opinions internally and from current and future sab members ensuring a solid scientific and ethical foundation for this business in addition to serving its customers allele’s ipsc bank will be an unparalleled resource for biomedical research proper consent and privacy guardianship will allow thousands of ipsc lines with accompanying sequence database and health information to be made available from the bank to scientists and clinicians currently ipsc banks are funded by government agencies at multimillion dollar costs per project allele’s model does not rely on tax dollars and provides potentially a larger bank of ipscs of higher quality to aid research and treatment efforts the company announced drs mahendra rao and joseph paulauskis as the first members of its scientific advisory board sab for ipsc banking and cgmp
