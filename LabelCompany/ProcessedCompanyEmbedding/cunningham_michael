cunninghamoct   continue reading the main story share this page continue reading the main story as the author of “las horas” “die stunden” and “de uren” — ostensibly the spanish german and dutch translations of my book “the hours but actually unique works in their own right — i’ve come to understand that all literature is a product of translation that is translation is not merely a job assigned to a translator expert in a foreign language but a long complex and even profound series of transformations that involve the writer and reader as well “translation” as a human act is like so many human acts a far more complicated proposition than it may initially seem to belet’s take as an example one of the most famous lines in literature “call me ishmael” that as i suspect you know is the opening sentence of herman melville’s “mobydick” we still recognize that line after more than  yearsstill “call me ishmael” three simple words what’s the big dealfor one thing they possess that most fundamental but elusive of all writerly qualities authority as writers we must from our very opening sentence speak with authority to our readersit’s a little like waltzing with a new partner for the first time anyone who is able to waltz or foxtrot or tango or perform any sort of dance that requires physical contact with a responsive partner knows that there is a first moment on the dance floor when you assess automatically whether the new partner in question can dance at all — and if he or she can in fact dance how well you know almost instantly whether you have a novice on your hands and that if you do you’ll have to do a fair amount of work just to keep things moving advertisement continue reading the main story authority is a rather mysterious quality and it’s almost impossible to parse it for its components the translator’s first task then is to rerender a certain forcefulness that can’t quite be described or explained continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story although the words “call me ishmael” have force and confidence force and confidence alone aren’t enough “idiot read this” has force and confidence too but is less likely to produce the desired effect what else do melville’s words possess that “idiot read this” lackthey have music here’s where the job of translation gets more difficult language in fiction is made up of equal parts meaning and music the sentences should have rhythm and cadence they should engage and delight the inner ear ideally a sentence read aloud in a foreign language should still sound like something even if the listener has no idea what it is he or she is being toldlet’s try to forget that the words “call me ishmael” mean anything and think about how they soundlisten to the vowel sounds ah ee soft i aa four of them each different and each a soft soothing note listen too to the way the line is bracketed by consonants we open with the hard c hit the l at the end of “call” and then in a lovely act of symmetry hit the l at the end of “ishmael” “call me arthur” or “call me bob” are adequate but not for musical reasons as satisfyingmost readers of course wouldn’t be able to tell you that they respond to those three words because they are soothing and symmetrical but most readers register the fact unconsciously you could probably say that meaning is the force we employ and music is the seduction it is the translator’s job to reproduce the force as well as the music“chiamami ismaele”that is the italian version of melville’s line and the translator has done a nice job i can tell you as a reader who doesn’t speak italian that those two words do in fact sound like something independent of their meaning although different from the english we have a new equally lovely progression of vowel sounds — eea ah ee a ee — and those three m’s nicely spacedif you’re translating “mobydick” that’s one sentence down approximately a million more to go advertisement continue reading the main story i encourage the translators of my books to take as much license as they feel that they need this is not quite the heroic gesture it might seem because i’ve learned from working with translators over the years that the original novel is in a way a translation itself it is not of course translated into another language but it is a translation from the images in the author’s mind to that which he is able to put down on paperhere’s a secret many novelists if they are pressed and if they are being honest will admit that the finished book is a rather rough translation of the book they’d intended to write it’s one of the heartbreaks of writing fiction you have for months or years been walking around with the idea of a novel in your mind and in your mind it’s transcendent it’s brilliantly comic and howlingly tragic it contains everything you know and everything you can imagine about human life on the planet earth it is vast and mysterious and aweinspiring it is a cathedral made of firebut even if the book in question turns out fairly well it’s never the book that you’d hoped to write it’s smaller than the book you’d hoped to write it is an object a collection of sentences and it does not remotely resemble a cathedral made of fireit feels in short like a rather inept translation of a mythical great workthe translator then is simply moving the book another step along the translation continuum the translator is translating a translationa translator is also translating a work in progress one that has a beginning middle and end but is not exactly finished even though it’s being published a novel any novel if it’s any good is not only a slightly disappointing translation of the novelist’s grandest intentions it is also the most finished draft he could come up with before he collapsed from exhaustion it’s all i can do not to go from bookstore to bookstore with a pen grabbing my books from the shelves crossing out certain lines i’ve come to regret and inserting better ones for many of us there is not what you could call a “definitive text”this brings us to the question of the relationship between writers and their readers where another act of translation occurs photo credit ji lee i teach writing and one of the first questions i ask my students every semester is who are you writing for the answer  times out of  is that they write for themselves i tell them that i understand — that i go home every night make an elaborate cake and eat it all by myself by which i mean that cakes and books are meant to be presented to others and further that books unlike cakes are deep elaborate interactions between writers and readers albeit separated by time and spacei remind them as well that no one wants to read their stories there are a lot of other stories out there and by now in the st century there’s been such an accumulation of literature that few of us will live long enough to read all the great stories and novels never mind the pretty good ones not to mention the fact that we as readers are busy advertisement continue reading the main story we have large and difficult lives we have variously jobs to do spouses and children to attend to errands to run friends to see we need to keep up with current events we have gophers in our gardens we are taking extension courses in french or wine tasting or art appreciation we are looking for evidence that our lovers are cheating on us we are wondering why in the world we agreed to have  people over on saturday night we are worried about money and global warming we are tivoing

saying essentially is this make room in all that for this stop what you’re doing and read this it had better be apparent from the opening line that we’re offering readers something worth their whilei should admit that when i was as young as my students are now i too thought of myself as writing either for myself for some ghostly ideal reader or at my most grandiose moments for future generations my work suffered as a resultit wasn’t until some years ago when i was working in a restaurant bar in laguna beach calif that i discovered a better method one of the hostesses was a woman named helen who was in her mids at the time and so seemed to me to be just slightly younger than the ancient mariner helen was a lovely generous woman who had four children and who had been left abruptly and without warning by her husband she had to work and work and work she worked in a bakery in the early mornings typed manuscripts for writers in the afternoons and seated diners at the restaurant nightshelen was an avid reader and her great joy at the end of her long hard days was to get into bed and read for an hour before she caught the short interlude of sleep that was granted her she read widely and voraciously she was when we met reading a trashy murder mystery and i as only the young and pretentious might do suggested that she try dostoyevsky’s “crime and punishment” since she liked detective stories she read it in less than a week when she had finished it she told me “that was wonderful”“thought you’d like it” i answeredshe added “dostoyevsky is much better than ken follett”“yep”then she paused “but he’s not as good as scott turow”although i didn’t necessarily agree with her about dostoyevsky versus turow i did like very much that helen had no schoolinspired sense of what she was supposed to enjoy more and what less she simply needed what any good reader needs absorption emotion momentum and the sense of being transported from the world in which she lived and transplanted into another onei began to think of myself as trying to write a book that would matter to helen and i have to tell you it changed my writing i’d seen rather suddenly that writing is not only an exercise in selfexpression it is also more important a gift we as writers are trying to give to readers writing a book for helen or for someone like helen is a manageable goalit also helped me to realize that the reader represents the final step in a book’s life of translation advertisement continue reading the main story one of the more remarkable aspects of writing and publishing is that no two readers ever read the same book we will all feel differently about a movie or a play or a painting or a song but we have all undeniably seen or heard the same movie play painting or song they are physical entities a painting by velázquez is purely and simply itself as is “blue” by joni mitchell if you walk into the appropriate gallery in the prado museum or if someone puts a joni mitchell disc on you will see the painting or hear the music you have no choicewriting however does not exist without an active consenting reader writing requires a different level of participation words on paper are abstractions and everyone who reads words on paper brings to them a different set of associations and images i have vivid mental pictures of don quixote anna karenina and huckleberry finn but i feel confident they are not identical to the images carried in the mind of anyone elsehelen was clearly not reading the same “crime and punishment” i was she wasn’t looking for an existential work of genius she was looking for a good mystery and she read dostoyevsky with that thought in mind i don’t blame her for it i like to imagine that dostoyevsky wouldn’t eitherwhat the reader is doing then is translating the words on the pages into his or her own private imaginary lexicon according to his or her interests and needs and levels of comprehensionhere then is the full process of translation at one point we have a writer in a room struggling to approximate the impossible vision that hovers over his head he finishes it with misgivings some time later we have a translator struggling to approximate the vision not to mention the particulars of language and voice of the text that lies before him he does the best he can but is never satisfied and then finally we have the reader the reader is the least tortured of this trio but the reader too may very well feel that he is missing something in the book that through sheer ineptitude he is failing to be a proper vessel for the book’s overarching visioni don’t mean to suggest that writer translator and reader are all engaged in a mass exercise in disappointment how depressing would that be and untrueand still we as a species are always looking for cathedrals made of fire and part of the thrill of reading a great book is the promise of another yet to come a book that may move us even more deeply raise us even higher one of the consolations of writing books is the seemingly unquenchable conviction that the next book will be better will be bigger and bolder and more comprehensive and truer to the lives we live we exist in a condition of hope we love the beauty and truth that come to us and we do our best to tamp down our doubts and disappointmentswe are on a quest and are not discouraged by our collective suspicion that the perfection we look for in art is about as likely to turn up as is the holy grail that is one of the reasons we i mean we humans are not only the creators translators and consumers of literature but also its subjects continue reading the main story we’re interested in your feedback on this page tell us what you think related coverage times topic michael cunningham
