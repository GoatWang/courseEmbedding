steps that the company anticipates that will occur in regard to the adoption and implementation of trade and transportation and a highspeed rail system by a regional or local municipality to date the company has not developed any rail systems the company plans that it will prepare the feasibility and investment grade studies and locate contractors and manufacturers to complete work and provide cost estimates trade and transportation corridors use technology well known to us contractors however because highspeed rail travel is already inplace in much of europe and asia the company anticipates working with european companies to furnish the highspeed equipment such as locomotives and passenger cars the company will put proposed contracts together with the supporting feasibility study appraisals costbenefit analysis tems study transportation history and other data to create a complete regional project proposal the company will then present such project proposals to the municipalities state or local as a complete and finished project the local or regional municipality will then independently analyze and discuss the companys proposal if accepted the company anticipates that upon approval the local municipality will effectuate a bond offering for the funding of the different projects the company anticipates that the projects will be financed by bonds or indentures offered by sponsored or affiliated nonprofit organizations of the applicable local or municipal government or agency such nonprofit entities may also be affiliates or companies related to the company once a proposed trade and transportation or highspeed rail project is accepted and a financing bond issue is effected by the municipality the company will act as the project manager and oversee the entire project including not only the development of the project but its continued operations as well the company will also serve as the main central point for coordination of and between the municipalities contractors and operators of the project and once established the rail system  hi speed rail facilities inc in  the company entered into an agreement with hsrf one of the companys

united states census bureau predicts that the american population will reach  million by  a trend that will overwhelm our nations transportation infrastructure current estimates suggest that overall freight demand will double over the next  years from  billion tons today to  billion tons the number of trucks on the road is also expected to double already under unsustainable strain the nations freight transportation infrastructure and highways will face even greater challenges as the total volume of freight increases extensive infrastructure expansion such as new ports trade corridors and highspeed rail hsr is critical if rail and road transportation is to help mitigate problems associated with rising fuel costs crowded highways and greenhouse gas emissions population growth and development in the us have made our nation increasingly reliant on rail and highway infrastructure to transport people and freight clearly a strong efficient freight transportation system is vital to the nations economy our alreadystrained and outdated railways must be upgraded to handle the projected increases in freight shipping to relieve congestion on our highways new trade corridors are needed to support the changes in marine shipping that will need new ports and infrastructure equally new high speed rail routes are needed to increase connectivity between us cities and support the emerging new economy and reduce auto emissions  company focus the company recognizes the  trillion dollar infrastructure market as identified in mckinseys report the need and demand for alternative transportation such as high speed rail sea ports intermodal ports and toll roads the boeing reports and society of civil engineers reports identify the need for more efficient port operations and infrastructure projects to be completed to satisfy the demands and growth of the united states it is increasingly important as the united states adopts policies to attempt to reduce its dependency on fossil fuels and to improve its infrastructure and transportation systems for global competiveness the companys intention is to profit from such opportunities and has structured itself to be the leading provider of such services in the united states and globally the company is focusing on the following means to create efficient freight transportation  increase port capacity to increase our nations ability to distribute goods making us more competitive in the global economy  develop larger railserved inland distribution centers that will encourage more efficient movement of goods and create more capacity at ports  permit increased volume and speed of inland heavy freight allowing inland distribution points to expand into larger national service hubs and promote economic growth  develop profitable high speed rail for the fast movement of people and goods management believes that development of the trade and transport corridors and high speed rail corridors will result in significant franchise operations these include  ø fuel the company will franchise fuel and energy for vehicles moving in the corridors it develops ø corridor centers for foodrestaurantshotels foodrestaurants and hotels at major intersections and terminal areas associated with its trade toll and rail corridors ø logistic technology applications the company will develop advanced high speed operations for truck and rail freight and passenger operations high speed truck lanes truck trains and automatic truck operations will be included in the companys toll roads high speed rail freight and passenger operations with train speeds exceeding  mph will be developed ø pipelines pipeline operations will be developed where appropriate to facilitate crude oil movements to coastal refineries from inland oil fields and facilities ø cable cable will be laid along the company corridors to increase capacity for phone line operators ø parking parking facilities will be developed at critical network locations and at network nodes ø advertising advertising facilities will be developed as appropriate along the project corridors and key locations at terminals and facilities  ø franchise

innovative approach to resolving the nations transportation crisis and it proposes doing so without the necessity of the government increasing taxes at any level or in any manner in short the company suggests replacing public financing with private funding the primary competitive barrier most companies face in attempting to impact the nations infrastructure crisis is that they approach the overall problem in disparate segments for example one provider proposes building railroad cars while another proposes laying tracks a third is interested in depots while a fourth focuses on accommodations none bring a comprehensive plan for fullfunding to the mix on the other hand the company takes an intermodal approach to providing seamless service with a scale of economy for example the highspeed rail plan will utilize existing rail rightsofway to connect several metropolitan areas and states serving expanding populations  the company through related parties also foresees pursuing joint ventures with other industries related to the transportation industry for example hsr technologies it is currently finalizing an arrangement with a major manufacturer of certain materials used in the construction of highways and other transportation systems the discussions contemplate a twofold transaction by which the company would initially buy the manufacturing plant and then subsequently purchase the remaining noncash assets of the company competition the company may face significant competition from other companies that may be developing competing transportation systems the company will however face competition in the allocation of monetary resources from governmental agencies at the local regional state and federal levels the company believes that government agencies will strongly endorse its proposed plan for highspeed regional rail systems but believes that given the economic environment there may be few or no funds available for such development nevertheless as an example traditionally significant competition generally exists in the industry from government agencies and entities due to the federal budgetary constraints henceforth any completion would come from private or public entities on the heels of the department of transportations recent request for highspeed rail proposals its federal railroad administration received  applications from  states totaling  billion that was more than three times the  billion available during the first round of awards in the fall of  applicants submitted more than  billion in project proposals that was nearly six times the initial  billion available from the american recovery and reinvestment act unfortunately due to federal budgetary setbacks as of early  very little of this has come to fruition trading market while there currently is no market for the shares the company as obtained the trading symbol armt from finra employees in addition to the chief executive officer the company has been accruing salaries for employees and twenty six other persons who are working on behalf of the company to assist in the development of its initial highspeed rail project none of the twenty six people currently

development of the land next to such corridor which it has termed the port trajan project  the company anticipates that it will construct a distribution center consisting of a terminal and a rail line between the main rail tracks to the highway for the transition of shipping containers from the rail line to waiting trucks  the distribution center will provide the facility for repackaging the shipments into containers or other shipments destined for final destination by truck   the company anticipates that such project will be completed in phases the first of which is the purchase of an initial  acres at  per acre  the purchase price will include all onsite horizontal improvements  offsite improvements will be acquired at an additional  the land is currently owned by a related company and the company has entered into a letter of intent for its purchase on january   the company signed a letter of intent with a related party to purchase land for a potential future project  the company was unable to meet the deposit requirements of this contract and so in november  the deposit requirements were amended to require a cash deposit of  which has been paid to hold the purchase option open for the company until institutional funding is acquired  future plans are to issue in excess of  shares of common stock to aid in funding the land purchase   on january   the company entered into a letter of intent with a related party to contract for services for the build out of the port trajan  terminals on february   the company entered into a master agreement for production services with platinum media whereby platinum media will provide the company with all of its media development needs for a  year term  the agreement states that the fees charged to the company will be no less than  per year once we have received funding and begun executing on our business plan and platinum media has begun providing substantial services to armt  at july   the company has not incurred fees to by platinum media   the market   the company believes that the united states suffers from an overburdened transportation infrastructure and that a fundamental overhaul of the dilapidated national transportation structure is needed according to society of civil engineering reports  httpwwwinfrastructurereportcardorg  the company anticipates that it will be able to assist in this “ fundamental overhaul ” by providing both the handson expertise and investment resources to establish an intermodal grid comprised of transportation and support services extending to urban and outlying areas alike   the infrastructure experts believe that there is a compelling need to revitalize america ’ s transportation infrastructure as all levels of government are facing increasing economic crisis the company anticipates that such revitalization will be the result of publicprivate partnerships and alliances to create the basis for developing such an infrastructure organizations    such as the company are accordingly poised to play a significant role in the redevelopment and improvement of the nation ’ s transportation infrastructure   the  david r goode national transportation policy conference held at the miller center of public affairs at the university of virginia outlined the compelling need to revitalize america ’ s transportation infrastructure and recommended that “ public private partnerships need to emerge from the laboratory of pilot programs to play a much larger role as a core element of america ’ s transport investment strategy ” organizations such as the company are accordingly poised to play a significant role in the redevelopment and improvement of the nation ’ s transportation infrastructure the same transportation conference also noted that “ lacking a coherent vision for our transportation future and chronically short of resources we defer new investments fail to plan and allow existing systems to fall into disrepair this shortsightedness and under investment — at the planning level and on our nation ’ s roads rails airports and waterways — costs the country dearly it compromises our productivity and ability to compete internationally transportation users pay for the system ’ s inefficiencies in lost time money and safety rural areas are cut off from economic opportunities and even urbanites suffer from inadequate public transportation options meanwhile transportationrelated pollution exacts a heavy toll on our environment and public health ”   furthermore the conference report was equally insistent on the need for private sector funding in “ recommendation  connecting the dots ” the cochairs wrote “ resolving the controversy over private equity contributions to the transport system is essential to meet the nation ’ s pressing transportation challenges as is recognizing the appropriate role of publicprivate partnerships ppps in taking on those challenges ” they added “ ppps need to emerge from the laboratory of pilot programs to play a much larger role as a core element of america ’ s transport investment strategy ”   to resolve this crisis will require a massive infusion of capital the national surface transportation infrastructure financing commission in its  report paying our way estimates the total shortfall between what is required and what is available at all levels of government just for maintaining the current system range from  billion to  billion per year for the period  to  if the goal is to improve existing transportation systems the shortfall is even larger  –  billion per year over the same time period   the main problem is that the funds to either maintain or improve existing transportation systems are simply not available from traditional sources taxpayers at all levels of government are loath to support any tax increases for infrastructure projects new transportation systems are frequently discussed at all levels of government but the public funding for implementing such plans is usually nonexistent   the company has met recently with appalachian regional commission their region consists of  counties in  states serving more than  million people political pressure is increasing to find alternate transportation systems as the price of gas and environmental risk of drilling and using petroleum products rises highway maintenance is increasingly expensive as the price of materials and labor increases  highway congestion is an increasing urban problem the company presented a project as a total package thereby providing the municipalities with the complete overview and relieving it of the time and costs involved in studying the proposal seeking pricing information and projecting results in addition the company believes that it may be able to effect economies of scale by purchasing new and renovating existing equipment and facilities on an integrated regional basis rather than in fractured individual areas or small municipalities  the project also creates many jobs in the areas that the facilities are located in the nonprofit high speed rail facilities inc has been identified in house resolution  of the  georgia legislative session high speed rail will connect freight and passenger services from georgia to alabama and throughout georgia the company has met recently with port of freeport and brazoriafort bend rail district  to expand the port operations along with passenger and freight rail forecasts from the texas comptroller of public accounts predict that the us and texas economies will rebound from the current recession in terms of gsp and gdp and grow at  percent and  percent respectively on average per year between  and   an efficient and wellmaintained

the alabama toll way facility and rail car technology for dmu diesel multi unit technology along with composite rail road ties tems transportation economics management systems identified projects for the company focus as part of the growth strategy   the company is facing solid growth for next  years or more according to “ mckinsey global institute the mckinsey infrastructure practice report january  confirms that  to  trillion dollars of investment is needed for infrastructure from  to  due to robust infrastructure market and a tremendous back log of infrastructure projects on hand along with anticipated projects identified by the company ’ s infrastructure projects consultants tems inc management believed that market conditions warranted that the company reconsider its capital structure and in september  we amended our certificate of incorporation to increase our authorized shares market conditions were further supported by “ the boeing current market outlook  report ” which shows an   growth over next  years for cargo fleet   entry of the company into the market   the company anticipates that it can offer a comprehensive innovative approach to resolving the nation ’ s transportation crisis and it proposes doing so without the necessity of the government increasing taxes at any level or in any manner in short the company suggests replacing public financing with private funding   the primary competitive barrier most companies face in attempting to impact the nation ’ s infrastructure crisis is that they approach the overall problem in disparate segments for example one provider proposes building railroad cars while another proposes laying tracks a third is interested in depots while a fourth focuses on accommodations none bring a comprehensive plan for fullfunding to the mix on the other hand the company takes an intermodal approach to providing seamless service with a scale of economy for example the highspeed rail plan will utilize existing rail rightsofway to connect several metropolitan areas and states serving expanding populations   the company through related parties also foresees pursuing joint ventures with other industries related to the transportation industry for example hsr technologies it is currently finalizing an arrangement with a major manufacturer of certain materials used in the construction of highways and other transportation systems the discussions contemplate a twofold transaction by which the company would initially buy the manufacturing plant and then subsequently purchase the remaining noncash assets of the company    competition   the company may face significant competition from other companies that may be developing competing transportation systems  the company will however face competition in the allocation of monetary resources from governmental agencies at the local regional state and federal levels the company believes that government agencies will strongly endorse its proposed plan for highspeed regional rail systems but believes that given the economic environment there may be few or no funds available for such development   nevertheless as an example traditionally significant competition generally exists in the industry from government agencies and entities due to the federal budgetary constraints henceforth any completion would come from private or public entities on the heels of the department of transportation ’ s recent request for highspeed rail proposals its federal railroad administration received  applications from  states totaling  billion that was more than three times the  billion available during the first round of awards in the fall of  applicants submitted more than  billion in project proposals that was nearly six times the initial  billion available from the american recovery and reinvestment act unfortunately due to federal budgetary setbacks as of  very little of this has come to fruition   trading market   while there currently is no market for the shares a market maker has filed the initial form c with finra   employees   in addition to the chief executive officer the company has a few paid employees and approximately twenty six other persons who are working on behalf of the company to assist in the development of its initial highspeed rail project none of these people currently receive salaries or other compensation certain

companies that may be developing high speed rail passenger and freight transportation systems as this industry is not well developed in the united states to date such competition that may exist is primarily in the development and planning stages the company will however face competition in the allocation of monetary resources from governmental agencies at the local regional state and federal levels the company believes that government agencies will strongly endorse its proposed plan for highspeed regional rail systems but believes that given the economic environment there may be few or no funds available for such development nevertheless it appears that significant competition generally exists in the industry from private organizations or government agencies and entities on the heels of the department of transportation’s recent request for highspeed rail proposals its federal railroad administration received  applications from  states totaling  billion that was more than three times the  billion available during the first round of awards in the fall of  applicants submitted more than  billion in project proposals that was nearly six times the initial  billion available from the american recovery and reinvestment act so overwhelming has the response been that transportation secretary lahood observed at the time that “demand for highspeed rail dollars is intense and it demonstrates just how important this historic initiative is states understand that highspeed rail represents a unique opportunity to create jobs revitalize our manufacturing base spur economic development and provide people with an environmentally friendly transportation option” company description the company intends to focus on highspeed rail for passenger and freight transportation and related and ancillary transportation businesses the company anticipates that it will provide various services for highspeed rail throughout the united states the company intends to secure manufacturing and technologies together with ancillary land development projects sale of goods and services to government civilian and commercial end users the company anticipates that it will directly or through subsidiaries develop plans and then coordinate and supervise the financing construction and development of such transportation projects by bringing together the resources plans financing approvals and technology needed to implement such transportation systems the company has no revenue producing operations to date the company intends to develop numerous projects as opportunities are presented primarily in the transportation or transportationrelated fields the company believes that the need demand and usage of alternative transportation such as high speed rail are increasingly important as the united states adopts policies to attempt to reduce its dependency on fossil fuels particularly the automobile the company intends to develop and prepare the designs and concepts for feasible and profitable regional highspeed rail projects utilizing existing and new railbeds stations and equipment the company will prepare the complete project package including appraisals and estimates and will obtain contracts for the development of the railbeds and purchase of the equipment the company will present the complete project working as project supervisor and coordinator to municipalities and regional government agencies in addition to high speed rail projects the company will also develop other selected transportationrelated projects that promote efficient and improved transportation structures or plans funding for individual projects of the company will occur from bond offerings organized through various nonprofit entities and organizations
