olivia kirtley a nonexecutive director of us bancorp papa john’s international and rescare inc and president of the international federation of accountants ifa examines the multidimensional environment of subsidiary governance and highlights leading practices organizations can take to better align the governance of parents and their subsidiaries in her role at the ifa she leads an organization which includes over  member bodies in  countries representing almost three million accountants she also is a past chairman of the board of the american institute of certified public accountants and the national association of corporate directors has named ms kirtley as one of the top  corporate directors and governance professionals in the us following is an excerpt of an interview with ms kirtley which originally appeared in deloitte’s on the board’s agenda publication q in organizations that consist of a parent and subsidiaries governance of the full enterprise is often shared between the boards of the parent and the subsidiaries what are the key issues for parent boards olivia f kirtley transparency and accountability—it’s as simple as that a lot of what goes on at the subsidiary level may be outside the control of the parent for example a subsidiary board may need to deal with issues unique to the subsidiary’s own circumstances including issues that are dictated by local regulatory or other national requirements therefore it is important that the parent board knows the issues being discussed by the subsidiary board and is assured that all of the appropriate issues are being addressed when something important comes up mechanisms and protocols need to be in place as to elevate these matters to a higher level for awareness follow up remediation or any other reason having said that it’s always a challenge for the parent board to know how to interact with its subsidiaries how frequently to interact what type of information subsidiaries should be asked to provide and at what point the parent board needs to be involved with certain matters there isn’t a one‑size‑fits‑all answer for how to go about doing that other than to say the basic goal should be transparency and accountability q subsidiary boards need to act in the best interests of the subsidiary but also have a responsibility to the parent organization how should the subsidiary board balance these responsibilities olivia f kirtley ideally the interests of the parent and subsidiary will be aligned but when that isn’t the case it is the subsidiary board’s responsibility to make sure the parent understands why a particular solution or course of action is not a good one for the subsidiary in some situations it may be that the proposed solution is not the optimal one for the subsidiary or could be just a matter of preference on the other hand the issue may be about something substantial for example because of a difference in business models a difference in the format for accumulating data or because the solution may be overly expensive or difficult for the subsidiary to implement in these situations it is important for the subsidiary board to make its case to the parent so the parent is aware of the issues and the related consequences this will allow the parent to weigh all of the pros and cons when making choices for the entire organization q would having common directors on both the parent and subsidiary boards help facilitate transparency olivia f kirtley that is certainly a good practice there often are crossover directors on the parent and subsidiary boards but those individuals are not always parent company independent directors sometimes senior members of management of the parent company will serve on the subsidiary board they are normally expected to report up to the parent on any issues arising from the subsidiary’s board or committee meetings that would be viewed as significant and of interest to the parent’s full board or its committees q historically organizations weren’t always fully aware of the risks facing their subsidiaries are they better understanding these risks today olivia f kirtley there’s no one answer to this because different organizations are at different levels of maturity in their risk model and some are much more mature than others however after the global financial crisis the whole subject of risk began building momentum it was no longer a case of just going through the exercise and having a risk assessment but one of actively monitoring mitigating and following existing and emerging risks when it comes to risk i think there are two big dangers one is not having a true understanding at the parent level of the culture climate and environment that the subsidiaries operate in the other is to assess risk based solely on materiality because some risks are extremely disproportionate to their financial materiality for instance most antimoney laundering or antibribery regulations have very low tolerance levels—it’s not a materiality issue it’s an event issue—and that can really have very disproportionate consequences to the financial issue at hand i think there is a lot of room for improvement though many companies’ risk processes may be very good but depending on how they’re structured how centralized or decentralized their compliance and their risk processes are the diversity of their human capital and the parent board’s awareness of cultural norms and what happens within and across national borders i think that most boards should pay close attention to the way risks are being identified monitored and mitigated q would rotating management between the parent and subsidiaries help the overall organization better understand its risks olivia f kirtley some companies certainly do that and have done it for a long time i think it not only increases the knowledge management has of the subsidiaries but sometimes particularly with an acquisition it is the best way to ensure that the organization’s culture gets embedded into the new organization things can be written on a piece of paper such as a code of conduct but only by seeing it in real time can you tell how that code is being interpreted and adopted when an organization feels it needs to quickly get its values embedded into a new subsidiary particularly one in a developing country that may have less experience with large formal corporate structures putting parent company management into the subsidiary’s operations may be the best approach q is technology making the task of subsidiary oversight easier olivia f kirtley technology is certainly very helpful particularly when the parent and subsidiaries are on common platforms because it allows for the retrieval of data in real time the gathering of data in various formats or the manipulation of huge amounts of data to show trends or patterns with technology the collection and analysis of data is not dependent on it going through someone else’s human hands instead you can retrieve the data yourself in whatever format you want and do it in real time many organizations however may not be on common platforms and that makes data collection and analysis across the parent and subsidiaries a challenge to maximize the effectiveness of their technologies i think we will see organizations increasingly moving to centralized data

and downs of economic cycles and seen firsthand how leadership  both good and bad  can impact the success of organizations and individuals i think all of these experiences have made me a person who considers leadership to be an honor ive learned that the primary role of a leader is to serve  to help others succeed in whatever they do and to facilitate the achievement of agreedupon strategies and goals how has your previous employment experience aided your position at ifac my background is a bit different to previous ifac presidents im the first to come into this role as a professional accountant in business in addition to having public accounting experience i spent the first decade of my career with one of the large international firmsbut my last three decades have been spent in the corporate world as a cfo as a nonexecutive director of publicly listed companies as an audit committee chair and as a consultant on governance structures and risk management the one role i havent had in the financial reporting system is that of a regulator but i can assure you ive spent plenty of time with them particularly as an audit committee chair i believe my experience in so many different roles gives me a unique perspective on the issues impacting our profession i am a member of the profession i am client of the profession i rely on the profession and i want professional accountants around the world to be the best they can be  for our profession and in the public interest what have been the highlights and challenges been during your tenure at ifac i first joined the ifac board in   just before the global financial crisis the last seven years has encompassed extraordinary financial and sovereign debt issues they are still ongoing in many countries ifac has dealt with some exceptional challenges as a result including working with member bodies policy makers and global regulators to identify ways that the risks of corporate failures and financial crises can be mitigated going forward we have not always agreed with regulators on the best way forward particularly when calls for action inspire changes with potential unintended consequences but we continue to engage in dialogue and speak out in the public interest one of the most exciting challenges has been ifacs focus on professional accountancy organization development around the world last year ifac was granted several million dollars from the uk government to support the growth of the profession in countries that desperately need accountants to help support strong verifiable financial reporting that will help attract inward investment we recently announced the first three countries that will benefit from this grant  rwanda ghana and uganda and on a personal note i was elected president officially at the world congress of accountants in rome in november   a humbling and exciting experience and my first official role was to make a speech at the vatican to which pope francis had invited world congress attendees for a private audience the challenge came when i learned just a few days before that my speech had to be made in italian pope francis was very gracious and encouraging as i worked through my remarks and his speech to our group was most inspiring regarding the importance of accountants in fighting corruption and poverty by encouraging accountable and transparent financial systems what advice can you offer women who are seeking a career in financial services first of all theres no substitute for competence so devote yourself to learning and expanding your knowledge not only of financial services sector but also of business generally but competence must be accompanied by confidence which can only be gained through experience so my primary message would be to raise your hand take the risk of accepting new challenges and opportunities there are several studies that say men accept assignments or seek promotions when they are only partially prepared whereas most women do so only with a much greater level of preparedness dont wait until you think you are  prepared  few of us really are go for it the experience youll obtain will be invaluable and lead to bigger opportunities in the future how do you maintain a worklife balance thats an ongoing challenge and im not always successful but i try to use the  rule  striving to have the proper balance at least  of the time that has been more difficult at certain stages of my career and family however having an infrastructure at home allowed me to spend quality time with my children and husband which has always been a top priority the other challenge is being disciplined about disconnecting from all the connectivity we have  email smart phones and tablets that is something i could do better at and im trying to be more disciplined what do you think is the biggest issue for women in the workplace there are at least two big issues other than the confidence issue i mentioned earlier they are legacy workplace issues  ie not changing to accommodate greater use of remote technology and allowing more flexible office time  and unconscious biases of both men and women we must tackle both of these issues to increase our success in retaining women and hiring them into senior management roles how has mentorship made a difference in your professional and personal life ive been lucky to have been inspired by terrific people  both men and women  throughout my personal and professional lives from parents who gave me every encouragement to a husband who was my biggest encourager while he excelled in his own career as a physician to professionals in all walks of life my involvement outside my workplace in the accounting profession and nonprofit organizations was particularly significant in providing some wonderful mentors which other female leaders do you admire and why they are numerous there are several women world leaders past and present who have demonstrated outstanding leadership on very complex situations among the several current women executives that i admire is sheryl sandberg she has not only been a leader and visionary early adopter of new technology thats transforming the way we live work and interact with each other but shes also given back by writing a terrific book to encourage other women along their leadership journey and leadership isnt always about age or experience we have much to learn from young women too who could fail to be impressed by the poise bravery and boldness of malala yousafzai she was shot for being a girl who wanted an education  and continues to campaigns for girls rights to an education she is an utterly amazing young woman and gives a whole new meaning to leading by example what do you want ifac to accomplish in the next year ifac is the global voice of the accounting profession as regulators ponder changes to financial reporting and audit processes im looking forward to engaging with as many as possible im looking forward to further progress in our program to support the growth of professional accountancy organizations in developing countries supporting diversity and inclusion programs in the profession to help build talent and looking at ways in which we can further encourage technology solutions for sharing best practice and information with our peers all over all the
