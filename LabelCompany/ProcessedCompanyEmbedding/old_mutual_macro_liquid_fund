asymmetry of the omlm return profile shown in fig is unusual because many investment strategies have a negatively skewed return profile as do most longonly asset classes as well as seeking a positive skew over time oxley expects omlm returns should have no structural correlation to any traditional asset class as there is no structural bias to being long or short of interest rates between  and  the strategy’s correlation with conventional asset classes was in fact slightly negative because at that time the team was running a somewhat contrarian stance profiting during the  ‘taper tantrum’ for

to launch new fixed income fund date wednesday  may  old mutual global investors aiming to launch new fixed income fund the old mutual monthly income high yield bond fund old mutual global investors today announces that it is aiming to launch the old mutual monthly income high yield bond fund ‘the fund’ during the course of the summer of  subject to regulatory approval  the fund will aim to achieve a total return through a combination of income and capital growth from a welldiversified portfolio predominantly comprising of fixed and variable rate debt securities located worldwide the fund will be managed by christine johnson and bastian wagner who work as part of an integrated team comprising specialists in high yield financials and investment grade credit as well as macro strategists and portfolio managers   this team offers an excellent performance record  as at the end of march  the old mutual corporate bond fund and the old mutual monthly income bond fund both had first quartile performance over one three and five years the fund is expected to focus on higher yielding corporate bonds as a means to deliver a strong regular income stream  the team will seek to deliver a competitive monthly distribution with a — annual yield targeted at launch distributions will be smoothed to give the endclient as close as possible to a regular income capital enhancement – and a positive total return – will be achieved through active management of credit quality and interest rate risk the fund’s duration limits will be  to  years enabling it to take advantage of both rising and falling yield environments commenting on the rationale behind the planned launch of the fund christine johnson head of fixed income at old mutual global investors said “we believe that there is a market opportunity to launch a product that will meet the continuing need of our clients to access income streams “as bank lending continues to contract there is an increasing supply of good quality higher yielding issues the issuing companies are typically from continental – and particularly southern – europe long established with good free cash flows healthy balance sheets and credible growth prospects this is a liquid diversified market – for example the bofa merrill lynch european currency fixed  floating rate nonfinancial high yield index has €bn in issue representing  separate issues” bastian wagner portfolio manager – fixed income added “around a third of the market comprises of issues below €m and we believe that this part of the market represents a particularly attractive opportunity companies issuing in this area are in many cases new to the bond market and issues under €m are too small to be investible by the megafunds for these reasons they will often offer somewhat better terms to those in the broader market” the team’s investment approach is big picture and thematic emphasising analysis of real world trends in politics economics business and society  the team monitors each of its themes through an external indicator and expresses its views through simple liquid positions   in reducing the investible market from  bonds to  the team use a number of screens which reflect their thematic preferences  the team tests the market factors risk appetite spreads and investment flows and liquidity volatility valuation age of bond pricing frequency  a further test for credit quality is undertaken through financial modelling and meetings with the management of the companies in which the team invests the detailed modelling of each stock is debated at a weekly meeting of the full credit team the final selection depends on the level of conviction sector overlap portfolio diversification and position limits any stock bought should fit the themes be of stable or improving credit quality trade cheap or fair to its peers and have a catalyst for price appreciation  the team sells a stock when any one of these factors no longer applies

global investors is to launch the old mutual absolute return government bond fund which is a ucits fund and the old mutual liquid macro fund which is a qualifying investor alternative investment fund on  october   the strategy will launch with usd million seed capital from old mutual plc   the funds will be managed by russ oxley and his team who joined old mutual global investors from ignis asset management earlier this year russ the lead manager and comanagers adam purzitsky and paul shanta will be supported in their portfolio management and trading by huw davies and jin wong and in systems development by josh heming    warren tonkinson managing director of old mutual global investors says “this is a very exciting development for our company as a lot of work has been undertaken to prepare for the launch of this range  we have had a lot of interest from investors as russ and his team are highly respected having one of the best track records of managing absolute return government bond funds in our industry  we are therefore confident that demand will be strong from our global client base”   the objective of the funds is to seek to deliver positive total returns on a rolling month basis with stable levels of volatility uncorrelated to bond and equity market conditions the ucits fund will be managed to a volatility target of  per cent per cent with expected annualised returns of cash plus  per cent the qiaif which will also offer investors daily liquidity will be managed to a volatility target of  per cent per cent with expected annualised returns of cash  per cent the funds aim to be diversified from global fixed income markets by employing a highly distinctive investment strategy focused on expressing views on macro themes through exposure to forward interest rates inflation expectations and foreign exchange   the low correlation with global bond markets is likely to be appealing at a time when the traditional safehaven role of government bond markets is increasingly questionable due to the distinctive process and avoidance of credit and creditlike assets and of emerging market debt the fund is also  expected to exhibit low correlation with other absolute return investment strategies including global macro hedge funds fixed income equity and multiasset based strategies making it a potentially attractive addition to a portfolio the portfolio managers will place a strong emphasis on investing in highly liquid assets in which the market has historically remained liquid even in the most extreme periods including for example the global financial crisis   donald pepper managing director of alternatives says “we are delighted that old mutual will be supporting the strategy with usd million of seed capital at launch this demonstrates the belief we have in the strategy and our commitment to both these funds and to the development of the alternatives business within old mutual global investors we have successfully delivered uncorrelated returns in our highly liquid global equity market neutral strategy which now has over usd billion¹ in client assets under management and we hope for similar investor support for this highly liquid uncorrelated strategy”   adam purzitsky comanager of the fund says “our investment philosophy hinges on the belief that through a detailed understanding of forward interest rates it is possible to express views on global macro trends in a very precise way  through our approach to investing we are able to target specific risks and opportunities without “inadvertently” taking economic exposures to those risks we would rather avoid  at the core of our approach is the understanding that forward rates are influenced by very different factors depending on their location on the curve   we believe we have the potential to deliver positive returns for investors within clearly defined volatility parameters irrespective of the direction of interest rates  our investment track record of successfully managing these strategies is clear evidence that our process if very effective”   paul shanta comanager of the fund adds “we have developed a unique investment strategy over a period of many years and a product that we think plays a valuable role in our clients’ wider portfolio joining old mutual global investors has given us the opportunity to further enhance our processes and technology and to prepare a bespoke platform for the launch of our new funds  we are excited about being part of an organisation that shares our ambition and now look forward to working with investors” like this article  get the free daily newsletter print email furtherreading from hedgeweek global advisors jersey launches crypto fund tue    gabelli merger plus trust now trading on lse
