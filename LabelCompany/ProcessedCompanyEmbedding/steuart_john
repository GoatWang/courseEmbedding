installed in the department of interior in  the united states department of the interior murals in washington dc the homestead and the oklahoma land rush were painted with oil and tempera on canvas  and installed november  by john steuart curry created during the great depression the murals are the product of president franklin d roosevelt’s new deal the two murals depict events of the time period the homestead acts and the oklahoma land run of  early sketches of figures and ideas are held by archives located at the marianna kistler beach museum of art at kansas state university the homesteadedit this mural is nine foot by  feet eight inch it represents a homestead with the typical features that make up its ideal of blessed peace happiness and potential prosperity of ensuring rural life the homestead features a mother and her daughter paring potatoes near a small garden for the family meal a young son holds the fence posts while his father drives them into the ground an older sister drives the wagon full of spikes while she also cares for the youngest child each member of the family is actively working and contributing its energies to the productive whole near the bottom left of the mural roosters chicks and chickens peck and feed near the foreground garden as bountiful reminders of their capacity to provide this frontier family with eggs the oklahoma land rushedit just two inches taller than its partner painting this nine feet two inch by  feet eight inch  mural represents another historical event from the time period the oklahoma land rush depicts the westward migration in the representation of that famous day—twelve oclock noon on april  —when the oklahoma territory was opened to homestead settlement and over twenty thousand prospective settlers rushed into the new land to stake their claimspage needed anxious but looking forward to eventual security an  pioneer mother sunbonnet intact is of greatest importance to the far left foreground of currys westwardmoving mural perched on a brokendown wagon she clutches her small son while waving and calling out to her certificateholding husband who astride their rearing horse is to ride on to claim a new farm site his hellbent competition includes a cyclist riding a high ordinary safety bicycle from the s and an overweight overdressed lady in a rocking chair she rolls back in an open wagon driven frantically by her balding husband and if nothing else lends comic relief to balance the anxious sincerity of the mother on the groundpage needed john steuart currys oklahoma land rush repeated an important theme of the time history told through the actions of common people by emphasizing the rush of figures across the land curry shared his concern with capturing the energy and vigor of american pioneers kansas state capital muralsedit one of currys most famous works are the murals designed for the kansas state capitol in topeka kansas in june  newspaper editors raised money to commission john steuart curry who was the most famous artist in kansas to paint murals in the statehouse currys design was divided into three themes first the settlement of kansas which depicted the conquistadors and the plainsmen second the life of a homesteader which would depict john brown and third pastoral prosperity which would include scenes of modern kansas curry wanted to be free to express his own ideas regarding the murals i have my own ideas about telling the story of pioneers coming into kansas i want to paint this war with nature and i want to paint the things i feel as a native kansan political controversy stalled the completion of the murals expensive italian marble slabs covered the spot in the rotunda where the eight panels depicting scenes from the life of the kansas homesteader were to be painted the legislative committee refused to move them from the wall to make way for currys mural however behind the refusal were two real issues with currys paintings the first being that currys factual details were incorrect for instance they criticized the tails of his animals calling them not natural like in currys opinion those problems could be easily fixed however with the next issue the committee had an even stronger objection and that was the image of kansan abolitionist john brown in front of a crowd of people and a tornado in particular the committee objected to the blood on john browns hands the prairie fires and tornadoes these inclusions were thought by some to show the state in a negative light due to the fact that brown who was executed for leading a raid on harpers ferry virginia in  was considered by some to be a traitor and a murderer curry tried to explain that while the blood on browns hands was not literal his acts caused bloodshed and that the tornado was a symbol of the abolitionists passion however the people of kansas saw its inclusion as a negative statement about bad weather in his presentation to the people curry expressed that he wanted to get into his pictures the irony that is the kansas people not a soft soppy presentation when rejected curry in anger left the finished murals unsigned at his death in  since currys death his murals have come to be regarded as on par with similar works done by his contemporary thomas hart benton printsedit manhunt  lithograph figge art museum davenport ia

art institute of chicago in  curry wrote home to his parents about his decision to study illustration he noted his interest in studying with harvey dunn who curry said was “making the illustrators of today in  curry met dunn and while he did not become one of dunn’s students the established artist became a mentor helping curry further his illustration education and career curry began publishing illustrations in  and continued through  when he took a hiatus from illustration writing “came to ny to be an illustrator was not a brilliant success went to paris and learned something from m schoukhareff of the russian academy learned something also from the louvre and have been trying since to carry out my ideas of how an american should paint in  john curry returned to making illustrations for books and other media and he contributed to this field until his death in  his last illustrations can be found in john brown’s body a poem by stephen vincent benét published by

with the downhome folksy look of regional art the american tobacco company did not capitalize on the war or use military themes when advertising for their cigarettes curry only made two lucky strike tobacco ads grading a pile of tobacco after curing the first lucky strike ad features a woman wearing a headscarf sorting tobacco leaves grading the lighter leaf this ad depicts a farmer sorting and examining tobacco leaves inside a barn there are four original primary sketches of ideas and the layouts for these lucky strike ads in the archives located at the marianna kistler beach museum of art at kansas state university hoover and the floodedit on may   life magazine released hoover and the flood a painting for life by john steuart curry this editorial was the sixth of eight commissioned installments for life magazines american history series that featured modern american history paintings john steuart currys hoover and the flood painting is an oil on panel and measures ½ by  inches the painting is currently located at the morris museum of art in augusta ga currys life magazine commission was solely for the reproduction rights to the painting since the magazine never intended to purchase currys painting there has been little success finding documentation regarding the financial aspects of the commission currys hoover and the flood was created to celebrate the humanitarian and relief efforts of secretary of commerce herbert hoover before his presidential election in  currys painting demonstrates many of the major scenes and events that were associated during the mississippi flood of  such as flood waters national guardsmen the red cross relief refugees stranded farm animals praying african americans and a mississippi riverboat john steuart currys work often supported the mentalities of the african american population that were common during the first half of the twentieth century hoover and the flood references several of currys previous artworks his use of a centrally positioned african american male figure appears in other works including freeing of the slaves  the fugitive  and mississippi noah  war artedit important pieces of war art include our good earth  oil on hardboard chazen museum of art university of wisconsin  farm is a battleground too  world war ii war bond poster original at figge art museum davenport ia the surgeon ca  conté crayon on paper war department commission camp barkeley tx us army medical training ca  backgroundedit main article american propaganda during world war ii the government used posters to advertise as technique during the first world war the posters bridged a gap between the government and the people by using direct and simple messages the government’s plan of advertising via posters was to stir the nation into action by engaging its people’s hearts and minds quite simply the posters were meant to inform influence and guide americans’ behavior toward a certain political ideology because these posters were to be a part of the urban environment they could be placed anywhere moreover artists were told to use objects that could stand for a whole like a flag signifying a nation or a bomb meaning war so that they would not require any text on the poster no poster text was deemed a more effective and efficient technique of advertising specifically posters were to “tell the truth”  because they engaged all americans and fostered a social movement among americans sympathetic and realistic representations of the common soldier encouraged american nationalism such that the common lives of persons were made to be heroic during the warpage needed two different schools of art did work during this time regionalists and social realist both groups of art had vastly different views but they did share the common idea of the championing the common man therefore if either group was to make art to persuade people it needed to be done in this manner although he openly opposed the possibility of a second world war john steuart currys political opinions are not known explicitly his opinions were a mystery even to his wife in an interview when asked what currys political views were she told the interviewer that her husband read the progressive matthew biagell once wrote that subject matter of an important group of paintingsas well as statements that he made suggest strongly that his interests lay in a liberalism of one sort or another his opinions of military involvement in europe were believed to be in step with the majority of americans at this time isolationism may have been most pronounced in the landlocked midwest but americans of both sexes of all ages religions and political persuasions from all ethnic groups and all religions shared in the postwar years a feeling of apathy toward europe not to mention the rest of the wretchedly quarrelsome world that bordered on disgust curry was frustrated by the possibility of war he saw the war only as a set back in the progress the nation had made since that last world war and thus ending the progress made in the world of art curry warned that the entrance into another world war would kill the renaissance that he had seen reborn after the wwi after the first world war there began a splendid resurgence in art in america and we are in the midst of this movement nowbut war will kill it before it can reach its flowering curry had shown his dread of the coming war through his painting the light of the world which depicted onlookers gazing at a coming storm it wasnt until after the attack on pearl harbor december   which caused the shift in american opinion that inspired a change in currys support of the war curry was faced with the dilemma on how to make his work matter he had the desire to reach a broader audience of people and for the first time in currys career he expressed a desire to utilize his talents in support of american troops in  he finished his first work in support of a war sponsored by abbott laboratories  to produce government sanctioned war propaganda curry finished his first work in support of any war effort he submitted an oil titled our good earth to be used in publications our good earthedit our good earth is a painting and war poster by curry that highlights the symbolic importance of the heartland to the american war effort when commissioned to do war art reeves lewenthal director of associated american artists gallery tried suggesting possible subjects for john steuart currys new sponsorship perhaps you can do a heroic figure of a soldier guarding over or fighting for the preservation of all those benefits and advantages we enjoy in our democracy or perhaps could be fighting for the preservation of our peaceful fertile farmlands can be effectively portrayed in the background or perhaps shadows of out former hero soldiers can drift into the distance behind this forceful foreground figure then again you might do a nurseor a flyeror a marineor a sailorin some symbolic composition  but curry had other ideas when he responded with it seems very doubtful whether it is strategic or desirable to use fear as the motive in picturing to them the needs of the war program our people are patriotic thousands of our young men are volunteering before they are drafted bond sales are at a high level our people expect to win the war and are prepared to pay any price that may be necessary they do not need to be threatened by some fear complex in order to do their best they are responding to incentives that are on a much higher plane and more effective than fear  instead curry fell into step with his typical subject matter and painted an agricultural subject john steuart currys our good earth shows a farmer standing in his field of wheat flanked on either side by children as wind gusts through the scene the state of the man his children and the bountiful crop register the plenty that the farm is experiencing despite the war overseas the farmers face shows his concern for the times ahead but it does not indicate any intention to depart from his land or his family for the war overseas typical of a curry work the weather alludes to the underlying stress of the war as the family stands in the field a gust of wind rips through the scene trying to uproot the children and disrupt the cropsjust as the war threatens the farmers land and family when the work was published as a war bond poster the caption our good earthkeep it ours was added inspiring the onlooker to do their part by buying war bonds to make every market day bond day later the work was used as the cover for a war bond pamphlet in addition to the keep it ours caption long may it wave was placed at the bottom of the pamphlet referencing the amber waves of grain of the song america the beautiful and the second stanza of the star spangled banner the farm is a battleground tooedit in october  shortly after he finished our good earth curry received an official request from the office of war information to make another poster he was asked to have the poster completed by november  of that year based upon the writers’ war board’s directive curry was to convey that if america lost the war to the nazis then the farmers of the nation would become enslaved curry however argued that the idea to be expressed was a correct assumption of how life was in rural america he is quoted in a letter to his dealer reeves lewenthal as saying “farmers are exerting allout effort and working  and  hours a week there is no problem as we see it out here in getting farmers to work as hard as they can for they are doing exactly this” curry then requested that the board consider developing a more positive rural theme and offered to help think of one too in doing so curry came up with an idea from a sketch he had used in a previous mural idea for the wisconsin state fair called wisconsin agriculture leads to victory he believed such a representation would be a better and more positive idea for a poster lewenthal agreed thus in the farm is a battleground too he depicts a gigantic farmer who resembles the one in our good earth he is holding a pitchfork and is standing before two soldiers he is visually connecting the activities of the farmer to those on the war front in the background curry was shown a tractor and tank both mobile and therefore representative of the war and their respective missions because he wanted to keep his work as authentic as possible curry rejected any ideas that might go against the realities of the farmers’ work for example one idea that was suggested by lewenthal was that the pitchfork be held in the same advancing motion as the soldiers’ guns curry objected and said that farming is a skilled profession having the pitchfork in such a way would seem strange and wrong combat artedit in  the corps of engineers established a war art unit to include both military and civilian artists in an effort to reveal the realities of war to the nation artist for the program were recruited in joint effort by the associated american artists organization and the war department established art committee unfortunately a little over six months into the program congress cut the funds for the art project and the military artists were reassigned to other duties some however continued to produce art through their military career additional efforts to document the war came from major companies with a history in supporting both soldiers and artists such as abbott laboratories from  abbott laboratories helped produce seven different combat art projects one such project abbott supported in collaboration with the surgeon general’s office and focused on producing medical related art for this they commissioned wellknown artists such as peter blume joseph hirsch and john steuart curry john steuart curry started his commission in early  at camp barkeley eleven miles southwest of abilene texas during his stay there he committed himself to becoming one of the soldiers he wore a uniform ate and went on bivouacs with the soldiers curry spent most of his time sketching training battalion units during bivouac problems as well as following teams through their levels of field medical evacuation he also commonly sketched the soldiers as they maneuvered their way through obstacle and infiltration courses and demonstrations in the “nazi village” and strafing while at the camp curry produced nearly a hundred sketches covering virtually all training exercises a crayon portrait of lieut col edward a zimmerman and even a large oil portrait of brig gen roy c heflebower the commanding general of the medical replacement training center sketches held by the beach museum of art the

washington dc the homestead and the oklahoma land rush were painted with oil and tempera on canvas  and installed november  by john steuart curry created during the great depression the murals are the product of president franklin d roosevelt’s new deal the two murals depict events of the time period the homestead acts and the oklahoma land run of  early sketches of figures and ideas are held by archives located at the marianna kistler beach museum of art at kansas state university the homesteadedit this mural is nine foot by  feet eight inch it represents a homestead with the typical features that make up its ideal of blessed peace happiness and potential prosperity of ensuring rural life the homestead features a mother and her daughter paring potatoes near a small garden for the family meal a young son holds the fence posts while his father drives them into the ground an older sister drives the wagon full of spikes while she also cares for the youngest child each member of the family is actively working and contributing its energies to the productive whole near the bottom left of the mural roosters chicks and chickens peck and feed near the foreground garden as bountiful reminders of their capacity to provide this frontier family with eggs the oklahoma land rushedit just two inches taller than its partner painting this nine feet two inch by  feet eight inch  mural represents another historical event from the time period the oklahoma land rush depicts the westward migration in the representation of that famous day—twelve oclock noon on april  —when the oklahoma territory was opened to homestead settlement and over twenty thousand prospective settlers rushed into the new land to stake their claimspage needed anxious but looking forward to eventual security an  pioneer mother sunbonnet intact is of greatest importance to the far left foreground of currys westwardmoving mural perched on a brokendown wagon she clutches her small son while waving and calling out to her certificateholding husband who astride their rearing horse is to ride on to claim a new farm site his hellbent competition includes a cyclist riding a high ordinary safety bicycle from the s and an overweight overdressed lady in a rocking chair she rolls back in an open wagon driven frantically by her balding husband and if nothing else lends comic relief to balance the anxious sincerity of the mother on the groundpage needed john steuart currys oklahoma land rush repeated an important theme of the time history told through the actions of common people by emphasizing the rush of figures across the land curry shared his concern with capturing the energy and vigor of american pioneers kansas state capital muralsedit one of currys most famous works are the murals designed for the kansas state capitol in topeka kansas in june  newspaper editors raised money to commission john steuart curry who was the most famous artist in kansas to paint murals in the statehouse currys design was divided into three themes first the settlement of kansas which depicted the conquistadors and the plainsmen second the life of a homesteader which would depict john brown and third pastoral prosperity which would include scenes of modern kansas curry wanted to be free to express his own ideas regarding the murals i have my own ideas about telling the story of pioneers coming into kansas i want to paint this war with nature and i want to paint the things i feel as a native kansan political controversy stalled the completion of the murals expensive italian marble slabs covered the spot in the rotunda where the eight panels depicting scenes from the life of the kansas homesteader were to be painted the legislative committee refused to move them from the wall to make way for currys mural however behind the refusal were two real issues with currys paintings the first being that currys factual details were incorrect for instance they criticized the tails of his animals calling them not natural like in currys opinion those problems could be easily fixed however with the next issue the committee had an even stronger objection and that was the image of kansan abolitionist john brown in front of a crowd of people and a tornado in particular the committee objected to the blood on john browns hands the prairie fires and tornadoes these inclusions were thought by some to show the state in a negative light due to the fact that brown who was executed for leading a raid on harpers ferry virginia in  was considered by some to be a traitor and a murderer curry tried to explain that while the blood on browns hands was not literal his acts caused bloodshed and that the tornado was a symbol of the abolitionists passion however the people of kansas saw its inclusion as a negative statement about bad weather in his presentation to the people curry expressed that he wanted to get into his pictures the irony that is the kansas people not a soft soppy presentation when rejected curry in anger left the finished murals unsigned at his death in  since currys death his murals have come to be regarded as on par with similar works done by his contemporary thomas hart benton printsedit manhunt  lithograph figge art museum davenport ia the fugitive  lithograph marianna kistler beach museum of art kansas state university manhattan  elephants

his interest in studying with harvey dunn who curry said was “making the illustrators of today in  curry met dunn and while he did not become one of dunn’s students the established artist became a mentor helping curry further his illustration education and career curry began publishing illustrations in  and continued through  when he took a hiatus from illustration writing “came to ny to be an illustrator was not a brilliant success went to paris and learned something from m schoukhareff of the russian academy learned something also from the louvre and have been trying since to carry out my ideas of how an american should paint in  john curry returned to making illustrations for books and other media and he contributed to this field until his death in  his last illustrations can be found

ranch in wyoming it was later requested by the lippincott publishing company of new york that she make it into a novel it was published in  and john steuart curry contributed fifteen drawings for the

advertising for their cigarettes curry only made two lucky strike tobacco ads grading a pile of tobacco after curing the first lucky strike ad features a woman wearing a headscarf sorting tobacco leaves grading the lighter leaf this ad depicts a farmer sorting and examining tobacco leaves inside a barn there are four original primary sketches of ideas and the layouts for these lucky strike ads

steuart curry this editorial was the sixth of eight commissioned installments for life magazines american history series that featured modern american history paintings john steuart currys hoover and the flood painting is an oil on panel and measures ½ by  inches the painting is currently located at the morris museum of art in augusta ga currys life magazine commission was solely for the reproduction rights to the painting since the magazine never intended to purchase currys painting there has been little success finding documentation regarding the financial aspects of the commission currys hoover and the flood was created to celebrate the humanitarian and relief efforts of secretary of commerce herbert hoover before his presidential election in  currys painting demonstrates many of the major scenes and events that were associated during the mississippi flood of  such as flood waters national guardsmen the red cross relief refugees stranded farm animals praying african americans and a mississippi riverboat john steuart currys work often supported the mentalities of the african american population that were common during the first half of the twentieth century hoover and the flood references several of currys previous artworks his use of a centrally positioned african american male figure appears in other works including freeing of the slaves  the fugitive  and mississippi noah  war artedit important pieces of war art include our good earth  oil on hardboard chazen museum of art university of wisconsin  farm is a battleground too  world war ii war bond poster original at figge art museum davenport ia the surgeon ca  conté crayon on paper war department commission camp barkeley tx us army medical training ca  backgroundedit main article american propaganda during world war ii the government used posters to advertise as technique during the first world war the posters bridged a gap between the government and the people by using direct and simple messages the government’s plan of advertising via posters was to stir the nation into action by engaging its people’s hearts and minds quite simply the posters were meant to inform influence and guide americans’ behavior toward a certain political ideology because these posters were to be a part of the urban environment they could be placed anywhere moreover artists were told to use objects that could stand for a whole like a flag signifying a nation or a bomb meaning war so that they would not require any text on the poster no poster text was deemed a more effective and efficient technique of advertising specifically posters were to “tell the truth”  because they engaged all americans and fostered a social movement among americans sympathetic and realistic representations of the common soldier encouraged american nationalism such that the common lives of persons were made to be heroic during the warpage needed two different schools of art did work during this time regionalists and social realist both groups of art had vastly different views but they did share the common idea of the championing the common man therefore if either group was to make art to persuade people it needed to be done in this manner although he openly opposed the possibility of a second world war john steuart currys political opinions are not known explicitly his opinions were a mystery even to his wife in an interview when asked what currys political views were she told the interviewer that her husband read the progressive matthew biagell once wrote that subject matter of an important group of paintingsas well as statements that he made suggest strongly that his interests lay in a liberalism of one sort or another his opinions of military involvement in europe were believed to be in step with the majority of americans at this time isolationism may have been most pronounced in the landlocked midwest but americans of both sexes of all ages religions and political persuasions from all ethnic groups and all religions shared in the postwar years a feeling of apathy toward europe not to mention the rest of the wretchedly quarrelsome world that bordered on disgust curry was frustrated by the possibility of war he saw the war only as a set back in the progress the nation had made since that last world war and thus ending the progress made in the world of art curry warned that the entrance into another world war would kill the renaissance that he had seen reborn after the wwi after the first world war there began a splendid resurgence in art in america and we are in the midst of this movement nowbut war will kill it before it can reach its flowering curry had shown his dread of the coming war through his painting the light of the world which depicted onlookers gazing at a coming storm it wasnt until after the attack on pearl harbor december   which caused the shift in american opinion that inspired a change in currys support of the war curry was faced with the dilemma on how to make his work matter he had the desire to reach a broader audience of people and for the first time in currys career he expressed a desire to utilize his talents in support of american troops in  he finished his first work in support of a war sponsored by abbott laboratories  to produce government sanctioned war propaganda curry finished his first work in support of any war effort he submitted an oil titled our good earth to be used in publications our good earthedit our good earth is a painting and war poster by curry that highlights the symbolic importance of the heartland to the american war effort when commissioned to do war art reeves lewenthal director of associated american artists gallery tried suggesting possible subjects for john steuart currys new sponsorship perhaps you can do a heroic figure of a soldier guarding over or fighting for the preservation of all those benefits and advantages we enjoy in our democracy or perhaps could be fighting for the preservation of our peaceful fertile farmlands can be effectively portrayed in the background or perhaps shadows of out former hero soldiers can drift into the distance behind this forceful foreground figure then again you might do a nurseor a flyeror a marineor a sailorin some symbolic composition  but curry had other ideas when he responded with it seems very doubtful whether it is strategic or desirable to use fear as the motive in picturing to them the needs of the war program our people are patriotic thousands of our young men are volunteering before they are drafted bond sales are at a high level our people expect to win the war and are prepared to pay any price that may be necessary they do not need to be threatened by some fear complex in order to do their best they are responding to incentives that are on a much higher plane and more effective than fear  instead curry fell into step with his typical subject matter and painted an agricultural subject john steuart currys our good earth shows a farmer standing in his field of wheat flanked on either side by children as wind gusts through the scene the state of the man his children and the bountiful crop register the plenty that the farm is experiencing despite the war overseas the farmers face shows his concern for the times ahead but it does not indicate any intention to depart from his land or his family for the war overseas typical of a curry work the weather alludes to the underlying stress of the war as the family stands in the field a gust of wind rips through the scene trying to uproot the children and disrupt the cropsjust as the war threatens the farmers land and family when the work was published as a war bond poster the caption our good earthkeep it ours was added inspiring the onlooker to do their part by buying war bonds to make every market day bond day later the work was used as the cover for a war bond pamphlet in addition to the keep it ours caption long may it wave was placed at the bottom of the pamphlet referencing the amber waves of grain of the song america the beautiful and the second stanza of the star spangled banner the farm is a battleground tooedit in october  shortly after he finished our good earth curry received an official request from the office of war information to make another poster he was asked to have the poster completed by november  of that year based upon the writers’ war board’s directive curry was to convey that if america lost the war to the nazis then the farmers of the nation would become enslaved curry however argued that the idea to be expressed was a correct assumption of how life was in rural america he is quoted in a letter to his dealer reeves lewenthal as saying “farmers are exerting allout effort and working  and  hours a week there is no problem as we see it out here in getting farmers to work as hard as they can for they are doing exactly this” curry then requested that the board consider developing a more positive rural theme and offered to help think of one too in doing so curry came up with an idea from a sketch he had used in a previous mural idea for the wisconsin state fair called wisconsin agriculture leads to victory he believed such a representation would be a better and more positive idea for a poster lewenthal agreed thus in the farm is a battleground too he depicts a gigantic farmer who resembles the one in our good earth he is holding a pitchfork and is standing before two soldiers he is visually connecting the activities of the farmer to those on the war front in the background curry was shown a tractor and tank both mobile and therefore representative of the war and their respective missions because he wanted to keep his work as authentic as possible curry rejected any ideas that might go against the realities of the farmers’ work for example one idea that was suggested by lewenthal was that the pitchfork be held in the same advancing motion as the soldiers’ guns curry objected and said that farming is a skilled profession having the pitchfork in such a way would seem strange and wrong combat artedit in  the corps of engineers established a war art unit to include both military and civilian artists in an effort to reveal the realities of war to the nation artist for the program were recruited in joint effort by the associated american artists organization and the war department established art committee unfortunately a little over six months into the program congress cut the funds for the art project and the military artists were reassigned to other duties some however continued to produce art through their military career additional efforts to document the war came from major companies with a history in supporting both soldiers and artists such as abbott laboratories from  abbott laboratories helped produce seven different combat art projects one such project abbott supported in collaboration with the surgeon general’s office and focused on producing medical related art for this they commissioned wellknown artists such as peter blume joseph hirsch and john steuart curry john steuart curry started his commission in early  at camp barkeley eleven miles southwest of abilene texas during his stay there he committed himself to becoming one of the soldiers he wore a uniform ate and went on bivouacs with the soldiers curry spent most of his time sketching training battalion units during bivouac problems as well as following teams through their levels of field medical evacuation he also commonly sketched the soldiers as they maneuvered their way through obstacle and infiltration courses and demonstrations in the “nazi village” and strafing while at the camp curry produced nearly a hundred sketches covering virtually all training exercises a crayon portrait of lieut col edward a zimmerman and even a large oil portrait of brig gen roy c heflebower the commanding general of the medical replacement training center sketches held by the beach museum of art the following is a list of sketches held by the beach museum of art from currys time as a combat artist

department of the interior murals in washington dc the homestead and the oklahoma land rush were painted with oil and tempera on canvas  and installed november  by john steuart curry created during the great depression the murals are the product of president franklin d roosevelt’s new deal the two murals depict events of the time period the homestead acts and the oklahoma land run of  early sketches of figures and ideas are held by archives located at the marianna kistler beach museum of art at kansas state university the homesteadedit this mural is nine foot by  feet eight inch it

feet two inch by  feet eight inch  mural represents another historical event from the time period the oklahoma land rush depicts the westward migration in the representation of that famous day—twelve oclock noon on april  —when the oklahoma territory was opened to homestead settlement and over twenty thousand prospective settlers rushed into the new land to stake their claimspage needed anxious but looking forward to eventual security an  pioneer mother sunbonnet intact is of greatest importance to the far left foreground of currys westwardmoving mural perched on a brokendown wagon she clutches her small son while waving and calling out to her certificateholding husband who astride their rearing horse is to ride on to claim a new farm site his hellbent competition includes a cyclist riding a high ordinary safety bicycle from the s and an overweight overdressed lady in a rocking chair she rolls back in an open wagon driven frantically by her balding husband and if nothing else lends comic relief to balance the anxious sincerity of the mother on the groundpage needed john steuart currys oklahoma land rush repeated an important theme of the time history told through the actions of common people by emphasizing the rush of figures across the land curry shared his concern with capturing the energy and vigor of american pioneers kansas state capital muralsedit one of currys most famous works are the murals designed for the kansas state capitol in topeka kansas in june  newspaper editors raised money to commission john steuart curry who was the most famous artist in kansas to paint murals in the statehouse currys design was divided into three themes first the settlement of kansas which depicted the conquistadors and the plainsmen second the life of a homesteader which would depict john brown and third pastoral prosperity which would include scenes of modern kansas curry wanted to be free to express his own ideas regarding the murals i have my own ideas about telling the story of pioneers coming into kansas i want to paint this war with nature and i want to paint the things i feel as a native kansan political controversy stalled the completion of the murals expensive italian marble slabs covered the spot in the rotunda where the eight panels depicting scenes from the life of the kansas homesteader were to be painted the legislative committee refused to move them from the wall to make way for currys mural however behind the refusal were two real issues with currys paintings the first being that currys factual details were incorrect for instance they criticized the tails of his animals calling them not natural like in currys opinion those problems could be easily fixed however with the next issue the committee had an even stronger objection and that was the image of kansan abolitionist john brown in front of a crowd of people and a tornado in particular the committee objected to the blood on john browns hands the prairie fires and tornadoes these inclusions were thought by some to show the state in a negative light due to the fact that brown who was executed for leading a raid on harpers ferry virginia in  was considered by some to be a traitor and a murderer curry tried to explain that while the blood on browns hands was not literal his acts caused bloodshed and that the tornado was a symbol of the abolitionists passion however the people of kansas saw its inclusion as a negative statement about bad weather in his presentation to the people curry expressed that he wanted to get into his pictures the irony that is the kansas people not a soft soppy presentation when rejected curry in anger left the finished murals unsigned at his death in  since currys death his murals have come to be regarded

in augusta ga currys life magazine commission was solely for the reproduction rights to the painting since the magazine never intended to purchase currys painting there has been little success finding documentation regarding the financial aspects of the commission currys hoover and the flood was created to celebrate the humanitarian and relief efforts of secretary of commerce herbert hoover before his presidential election in  currys painting demonstrates many of the major scenes and events that were associated during the mississippi flood of  such as flood waters national guardsmen the red cross relief refugees stranded farm animals praying african americans and a mississippi riverboat john steuart currys work often supported the mentalities of the african american population that were common during the first half of the twentieth century hoover and the flood references several of currys previous artworks his use of a centrally positioned african american male figure appears in

medical training ca  backgroundedit main article american propaganda during world war ii the government used posters to advertise as technique during the first world war the posters bridged a gap between the government and the people by using direct and simple messages the government’s plan of advertising via posters was to stir the nation into action by engaging its people’s hearts and minds quite simply the posters were meant to inform influence and guide americans’ behavior toward a certain political ideology because these posters were to be a part of the urban environment they could be placed anywhere moreover artists were told to use objects that could stand for a whole like a flag signifying a nation or a bomb meaning war so that they would not require any text on the poster no poster text was deemed a more effective and efficient technique of advertising specifically posters were to “tell the truth”  because they engaged all americans and fostered a social movement among americans sympathetic and realistic representations of the common soldier encouraged american nationalism such that the common lives of persons were made to be heroic during the warpage needed two different schools of art did work during this time regionalists and social realist both groups of art had vastly different views but they did share the common idea of the championing the common man therefore if either group was to make art to persuade people it needed to be done in this manner although he openly opposed the possibility of a second world war john steuart currys political opinions are not known explicitly his opinions were a mystery even to his wife in an interview when asked what currys political views were she told the interviewer that her husband read the progressive matthew biagell once wrote that subject matter of an important group of paintingsas well as statements that he made suggest strongly that his interests lay in a liberalism of one sort or another his opinions of military involvement in europe were believed to be in step with the majority of americans at this time isolationism may have been most pronounced in the landlocked midwest but americans of both sexes of all ages religions and political persuasions from all ethnic groups and all religions shared in the postwar years a feeling of apathy toward europe not to mention the rest of the wretchedly quarrelsome world that bordered on disgust curry was frustrated by the possibility of war he saw the war only as a set back in the progress the nation had made since that last world war and thus ending the progress made in the world of art curry warned that the entrance into another world war would kill the renaissance that he had seen reborn after the wwi after the first world war there began a splendid resurgence in art in america and we are in the midst of this movement nowbut war will kill it before it can reach its flowering curry had shown his dread of the coming war through his painting the light of the world which depicted onlookers gazing at a coming storm it wasnt until after the attack on pearl harbor december   which caused the shift in american opinion that inspired a change in currys support of the war curry was faced with the dilemma on how to make his work matter he had the desire to reach a broader audience of people and for the first time in currys career he expressed a desire to utilize his talents in support of american troops in  he finished his first work in support of a war sponsored by abbott laboratories  to produce government sanctioned war propaganda curry finished his first work in support of any war effort he submitted an oil titled our good earth to be used in publications our good earthedit our good earth is a painting and war poster by curry that highlights the symbolic importance of the heartland to the american war effort when commissioned to do war art reeves lewenthal director of associated american artists gallery tried suggesting possible subjects for john steuart currys new sponsorship perhaps you can do a heroic figure of a soldier guarding over or fighting for the preservation of all those benefits and advantages we enjoy in our democracy or perhaps could be fighting for the preservation of our peaceful fertile farmlands can be effectively portrayed in the background or perhaps shadows of out former hero soldiers can drift into the distance behind this forceful foreground figure then again you might do a nurseor a flyeror a marineor a sailorin some symbolic composition  but curry had other ideas when he responded with it seems very doubtful whether it is strategic or desirable to use fear as the motive in picturing to them the needs of the war program our people are patriotic thousands of our young men are volunteering before they are drafted bond sales are at a high level our people expect to win the war and are prepared to pay any price that may be necessary they do not need to be threatened by some fear complex in order to do their best they are responding to incentives that are on a much higher plane and more effective than fear  instead curry fell into step with his typical subject matter and painted an agricultural subject john steuart currys our good earth shows a farmer standing in his field of wheat flanked on either side by children as wind gusts through the scene the state of the man his children and the bountiful crop register the plenty that the farm is experiencing despite the war overseas the farmers face shows his concern for the times ahead but it does not indicate any intention to depart from his land or his family for the war overseas typical of a curry work the weather alludes to the underlying stress of the war as the family stands in the field a gust of wind rips through the scene trying to uproot the children and disrupt the cropsjust as the war threatens the farmers land and family when the work was published as a war bond poster the caption our good earthkeep it ours was added inspiring the onlooker to do their part by buying war bonds to make every market day bond day later the work was used as the cover for a war bond pamphlet in addition to the keep it ours caption long may it wave was placed at the bottom of the pamphlet referencing the amber waves of grain of the song america the beautiful and the second stanza of the star spangled banner the farm is a battleground tooedit in october  shortly after he finished our good earth curry received an official request from the office of war information to make another poster he was asked to have the poster completed by november  of that year based upon the writers’ war board’s directive curry was to convey that if america lost the war to the nazis then the farmers of the nation would become enslaved curry however argued that the idea to be expressed was a correct assumption of how life was in rural america he is quoted in a letter to his dealer reeves lewenthal as saying “farmers are exerting allout effort and working  and  hours a week there is no problem as we see it out here in getting farmers to work as hard as they can for they are doing exactly this” curry then requested that the board consider developing a more positive rural theme and offered to help think of one too in doing so curry came up with an idea from a sketch he had used in a previous mural idea for the wisconsin state fair called wisconsin agriculture leads to victory he believed such a representation would be a better and more positive idea for a poster lewenthal agreed thus in the farm is a battleground too he depicts a gigantic farmer who resembles the one in our good earth he is holding a pitchfork and is standing before two soldiers he is visually connecting the activities of the farmer to those on the war front in the background curry was shown a tractor and tank both mobile and therefore representative of the war and their respective missions because he wanted to keep his work as authentic as possible curry rejected any ideas that might go against the realities of the farmers’ work for example one idea that was suggested by lewenthal was that the pitchfork be held in the same advancing motion as the soldiers’ guns curry objected and said that farming is a skilled profession having the pitchfork in such a way would seem strange and wrong combat artedit in  the corps of engineers established a war art unit to include both military and civilian artists in an effort to reveal the realities of war to the nation artist for the program were recruited in joint effort by the associated american artists organization and the war department established art committee unfortunately a little over six months into the program congress cut the funds for the art project and the military artists were reassigned to other duties some however continued to produce art through their military career additional efforts to document the war came from major companies with a history in supporting both soldiers and artists such as abbott laboratories from  abbott laboratories helped produce seven different combat art projects one such project abbott supported in collaboration with the surgeon general’s office and focused on producing medical related art for this they commissioned wellknown artists such as peter blume joseph hirsch and john steuart curry john steuart curry started his commission in early  at camp barkeley eleven miles southwest of abilene texas during his stay there he committed himself to becoming one of the soldiers he wore a uniform ate and went on bivouacs with the soldiers curry spent most of his time sketching training battalion units during bivouac problems as well as following teams through their levels of field medical evacuation he also commonly sketched the soldiers as they maneuvered their way through obstacle and infiltration courses and demonstrations in the “nazi village” and strafing while at the camp curry produced nearly a hundred sketches covering virtually all training exercises a crayon portrait of lieut col edward a zimmerman and even a large oil portrait of brig gen roy c heflebower

medical training ca  backgroundedit main article american propaganda during world war ii the government used posters to advertise as technique during the first world war the posters bridged a gap between the government and the people by using direct and simple messages the government’s plan of advertising via posters was to stir the nation into action by engaging its people’s hearts and minds quite simply the posters were meant to inform influence and guide americans’ behavior toward a certain political ideology because these posters were to be a part of the urban environment they could be placed anywhere moreover artists were told to use objects that could stand for a whole like a flag signifying a nation or a bomb meaning war so that they would not require any text on the poster no poster text was deemed a more effective and efficient technique of advertising specifically posters were to “tell the truth”  because they engaged all americans and fostered a social movement among americans sympathetic and realistic representations of the common soldier encouraged american nationalism such that the common lives of persons were made to be heroic during the warpage needed two different schools of art did work during this time regionalists and social realist both groups of art had vastly different views but they did share the common idea of the championing the common man therefore if either group was to make art to persuade people it needed to be done in this manner although he openly opposed the possibility of a second world war john steuart currys political opinions are not known explicitly his opinions were a mystery even to his wife in an interview when asked what currys political views were she told the interviewer that her husband read the progressive matthew biagell once wrote that subject matter of an important group of paintingsas well as statements that he made suggest strongly that his interests lay in a liberalism of one sort or another his opinions of military involvement in europe were believed to be in step with the majority of americans at this time isolationism may have been most pronounced in the landlocked midwest but americans of both sexes of all ages religions and political persuasions from all ethnic groups and all religions shared in the postwar years a feeling of apathy toward europe not to mention the rest of the wretchedly quarrelsome world that bordered on disgust curry was frustrated by the possibility of war he saw the war only as a set back in the progress the nation had made since that last world war and thus ending the progress made in the world of art curry warned that the entrance into another world war would kill the renaissance that he had seen reborn after the wwi after the first world war there began a splendid resurgence in art in america and we are in the midst of this movement nowbut war will kill it before it can reach its flowering curry had shown his dread of the coming war through his painting the light of the world which depicted onlookers gazing at a coming storm it wasnt until after the attack on pearl harbor december   which caused the shift in american opinion that inspired a change in currys support of the war curry was faced with the dilemma on how to make his work matter he had the desire to reach a broader audience of people and for the first time in currys career he expressed a desire to utilize his talents in support of american troops in  he finished his first work in support of a war sponsored by abbott laboratories  to produce government sanctioned war propaganda curry finished his first work in support of any war effort he submitted an oil titled our good earth to be used in publications our good earthedit our good earth is a painting and war poster by curry that highlights the symbolic importance of the heartland to the american war effort when commissioned to do war art reeves lewenthal director of associated american artists gallery tried suggesting possible subjects for john steuart currys new sponsorship perhaps you can do a heroic figure of a soldier guarding over or fighting for the preservation of all those benefits and advantages we enjoy in our democracy or perhaps could be fighting for the preservation of our peaceful fertile farmlands can be effectively portrayed in the background or perhaps shadows of out former hero soldiers can drift into the distance behind this forceful foreground figure then again you might do a nurseor a flyeror a marineor a sailorin some symbolic composition  but curry had other ideas when he responded with it seems very doubtful whether it is strategic or desirable to use fear as the motive in picturing to them the needs of the war program our people are patriotic thousands of our young men are volunteering before they are drafted bond sales are at a high level our people expect to win the war and are prepared to pay any price that may be necessary they do not need to be threatened by some fear complex in order to do their best they are responding to incentives that are on a much higher plane and more effective than fear  instead curry fell into step with his typical subject matter and painted an agricultural subject john steuart currys our good earth shows a farmer standing in his field of wheat flanked on either side by children as wind gusts through the scene the state of the man his children and the bountiful crop register the plenty that the farm is experiencing despite the war overseas the farmers face shows his concern for the times ahead but it does not indicate any intention to depart from his land or his family for the war overseas typical of a curry work the weather alludes to the underlying stress of the war as the family stands in the field a gust of wind rips through the scene trying to uproot the children and disrupt the cropsjust as the war threatens the farmers land and family when the work was published as a war bond poster the caption our good earthkeep it ours was added inspiring the onlooker to do their part by buying war bonds to make every market day bond day later the work was used as the cover for a war bond pamphlet in addition to the keep it ours caption long may it wave was placed at the bottom of the pamphlet referencing the amber waves of grain of the song america the beautiful and the second stanza of the star spangled banner the farm is a battleground tooedit in october  shortly after he finished our good earth curry received an official request from the office of war information to make another poster he was asked to have the poster completed by november  of that year based upon the writers’ war board’s directive curry was to convey that if america lost the war to the nazis then the farmers of the nation would become enslaved curry however argued that the idea to be expressed was a correct assumption of how life was in rural america he is quoted in a letter to his dealer reeves lewenthal as saying “farmers are exerting allout effort and working  and  hours a week there is no problem as we see it out here in getting farmers to work as hard as they can for they are doing exactly this” curry then requested that the board consider developing a more positive rural theme and offered to help think of one too in doing so curry came up with an idea from a sketch he had used in a previous mural idea for the wisconsin state fair called wisconsin agriculture leads to victory he believed such a representation would be a better and more positive idea for a poster lewenthal agreed thus in the farm is a battleground too he depicts a gigantic farmer who resembles the one in our good earth he is holding a pitchfork and is standing before two soldiers he is visually connecting the activities of the farmer to those on the war front in the background curry was shown a tractor and tank both mobile and therefore representative of the war and their respective missions because he wanted to keep his work as authentic as possible curry rejected any ideas that might go against the realities of the farmers’ work for example one idea that was suggested by lewenthal was that the pitchfork be held in the same advancing motion as the soldiers’ guns curry objected and said that farming is a skilled profession having the pitchfork in such a way would seem strange and wrong combat artedit in  the corps of engineers established a war art unit to include both military and civilian artists in an effort to reveal the realities of war to the nation artist for the program were recruited in joint effort by the associated american artists organization and the war department established art committee unfortunately a little over six months into the program congress cut the funds for the art project and the military artists were reassigned to other duties some however continued to produce art through their military career additional efforts to document the war came from major companies with a history in supporting both soldiers and artists such as abbott laboratories from  abbott laboratories helped produce seven different combat art projects one such project abbott supported in collaboration with the surgeon general’s office and focused on producing medical related art for this they commissioned wellknown artists such as peter blume joseph hirsch and john steuart curry john steuart curry started his commission in early  at camp barkeley eleven miles southwest of abilene texas during his stay there he committed himself to becoming one of the soldiers he wore a uniform ate and went on bivouacs with the soldiers curry spent most of his time sketching training battalion units during bivouac problems as well as following teams through their levels of field medical evacuation he also commonly sketched the soldiers as they maneuvered their way through obstacle and infiltration courses and demonstrations in the “nazi village” and strafing while at the camp curry produced nearly a hundred sketches covering virtually all training exercises a crayon portrait of lieut col edward a zimmerman and even a large oil portrait of brig gen roy c heflebower

department of the interior murals in washington dc the homestead and the oklahoma land rush were painted with oil and tempera on canvas  and installed november  by john steuart curry created during the great depression the murals are the product of president franklin d roosevelt’s new deal the two murals depict events of the time period the homestead acts and the oklahoma land run of  early sketches of figures and ideas are held by archives located at the marianna kistler beach museum of art at kansas state university the homesteadedit this mural is nine foot by  feet eight inch it represents a homestead with the typical features that make up its ideal of blessed peace happiness and potential prosperity of ensuring rural life the homestead features a mother and her daughter paring potatoes near a small garden for the family meal a young son holds the fence posts while his father drives them into the ground an older sister drives the wagon full of spikes while she also cares for the youngest child each member of the family is actively working and contributing its energies to the productive whole near the bottom left of the mural roosters chicks and chickens peck and feed near the foreground garden as bountiful reminders of their capacity to provide this frontier family with eggs the oklahoma land rushedit just two inches taller than its partner painting this nine feet two inch by  feet eight inch  mural represents another historical event from the time period the oklahoma land rush depicts the westward migration in the representation of that famous day—twelve oclock noon on april  —when the oklahoma territory was opened to homestead settlement and over twenty thousand prospective settlers rushed into the new land to stake their claimspage needed anxious

lends comic relief to balance the anxious sincerity of the mother on the groundpage needed john steuart currys oklahoma land rush repeated an important theme of the time history told through the actions of common people by emphasizing the rush of figures across the land curry shared his concern with capturing the energy and vigor of american pioneers kansas state capital muralsedit one of currys most famous works are the murals designed for the kansas state capitol in topeka kansas in june  newspaper editors raised money to commission john steuart curry who was the most famous artist in kansas to paint murals in the statehouse currys design was divided into three themes first the settlement of kansas which depicted the conquistadors and the plainsmen second the life of a homesteader which would depict john brown and third pastoral prosperity which would include scenes of modern kansas curry wanted to be free to express his own ideas regarding the murals i have my own ideas about telling the story of pioneers coming into kansas i want to paint this war with nature and i want to paint the things i feel as a native kansan political controversy stalled the completion of the murals expensive italian marble slabs covered the spot in the rotunda where the eight panels depicting scenes from the life of the kansas homesteader were to be painted the legislative committee refused to move them from the wall to make way for currys mural however behind the refusal were two real issues with currys paintings the first being that currys factual details were incorrect for instance they criticized the tails of his animals calling them not natural like in currys opinion those problems could be easily fixed however with the next issue the committee had an even stronger objection and that was the image of kansan abolitionist john brown in front of a crowd of people and a tornado in particular the committee objected to the blood on john browns hands the prairie fires and tornadoes these inclusions were thought by some to show the state in a negative light due to the fact that brown who was executed for leading a raid on harpers ferry virginia in  was considered by some to be a traitor and a murderer curry tried to explain that while the blood on browns hands was not literal his acts caused bloodshed and that the tornado was a symbol of the abolitionists passion however the people of kansas saw its inclusion as a negative statement about bad weather in his presentation to the people curry expressed that he wanted to get into his pictures the irony that is the kansas people not a soft soppy presentation when rejected curry in anger left the finished murals unsigned at his death in  since currys death his murals have come to be regarded as on par with similar works done by his contemporary thomas hart benton printsedit manhunt  lithograph figge art museum davenport ia the fugitive  lithograph marianna kistler beach museum of art

about his decision to study illustration he noted his interest in studying with harvey dunn who curry said was “making the illustrators of today in  curry met dunn and while he did not become one of dunn’s students the established artist became a mentor helping curry further his illustration education and career curry began publishing illustrations in  and continued through  when he took a hiatus from illustration writing “came to ny to be an illustrator was not a brilliant success went to paris and learned something from m schoukhareff of the russian academy learned something also from the louvre and have been trying since to carry out my ideas of how an american should paint in  john curry returned to making illustrations for books and other media and he contributed to this field until his death in  his last illustrations can be found in john brown’s body a poem by stephen vincent benét published by limited editions club in  “my friend flicka” was originally written as just a short

tried suggesting possible subjects for john steuart currys new sponsorship perhaps you can do a heroic figure of a soldier guarding over or fighting for the preservation of all those benefits and advantages we enjoy in our democracy or perhaps could be fighting for the preservation of our peaceful fertile farmlands can be effectively portrayed in the background or perhaps shadows of out former hero soldiers can drift into the distance behind this forceful foreground figure then again you might do a nurseor a flyeror a marineor a sailorin some symbolic composition  but curry had other ideas when he responded with it seems very doubtful whether it is strategic or desirable to use fear as the motive in picturing to them the needs of the war program our people are patriotic thousands of our young men are volunteering before they are drafted bond sales are at a high level our people expect to win the war and are prepared to pay any price that may be necessary they do not need to be threatened by some fear complex in order to do their best they are responding to incentives that are on a much higher plane and more effective than fear  instead curry fell into step with his typical subject matter and painted an agricultural subject john steuart currys our good earth shows a farmer standing in his field of wheat flanked on either side by children as wind gusts through the scene the state of the man his children and the bountiful crop register the plenty that the farm is experiencing despite the war overseas the farmers face shows his concern for the times ahead but it does not indicate any intention to depart from his land or his family for the war overseas typical of a curry work the weather alludes to the underlying stress of the war as the family stands in the field a gust of wind rips through the scene trying to uproot the children and disrupt the cropsjust as the war threatens the farmers land and family when the work was published as a war bond poster the caption our good earthkeep it ours was added inspiring the onlooker to do their part by buying war bonds to make every market day bond day later the work was used as the cover for a war bond pamphlet in addition to the keep it ours caption long may it wave was placed at the bottom of the pamphlet referencing the amber waves of grain of the song america the beautiful and the second stanza of the star spangled banner the farm is a battleground tooedit in october  shortly after he finished our good earth curry received an official request from the office of war information to make another poster he was asked to have the poster completed by november  of that year based upon the writers’ war board’s directive curry was to convey that if america lost the war to the nazis then the farmers of the nation would become enslaved curry however argued that the idea to be expressed was a correct assumption of how life was in rural america he is quoted in a letter to his dealer reeves lewenthal as saying “farmers are exerting allout effort and working  and  hours a week there is no problem as we see it out here in getting farmers to work as hard as they can for they are doing exactly this” curry then requested that the board consider developing a more positive rural theme and offered to help think of one too in doing so curry came up with an idea from a sketch he had used in a previous mural idea for the wisconsin state fair called wisconsin agriculture leads to victory he believed such a representation would be a better and more positive idea for a poster lewenthal agreed thus in the farm is a battleground too he depicts a gigantic farmer who resembles the one in our good earth he is holding a pitchfork and is standing before two soldiers he is visually connecting the activities of the farmer to those on the war front in the background curry was shown a tractor and tank both mobile and therefore representative of the war and their respective missions because he wanted to keep his work as authentic as possible curry rejected any ideas that might go against the realities of the farmers’ work for example one idea that was suggested by lewenthal was that the pitchfork be held in the same advancing motion as the soldiers’ guns curry objected and said that farming is a skilled profession having the pitchfork in such a way would seem strange and wrong combat artedit in  the corps of engineers established a war art unit to include both military and civilian artists in an effort to reveal the realities of war to the nation artist for the program were recruited in joint effort by the associated american artists organization and the war department established art committee unfortunately a little over six months into the program congress cut the funds for the art project and the military artists were reassigned to other duties some however continued to produce art through their military career additional efforts to document the war came from major companies with a history in supporting both soldiers and artists such as abbott laboratories from  abbott laboratories helped produce seven different combat art projects one such project abbott supported in collaboration with the surgeon general’s office and focused on producing medical related art for this they commissioned wellknown artists such as peter blume joseph hirsch and john steuart curry john steuart curry started his commission in early  at camp barkeley eleven miles southwest of abilene texas during his stay there he committed himself to becoming one of the soldiers he wore a uniform ate and went on bivouacs with the soldiers curry spent most of his time sketching training battalion units during bivouac problems as well as following teams through their levels of field medical evacuation he also commonly sketched the soldiers as they maneuvered their way through obstacle and infiltration courses and demonstrations in the “nazi village” and strafing while at the camp curry produced nearly a hundred sketches covering virtually all training exercises a crayon portrait of lieut col edward a zimmerman and even a large oil portrait of brig gen roy c heflebower

department of interior muralsedit a black and white rendering of the oklahoma land rush april   by curry the work was commissioned in  and installed in the department of interior in  the united states department of the interior murals in washington dc the homestead and the oklahoma land rush were painted with oil and tempera on canvas  and installed november  by john steuart curry created during the great depression the murals are the product of president franklin d roosevelt’s new deal the two murals depict events of the time period the homestead acts and the oklahoma land run of  early sketches of figures and ideas are held by archives located at the marianna kistler beach museum of art at kansas state university the homesteadedit this mural is nine foot by  feet eight inch it represents a homestead with the typical features that make up its ideal of blessed peace happiness and potential prosperity of ensuring rural life the homestead features a mother and her daughter paring potatoes near a small garden for the family meal a young son holds the fence posts while his father drives them into the ground an older sister drives the wagon full of spikes while she also cares for the youngest child each member of the family is actively working and contributing its energies to the productive whole near the bottom left of the mural roosters chicks and chickens peck and feed near the foreground garden as bountiful reminders of their capacity to provide this frontier family with eggs the oklahoma land rushedit just two inches taller than its partner painting this nine feet two inch by  feet eight inch  mural represents another historical event from the time period the oklahoma land rush depicts the westward migration in the representation of that famous day—twelve oclock noon on april  —when the oklahoma territory was opened to homestead settlement and over twenty thousand prospective settlers rushed into the new land to stake their claimspage needed anxious but looking forward to eventual security an  pioneer mother sunbonnet intact is of greatest importance to the far left foreground of currys westwardmoving mural perched on a brokendown wagon she

riding a high ordinary safety bicycle from the s and an overweight overdressed lady in a rocking chair she rolls back in an open wagon driven frantically by her balding husband and if nothing else lends comic relief to balance the anxious sincerity of the mother on the groundpage needed john steuart currys oklahoma land rush repeated an important theme of the time history told through the actions of common people by emphasizing the rush of figures across the land curry shared his concern with capturing the energy and vigor of american pioneers kansas state capital muralsedit one of currys most famous works are the murals designed for the kansas state capitol in topeka kansas in june  newspaper editors raised money to commission john steuart curry who was the most famous artist in kansas to paint murals in the statehouse currys design was divided into three themes first the settlement of kansas which depicted the conquistadors and the plainsmen second the life of a homesteader which would depict john brown and third pastoral prosperity which would include scenes of modern kansas curry wanted to be free to express his own ideas regarding the murals i have my own ideas about telling the story of pioneers coming into kansas i want to paint this war with nature and i want to paint the things i feel as a native kansan political controversy stalled the completion of the murals expensive italian marble slabs covered the spot in the rotunda where the eight panels depicting scenes from the life of the kansas homesteader were to be painted the legislative committee refused to move them from the wall to make way for currys mural however behind the refusal were two real issues with currys paintings the first being that currys factual details were incorrect for instance they criticized the tails of his animals calling them not natural like in currys opinion those problems could be easily fixed however with the next issue the committee had an even stronger objection and that was the image of kansan abolitionist john brown in front of a crowd of people and a tornado in particular the committee objected to the blood on john browns hands the prairie fires and tornadoes these inclusions were thought by some to show the state in a negative light due to the fact that brown who was executed for leading a raid on harpers ferry virginia in  was considered by some to be a traitor and a murderer curry tried to explain that while the blood on browns hands was not literal his acts caused bloodshed and that the tornado was a symbol of the abolitionists passion however the people of kansas saw its inclusion as a negative statement about bad weather in his presentation to the people curry expressed that he wanted to get into his pictures the irony that is the kansas people not a soft soppy presentation when rejected curry in anger left the finished murals unsigned at his death in  since currys death his murals have come to be regarded as on par with similar works done by his contemporary thomas hart benton printsedit manhunt  lithograph figge art museum davenport ia the fugitive  lithograph marianna kistler beach museum of art

about his decision to study illustration he noted his interest in studying with harvey dunn who curry said was “making the illustrators of today in  curry met dunn and while he did not become one of dunn’s students the established artist became a mentor helping curry further his illustration education and career curry began publishing illustrations in  and continued through  when he took a hiatus from illustration writing “came to ny to be an illustrator was not a brilliant success went to paris and learned something from m schoukhareff of the russian academy learned something also from the louvre and have been trying since to carry out my ideas of how an american should paint in  john curry returned to making illustrations for books and other media and he contributed to this field until his death in  his last illustrations can be found in john brown’s body a poem by stephen vincent benét published by limited editions club in  “my friend flicka” was originally written as just a short story by mary o’hara while she was living on a ranch in wyoming it was later requested by the lippincott publishing company of new york that she make it into a novel it was published in  and john

cross relief refugees stranded farm animals praying african americans and a mississippi riverboat john steuart currys work often supported the mentalities of the african american population that were

wisconsin  farm is a battleground too  world war ii war bond poster original at figge art museum davenport ia the surgeon ca  conté crayon on paper war department commission camp barkeley tx us army medical training ca  backgroundedit main article american propaganda during world war ii the government used posters to advertise as technique during the first world war the posters bridged a gap between the government and the people by using direct and simple messages the government’s plan of advertising via posters was to stir the nation into action by engaging its people’s hearts and minds quite simply the posters were meant to inform influence and guide americans’ behavior toward a certain political ideology because these posters were to be a part of the urban environment they could be placed anywhere moreover artists were told to use objects that could stand for a whole like a flag signifying a nation or a bomb meaning war so that they would not require any text on the poster no poster text was deemed a more effective and efficient technique of advertising specifically posters were to “tell the truth”  because they engaged all americans and fostered a social movement among americans sympathetic and realistic representations of the common soldier encouraged american nationalism such that the common lives of persons were made to be heroic during the warpage needed two different schools of art did work during this time regionalists and social realist both groups of art had vastly different views but they did share the common idea of the championing the common man therefore if either group was to make art to persuade people it needed to be done in this manner although he openly opposed the possibility of a second world war john steuart currys political opinions are not known explicitly his opinions were a mystery even to his wife in an interview when asked what currys political views were she told the interviewer that her husband read the progressive matthew biagell once wrote that subject matter of an important group of paintingsas well as statements that he made suggest strongly that his interests lay in a liberalism of one sort or another his opinions of military involvement in europe were believed to be in step with the majority of americans at this time isolationism may have been most pronounced in the landlocked midwest but americans of both sexes of all ages religions and political persuasions from all ethnic groups and all religions shared in the postwar years a feeling of apathy toward europe not to mention the rest of the wretchedly quarrelsome world that bordered on disgust curry was frustrated by the possibility of war he saw the war only as a set back in the progress the nation had made since that last world war and thus ending the progress made in the world of art curry warned that the entrance into another world war would kill the renaissance that he had seen reborn after the wwi after the first world war there began a splendid resurgence in art in america and we are in the midst of this movement nowbut war will kill it before it can reach its flowering curry had shown his dread of the coming war through his painting the light of the world which depicted onlookers gazing at a coming storm it wasnt until after the attack on pearl harbor december   which caused the shift in american opinion that inspired a change in currys support of the war curry was faced with the dilemma on how to make his work matter he had the desire to reach a broader audience of people and for the first time in currys career he expressed a desire to utilize his talents in support of american troops in  he finished his first work in support of a war sponsored by abbott laboratories  to produce government sanctioned war propaganda curry finished his first work in support of any war effort he submitted an oil titled our good earth to be used in publications our good earthedit our good earth is a painting and war
