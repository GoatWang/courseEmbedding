estate investment trusts “reits” allow individuals to invest in largescale incomeproducing real estate a reit is a company that owns and typically operates incomeproducing real estate or related assets these may include office buildings shopping malls apartments hotels resorts selfstorage facilities warehouses and mortgages or loans unlike other real estate companies a reit does not develop real estate properties to resell them instead a reit buys and develops properties primarily to operate them as part of its own investment portfolio why would somebody invest in reits reits provide a way for individual investors to earn a share of the income produced through commercial real estate ownership – without actually having to go out and buy commercial real estate what types of reits are there many reits are registered with the sec and are publicly traded on a stock exchange these are known as publicly traded reits others may be registered with the sec but are not publicly traded these are known as non traded reits also known as nonexchange traded reits this is one of the most important distinctions among the various kinds of reits before investing in a reit you should understand whether or not it is publicly traded and how this could affect the benefits and risks to you what are the benefits and risks of reits reits offer a way to include real estate in one’s investment portfolio additionally some reits may offer higher dividend yields than some other investments but there are some risks especially with nonexchange traded reits because they do not trade on a stock exchange nontraded reits involve special risks lack of liquidity nontraded reits are illiquid investments they generally cannot be sold readily on the open market if you need to sell an asset to raise money quickly you may not be able to do so with shares of a nontraded reit share value transparency while the market price of a publicly traded reit is readily accessible it can be difficult to determine the value of a share of a nontraded reit nontraded reits typically do not provide an estimate of their value per share until  months after their offering closes this may be years after you have made your investment as a result for a significant time period you may be unable to assess the value of your nontraded reit investment and its volatility distributions may be paid from offering proceeds and borrowings investors may be attracted to nontraded reits by their relatively high dividend yields compared to those of publicly traded reits unlike publicly traded reits however nontraded reits frequently pay distributions in excess of their funds from operations to do so they may use offering proceeds and borrowings this practice which is typically not used by publicly traded reits reduces the value of the shares and the cash available to the company to purchase additional assets conflicts of interest nontraded reits typically have an external manager instead of their own employees this can lead to potential conflicts of interests with shareholders for example the reit may pay the external manager significant fees based on the amount of property acquisitions and assets under management these fee incentives may not necessarily align with the interests of shareholders how to buy and sell reits you can invest in a publicly traded reit which is listed on a major stock exchange by purchasing shares through a broker you can purchase shares of a nontraded reit through a broker that participates in the nontraded reit’s offering you can also purchase shares
