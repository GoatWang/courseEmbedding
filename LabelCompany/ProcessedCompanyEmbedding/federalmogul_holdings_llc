pokal industrial spark plug federalmogul powertrain’s new pokal industrial spark plug has unprecedented mechanical and electrical strength thanks to a new ‘ushaped’ core nose on the insulator   federalmogul llc unique insulator core nose design provides unprecedented mechanical and electrical strength southfield mich march   globe newswire  federalmogul powertrain has introduced a new industrial spark plug that has unprecedented mechanical and electrical strength thanks to a new ‘ushaped’ core nose on the insulator the pokal spark plug offers increased robustness for use in new engine applications with high peak cylinder pressures while also enabling the use of larger electrodes providing increased service life and enhanced performance “the geometric constraints of a mm plug make it more difficult to meet the levels of robustness and durability possible with an mm product but we have achieved this with our new pokal spark plug” said gian maria olivetti chief technology officer federalmogul powertrain “the unique shape of the insulator core nose increases its resistance to mechanical pressure waves allowing oems to use more aggressive combustion strategies for improved engine efficiency without reducing spark plug life” conventional insulators have a conical nose the shape of which defines the heat range of the plug and ultimately limits the thermal extraction and electrical properties the nose of the pokal spark plug incorporates a cupshaped cavity around the center electrode improving both the electrical and mechanical strength  this shape allows the plug to better withstand increased voltage demand requirements in addition to a more aggressive combustion setting with higher peak cylinder pressures the pokal spark plug has been released for use in engines rated between  kw and  kw and has been in production since  its first application is with a major european industrial engine manufacturer but the technology is of interest worldwide for marine offhighway and stationary industrial engines using gaseous fuels including natural gas landfill gas and biogas “there is significant market demand for costeffective plugs wrapped in m packaging but they must be technically capable in order to meet increasing efficiency and service life requirements of current and future engine applications” explained andrew stamper director global sales and engineering industrial ignition federalmogul powertrain “federalmogul powertrain’s pokal spark plug brings a new higher level of capability and robustness offering to this important market sector” federalmogul powertrain’s industrial ignition products are sold under the federalmogul and champion® brands globally and are industryleading technologies servicing all heavyduty and

object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate
