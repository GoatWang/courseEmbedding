direct competition with them many of these companies may have a greater more established customer base than us we will likely lose business to such companies we foresee to continue to face challenges

operations temir corp has not yet entered the market and has no market penetration to date once we have entered the market we will be one of many participants in the tourism industry many established yet well financed entities are currently active in tourism nearly all temir corps competitors have significantly greater financial resources technical expertise and managerial capabilities than temir

shareholder liability is not negated by the express terms of the contract claims for taxes and certain statutory liabilities our shareholders may be personally liable to the extent that those claims

material federal income tax considerations the following section summarizes the material federal income tax issues that you may consider relevant relating to our taxation as a reit under the code and the acquisition ownership and disposition of our common preferred and depositary shares if we offer one or more additional series of common shares or preferred shares debt securities depositary shares or warrants to purchase debt or equity securities the prospectus supplement would include information about additional material us federal income tax considerations to holders of any of the offered securities because this section is a summary it does not address all of the tax issues that may be important to you for example the discussion of the tax treatment of our shareholders addresses only common or preferred shares held as capital assets generally property held for investment within the meaning of section  of the code this discussion is based on current law and does not purport to deal with all aspects of us federal income taxation that may be relevant to a prospective shareholder in light of its particular circumstances in addition this section does not address the tax issues that may be important to certain types of shareholders that are subject to special treatment under the federal income tax laws such as financial institutions brokers dealers in securities and commodities insurance companies former us citizens or longterm residents regulated investment companies real estate investment trusts taxexempt organizations except to the extent discussed in  taxation of taxexempt us shareholders below controlled foreign corporations passive foreign investment companies persons that acquire shares in connection with employment or other performance of personal services persons subject to the alternative minimum tax persons that are or that hold their shares through partnerships or other passthrough entities persons whose functional currency is not the us dollar persons that hold shares as part of a straddle hedge conversion synthetic security or constructive sale transaction for us federal income tax purposes persons that purchase or sell shares as part of a wash sale for tax purposes or nonus individuals and foreign corporations except to the extent discussed in  taxation of nonus shareholders below in addition this discussion is general in nature and is not exhaustive of all possible tax considerations nor does it address any aspect of state local or foreign taxation or any us federal tax other than the income tax and only to the extent specifically provided herein certain excise taxes potentially applicable to reits this summary is based upon the code the regulations of the us department of treasury treasury promulgated thereunder and judicial and administrative rulings now in effect all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations possibly with retroactive effect if a partnership including an entity or arrangement that is treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes is a beneficial owner of our shares the treatment of the partnership and partners in the partnership will generally depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership partnerships holding shares and partners in such partnerships should consult their tax advisors with regard to the us federal income tax treatment of an investment in our shares prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the specific federal state local foreign and other tax consequences to them of the acquisition ownership and disposition of our common or preferred shares our election to be taxed as a reit and the effect of potential changes in applicable tax laws taxation of the company the statements in this section are based on the current federal income tax laws governing our qualification as a reit we cannot assure you that new laws interpretations of laws or court decisions any of which may take effect retroactively will not cause any statement in this section to be inaccurate we elected to be taxed as a reit under the federal income tax laws when we filed our  federal income tax return we have been organized and have operated in a manner intended to qualify as a reit and we intend to continue to operate in that manner this section discusses the laws governing the federal income tax treatment of a reit and its shareholders these laws are highly technical and complex    table of contents in the opinion of our tax counsel pillsbury winthrop shaw pittman llp i we qualified as a reit under sections  through  of the code with respect to each of our taxable years ended through december   and ii we are organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification as a reit under the code and our current method of operation and ownership will enable us to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a reit for the current taxable year and for future taxable years provided that we have operated and continue to operate in accordance with various assumptions and factual representations made by us concerning our diversity of share ownership business properties and operations we may not however have met or continue to meet such requirements you should be aware that opinions of counsel are not binding on the internal revenue service irs or any court our qualification as a reit depends on our ability to meet on a continuing basis certain qualification tests set forth in the federal tax laws those qualification tests involve the percentage of income that we earn from specified sources the percentage of our assets that fall within certain categories the diversity of the ownership of our shares and the percentage of our earnings that we distribute we describe the reit qualification tests in more detail below pillsbury winthrop shaw pittman llp will not monitor our compliance with the requirements for reit qualification on an ongoing basis accordingly our actual operating results may not satisfy the qualification tests pillsbury winthrop shaw pittman llps opinion does not foreclose the possibility that we may have to use one or more of the reit savings provisions described below which would require us to pay an excise or penalty tax which could be material in order for us to maintain our reit qualification for a discussion of the tax treatment of us and our shareholders if we fail to qualify as a reit see  requirements for reit qualification  failure to qualify as a reit we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on the taxable income that we distribute to our shareholders the benefit of that tax treatment is that it avoids the double taxation ie at both the corporate and shareholder levels that generally results from owning shares in a subchapter c corporation however we will be subject to federal tax in the following circumstances        we will pay federal income tax on taxable income including net capital gain that we do not distribute to our shareholders during or within a specified time period after the calendar year in which the income is earned        we may be subject to the alternative minimum tax on any items of tax preference that we do not distribute or allocate to our shareholders        we will pay income tax at the highest corporate rate on i net income from the sale or other disposition of property acquired through foreclosure or after a default on a loan secured by the property or a lease of the property foreclosure property that we hold primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business and ii other nonqualifying income from foreclosure property        we will pay a  tax on net income from certain sales or other dispositions of property other than foreclosure property that we hold primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business prohibited transactions        our subsidiaries that are c corporations including our taxable reit subsidiaries generally will be required to pay federal corporate income tax on their earnings        we will pay a  excise tax on transactions with a taxable reit subsidiary that are not conducted on an armslength basis        if we fail to satisfy the  gross income test or the  gross income test as described below under requirements for reit qualification  income tests but nonetheless continue to qualify as a reit because we meet certain other requirements we will pay a  tax on i the gross income attributable to the greater of the amount by which we fail respectively the  or  gross income test multiplied in either case by ii a fraction intended to reflect our profitability        if we fail in more than a de minimis fashion to satisfy one or more of the asset tests for any quarter of a taxable year but nonetheless continue to qualify as a reit because we qualify under certain relief provisions we may be required to pay a tax of the greater of  or a tax computed at the highest corporate rate on the amount of net income generated by the assets causing the failure from the date of failure until the assets are disposed of or we otherwise return to compliance with the asset test        if we fail to satisfy one or more of the requirements for reit qualification other than the income tests or the asset tests we nevertheless may avoid termination of our reit election in such year if the failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect but we would also be required to pay a penalty of  for each failure to satisfy the reit qualification requirements    table of contents      if we fail to distribute during a calendar year at least the sum of i  of our reit ordinary income for such year ii  of our reit capital gain net income for such year and iii any undistributed taxable income from prior periods we will pay a nondeductible  excise tax on the excess of such required distribution over a the amount we actually distributed plus b retained amounts on which corporatelevel tax was paid by us        we may be required to pay monetary penalties to the irs in certain circumstances including if we fail to meet recordkeeping requirements intended to monitor our compliance with the rules relating to the composition of a reits shareholders        we may elect to retain and pay income tax on our net longterm capital gain or        if we acquire any asset from a c corporation ie a corporation generally subject to full corporatelevel tax in a merger or other transaction in which we acquire a carryover basis in the asset ie basis determined by reference to the c corporations basis in the asset or another asset and no election is made for the transaction to be taxable on a current basis then if we recognize gain on the sale or disposition of such asset during the year period after we acquire such asset we will pay tax at the highest regular corporate rate applicable on the lesser of i the amount of gain that we recognize at the time of the sale or disposition and ii the amount of gain that we would have recognized if we had sold the asset at the time we acquired the asset requirements for reit qualification to qualify as a reit we must meet the following requirements      we are managed by one or more trustees or directors      our beneficial ownership is evidenced by transferable shares or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest      we would be taxable as a domestic corporation but for sections  through  of the code      we are neither a financial institution nor an insurance company subject to certain provisions of the code      at least  persons are beneficial owners of our shares or ownership certificates      not more than  in value of our outstanding shares or ownership certificates is owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals as defined in the code to include certain entities during the last half of any taxable year the  rule      we elect to be a reit or have made such election for a previous taxable year and satisfy all relevant filing and other administrative requirements established by the irs that must be met to elect and maintain reit status      we use a calendar year for federal income tax purposes and comply with the record keeping requirements of the code and the related regulations of the treasury and      we meet certain other qualification tests described below regarding the nature of our income and assets and the amount of our distributions to shareholders we must meet requirements  through  during our entire taxable year and must meet requirement  during at least  days of a taxable year of  months or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than  months if we comply with all the requirements for ascertaining the ownership of our outstanding shares in a taxable year and have no reason to know that we violated the  rule we will be deemed to have satisfied the  rule for such taxable year for purposes of determining share ownership under the  rule an individual generally includes a supplemental unemployment compensation benefits plan a private foundation or a portion of a trust permanently set aside or used exclusively for charitable purposes an individual however generally does not include a trust that is a qualified employee pension or profit sharing trust under code section a and beneficiaries of such a trust will be treated as holding our shares in proportion to their actuarial interests in the trust for purposes of the  rule    table of contents we believe we have issued sufficient shares with sufficient diversity of ownership to satisfy requirements  and  set forth above in addition our declaration of trust restricts the ownership and transfer of our shares so that we should continue to satisfy requirements  and  the provisions of our declaration of trust restricting the ownership and transfer of our shares are described in description of shares of beneficial ownershiprestrictions on ownership and transfer we currently have several direct corporate subsidiaries and may have additional corporate subsidiaries in the future a corporation that is a qualified reit subsidiary is not treated as a corporation separate from its parent reit all assets liabilities and items of income deduction and credit of a qualified reit subsidiary are treated as assets liabilities and items of income deduction and credit of the reit a qualified reit subsidiary is a corporation all of the capital stock of which is owned by the parent reit unless we and the subsidiary have jointly elected to have it treated as a taxable reit subsidiary in which case it is treated separately from us and will be subject to federal corporate income taxation thus in applying the requirements described herein any qualified reit subsidiary of ours will be ignored and all assets liabilities and items of income deduction and credit of such subsidiary will be treated as our assets liabilities and items of income deduction and credit we believe all of our direct corporate subsidiaries are qualified reit subsidiaries except for those that would qualify as taxable reit subsidiaries or subsidiary reits accordingly our qualified reit subsidiaries are not subject to federal corporate income taxation though they may be subject to state and local taxation an unincorporated domestic entity such as a partnership or limited liability company that has a single beneficial owner generally is not treated as an entity separate from its owner for federal income tax purposes similar to a qualified reit subsidiary all assets liabilities and items of income deduction and credit of such a disregarded entity are treated as assets liabilities and items of income deduction and credit of the owner an unincorporated domestic entity such as a partnership or a limited liability company with two or more beneficial owners is generally treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes a reit is treated as owning its proportionate share of the assets of any partnership which includes any limited liability company treated as a partnership in which it is a partner and as earning its allocable share of the gross income of the partnership for purposes of the applicable reit qualification tests thus our proportionate share of the assets and items of income of any partnership or limited liability company treated as a partnership in which we have acquired or will acquire an interest directly or indirectly are treated as our assets and gross income for purposes of applying the various reit qualification requirements our proportionate share is generally determined for these purposes based on our percentage interest in partnership equity capital subject to special rules relating to the  asset test described below income tests  we must satisfy two gross income tests annually to maintain our qualification as a reit        at least  of our gross income excluding gross income from prohibited transactions cancellation of indebtedness certain real estate liability hedges and certain foreign currency hedges entered into and certain recognized real estate foreign exchange gains for each taxable year must consist of defined types of income that we derive directly or indirectly from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property or qualified temporary investment income the  gross income test qualifying income for purposes of the  gross income test includes rents from real property interest on debt secured by mortgages on real property or on interests in real property gain from the sale of real estate assets and dividends or other distributions on and gain from the sale of shares in other reits and        at least  of our gross income excluding gross income from prohibited transactions cancellation of indebtedness certain real estate liability hedges and certain foreign currency hedges entered into and certain recognized passive foreign exchange gains for each taxable year must consist of income that is qualifying income for purposes of the  gross income test dividends other types of interest gain from the sale or disposition of stock or securities or any combination of the foregoing the  gross income test    table of contents the following paragraphs discuss the specific application of these tests to us rental income  our primary source of income derives from leasing properties there are various limitations on whether rent that we receive from real property that we own and lease to tenants will qualify as rents from real property which is qualifying income for purposes of the  and  gross income tests under the reit tax rules        if the rent is based in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person although generally rent may be based on a fixed percentage or percentages of receipts or sales the rent will not qualify as rents from real property our leases provide for either fixed rent sometimes with scheduled escalations or a fixed minimum rent and a percentage of gross receipts in excess of some threshold we have not entered into any lease based in whole or part on the net income of any person and on an ongoing basis will use our best efforts to avoid entering into such arrangements unless in either instance we have determined or we determine in our discretion that such arrangements will not jeopardize our status as a reit        except in certain limited circumstances involving taxable reit subsidiaries if we or someone who owns  or more of our shares owns  or more of a tenant from whom we receive rent the tenant is deemed a related party tenant and the rent paid by the related party tenant will not qualify as rents from real property our ownership and the ownership of a tenant is determined based on direct indirect and constructive ownership the constructive ownership rules generally provide that if  or more in value of our shares are owned directly or indirectly by or for any person we are considered as owning the shares owned directly or indirectly by or for such person the applicable attribution rules however are highly complex and difficult to apply and we may inadvertently enter into leases with tenants who through application of such rules will constitute related party tenants in such event rent paid by the related party tenant will not qualify as rents from real property which may jeopardize our status as a reit we believe that we have not leased property to any related party tenant except where we may rent to certain taxable reit subsidiaries as described below or where we have determined in our discretion that the rent received from such related party tenant is not material and will not jeopardize our status as a reit on an ongoing basis we will use our best efforts not to rent any property to a related party tenant taking into account the applicable constructive ownership rules unless we determine in our discretion that the rent received from such related party tenant will not jeopardize our status as a reit        in the case of certain rent from a taxable reit subsidiary which would but for this exception be considered rent from a related party tenant the space leased to the taxable reit subsidiary must be part of a property at least  of which is rented to persons other than taxable reit subsidiaries and related party tenants and the amounts of rent paid to us by the taxable reit subsidiary must be substantially comparable to the rents paid by such other persons for comparable space on an ongoing basis we use and will use our best efforts to ensure that all space leased to our taxable reit subsidiaries meets these conditions unless we determine in our discretion that the related party rent received from a taxable reit subsidiary will not jeopardize our status as a reit        if the rent attributable to any personal property leased in connection with a lease of property is more than  of the total rent received under the lease all of the rent attributable to the personal property will fail to qualify as rents from real property in general we have not leased a significant amount of personal property under our current leases if any incidental personal property has been leased we believe that rent under each lease from the personal property has been no more than  of total rent from that lease and on an ongoing basis we will use our best efforts to avoid leasing personal property in connection with a future lease except where rent from the personal property is no more than  of total rent from that lease unless in either instance we have determined or we determine in our discretion that the amount of disqualified rent attributable to the personal property will not jeopardize our status as a reit        in general if we furnish or render services to our tenants other than through a taxable reit subsidiary or an independent contractor who is adequately compensated and from whom we do not derive revenue the income received from the tenants may not be deemed rents from real property we may provide services directly if the services are usually or customarily rendered in connection with the rental of space for occupancy only and are not otherwise considered to be provided for the tenants convenience in addition we may render directly a de minimis amount of noncustomary services to the tenants of a property without disqualifying the income as rents from real property as long as our income from the services does not exceed  of our income from the related property we believe that we have not provided services to leased properties that have caused rents to be disqualified as rents from real property and on an ongoing basis in the future we will use our best efforts to determine in our discretion that any services provided will not cause rents to be disqualified as rents from real property or unless in either instance we have determined or we determine in our discretion that the amount of disqualified rent resulting from such services will not jeopardize our status as a reit    table of contents based on and subject to the foregoing we believe that rent from our leases should generally qualify as rents from real property for purposes of the  and  gross income tests except in amounts that should not jeopardize our status as a reit as described above however the irs may assert successfully a contrary position and therefore prevent us from qualifying as a reit interest for purposes of the gross income tests the term interest generally does not include any amount received or accrued directly or indirectly if the determination of all or some of the amount depends in any way on the income or profits of any person however an amount received or accrued generally will not be excluded from the term interest solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage or percentages of receipts or sales if a loan contains a provision that entitles us to a percentage of the borrowers gain upon the sale of the real property securing the loan or a percentage of the appreciation in the propertys value as of a specific date income attributable to that loan provision will be treated as gain from the sale of the property securing the loan which generally is qualifying income for purposes of both gross income tests we may from time to time hold mortgage debt interest on debt secured by a mortgage on real property or on interests in real property including for this purpose discount points prepayment penalties loan assumption fees and late payment charges that are not compensation for services generally is qualifying income for purposes of the  gross income test however in the case of acquisition of an existing loan if the loan is secured by real property and other property and the highest principal amount of the loan outstanding during a taxable year exceeds the fair market value of the real property securing the loan as of the date we agreed to acquire the loan then a portion of the interest income from such loan will not be qualifying income for purposes of the  gross income test but will be qualifying income for purposes of the  gross income test the portion of the interest income that will not be qualifying income for purposes of the  gross income test will be equal to the portion of the principal amount of the loan that is not secured by real property  that is the amount by which the loan principal exceeds the value of the real estate that is security for the loan as of the date we agreed to acquire the loan dividends our share of any dividends received from any corporation including any taxable reit subsidiary but excluding any reit in which we own an equity interest will qualify for purposes of the  gross income test but not for purposes of the  gross income test our share of any dividends received from any other reit in which we own an equity interest will be qualifying income for purposes of both gross income tests tax on income from property acquired in foreclosure we will be subject to tax at the maximum corporate rate on any income from foreclosure property other than income that would be qualifying income for purposes of the  gross income test less expenses directly connected to the production of such income however gross income from foreclosure property will qualify under the  and  gross income tests foreclosure property is any real property including interests in real property and any personal property incident to such real property        that is acquired by a reit at a foreclosure sale or having otherwise become the owner or in possession of the property by agreement or process of law after a default or imminent default on a lease of such property or on a debt owed to the reit secured by the property        for which the related loan was acquired by the reit at a time when default was not imminent or anticipated and        for which the reit makes a proper election to treat the property as foreclosure property a reit will not be considered to have foreclosed on a property where it takes control of the property as a mortgageeinpossession and cannot receive any profit or sustain any loss except as a creditor of the mortgagor generally property acquired as described above ceases to be foreclosure property on the earlier of        the last day of the third taxable year following the taxable year in which the reit acquired the property or longer if an extension is granted by the secretary of the treasury        the first day on which a lease is entered into with respect to such property that by its terms will give rise to income that does not qualify under the  gross income test or any amount is received or accrued directly or indirectly pursuant to a lease entered into on or after such day that will give rise to income that does not qualify under the  gross income test    table of contents      the first day on which any construction takes place on such property other than completion of a building or any other improvement where more than  of the construction of such building or other improvement was completed before default became imminent or        the first day that is more than  days after the day on which such property was acquired by the reit and the property is used in a trade or business that is conducted by the reit other than through an independent contractor from whom the reit itself does not derive or receive any income tax on prohibited transactions a reit will incur a  tax on net income taking into account foreign currency gains and losses derived from any prohibited transaction a prohibited transaction generally is a sale or other disposition of property other than foreclosure property that the reit holds primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business the prohibited transaction rules do not apply to property held by a taxable reit subsidiary of a reit we believe that none of our assets other than certain assets held through our taxable reit subsidiaries are held for sale to customers and that a sale of any such asset would not be in the ordinary course of our business whether a reit holds an asset primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business depends however on the facts and circumstances in effect from time to time including those related to a particular asset the code provides a safe harbor that if met by us allows us to avoid being treated as engaged in a prohibited transaction in order to meet the safe harbor i we must have held the property for at least  years and in the case of property which consists of land or improvements not acquired through foreclosure we must have held the property for  years for the production of rental income ii we must not have made aggregate expenditures includible in the basis of the property during the year period preceding the date of sale that exceed  of the net selling price of the property and iii during the taxable year the property is disposed of we must not have made more than  property sales or alternatively the aggregate adjusted basis or fair market value of all of the properties sold by us during the taxable year must not exceed  of the aggregate adjusted basis or  of the fair market value respectively of all of our assets as of the beginning of the taxable year if the  sale limitation in iii above is not satisfied substantially all of the marketing and development expenditures with respect to the property must be made through an independent contractor from whom we do not derive or receive any income we believe we have complied with the terms of the safe harbor provision and we will attempt to comply with the terms of the safe harbor in the future except where we determine in our discretion that a particular transaction will avoid prohibited transaction treatment regardless of the safe harbor we may fail to comply with the safeharbor provision and may sell or dispose of property that could be characterized as property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business tax and deduction limits on certain transactions with taxable reit subsidiaries a reit will incur a  tax on certain transactions between a reit and a taxable reit subsidiary to the extent the transactions are not on an armslength basis in addition under certain circumstances the interest paid by a taxable reit subsidiary to the reit may not be deductible by the taxable reit subsidiary we believe that none of the transactions we have had with our taxable reit subsidiaries will give rise to the  tax and that none of our taxable reit subsidiaries will be subject to the interest deduction limits hedging transactions except to the extent provided by treasury regulations any income we derive from a hedging transaction which may include entering into interest rate swaps caps and floors options to purchase these items and futures and forward contracts which is clearly identified as such as specified in the code and treasury regulations including gain from the sale or disposition of such a transaction will not constitute gross income for purposes of either the  or  gross income test and therefore will be exempt from these tests but only to the extent that the transaction hedges indebtedness incurred or to be incurred by us to acquire or carry real estate assets or is entered into primarily to manage the risk of foreign currency fluctuations with respect to qualifying income under the  or  gross income test income from any hedging transaction not described above will likely be treated as nonqualifying for both the  and  gross income tests likekind exchanges we may dispose of properties in transactions intended to qualify as likekind exchanges under the code such likekind exchanges are intended to result in the deferral of gain for federal income tax purposes the failure of any such transaction to qualify as a likekind exchange could require us to pay federal income tax possibly including the  prohibited transaction tax depending on the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction    table of contents relief from consequences of failing to meet income tests  if we fail to satisfy one or both of the  and  gross income tests for any taxable year we nevertheless may qualify as a reit for such year if we qualify for relief under certain provisions of the code those relief provisions generally will be available if our failure to meet such tests is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect and we file a schedule of the sources of our income in accordance with regulations prescribed by the treasury we may not qualify for the relief provisions in all circumstances in addition as discussed above in   taxation of the company even if the relief provisions apply we would incur a  tax on gross income to the extent we fail the  or  gross income test whichever amount is greater multiplied by a fraction intended to reflect our profitability asset tests to maintain our qualification as a reit we also must satisfy the following asset tests at the close of each quarter of each taxable year        at least  of the value of our total assets must consist of cash or cash items including certain receivables and money market funds us government securities real estate assets or qualifying temporary investments the  asset test        real estate assets include interests in real property interests in mortgages on real property and stock in other reits we believe that our properties qualify as real estate assets        interests in real property include an interest in mortgage loans or land and improvements thereon such as buildings or other inherently permanent structures including items that are structural components of such buildings or structures a leasehold of real property and an option to acquire real property or a leasehold of real property        qualifying temporary investments are investments in stock or debt instruments during the oneyear period following our receipt of new capital that we raise through equity or longterm at least fiveyear debt offerings        for investments not included in the  asset test a the value of our interest in any one issuers securities which does not include our equity ownership of other reits any taxable reit subsidiary or any qualified reit subsidiary may not exceed  of the value of our total assets the  asset test b we may not own more than  of the voting power or value of any one issuers outstanding securities which does not include our equity ownership in other reits any taxable reit subsidiary or any qualified reit subsidiary the  asset test c the value of our securities in one or more taxable reit subsidiaries may not exceed  of the value of our total assets and d no more than  of the value of our total assets may consist of the securities of taxable reit subsidiaries and our assets that are not qualifying assets for purposes of the  asset test for purposes of the  asset test that relates to value the following are not treated as securities i loans to individuals and estates ii securities issued by reits iii accrued obligations to pay rent iv certain debt meeting the definition of straight debt if neither we nor a taxable reit subsidiary that we control hold more than  of the issuers securities that do not qualify as straight debt and v debt issued by a partnership if the partnership meets the  gross income test with respect to its own gross income in addition solely for purposes of the  asset test that relates to value the determination of our interest in the assets of a partnership in which we own an interest will be based on our proportionate interest in any securities issued by the partnership excluding for this purpose certain securities described in the code we intend to select future investments so as to comply with the asset tests as described above we may from time to time hold mortgage debt mortgage loans will generally qualify as real estate assets for purposes of the  asset test to the extent that they are secured by real property however if a loan is secured by real property and other property and the highest principal amount of a loan outstanding during a taxable year exceeds the fair market value of the real property securing the loan as of the date we agreed to acquire the loan then a portion of such loan likely will not be a qualifying real estate asset under current law it is not clear how to determine what portion of such a loan will be treated as a real estate asset under recently issued guidance the irs has stated that it will not challenge a reits treatment of a loan as being in part a real estate asset for purposes of the  asset test if the reit treats the loan as being a qualifying real estate asset in an amount equal to the lesser of i the greater of a the current fair market value of the real property securing the loan or b the fair market value of such property on the date the reit acquires the loan or ii the fair market value of the loan    table of contents if we fail to satisfy the asset tests at the end of a calendar quarter we would not lose our reit status if i we satisfied the asset tests at the close of the preceding calendar quarter and ii the discrepancy between the value of our assets and the asset test requirements arose from changes in the market values of our assets and was not wholly or partly caused by the acquisition of one or more nonqualifying assets if we did not satisfy the condition described in clause ii of the preceding sentence we still could avoid disqualification as a reit by eliminating any discrepancy within  days after the close of the calendar quarter in which the discrepancy arose relief from consequences of failing to meet asset tests  if we fail to satisfy one or more of the asset tests for any quarter of a taxable year we nevertheless may qualify as a reit for such year if we qualify for relief under certain provisions of the code those relief provisions are available for failures of the  asset test and the  asset test if i the failure is due to the ownership of assets that do not exceed the lesser of  of our total assets or  million and ii the failure is corrected or we otherwise return to compliance with the applicable asset test within  months following the quarter in which it was discovered in addition should we fail to satisfy any of the asset tests other than failures addressed in the previous sentence we may nevertheless qualify as a reit for such year if i the failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect ii we file a schedule with a description of each asset causing the failure in accordance with regulations prescribed by the treasury iii the failure is corrected or we otherwise return to compliance with the asset tests within  months following the quarter in which the failure was discovered and iv we pay a tax consisting of the greater of  or a tax computed at the highest corporate rate on the amount of net income generated by the assets causing the failure from the date of failure until the assets are disposed of or we otherwise return to compliance with the asset tests we may not qualify for the relief provisions in all circumstances distribution requirements  each taxable year we must distribute dividends other than capital gain dividends and deemed distributions of retained capital gain to our shareholders in an aggregate amount at least equal to  the sum of  of a our reit taxable income computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain and b our net income after tax if any from foreclosure property minus  certain items of noncash income we generally must pay such distributions in the taxable year to which they relate or in the following taxable year if we i declare a dividend in one of the last three months of the calendar year to which the dividend relates which is payable to shareholders of record as determined in one of such months and pay the distribution during january of the following taxable year or ii declare the distribution before we timely file our federal income tax return for such year and pay the distribution on or before the first regular dividend payment date after such declaration we will pay federal income tax at regular corporate rates on taxable income including net capital gain that we do not distribute to shareholders furthermore we will incur a  nondeductible excise tax if we fail to distribute during a calendar year or in the case of distributions with declaration and record dates falling in the last three months of the calendar year by the end of january following such calendar year at least the sum of   of our reit ordinary income for such year   of our reit capital gain income for such year and  any undistributed taxable income from prior periods the excise tax is on the excess of such required distribution over the amounts we actually distributed we may elect to retain and pay income tax on the net longterm capital gain we receive in a taxable year see  taxation of taxable us shareholders for purposes of the  excise tax we will be treated as having distributed any such retained amount we have made and we intend to continue to make timely distributions sufficient to satisfy the annual distribution requirements it is possible that from time to time we may experience timing differences between  the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses and  the inclusion of that income and deduction of such expenses in arriving at our reit taxable income for example we may not deduct recognized capital losses from our reit taxable income further it is possible that from time to time we may be allocated a share of partnership net capital gain attributable to the sale of depreciated property that exceeds our allocable share of cash attributable to that sale as a result of the foregoing we may have less cash than is necessary to distribute taxable income sufficient to avoid corporate income tax and the excise tax imposed on certain undistributed income or even to meet the  distribution requirement in such a situation we may need to borrow funds issue preferred shares or additional common shares to raise the cash necessary to make required distributions or if possible pay taxable dividends of our shares or debt securities    table of contents we may satisfy the  distribution requirement with taxable distributions of our shares or debt securities the irs has issued private letter rulings to other reits treating certain distributions that are paid partly in cash and partly in shares as dividends that would satisfy the reit annual distribution requirement and qualify for the dividends paid deduction for federal income tax purposes those rulings may be relied upon only by taxpayers to whom they were issued but we could request a similar ruling from the irs in addition the irs previously issued a revenue procedure authorizing publicly traded reits to make elective cashshare dividends but that revenue procedures effectiveness has expired and does not apply to our current and future taxable years accordingly it is unclear whether and to what extent we will be able to make taxable dividends payable in cash and shares we have no current intention to make a taxable dividend payable in our shares or debt securities under certain circumstances we may be able to correct a failure to meet the distribution requirement for a year by paying deficiency dividends to our shareholders in a later year we may include such deficiency dividends in our deduction for dividends paid for the earlier year although we may be able to avoid income tax on amounts distributed as deficiency dividends we will be required to pay interest to the irs based upon the amount of any deduction we take for deficiency dividends record keeping requirements  we must maintain certain records in order to qualify as a reit in addition to avoid a monetary penalty we must request on an annual basis certain information from our shareholders designed to disclose the actual ownership of our outstanding shares we have complied and intend to continue to comply with such requirements relief from other failures of the reit qualification provisions  if we fail to satisfy one or more of the requirements for reit qualification other than the income tests or the asset tests we nevertheless may avoid termination of our reit election in such year if the failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect and we pay a penalty of  for each failure to satisfy the reit qualification requirements we may not qualify for this relief provision in all circumstances failure to qualify  if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year and no relief provision applied we would be subject to federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates in calculating our taxable income in a year in which we fail to qualify as a reit we would not be able to deduct amounts paid out to shareholders and we would not be required to distribute any amounts to shareholders in such year in such event to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits all distributions to shareholders would be taxable as ordinary income any such dividends should however be qualified dividend income which is taxable at longterm capital gain rates for individual shareholders who satisfy certain holding period requirements see  taxation of taxable us shareholders  current tax rates furthermore subject to certain limitations of the code corporate shareholders might be eligible for the dividends received deduction unless we qualified for relief under specific statutory provisions we also would be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which we ceased to qualify as a reit we cannot predict whether in all circumstances we would qualify for such statutory relief taxation of taxable us shareholders as used herein the term taxable us shareholder means a taxable beneficial owner of our common or preferred shares that for us federal income tax purposes is        a citizen or resident of the united states        a corporation including an entity treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes created or organized in or under the laws of the united states any of its states or the district of columbia        an estate whose income is subject to us federal income taxation regardless of its source or        a trust if a a us court is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of such trust and one or more us persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or b it has a valid election in effect to be treated as a us person    table of contents for us federal income tax purposes holders of depositary share receipts will be treated as if they held the equivalent fraction of the underlying preferred shares accordingly the discussion below with respect to the consequences of holding our preferred shares applies equally to holders of depositary receipts dividends and other taxable us shareholder distributions  as long as we qualify as a reit a taxable us shareholder must take into account distributions on our common or preferred shares out of our current and accumulated earnings and profits and that we do not designate as capital gain dividends or retained longterm capital gain as ordinary income such distributions will not qualify for the dividends received deduction generally available to corporations in addition dividends paid to taxable us shareholders generally will not qualify for the maximum  tax rate for qualified dividend income in determining the extent to which a distribution constitutes a dividend for us federal income tax purposes our earnings and profits will be allocated first to distributions with respect to our preferred shares and then to distributions with respect to our common shares if for any taxable year we elect to designate as capital gain dividends any portion of the distributions paid for the year to our shareholders the portion of the amount so designated not in excess of our net capital gain for the year that will be allocable to the holders of each class or series of preferred shares will be the amount so designated multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which will be the total dividends within the meaning of the code paid to the holders of such class or series of preferred shares for the year and the denominator of which will be the total dividends paid to the holders of all classes of our shares for the year the remainder of the designated capital gain dividends will be allocable to holders of our common shares a taxable us shareholder will recognize distributions that we designate as capital gain dividends as longterm capital gain to the extent they do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year without regard to the period for which the taxable us shareholder has held its common or preferred shares see  capital gains and losses below subject to certain limitations we will designate whether our capital gain dividends are taxable at the usual capital gains rate or at the higher rate applicable to depreciation recapture a corporate taxable us shareholder however may be required to treat up to  of certain capital gain dividends as ordinary income we may elect to retain and pay income tax on the net longterm capital gain that we receive in a taxable year in that case a taxable us shareholder would be taxed on its proportionate share of our undistributed longterm capital gain the taxable us shareholder would receive a credit or refund for its proportionate share of the tax we paid the taxable us shareholder would increase the basis in its shares by the amount of its proportionate share of our undistributed longterm capital gain minus its share of the tax we paid a taxable us shareholder will not incur tax on a distribution to the extent it exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and profits if such distribution does not exceed the adjusted basis of the taxable us shareholders common or preferred shares instead such distribution in excess of earnings and profits will reduce the adjusted basis of such common or preferred shares to the extent a distribution exceeds both our current and accumulated earnings and profits and the taxable us shareholders adjusted basis in its common or preferred shares the taxable us shareholder will recognize longterm capital gain or shortterm capital gain if the shares have been held for one year or less assuming the shares are a capital asset in the hands of the taxable us shareholder in addition if we declare a distribution in october november or december of any year that is payable to a taxable us shareholder of record on a specified date in any such month such distribution shall be treated as both paid by us and received by the taxable us shareholder on december  of such year provided that we actually pay the distribution during january of the following calendar year we will notify taxable us shareholders after the close of our taxable year as to the portions of the distributions attributable to that year that constitute return of capital ordinary income or capital gain dividends taxation of taxable us shareholders on the disposition of our shares  in general a taxable us shareholder must treat any gain or loss realized upon a taxable disposition of our common or preferred shares as longterm capital gain or loss if the taxable us shareholder has held the shares for more than one year and otherwise as shortterm capital gain or loss a taxable us shareholder will generally realize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the sum of the fair market value of any property and the amount of cash received in such disposition and the taxable us shareholders adjusted tax basis a taxable us shareholders adjusted tax basis generally will equal the taxable us shareholders acquisition cost increased by the excess of net capital gains deemed distributed to the taxable us shareholder discussed above less tax deemed paid on such gains and reduced by any returns of capital however a taxable us shareholder must treat any loss upon a sale or exchange    table of contents of common or preferred shares held by such shareholder for six months or less after applying certain holding period rules as a longterm capital loss to the extent of capital gain dividends and other distributions from us that such taxable us shareholder treats as longterm capital gain capital gains and losses  a taxpayer generally must hold a capital asset for more than one year for gain or loss derived from its sale or exchange to be treated as longterm capital gain or loss the highest marginal individual income tax rate on ordinary income significantly exceeds the maximum tax rate on longterm capital gain applicable to noncorporate taxpayers the maximum tax rate on longterm capital gain from the sale or exchange of section  property ie depreciable real property is to the extent that such gain would have been treated as ordinary income if the property were section  property higher than the maximum longterm capital gain rate otherwise applicable with respect to distributions that we designate as capital gain dividends and any retained capital gain that is deemed to be distributed we may designate subject to certain limits whether such a distribution is taxable to our noncorporate shareholders at the lower or higher rate a taxable us shareholder required to include retained longterm capital gains in income will be deemed to have paid in the taxable year of the inclusion its proportionate share of the tax paid by us in respect of such undistributed net capital gains taxable us shareholders subject to these rules will be allowed a credit or a refund as the case may be for the tax deemed to have been paid by such shareholders taxable us shareholders will increase their basis in their shares by the difference between the amount of such includible gains and the tax deemed paid by the taxable us shareholder in respect of such gains in addition the characterization of income as capital gain or ordinary income may affect the deductibility of capital losses a noncorporate taxpayer may generally deduct capital losses not offset by capital gains against its ordinary income only up to a maximum annual amount of  a noncorporate taxpayer may carry forward unused capital losses indefinitely a corporate taxpayer must pay tax on its net capital gain at ordinary corporate rates a corporate taxpayer can deduct capital losses only to the extent of capital gains with unused losses being carried back three years and forward five years redemption of preferred shares for cash  the treatment accorded to any redemption by us for cash as distinguished from a sale exchange or other disposition of preferred shares can only be determined on the basis of particular facts as to each holder at the time of redemption as stated above in general a taxable us shareholder of preferred shares will recognize capital gain or loss measured by the difference between the amount received upon the redemption and such holders adjusted tax basis in the preferred shares redeemed provided the preferred shares are held as a capital asset if such redemption i results in a complete termination of the holders interest in all classes of our shares under section b of the code ii is substantially disproportionate with respect to the holders interest in our shares under section b of the code which will not be the case if only preferred shares are redeemed since they generally do not have voting rights or iii is not essentially equivalent to a dividend with respect to the holder of preferred shares under section b of the code in applying these tests there must be taken into account not only the preferred shares owned by the taxable us shareholder but also such holders ownership of our common shares and any other options including share purchase rights to acquire any of the foregoing the holder of preferred shares also must take into account any such securities including options which are considered to be owned by such holder by reason of the constructive ownership rules set forth in sections  and c of the code if a particular taxable us shareholder of preferred shares owns actually or constructively none of our common shares or an insubstantial percentage of our outstanding common shares then based upon current law it is probable that the redemption of preferred shares from such a holder would be considered not essentially equivalent to a dividend however whether a dividend is not essentially equivalent to a dividend depends on all of the facts and circumstances and a taxable us shareholder of preferred shares intending to rely on any of these tests at the time of redemption should consult the holders own tax advisor to determine their application to the holders particular situation if the redemption does not meet any of the tests under section  of the code then the redemption proceeds received from the preferred shares will be treated as a distribution on the preferred shares if the redemption is taxed as a dividend the taxable us shareholders adjusted tax basis in the preferred shares will be transferred to any other shares held by the holder if the holder of preferred shares owns none of our other shares under certain circumstances such basis may be transferred to a related person or it may be lost entirely under proposed treasury regulations if any portion of the amount received by a taxable us shareholder on a redemption of our preferred shares is treated as a distribution with respect to our shares but not as a taxable dividend then such portion will be allocated to all shares held by the taxable us shareholder just before the redemption on a pro rata sharebyshare basis the amount applied to each share will first reduce the taxable us    table of contents shareholders basis in that share and any excess after the basis is reduced to zero will result in taxable gain if the holder has different basis in its shares then the amount allocated could reduce some of the basis in certain shares while reducing all the basis and giving rise to taxable gain in others thus the taxable us shareholder could have gain even if the holders basis in all its shares exceeded such portion the proposed treasury regulations permit the transfer of basis in the redeemed shares of the preferred shares to the taxable us shareholders remaining unredeemed preferred shares if any but not to any other class of shares held directly or indirectly by the taxable us shareholder instead any unrecovered basis in the preferred shares would be treated as a deferred loss to be recognized when certain conditions are satisfied the proposed treasury regulations would be effective for transactions that occur after the date the regulations are published as final treasury regulations there can however be no assurance as to whether when and in what particular form such proposed treasury regulations will ultimately be finalized we urge you to consult your tax advisor concerning the treatment of a cash redemption of our preferred shares redemption or conversion of preferred shares to common shares  assuming that preferred shares will not be redeemed or converted at a time when there are distributions in arrears in general no gain or loss will be recognized for us federal income tax purposes upon the redemption or conversion of our preferred shares at the option of the holder solely into common shares the basis that a taxable us shareholder will have for us federal income tax purposes in the common shares received will be equal to the adjusted basis the holder had in the preferred shares so redeemed or converted and provided that the preferred shares were held as a capital asset the holding period for the common shares received will include the holding period for the preferred shares redeemed or converted a holder however will generally recognize gain or loss on the receipt of cash in lieu of a fractional common share in an amount equal to the difference between the amount of cash received and the holders adjusted basis in such fractional share if a redemption or conversion occurs when there is a dividend arrearage on the preferred shares and the fair market value of the common shares exceeds the issue price of the preferred shares a portion of the common shares received might be treated as a dividend distribution taxable as ordinary income if pursuant to the terms of a class of preferred shares a taxable us shareholder receives alternative consideration such as cash securities or other property or assets including any combination thereof in lieu of common shares in connection with the conversion of the taxable us shareholders preferred shares the tax treatment of the receipt of any such other consideration will depend on the nature of the consideration and the structure of the transaction that gives rise to the right to receive such alternative consideration and it may be a taxable exchange taxable us shareholders converting their preferred shares should consult their tax advisors regarding the us federal income tax consequences of any such conversion and of the ownership and disposition of the consideration received upon any such conversion adjustments to conversion price  under section  of the code holders of preferred shares may be deemed to have received a constructive distribution of shares that is taxable as a dividend where the conversion ratio is adjusted to reflect a cash or property distribution with respect to the common shares into which it is convertible an adjustment to the conversion price made pursuant to a bona fide  reasonable adjustment formula that has the effect of preventing dilution of the interest of the holders however will generally not be considered to result in a constructive distribution of shares certain of the possible adjustments that may be provided in issuances of our preferred shares may not qualify as being pursuant to a bona fide  reasonable adjustment formula in such a case if a nonqualifying adjustment were made the holders of preferred shares might be deemed to have received a taxable stock dividend passive activity and investment income limitations distributions from us and gain from the disposition of our common or preferred shares will not be treated as passive activity income and therefore taxable us shareholders will not be able to apply any passive activity losses against such income dividends from us to the extent they do not constitute a return of capital or capital gain dividends and on an elective basis capital gain dividends and gain from the disposition of common or preferred shares generally will be treated as investment income for purposes of the investment income limitation medicare tax on unearned income certain taxable us shareholders who are individuals estates or trusts are subject to a  medicare tax on all or a portion of their net investment income which may include all or a portion of their dividends on our common or preferred shares and net gains from the taxable disposition of their shares taxable us shareholders that are individuals estates or trusts should consult their tax advisors regarding the applicability of the medicare tax to any of their income or gains in respect of our common or preferred shares    table of contents current tax rates  the maximum tax rate on the longterm capital gains of domestic noncorporate taxpayers is  the maximum tax rate on qualified dividend income is the same as the capital gains rate and is substantially lower than the maximum rate on ordinary income because as a reit we are not generally subject to tax on the portion of our reit taxable income or capital gains distributed to our shareholders our distributions are not generally eligible for the tax rate on qualified dividend income as a result our ordinary reit distributions are taxed at the higher tax rates applicable to ordinary income however with respect to noncorporate taxpayers the lower qualified dividend incomecapital gains tax rate at a maximum of  does generally apply to        a shareholders longterm capital gain if any recognized on the disposition of our shares        distributions we designate as longterm capital gain dividends except to the extent attributable to real estate depreciation in which case the  tax rate applies        distributions attributable to dividends we receive from nonreit corporations including our taxable reit subsidiaries and        distributions to the extent attributable to income upon which we have paid corporate tax for example the tax we would pay if we distributed less than all of our taxable reit income in general to qualify for the reduced tax rate on qualified dividend income a shareholder must hold our shares for more than  days during the day period beginning on the date that is  days before the date on which our shares become exdividend information reporting and backup withholding  taxable us shareholders that are exempt recipients such as corporations generally will not be subject to us backup withholding and related information reporting on payments of dividends on and the proceeds from the disposition of our common or preferred shares unless when required they fail to demonstrate their status as exempt recipients in general we will report to our other shareholders and to the irs the amount of distributions we pay during each calendar year and the amount of tax we withhold if any under the backup withholding rules a shareholder may be subject to backup withholding currently at the rate of  with respect to dividends unless such holder  is a corporation or comes within certain other exempt categories and when required demonstrates this fact or  provides a taxpayer identification number certifies as to no loss of exemption from backup withholding and otherwise complies with the applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules a shareholder who does not provide us with its correct taxpayer identification number also may be subject to penalties imposed by the irs in addition we may be required to withhold a portion of capital gain distributions to any shareholders who fail to certify their nonforeign status to us backup withholding is not an additional tax and may be credited against a shareholders regular us federal income tax liability or refunded by the irs provided that the shareholder provides the required information to the irs in a timely manner taxation of taxexempt us shareholders taxexempt entities including qualified employee pension and profit sharing trusts and individual retirement accounts and annuities exempt organizations generally are exempt from federal income taxation however they are subject to taxation on their unrelated business taxable income ubti while many investments in real estate generate ubti the irs has issued a published ruling that dividend distributions from a reit to an exempt employee pension trust do not constitute ubti provided that the exempt employee pension trust does not otherwise use the shares of the reit in an unrelated trade or business of the pension trust based on that ruling amounts that we distribute to exempt organizations generally should not constitute ubti however if an exempt organization were to finance its acquisition of shares with debt a portion of the income that they receive from us would constitute ubti pursuant to the debtfinanced property rules furthermore social clubs voluntary employee benefit associations supplemental unemployment benefit trusts and qualified group legal services plans that are exempt from taxation under paragraphs    and  respectively of code section c are subject to different ubti rules which generally will require them to characterize distributions that they receive from us as ubti unless the organization is able to properly claim a deduction for amounts set aside or placed in reserve for specific purposes so as to offset the income generated by its investment in our shares finally in certain circumstances a qualified employee pension or profit sharing trust that owns more than  of our shares is required to treat a percentage of    table of contents the dividends that it receives from us as ubti the ubti percentage the ubti percentage is equal to the gross income we derive from an unrelated trade or business determined as if we were a pension trust divided by our total gross income for the year in which we pay the dividends the ubti rule applies to a pension trust holding more than  of our shares only if        the ubti percentage is at least         we qualify as a reit by reason of the modification of the  rule that allows the beneficiaries of the pension trust to be treated as holding our shares in proportion to their actuarial interests in the pension trust and        we are a pensionheld reit ie either  one pension trust owns more than  of the value of our shares or  a group of pension trusts individually holding more than  of the value of our shares collectively owns more than  of the value of our shares taxexempt entities will be subject to the rules described above under the heading  taxation of taxable us shareholders concerning the inclusion of our designated undistributed net capital gains in the income of our shareholders thus such entities will after satisfying filing requirements be allowed a credit or refund of the tax deemed paid by such entities in respect of such includible gains taxation of nonus shareholders the rules governing us federal income taxation of nonus shareholders defined below are complex this section is only a summary of such rules we urge nonus shareholders to consult their tax advisors to determine the impact of the us federal state and local income tax laws on ownership of our common or preferred shares including any reporting requirements as used herein the term nonus shareholder means any taxable beneficial owner of our shares other than a partnership or entity that is treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes that is not a taxable us shareholder or exempt organization ordinary dividends  a nonus shareholder that receives a distribution that is not attributable to gain from our sale or exchange of us real property interests as defined below and that we do not designate as a capital gain dividend or retained capital gain will recognize ordinary income to the extent that we pay such distribution out of our current and accumulated earnings and profits a withholding tax equal to  of the gross amount of the distribution ordinarily will apply to such distribution unless an applicable tax treaty reduces or eliminates the tax under some treaties however rates below  that are applicable to ordinary income dividends from us corporations may not apply to ordinary income dividends from a reit or may apply only if the reit meets certain additional conditions however if a distribution is treated as effectively connected with the nonus shareholders conduct of a us trade or business and if required by an applicable income tax treaty attributable to a us permanent establishment maintained by the nonus shareholder the nonus shareholder generally will be subject to federal income tax on the distribution at graduated rates in the same manner as taxable us shareholders are taxed with respect to such distributions and also may be subject to the  branch profits tax in the case of a nonus shareholder that is a nonus corporation unless the tax is reduced or eliminated by an applicable income tax treaty we plan to withhold us income tax at the rate of  on the gross amount of any such distribution paid to a nonus shareholder unless i a lower treaty rate applies and the nonus shareholder timely provides an irs form wben or wbene to us evidencing eligibility for that reduced rate or ii the nonus shareholder timely provides an irs form weci to us claiming that the distribution is effectively connected income return of capital  a nonus shareholder will not incur tax on a distribution to the extent it exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and profits if such distribution does not exceed the adjusted basis of its common or preferred shares instead such distribution in excess of earnings and profits will reduce the adjusted basis of such shares a nonus shareholder will be subject to tax to the extent a distribution exceeds both our current and accumulated earnings and profits and the adjusted basis of its common or preferred shares if the nonus shareholder otherwise would be subject to tax on gain from the sale or disposition of its shares as described below because we generally cannot determine at the time we make a distribution whether or not the distribution will exceed our current and accumulated earnings and profits we normally will withhold tax on the entire amount of any distribution just as we would withhold on a dividend however a nonus shareholder may obtain a refund of amounts that we withhold if we later determine that a distribution in fact exceeded our current and accumulated earnings and profits    table of contents if we are treated as a united states real property holding corporation we will be required to withhold  of any distribution that exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and profits consequently although we intend to withhold at a rate of  on the entire amount of any distribution to the extent we do not do so we may withhold at a rate of  on any portion of a distribution not subject to withholding at a rate of  capital gain dividends  provided that a particular class of our shares is regularly traded on an established securities market in the united states and the nonus shareholder does not own more than  of the shares of such class at any time during the oneyear period preceding the distribution then amounts distributed with respect to those shares that are designated as capital gains from our sale or exchange of us real property interests defined below are treated as ordinary dividends taxable as described above under  ordinary dividends if the foregoing exception does not apply for example because the nonus shareholder owns more than  of the relevant class of our shares or because our shares are not regularly traded on an established securities market the nonus shareholder will incur tax on distributions that are attributable to gain from our sale or exchange of us real property interests under the provisions of the foreign investment in real property tax act of  firpta the term us real property interests includes certain interests in real property and stock in corporations at least  of whose assets consists of interests in real property but excludes mortgage loans and mortgagebacked securities under firpta a nonus shareholder is taxed on distributions attributable to gain from sales of us real property interests as if such gain were effectively connected with a us business of the nonus shareholder a nonus shareholder thus would be taxed on such a distribution at the normal capital gain rates applicable to taxable us shareholders subject to applicable alternative minimum tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of a nonresident alien individual a corporate nonus shareholder may also be subject to the  branch profits tax unless the tax is reduced or eliminated by an applicable income tax treaty we must withhold  of any distribution that we could designate as a capital gain dividend however if we make a distribution and later designate it as a capital gain dividend then although such distribution may be taxable to a nonus shareholder it is not subject to withholding under firpta instead we must makeup the  firpta withholding from distributions made after the designation until the amount of distributions withheld at  equals the amount of the distribution designated as a capital gain dividend a nonus shareholder may receive a credit against its firpta tax liability for the amount we withhold distributions to a nonus shareholder that we designate at the time of distribution as capital gain dividends which are not attributable to or treated as attributable to our disposition of a us real property interest generally will not be subject to us federal income taxation except as described below under  sale of shares retention of net capital gains although the law is not clear on the matter it appears that amounts we designate as retained capital gains in respect of our shares held by shareholders generally should be treated with respect to nonus shareholders in the same manner as actual distributions by us of capital gain dividends under this approach a nonus shareholder would be able to offset as a credit against its us federal income tax liability resulting from its proportionate share of the tax paid by us on such retained capital gains and to receive from the irs a refund to the extent of the nonus shareholders proportionate share of such tax paid by us exceeds its actual us federal income tax liability provided that the nonus shareholder furnishes required information to the irs on a timely basis if we were to designate any portion of our net capital gain as retained net capital gain a nonus shareholder should consult its tax advisor regarding the taxation of such retained net capital gain sale of shares  a nonus shareholder generally will not incur tax under firpta on gain from the sale of its common or preferred shares as long as we are a domestically controlled reit a domestically controlled reit is a reit in which at all times during a specified testing period nonus persons held directly or indirectly less than  in value of our shares we anticipate that we will continue to be a domestically controlled reit but there is no assurance that we will continue to be so however even if we are not or cease to be a domestically controlled reit a nonus shareholder that owns actually or constructively  or less of a class of our of outstanding shares at all times during a specified testing period will not incur tax under firpta on a sale of such shares if shares of such class are regularly traded on an established securities market if neither of these exceptions were to apply the gain on the sale of the common or preferred shares would be taxed under firpta in which case a nonus shareholder would be required to file a us federal income tax return and would be taxed in generally the same manner as taxable us shareholders with respect to such gain subject to applicable alternative minimum tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals and if the shares sold were not regularly traded on an established securities market or we were not a domesticallycontrolled reit the purchaser of the shares may be required to withhold and remit to the irs  of the purchase price    table of contents a nonus shareholder will incur tax on gain not subject to firpta if  the gain is effectively connected with the nonus shareholders us trade or business and if required by an applicable income tax treaty is attributable to a us permanent establishment maintained by the nonus shareholder in which case the nonus shareholder will be subject to the same treatment as taxable us shareholders with respect to such gain or  the nonus shareholder is a nonresident alien individual who was present in the us for  days or more during the taxable year in which case the nonus shareholder will incur a  tax on his capital gains capital gains dividends not subject to firpta will be subject to similar rules a nonus shareholder that is treated as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes and has effectively connected income as described in the first point above may also under certain circumstances be subject to an additional branch profits tax which is generally imposed on a foreign corporation on the deemed repatriation from the united states of effectively connected earnings and profits at a  rate unless the rate is reduced or eliminated by an applicable income tax treaty wash sales in general special wash sale rules apply if a shareholder owning more than  of our common or preferred shares avoids a taxable distribution of gain recognized from the sale or exchange of us real property interests by selling our shares before the exdividend date of the distribution and then within a designated period enters into an option or contract to acquire shares of the same or a substantially identical class of our shares if a wash sale occurs then the sellerrepurchaser will be treated as having gain recognized from the sale or exchange of us real property interests in the same amount as if the avoided distribution had actually been received nonus shareholders should consult their own tax advisors on the special wash sale rules that apply to nonus shareholders information reporting and backup withholding  we must report annually to the irs and to each nonus shareholder the amount of distributions paid to such holder and the tax withheld with respect to such distributions regardless of whether withholding was required copies of the information returns reporting such distributions and withholding may also be made available to the tax authorities in the country in which the nonus shareholder resides under the provisions of an applicable income tax treaty backup withholding currently at the rate of  and additional information reporting will generally not apply to distributions to a nonus shareholder provided that the nonus shareholder certifies under penalty of perjury that the shareholder is a nonus shareholder or otherwise establishes an exemption notwithstanding the foregoing backup withholding may apply if either we or our paying agent has actual knowledge or reason to know that the holder is a us person that is not an exempt recipient as a general matter backup withholding and information reporting will not apply to a payment of the proceeds of a sale of common or preferred shares effected at a foreign office of a foreign broker information reporting but not backup withholding will apply however to a payment of the proceeds of a sale of common or preferred shares by a foreign office of a broker that        is a us person        derives  or more of its gross income for a specified threeyear period from the conduct of a trade or business in the us        is a controlled foreign corporation generally a foreign corporation controlled by stockholders that are united states persons for us tax purposes or        that is a foreign partnership if at any time during its tax year more than  of its income or capital interests are held by us persons or if it is engaged in the conduct of a trade or business in the us unless the broker has documentary evidence in its records that the holder or beneficial owner is a nonus shareholder and certain other conditions are met or the shareholder otherwise establishes an exemption payment of the proceeds of a sale of common or preferred shares effected at a us office of a broker is subject to both backup withholding and information reporting unless the shareholder certifies under penalty of perjury that the shareholder is a nonus shareholder or otherwise establishes an exemption backup withholding is not an additional tax and may be credited against a nonus shareholders us federal income tax liability or refunded to the extent excess amounts are withheld provided that the required information is timely supplied to the irs    table of contents reporting and withholding on foreign financial accounts certain foreign financial institutions and nonfinancial foreign entities are subject to a  us federal withholding tax on dividends on our common or preferred shares unless i in the case of a foreign financial institution which term generally includes investment funds such institution enters into an agreement with the us government unless alternative procedures apply pursuant to an applicable intergovernmental agreement between the united states and the relevant foreign government to withhold on certain payments and to collect and provide to the us tax authorities substantial information regarding us account holders of such institution which includes certain equity and debt holders of such institution as well as certain account holders that are foreign entities with us owners and to withhold on certain payments and ii in the case of a nonfinancial foreign entity such entity provides the withholding agent with a certification identifying any direct and indirect us owners of the entity in addition if such disclosure requirements are not satisfied withholding at a  rate on gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of our common or preferred shares by such foreign financial institutions and nonfinancial foreign entities will generally begin after december   or such other date as may be specified in guidance issued by the us treasury department under certain circumstances a nonus shareholder might be eligible for refunds or credits of such taxes prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the
