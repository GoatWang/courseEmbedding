contact us login search search nvidia corps most popular product in  the graphics specialists most popular product in  was also its most controversial ashraf eassa tmfchipfool feb   at am in late  graphics specialist nvidia nasdaqnvda launched a couple of new graphics processors based on its maxwell architecture the gtx  and the gtx  easily the star of the show was the gtx  a card priced at around  that delivered similar performance as the companys gtx titan graphics card which launched at a whopping  in in early  however some controversy around the card broke out in early  due to two things nvidia had provided incorrect specifications in the reviewers guide sent to professional reviewers and although the gtx  cards came with four gigabytes of memory on board only  gigabytes of this memory runs at full speed with the remaining half gigabyte running at lower speed at the time this looked like a pr nightmare for the graphics specialist however fastforward to today its clear that not only were nvidias gtx  sales not particularly affected by this controversy but that the part was easily nvidias most popular product among pc gamers in  digging through the numbers these days the vast majority of pc gamers use a program known as steam to purchase download and play games one of the nice things about steam is that every month it conducts a hardware survey which collects data on the kinds of components that steam users who are likely by and large gamers have in their machines this data is very useful to game developers as it allows them to understand what kinds of hardware they can reasonably target for their games one of the nice things about this data for the investment community is that it allows us to get a glimpse into what gamers are buying market share shifts among component vendors and so on at any rate according to the steam hardware survey the gtx   as of january  is the most popular graphics processor among gamers capturing  share among all steam users who participated in the survey the second most popular is intel nasdaqintc hd graphics  with  share likely casual gamers playing lowintensity games on laptops with the nvidia gtx  coming in third place with  share gtx  has been and continues to be a hugely successful product for the graphics specialist what does this data tell us in addition to painting a positive picture from a market share perspective for nvidia these results also show that gamers are quite willing to pay for performance if they feel theyre getting good value the gtx  is a  card which is hardly budget among discrete cards and the gtx  is a roughly  card this is a longterm positive for nvidia indeed i suspect that as long as nvidia is able to deliver compelling performance improvements at the typical gaming processor price points it should be able to continue to grow its gaming graphics processor business nicely in the years ahead the next move for nvidia nvidia is expected to roll out its nextgeneration graphics architecture known as pascal at some point in  its not clear yet when in  the pascal architecture will arrive but i suspect that once it does the performance enhancements it should bring to the table as a result of an updated architecture and a migration to a new chip manufacturing technology will be enough to catalyze another upgrade cycle among gamers ashraf eassa owns shares of intel

release of the geforce  nv most notably introducing onboard transformation and lighting tl to consumerlevel d hardware running at  mhz and featuring four pixel pipelines it implemented advanced video acceleration motion compensation and hardware subpicture alpha blending the geforce outperformed existing products by a wide margin due to the success of its products nvidia won the contract to develop the graphics hardware for microsofts xbox game console which earned nvidia a  million advance however the project drew the time of many of its best engineers away from other projects in the short term this did not matter and the geforce gts shipped in the summer of  in december  nvidia reached an agreement to acquire the intellectual assets of its onetime rival dfx a pioneer in consumer

of portalplayer inc in february  nvidia acquired ageia developer of the physx physics engine and physics processing unit nvidia announced that it planned to integrate the physx technology into its future gpu products in july  nvidia took a writedown of approximately  million on its firstquarter revenue after reporting that certain mobile chipsets and gpus produced by the company had abnormal failure rates due to manufacturing defects nvidia however did not reveal the affected products in september  nvidia became the subject of a class action lawsuit over the defects claiming that the faulty gpus had been incorporated into certain laptop models manufactured by apple inc dell and hp in september  nvidia reached a settlement in which it would reimburse owners of the affected laptops for repairs or in some cases replacement on january   nvidia signed a sixyear  billion crosslicensing agreement with intel ending all litigation between the two companies in november  after initially

supportedit see also free and opensource device drivers graphics mesa d and nouveau software until september   nvidia had not published any documentation for its hardware meaning that programmers could not write appropriate and effective free and opensource device driver for its products without resorting to clean room reverse engineering instead nvidia provides its own binary geforce graphics drivers for xorg and a thin opensource library that interfaces with the linux freebsd or solaris kernels and the proprietary graphics software nvidia also provided but stopped supporting an obfuscated opensource driver that only supports twodimensional hardware acceleration and ships with the xorg distribution the proprietary nature of nvidias drivers has generated dissatisfaction within freesoftware communities some linux and bsd users insist on using only opensource drivers and regard nvidias insistence on providing nothing more than a binaryonly driver as wholly inadequate given that competing manufacturers like intel offer support and documentation for opensource developers and that others like amd release partial documentation and provide some active development because of the closed nature of the drivers nvidia video cards cannot deliver adequate features on some platforms and architectures given that it only provides xx driver builds as a result support for d graphics acceleration in linux on powerpc does not exist nor does support for linux on the hypervisorrestricted playstation  console some users claim that nvidias linux drivers impose artificial restrictions like limiting the number of monitors that can be used at the same time but the company has not commented on these accusations deep learningedit nvidia gpus are used in deep learning artificial intelligence and accelerated analytics the company developed gpubased deep learning in order to use artificial intelligence to approach problems like cancer detection weather prediction and selfdriving vehicles they are included in all tesla vehicles the purpose is to help networks learn to “think” according to techrepublic nvidia gpus “work well for deep learning tasks because they are designed for parallel computing and do well to handle the vector and matrix operations that are prevalent in deep learning” these gpus are used by researchers laboratories tech companies and enterprise companies in  nvidia was involved in what was called the “big bang” of deep learning “as deeplearning neural networks were combined with nvidia graphics processing units gpus” that year the google brain used nvidia gpus to create deep neural networks capable of machine learning where andrew ng determined that gpus could increase the speed of deeplearning systems by about  times in april  nvidia produced the dgx supercomputer based on an  gpu cluster to improve the ability of users to use deep learning by combining gpus with integrated deep learning software it also developed nvidia tesla k and p gpubased virtual machines which are available through google cloud which google installed in november  microsoft added gpu servers in a preview offering of its n series based on nvidias tesla ks each containing  processing cores later that year aws’s p instance was produced using up to  nvidia tesla k gpus that month nvidia also partnered with ibm to create a software kit that boosts

supportedit see also free and opensource device drivers graphics mesa d and nouveau software until september   nvidia had not published any documentation for its hardware meaning that programmers could not write appropriate and effective free and opensource device driver for its products without resorting to clean room reverse engineering instead nvidia provides its own binary geforce graphics drivers for xorg and a thin opensource library that interfaces with the linux freebsd or solaris kernels and the proprietary graphics software nvidia also provided but stopped supporting an obfuscated opensource driver that only supports twodimensional hardware acceleration and ships with the xorg distribution the proprietary nature of nvidias drivers has generated dissatisfaction within freesoftware communities some linux and bsd users insist on using only opensource drivers and regard nvidias insistence on providing nothing more than a binaryonly driver as wholly inadequate given that competing manufacturers like intel offer support and documentation for opensource developers and that others like amd release partial documentation and provide some active development because of the closed nature of the drivers nvidia video cards cannot deliver adequate features on some platforms and architectures given that it only provides xx driver builds as a result support for d graphics acceleration in linux on powerpc does not exist nor does support for linux on the hypervisorrestricted playstation  console some users claim that nvidias linux drivers impose artificial restrictions like limiting the number of monitors that can be used at the same time but the company has not commented on these accusations deep learningedit nvidia gpus are used in deep learning artificial intelligence and accelerated analytics the company developed gpubased deep learning in order to use artificial intelligence to approach problems like cancer detection weather prediction and selfdriving vehicles they are included in all tesla vehicles the purpose is to help networks learn to “think” according to techrepublic nvidia gpus “work well for deep learning tasks because they are designed for parallel computing and do well to handle the vector and matrix operations that are prevalent in deep learning” these gpus are used by researchers laboratories tech companies and enterprise companies in  nvidia was involved in what was called the “big bang” of deep learning “as deeplearning neural networks were combined with nvidia graphics processing units gpus” that year the google brain used nvidia gpus to create deep neural networks capable of machine learning where andrew ng determined that gpus could increase the speed of deeplearning systems by about  times in april  nvidia produced the dgx supercomputer based on an  gpu cluster to improve the ability of users to use deep learning by combining gpus with integrated deep learning software it also developed nvidia tesla k and p gpubased virtual machines which are available through google cloud which google installed in november  microsoft added gpu servers in a preview offering of its n series based on nvidias tesla ks each containing  processing cores later that year aws’s p instance was produced using up to  nvidia tesla k gpus that month nvidia also partnered with ibm to create a software kit that boosts the ai capabilities of watson called ibm powerai nvidia also offers its own nvidia deep learning software development kit  in  the gpus were also brought online at the riken center for advanced

in the graphics industry amd which had acquired ati received subpoenas from the us department of justice regarding possible antitrust violations in the graphics card industry forbes magazine named nvidia its company of the year for  citing the accomplishments it made during the said period as well as during the previous  years on january   nvidia announced that it had completed the acquisition of portalplayer inc in february  nvidia acquired ageia developer of the physx physics engine and physics processing unit nvidia announced that it planned to integrate the physx technology into its future gpu products in july  nvidia took a writedown of approximately  million on its firstquarter revenue after reporting that certain mobile chipsets and gpus produced by the company had abnormal failure rates due to manufacturing defects nvidia however did not reveal the affected products in september  nvidia became the subject of a class action lawsuit over the defects claiming that the faulty gpus had been incorporated into certain laptop models manufactured by apple inc dell and hp in september  nvidia reached a settlement in which it would reimburse owners of the affected laptops for repairs or in some cases replacement on january   nvidia signed a sixyear  billion crosslicensing agreement with intel ending all litigation between the two companies in november  after initially unveiling it at mobile world congress nvidia released its tegra  arm systemonchip for mobile devices nvidia claimed that the chip featured the firstever quadcore mobile cpu in may  it was announced

car drivers the drive pxseries is a high performance computer platform aimed at autonomous driving through deep learning while driveworks is an operating system for driverless cars opensource software supportedit see also free and opensource device drivers graphics mesa d and nouveau software until september   nvidia had not published any documentation for its hardware meaning that programmers could not write appropriate and effective free and opensource device driver for its products without resorting to clean room reverse engineering instead nvidia provides its own binary geforce graphics drivers for xorg and a thin opensource library that interfaces with the linux freebsd or solaris kernels and the proprietary graphics software nvidia also provided but stopped supporting an obfuscated opensource driver that only supports twodimensional hardware acceleration and ships with the xorg distribution the proprietary nature of nvidias drivers has generated dissatisfaction within freesoftware communities some linux and bsd users insist on using only opensource drivers and regard nvidias insistence on providing nothing more than a binaryonly driver as wholly inadequate given that competing manufacturers like intel offer support and documentation for opensource developers and that others like amd release partial documentation and provide some active development because of the closed nature of the drivers nvidia video cards cannot deliver adequate features on some platforms and architectures given that it only provides xx driver builds as a result support for d graphics acceleration in linux on powerpc does not exist nor does support for linux on the hypervisorrestricted playstation  console some users claim that nvidias linux drivers impose artificial restrictions like limiting the number of monitors that can be used at the same time but the company has not commented on these accusations deep learningedit nvidia gpus are used in deep learning artificial intelligence and accelerated analytics the company developed gpubased deep learning in order to use artificial intelligence to approach problems like cancer detection weather prediction and selfdriving vehicles they are included in all tesla vehicles the purpose is to help networks learn to “think” according to techrepublic nvidia gpus “work well for deep learning tasks because they are designed for parallel computing and do well to handle the vector and matrix operations that are prevalent in deep learning” these gpus are used by researchers laboratories tech companies and enterprise companies in  nvidia was involved in what was called the “big bang” of deep learning “as deeplearning neural networks were combined with nvidia graphics processing units gpus” that year the google brain used nvidia gpus to create deep neural networks capable of machine learning where andrew ng determined that gpus could increase the speed of deeplearning systems by about  times in april  nvidia produced the dgx supercomputer based on an  gpu cluster to improve the ability of users to use deep learning by combining gpus with integrated deep learning software it also developed nvidia tesla k and p gpubased virtual machines which are available through google cloud which google installed in november  microsoft added gpu servers in a preview offering of its n series based on nvidias tesla ks each containing  processing cores later that year aws’s p instance was produced using up to  nvidia tesla k gpus that month nvidia also partnered with ibm to create a software kit that boosts the ai capabilities of watson called ibm powerai nvidia also offers its own nvidia deep learning software development kit  in  the gpus were also brought online at the riken center for advanced

foolcouk foolcomau foolca foolsg foolde helping the world invest better since  hi fool premium advice help fool answers contact us login search search why nvidia corporations volta gaming products wont use hbm for consumeroriented products the potential technical advantages of hbm memory are outweighed by other considerations ashraf eassa tmfchipfool may   at pm over in digitimes contributor nebojsa novakovic recently speculated that gamingoriented graphics processors based on nvidias nasdaqnvda recently announced volta architecture could use a type of video memory known as hbm high bandwidth memory  rather than a more traditional graphics double data rate gddr memory hbm memory is believed to be more expensive to produce than traditional gddrtype memory but the idea is that hbm is said to offer power efficiency and physical footprint advantages over gddrtype memories image source nvidia today nvidias gp chip  which powers the companys tesla p datacenter accelerator and its quadro gp professional visualization accelerator  uses hbm while the companys gamingoriented pascal products gp gp gp gp gp use either gddrx for higherend products or gddr for lowerend products nvidias first voltabased product known as gv will include a faster flavor of hbm memory than whats currently found on the gp however i doubt that nvidia will utilize this technology in the gamingoriented versions of volta cost and capacity issues first the use of hbm would likely drive product costs up even if nvidia restricted hbm use to the higherend of its voltabased product stack use of the technology could possibly either lead to increased product prices for end users reducing demand or lower gross profit margins for nvidia for datacentertargeted accelerators like the p or v product manufacturing cost isnt as important a consideration as it is for consumergrade products because datacenter customers care about total cost of ownership not necessarily upfront product acquisition costs so if nvidia charges datacenter customers more for a potentially more spacepower efficient product then theyll probably gladly pay as the spacepower efficiency improvements would probably lead to cheapertoown products over the longrun even if initial acquisition costs are higher for gaming products efficiency is obviously important but upfront acquisition costs are also a significant consideration remember gamers arent buying these graphics cards to perform work that will allow them to generate a financial return on their initial investments  theyre buying these cards so that they can play video games with their personal cash further even if nvidia were to adopt hbm in highendenthusiast gaming products it would probably need to limit the cards to gb of memory to keep product costs sane nvidias highend geforce gtx  ti currently packs gb of gddrx memory and i dont think the company would want to deliver a capacity regression to customers gddr is good enough obviously in addition to power efficiency considerations the whole point of hbm is to give graphics processors access to a lot of memory bandwidth that is to allow the graphics processor to read from and write to memory as quickly as possible however nvidia seems to be able to use gddrtype memories to give its graphics processors access to a substantial amount of memory bandwidth the companys latest titan xp graphics card for example uses fast gddrx and a wide memory interface to deliver gbsecond of memory bandwidth thats less bandwidth than what the current pascal p or upcoming volta v have access to but its certainly the most memory bandwidth available to any gamingoriented graphics processor today furthermore sk hynix recently announced extremely fast gddr memory that should using a similarly wide memory interface as the one on the titan xp deliver  gbsecond of bandwidth again thats less than the  gbsecond of bandwidth that the voltabased v has access to but the difference isnt that huge in light of this discussion i just cant see nvidia using hbm in its upcoming voltaarchitecture gaming graphics processors when potentially cheaper gddrtype memory should be able to do the

september   nvidia had not published any documentation for its hardware meaning that programmers could not write appropriate and effective free and opensource device driver for its products without resorting to clean room reverse engineering instead nvidia provides its own binary geforce graphics drivers for xorg and a thin opensource library that interfaces with the linux freebsd or solaris kernels and the proprietary graphics software nvidia also provided but stopped supporting an obfuscated opensource driver that only supports twodimensional hardware acceleration and ships with the xorg distribution the proprietary nature of nvidias drivers has generated dissatisfaction within freesoftware communities some linux and bsd users insist on using only opensource drivers and regard nvidias insistence on providing nothing more than a binaryonly driver as wholly inadequate given that competing manufacturers like intel offer support and documentation for opensource developers and that others like amd release partial documentation and provide some active development because of the closed nature of the drivers nvidia video cards cannot deliver adequate features on some platforms and architectures given that it only provides xx driver builds as a result support for d graphics acceleration in linux on powerpc does not exist nor does support for linux on the hypervisorrestricted playstation  console some users claim that nvidias linux drivers impose artificial restrictions like limiting the number of monitors that can be used at the same time but the company has not commented on these accusations deep learningedit nvidia gpus are used in deep learning artificial intelligence and accelerated analytics the company developed gpubased deep learning in order to use artificial intelligence to approach problems like cancer detection weather prediction and selfdriving vehicles they are included in all tesla vehicles the purpose is to help networks learn to “think” according to techrepublic nvidia gpus “work well for deep learning tasks because they are designed for parallel computing and do well to handle the vector and matrix operations that are prevalent in deep learning” these gpus are used by researchers laboratories tech companies and enterprise companies in  nvidia was involved in what was called the “big bang” of deep learning “as deeplearning neural networks were combined with nvidia graphics processing units gpus” that year the google brain used nvidia gpus to create deep neural networks capable of machine learning where andrew ng determined that gpus could increase the speed of deeplearning systems by about  times in april  nvidia produced the dgx supercomputer based on an  gpu cluster to improve the ability of users to use deep learning by combining gpus with integrated deep learning software it also developed nvidia tesla k and p gpubased virtual machines which are available through google cloud which google installed in november  microsoft added gpu servers in a preview offering of its n series based on nvidias tesla ks each containing  processing cores later that year aws’s p instance was produced using up to  nvidia tesla k gpus that month nvidia also partnered with ibm to create a software kit that boosts the ai capabilities of watson called ibm powerai nvidia also offers its own nvidia deep learning software

introducing onboard transformation and lighting tl to consumerlevel d hardware running at  mhz and featuring four pixel pipelines it implemented advanced video acceleration motion compensation and hardware subpicture alpha blending the geforce outperformed existing products by a wide margin due to the success of its products nvidia won the contract to develop the graphics hardware for microsofts xbox game console which earned nvidia a  million advance however the project drew the time of many of its best engineers away from other projects in the short term this did not matter and the geforce gts shipped in the summer of  in december  nvidia reached an agreement to acquire the intellectual assets of its onetime rival dfx a pioneer in consumer d graphics technology leading the field from mid s until  the acquisition process was finalized in april  in july  nvidia acquired exluna for an undisclosed sum exluna made software rendering tools and the personnel were merged into

was announced that nvidia would assist sony with the design of the graphics processor rsx in the playstation  game console in may  microsoft chose to license a design by ati and to make its own manufacturing arrangements for the xbox  graphics hardware as had nintendo for the wii console which succeeded the atibased nintendo gamecube on december   nvidia acquired uli electronics which at the time supplied thirdparty southbridge parts for chipsets to ati nvidias competitor in march  nvidia acquired hybrid graphics in december  nvidia along with its main rival in the graphics industry amd which had acquired ati received subpoenas from the us department of justice regarding possible antitrust violations in the graphics card industry forbes magazine named nvidia its company of the year for  citing the accomplishments it made during the said period as well as during the previous  years on january   nvidia announced that it had completed the acquisition of portalplayer inc in february  nvidia acquired ageia developer of the physx physics engine and physics processing unit nvidia announced that it planned to integrate the physx technology into its future gpu products in july  nvidia took a writedown of approximately  million on its firstquarter revenue after reporting that certain mobile chipsets and gpus produced by the company had abnormal failure rates due to manufacturing defects nvidia however did not reveal the affected products in september  nvidia became the subject of a class action lawsuit over the defects claiming that the faulty gpus had been incorporated into certain laptop models manufactured by apple inc dell and hp in september  nvidia reached a settlement in which it would reimburse owners of the affected laptops for repairs or in some cases replacement on january   nvidia signed a sixyear  billion crosslicensing agreement with intel ending all litigation between the two companies in november  after initially unveiling it at mobile world congress nvidia released its tegra  arm systemonchip for mobile devices nvidia claimed that the chip featured the firstever quadcore mobile cpu in may  it was announced that nvidia had agreed to

architecture also supports a new hardware feature known as simultaneous multiprojection smp which is designed to improve the quality of multimonitor and virtual reality rendering in july  nvidia agreed to a settlement for a false advertising lawsuit regarding its gtx  model as the models were unable to use all of their advertised  gb of ram due to limitations brought by the design of its hardware in may  nvidia announced a partnership with toyota motor corp toyota will use nvidias drive pxseries artificial intelligence platform for its autonomous vehicles in july  nvidia

drive pxseries is a high performance computer platform aimed at autonomous driving through deep learning while driveworks is an operating system for driverless cars opensource software supportedit see also free and opensource device drivers graphics mesa d and nouveau software until september   nvidia had not published any documentation for its hardware meaning that programmers could not write appropriate and effective free and opensource device driver for its products without resorting to clean room reverse engineering instead nvidia provides its own binary geforce graphics drivers for xorg and a thin opensource library that interfaces with the linux freebsd or solaris kernels and the proprietary graphics software nvidia also provided but stopped supporting an obfuscated opensource driver that only supports twodimensional hardware acceleration and ships with the xorg distribution the proprietary nature of nvidias drivers has generated dissatisfaction within freesoftware communities some linux and bsd users insist on using only opensource drivers and regard nvidias insistence on providing nothing more than a binaryonly driver as wholly inadequate given that competing manufacturers like intel offer support and documentation for opensource developers and that others like amd release partial documentation and provide some active development because of the closed nature of the drivers nvidia video cards cannot deliver adequate features on some platforms and architectures given that it only provides xx driver builds as a result support for d graphics acceleration in linux on powerpc does not exist nor does support for linux on the hypervisorrestricted playstation  console some users claim that nvidias linux drivers impose artificial restrictions like limiting the number of monitors that can be used at the same time but the company has not commented on these accusations deep learningedit nvidia gpus are used in deep learning artificial intelligence and accelerated analytics the company developed gpubased deep learning in order to use artificial intelligence to approach problems like cancer detection weather prediction and selfdriving vehicles they are included in all tesla vehicles the purpose is to help networks learn to “think” according to techrepublic nvidia gpus “work well for deep learning tasks because they are designed for parallel computing and do well to handle the vector and matrix operations that are prevalent in deep learning” these gpus are used by researchers laboratories tech companies and enterprise companies in  nvidia was involved in what was called the “big bang” of deep learning “as deeplearning neural networks were combined with nvidia graphics processing units gpus” that year the google brain used nvidia gpus to create deep neural networks capable of machine learning where andrew ng determined that gpus could increase the speed of deeplearning systems by about  times in april  nvidia produced the dgx supercomputer based on an  gpu cluster to improve the ability of users to use deep learning by combining gpus with integrated deep learning software it also developed nvidia tesla k and p gpubased virtual machines which are available through google cloud which google installed in november  microsoft added gpu servers in a preview offering of its n series based on nvidias tesla ks each containing  processing cores later that year aws’s p instance was produced using up to  nvidia tesla k gpus that month nvidia also partnered with ibm to create a software kit that boosts the ai capabilities of watson called ibm powerai nvidia also offers its own nvidia deep learning software development kit  in  the gpus were also brought online at the riken center for advanced

outperformed existing products by a wide margin due to the success of its products nvidia won the contract to develop the graphics hardware for microsofts xbox game console which earned nvidia a  million advance however the project drew the time of many of its best engineers away from other projects in the short term this did not matter and the geforce gts shipped in the summer of  in december  nvidia reached an agreement to acquire the intellectual assets of its onetime rival dfx a pioneer in consumer d graphics technology leading the field from mid s until  the acquisition process was

engine and physics processing unit nvidia announced that it planned to integrate the physx technology into its future gpu products in july  nvidia took a writedown of approximately  million on its firstquarter revenue after reporting that certain mobile chipsets and gpus produced by the company had abnormal failure rates due to manufacturing defects nvidia however did not reveal the affected products in september  nvidia became the subject of a class action lawsuit over the defects claiming that the faulty gpus had been incorporated into certain laptop models manufactured by apple inc dell and hp in september  nvidia reached a settlement in which it would reimburse owners of the affected laptops for repairs or in some cases replacement on january   nvidia signed a sixyear  billion

through deep learning while driveworks is an operating system for driverless cars opensource software supportedit see also free and opensource device drivers graphics mesa d and nouveau software until september   nvidia had not published any documentation for its hardware meaning that programmers could not write appropriate and effective free and opensource device driver for its products without resorting to clean room reverse engineering instead nvidia provides its own binary geforce graphics drivers for xorg and a thin opensource library that interfaces with the linux freebsd or solaris kernels and the proprietary graphics software nvidia also provided but stopped supporting an obfuscated opensource driver that only supports twodimensional hardware acceleration and ships with the xorg distribution the proprietary nature of nvidias drivers has generated dissatisfaction within freesoftware communities some linux and bsd users insist on using only opensource drivers and regard nvidias insistence on providing nothing more than a binaryonly driver as wholly inadequate given that competing manufacturers like intel offer support and documentation for opensource developers and that others like amd release partial documentation and provide some active development because of the closed nature of the drivers nvidia video cards cannot deliver adequate features on some platforms and architectures given that it only provides xx driver builds as a result support for d graphics acceleration in linux on powerpc does not exist nor does support for linux on the hypervisorrestricted playstation  console some users claim that nvidias linux drivers impose artificial restrictions like limiting the number of monitors that can be used at the same time but the company has not commented on these accusations deep learningedit nvidia gpus are used in deep learning artificial intelligence and accelerated analytics the company developed gpubased deep learning in order to use artificial intelligence to approach problems like cancer detection weather prediction and selfdriving vehicles they are included in all tesla vehicles the purpose is to help networks learn to “think” according to techrepublic nvidia gpus “work well for deep learning tasks because they are designed for parallel computing and do well to handle the vector and matrix operations that are prevalent in deep learning” these gpus are used by researchers laboratories tech companies and enterprise companies in  nvidia was involved in what was called the “big bang” of deep learning “as deeplearning neural networks were combined with nvidia graphics processing units gpus” that year the google brain used nvidia gpus to create deep neural networks capable of machine learning where andrew ng determined that gpus could increase the speed of deeplearning systems by about  times in april  nvidia produced the dgx supercomputer based on an  gpu cluster to improve the ability of users to use deep learning by combining gpus with integrated deep learning software it also developed nvidia tesla k and p gpubased virtual machines which are available through google cloud which google installed in november  microsoft added gpu servers in a preview offering of its n series based on nvidias tesla ks each containing  processing cores later that year aws’s p instance was produced using up to  nvidia tesla k gpus that month nvidia also partnered with ibm to create a software kit that boosts the ai capabilities of watson called ibm powerai nvidia also offers its own nvidia deep learning software development kit  in  the gpus were also brought online at the riken center for advanced intelligence project for fujitsu the company’s deep learning technology led to a boost in its  earnings see

writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in
