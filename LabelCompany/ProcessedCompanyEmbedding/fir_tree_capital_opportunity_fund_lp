process for what is now the largest bankruptcy in history incentives were put in place to align interests and empower the board to increase the overall value of the estate on an expedited basis fir

looked for people who are highly respected in a range of critical areas including real estate derivatives private equity and restructuring wall street journal december   lehman says its active board approach resembles a private equity board and says its new directors were recruited to work closely with the team that has been managing its still considerable realestate holdings…given the highly resultsoriented nature of this compensation package …i would say this is an eminently reasonable package and likely to deliver more value to debtors… said paul hodgson compensation expert at gmi ratings dow jones march   nextel communications formerly nxtl nasdaq “fir tree approached nextel with an inventive debt for equity swap that greatly improved our company’s financial strength dennis

richard haddrill chairman of the board and former chief executive officer rh donnelly corp formerly rhd nyse in  i was appointed to the rh donnelley board as fir tree’s representative at the time donnelley was the largest yellow page business in the us and it had recently been spun off from its parent company dun  bradstreet this was a time when the internet began to emerge as a game changing technological threat and so my focus for value creation centered on tech initiatives and ensuring that capital allocation was done to maximize shareholder value darius gaskins former fir tree representative to rh donnelly board of directors rite aid corporation rad nyse i first met the fir tree team when they were large holders of riteaid debt and they approached me with an innovative

provided constructive support to our management team and were quick to commit large sums of capital to complex deals claude leblanc chief restructuring officer the official information company formerly tcm nyse “the principals at fir tree were instrumental partners in the growth and development of the official information company their smart and constructive advice helped us develop finance and execute a growth plan that created five separate operating businesses which were later sold in multiple valueenhancing transactions on behalf of our shareholders” ian thomas former chief executive
