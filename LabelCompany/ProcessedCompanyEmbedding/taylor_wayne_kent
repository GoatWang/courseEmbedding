and investor relations following our remarks we will open the call for questions now id like to turn the call over to our founder and ceo kent taylor wayne kent taylor  chairman  chief executive officer thanks scott and good evening everyone we are pleased – very pleased with our top line performance for the second quarter as increasing guest counts and strong operating week growth drove  revenue growth for the quarter second quarter comps were up  including a  increase in guest counts and for the first four weeks of the third quarter we have started off well with comps up  while the strength and consistency of our sales growth remained strong our second quarter profit did not keep pace significant food cost inflation of  driven by higherthanexpected beef costs more than offset our strong sales results which resulted in profits being down  on the development front we continue to be pleased with the results from our new restaurant openings we have modified our new unit expectations for  to approximately  companyowned restaurants and we are well on our way to achieving that goal with  companyowned restaurants opened in the first half of the year including three bubbas  restaurants and  jaggers location the third quarter will be a busy one for us in terms of development with  openings expected as well as one franchise restaurant opening looking ahead to  our development pipeline is shaping up very well our target remains to open  to  companyowned restaurants next year with most of those sites already selected now ill turn the call over to tonya who will provide the financial update tonya robinson  senior director of investor relations and financial reporting thanks kent diluted earnings per share in the second quarter of  decreased  over the prior year to  per diluted share as strong revenue growth during the quarter was more than offset by a decline in restaurant margin driven by higher food costs revenue growth at  during the quarter was driven by an  increase in average unit volume along with a  increase in store weeks for the quarter comp sales increased  comprised of  traffic growth and a  increase in average check by month comparable sales increased   and  for our april may and june periods respectively and as kent mentioned comps were up  in the july period restaurant operating profit increased  or  million for the quarter compared to the prior year restaurant margins as a percentage of sales decreased  basis points and restaurant margin dollars per store week were down  in the quarter while we were able to generate leverage in labor events and other operating costs with strong average unit volume growth during the quarter food cost inflation of approximately  far outpaced our pricing actions food cost inflation was higher than we expected driven by beef costs as we were on the market for a significant portion of our beef needs while we continue to expect lower inflation in the back half of the year we have raised our full year inflation expectations to  to  this full year guidance implies food cost inflation of  to  in the back half of the year on the labor line we gained some leverage with strong average unit volume growth but that was somewhat offset by higher average wage rates and healthcare costs we are currently seeing a bit more wage rate inflation than the  to  we were expecting at the beginning of the year below restaurant margins ga costs were  million up  million versus last year as a percentage of revenue ga decreased approximately  basis points to  depreciation expense increased  million to  million versus the prior year and was flat as a percentage of revenue at  we continue to expect our full year depreciation and amortization expense margin to be higher in  due to the increase in our capitalized cost on new restaurants as well as an increase in the level of reinvestment in our existing assets preopening costs increased  million on a yearoveryear basis primarily due to the number of restaurant openings this quarter compared to the prior year and the timing of those openings with  companyowned restaurant openings expected by the end of september our preopening costs will be up significantly in the third quarter compared to last year our tax rate for the quarter came in at  which was in line with the rate last year we continue to expect our full year rate to be  to  depending on the reinstatement of the work opportunity tax credit in  we ended the quarter with  million in cash and during the quarter we generated  million in cash flow from operations and spent  million primarily on capital expenditures dividends and share repurchases we have increased our expectation for  capital expenditures by approximately  million to  million to  million based on the increase in new restaurant openings the relocation of two restaurants later this year and our continued investment in our existing assets now ill turn the call over to scott for final comments scott matthew colosi  president  chief financial officer thank you tonya we continue to be very pleased with the direction of our business and our opportunities for future growth our sales have been great all year and certainly food cost inflation has been a huge hurdle to date but this should have less of an impact on our results for the second half of the year and like other restaurant companies we will have our share of minimum wage and healthcare cost increases to contend with for the remainder of this year and on into  and weve begun evaluating the timing and amount of any menu price increases we expect to take in the fourth quarter of  as usual the discussion will be focused on many factors including the inflation outlook for  for both commodities and labor and more importantly well continue to focus on balancing the short term pressures we face with the long term positioning of the brand fortunately we continue to generate more than enough cash flow to provide for new store growth the maintenance of our existing store base and the return of capital to shareholders as tonya mentioned weve increased our capital expenditure range for the year part of that is a result of opening a few more new restaurants but weve also identified several other opportunities including the relocation of a couple of our existing restaurants buying additional parking in some of our locations and buying land rather than leasing it for a few of our  openings before i close id like to thank all of our operators around the country for their continued hard work and commitment theyre doing an outstanding job of staying true to providing legendary food and service to our guests all the while incurring significant inflationary pressure on their bottom line results that concludes our prepared remarks so blake please open the line for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you sir we will start with will slabaugh from stephens inc will slabaugh  stephens inc yeah thanks guys wonder if you could walk through sort of what happened with the food costs in the quarter i know you mentioned this was supposed to be your highest inflationary quarter of the year but it seems like it came in quite a bit ahead of where you thought it would end up so could you talk about kind of where you were locked and where it may be surprised you and why we have more confidence for the back half of the year tonya robinson  senior director of investor relations and financial reporting will this is tonya i can tell you that we havent really talked about where were locked or what were doing from that perspective this year but i can tell you we are putting a significant portion of our beef costs and thats kind of where we saw those costs come in higher than we – a little bit higher than we expected we expected it to high in q just not quite where it came in scott matthew colosi  president  chief financial officer this is scott will and so were floating a lot of product and at the same time our sales were quite high in the quarter so it was kind of we paid more for our beef and we bought a lot more of it so it was – it really cost us a lot more than we had anticipated will slabaugh  stephens inc got you one quick followup if i could on – you mentioned you opened a jaggers in the quarter and then a couple of more bubbas so curious on the update there you mentioned you may have a little bit more data to provide this quarter on the bubbas brand and then any sort of initial read on jaggers wayne kent taylor  chairman  chief executive officer this is kent yeah the bubbas were still very pleased with the results a lot of these stores are fairly new so you cant really judge where theyre going to be in six months and the jaggers is also very new so well just – well probably have more information for you on the call in three months but its too early to tell at this point will slabaugh  stephens inc got it thanks kent operator thank you and well move to david tarantino with robert w baird david e tarantino  robert w baird  co inc broker hi good afternoon and congratulations on the sales strength that youre seeing my question is more about the margins than the sales here i guess the first question i have is on the beef cost outlook it assumes i guess some moderation and the inflation in the second half of the year and my question is one is that something youre already seeing or is that by nature the comparisons and then secondly do you have any view as to what you might be looking at for next year at this stage tonya robinson  senior director of investor relations and financial reporting hi david its tonya i can tell you as far as what were seeing right now some of it is just what were lapping because beef inflation was higher last year in the back half of the year but we are seeing a little relief in the prices currently its a little early to tell but were encouraged by what were seeing so far scott matthew colosi  president  chief financial officer david this is scott for next year its really just too early to make any calls on that certainly we read things that people publish that say hey maybe supply is starting to grow again in the cattle world i think we dont have any bids in hand that says what were going to pay next year what were not going to pay next year so its really just too early to tell at this point david e tarantino  robert w baird  co inc broker okay and then maybe a quick followup on the margin side i think you previously said that you would be able to potentially hold restaurant margin percentages flat for the year if you had a midsingle digit comp and now youre guiding to midsingle digit comp so do you think its reasonable to still expect that you can hold the margins flat or will that higher inflation outlook now require a higher level of comp to hold the margins flat scott matthew colosi  president  chief financial officer itll be tough itll be tough at the end of the day with our second quarter coming in a little bit worse off on the margin side than we anticipated itll be a stretch to get there for the full year david e tarantino  robert w baird  co inc broker great thank you very much operator thank you and well go next to john glass with morgan stanley john glass  morgan stanley  co llc one more on beef and then i want to talk about maybe bubbas but the – on the  to  in the back half how certain are you of that have you taken – have you changed courses during the year and locked in more food so youve got better visibility or is that something that youre just basing on the market price of those commodities scott matthew colosi  president  chief financial officer john this is scott weve been floating quite a bit of product all year so i would tell you that theres a bit of risk in that forecast to the good or to the bad and it looks like itll stay that way probably as we continue throughout the year john glass  morgan stanley  co llc okay so bubbas is now going to be nearly  of unit openings this year so im wondering if – i know last couple calls theres been questions but maybe not as much clarity on the unit economics of this business so maybe can you talk a little bit about where you think those are going to look and if theyre going to be substantially different than texas roadhouse and what ways when you think about  might we see the same number of bubbas in other words another  or  of your openings in this concept could it be larger what is your thinking i guess over the next year or so and what do the economics of this business look like scott matthew colosi  president  chief financial officer well john this is scott the unit economics for bubbas generally theyd cost a little bit more than a roadhouse a little bit larger a little bit more parking on the other hand sales typically comparable to or better than a roadhouse margin substantially better than a roadhouse so the returns even though the investment is a little bit higher in the bubbas side the returns should be as good or better than the roadhouse side john glass  morgan stanley  co llc in terms of your overall thoughts about plans of opening in  is this something you – likely to be a larger percentage of your openings in  than was in  scott matthew colosi  president  chief financial officer too early to really comment on at this point i can tell you you might expect us to do a handful of bubbas in  and well give you an update from that on the next call john glass  morgan stanley  co llc okay great and then just one more on that is the economics i presume if volumes the same or better but the margins are about better  its all about the food cost is a much more favorable food cost model or is there some other piece to it scott matthew colosi  president  chief financial officer the food cost is definitely more favorable much higher alcohol mix as part of that with bubbas and just the menu of burgers and pizza versus steaks wayne kent taylor  chairman  chief executive officer and we see some of our competitors on the line here so wed kind of like to not give you all the facts at this point john glass  morgan stanley  co llc got you all right thanks very much operator thank you and well go next to brett levy of deutsche bank brett levy  deutsche bank securities inc good afternoon if we could spend a little bit of time talking more about labor obviously last quarter you gave us about  million to  million and youve already said – of healthcare costs and youve already said that wage rate inflation is trending above the  to  what are you seeing in terms of turnover and is the new – is the  growth that youve seen in the last two quarters per store is that the new norm or do you think we could see some improvement and also just a followup to that is are you looking at any research about the consumer that gives you the feeling that you might have more room to take pricing in the latter portion of the year than you normally do tonya robinson  senior director of investor relations and financial reporting hi brett this scott matthew colosi  president  chief financial officer i tonya robinson  senior director of investor relations and financial reporting oh scott matthew colosi  president  chief financial officer go ahead tonya robinson  senior director of investor relations and financial reporting this is tonya ill just answer the first part of that question on the labor piece i will tell you that we are seeing a little more hourly turnover its up probably  or so i would say versus last year so that is playing a part on our inflation its probably trending more in that  maybe a little higher than that even before the healthcare insurance thats – the healthcare has trended in just like we expected in that  million to  million range so that looks fine but the average wage rate inflation is up a little bit and i think thats what were seeing on the labor line operator thank you and well go next to david palmer with rbc david s palmer  rbc capital markets llc thanks just a quick followup on the beef costs i was a little surprised by the amount of inflation on steak even given the fact that youre floating is there some way for you to describe or just give a sense of maybe the cuts or perhaps you were locked in last year youre not this year to make us understand why the inflation might be a little higher than what we see in some of the urner barry numbers or some of the other published stats thanks scott matthew colosi  president  chief financial officer well david this is scott we were floating quite a bit of product last year and last year – seasonal changes were pretty benign last year so this year is sort of normal seasonality prices tend to peak in the second quarter and so we knew we were going to have probably our highest inflation of the year in the second quarter because of that and it turned out to be the case and its virtually in all the cuts of beef that we sell david s palmer  rbc capital markets llc great thank you operator thank you and well go next to jason west at credit suisse jason west  credit suisse securities usa llc broker yeah thanks i guess was there anything that surprised you guys on the nonbeef inflation just wondering – or if you could talk about at all what those numbers are looking like outside of beef scott matthew colosi  president  chief financial officer this is scott no big surprises seafood is looking pretty favorable and chickens looking pretty stable for us so nothing thats very surprising outside of just the magnitude of beef jason west  credit suisse securities usa llc broker okay and then going back to the pricing decision i recognize you guys probably havent made a decision yet there that you want to disclose anyway but as weve looked at the run rate over the last few years as youve seen a lot of in beef inflation as well in the last few years is there any reason to think the pricing decision would be materially kind of different from the run rate that weve been on or other factors like wages that are really going to weigh more heavily than weve seen on maybe the beef side in the last few years scott matthew colosi  president  chief financial officer wages would weigh a lot more heavily than food costs would since food costs for the most part are of cyclical nature we put a lot more weight on minimum wage or wage rate related things healthcare that sort of impact everybody at the same time versus commodities which is much more selective jason west  credit suisse securities usa llc broker okay thats helpful thank you operator thank you and well go next to karen holthouse with goldman sachs karen holthouse  goldman sachs  co hi thank you for taking the question so in last quarter there was a couple – actually in the past couple of quarters theres been some different technology trials that have been talked about sort of better management of the wait in the restaurants the potential for servers to have handheld devices its a pretty rapidly changing playing field out there so just thinking about is there anything incremental to talk about on that front scott matthew colosi  president  chief financial officer karen this is scott theres nothing incremental on our end we continue to explore look very hard at many different options well aware of what others in the industry are doing and getting a lot of feedback on how those processes work and how well theyre received by those companies and their employees but were looking very hard at what we think might work for us and also know that the technology is changing so fast that were going to be pretty diligent about the directions were going to go karen holthouse  goldman sachs  co great thank you operator thank you and well go next to jeffrey bernstein with barclays jeffrey bernstein  barclays capital inc great thank you very much two questions just want to followup on that prior question related to pricing if i understood it correctly and i think we all know that food is somewhat volatile but labor only goes up so in that scenario i think you said food inflation in the back half is only going to be up  to  and then you go into early  and obviously youre lapping the tremendous inflation that were experiencing right now so in that type of scenario if food was flattish to down a little bit but labor was at these elevated levels youd be more inclined to take more than the  in  again being driven by labor and less by commodity inflation is that how you kind of weight the two of them wayne kent taylor  chairman  chief executive officer jeff this is kent were getting ready to sit down in a week and i go through calls with our operators or our area managers thatll be about  people and we discuss the pricing in their individual market plus the pricing per individual item and then we come out of those calls with some ideas on which parts of the country are more comfortable raising prices maybe less than  or more than  and i think at that point we have a better idea of where were going to end up with our pricing jeffrey bernstein  barclays capital inc got it and then just as you look at the restaurant margin or i guess its obviously closely correlated to auvs but can you talk about a range of the highest to lowest quartile i dont know how you bucket those but im just wondering where the common themes may be of the weaker restaurant margin markets versus the strongest just wondering how you kind of bucket those things as you analyze the portfolio scott matthew colosi  president  chief financial officer this is scott im not understanding where youre – what youre trying to get at with your question jeffrey bernstein  barclays capital inc yeah obviously you have a wide range of auvs across your system im just wondering whether its very directly correlated in terms of the restaurant margin in the best markets versus the worst markets if they follow a similar trend or whether theres something else that might drive some of the weaker margin markets other than auvs im just trying to think about how you look at your portfolio in terms of the performance of the different markets scott matthew colosi  president  chief financial officer well theres no doubt it starts with sales so lower sales typically mean lower margins and there are exceptions in higher wage rate states or what would be your higher other cost of doing business whatever it is in a certain state but for the most part its sales driven its guest count driven but weve got very high sales all over the country so weve got strong markets all over the country its really – were just talking select stores jeffrey bernstein  barclays capital inc got it and lastly it just seemed like – is there any update on the cfo position i think – i dont know if scott youre likely to hold both titles for an extended period or whether the search is still kind of ongoing scott matthew colosi  president  chief financial officer search is still ongoing and were talking to a number of people and weve got a pretty wide reach hopefully well have some news on that as the year goes on jeffrey bernstein  barclays capital inc great thank you operator thank you and well go next to keith siegner with ubs keith r siegner  ubs securities llc thanks and great quarter scott if i could just ask you about – a little bit about the traffic in the top line these are busy boxes right long lines a lot of nights of the week to put up that kind of guest count number is really impressive i just wonder if you could talk about where is the traffic coming from is this increased throughput at peak is it shoulders other nights are the minutes per party trending down if they are how are you getting those minutes per table down just if you could talk a little bit more about that traffic it would be great thanks scott matthew colosi  president  chief financial officer i think it starts with our partnership program and the way we pay our operators theyre partners in the business and they own  of the profits in their restaurants and so they have a great incentive to find ways to run their restaurants in a way that gives them the best opportunity to grow traffic and whether thats adding seats inside the four walls bumping out their restaurants turning tables a little bit faster using certain technologies the way they staff their restaurants local store marketing efforts – but it really starts at that partnership program and baseline incentive and in combination with a great – not messing with the food not messing with the labor standards and you heard kent talk about the pricing strategy for us which has always been very conservative and what we like to say internally we talk – have you tried our steaks lately and so i think thats just a big reason why people keep coming back and visiting us keith r siegner  ubs securities llc so just little bits and pieces kind of across the board of options this sounds like scott matthew colosi  president  chief financial officer yeah keith r siegner  ubs securities llc thank you operator thank you we will take our next question from alton stump at longbow research alton k stump  longbow research llc yes thank you and good afternoon scott matthew colosi  president  chief financial officer how you doing tonya robinson  senior director of investor relations and financial reporting hi alton alton k stump  longbow research llc yeah i just wanted to ask followup questions on the margin front  obviously makes sense given the q result but as i look back at your comp performance which obviously was once again quite positive both for q and to date in the third quarter how do you keep that going obviously youre going to be lapping some awfully difficult comparisons in the back half of the year and specifically on the new product front its been a couple of years since your last major launch of porterhouse i think in the fall of  is there anything planned either back half of this year next year on the new product front andor how – are there other ways you can help to offset some of the comps getting more difficult on the samestore sales front thanks wayne kent taylor  chairman  chief executive officer this is kent no no big products on the – in the pipeline at the moment for the rest of this year or next we think its just basically doing what weve done for a lot of years taking care of our people that end up taking care of our guest and so we let others try to figure the new gimmick and we just stick to our guns and do what weve always done alton k stump  longbow research llc okay thats all i have thank you operator thank you and well go next to paul westra with stifel paul westra  stifel nicolaus  co inc great good afternoon everyone just another followup on your cost of goods sold so i guess the outlook just want to confirm a  to  outlook and i assume thats a yearoveryear basis that is right around pricing is there any reason why you would not see flattish to down yearoveryear cost of goods sold in the second half tonya robinson  senior director of investor relations and financial reporting its definitely possible yeah with the amount of pricing we have in the menu to your point yeah and it looks like it will be – we believe it will be pretty evenly spread over q and q so were not expecting to see the volatility that weve seen here in the first half of the year paul westra  stifel nicolaus  co inc all right then if thats the case then from a seasonal dollar standpoint it sounds like – so its safe to say q dollar cost seasonally can be – whether its  to  higher than the second half of  in order for the cost of goods sold to come back over  closer to the last years  range scott matthew colosi  president  chief financial officer are you talking percent of sales paul westra  stifel nicolaus  co inc yeah yeah im just trying to picture how – clearly you mentioned seasonality is up in q just trying to see how much on a maybe dollar basis you expect your dollar purchases to come down in the second half in order to scott matthew colosi  president  chief financial officer yeah if we ran over  in q wed have to run a little bit below  probably to be at  to  inflation for the back half paul westra  stifel nicolaus  co inc right okay and youre in – and what is beef is now as a percentage of total cost your basket now has inflated so much tonya robinson  senior director of investor relations and financial reporting its about  paul westra  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay and the other  again is relatively benign in the low singles range or so scott matthew colosi  president  chief financial officer you talking inflation all those items paul westra  stifel nicolaus  co inc yes scott matthew colosi  president  chief financial officer its pretty – as a basket its pretty small overall most of our inflation is driven by beef inflation paul westra  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay one more followup on maybe keiths question weve seen a lot of competitors of yours having a pretty – i guess bigger increases in your menu mix impact i know you sort of try to stay true to keeping the check as low as possible but any thoughts on any moving parts in the average check number any possibilities maybe pushing i dont know its whether more desserts or more – or moving people up the menu wayne kent taylor  chairman  chief executive officer this is kent nothing right at this time our guests have a wide variety of menu prices they can choose from when they look at our menus so they kind of decide whether they want to eat something more expensive or less as they visit us paul westra  stifel nicolaus  co inc fair enough congrats on a strong top line performance operator thank you and well go next to andrew strelzik with bmo capital markets andrew strelzik  bmo capital markets united states hey good afternoon thanks for taking the question you mentioned some of the things youre reading that could point to potentially more positive outlook for beef in  so im just wondering if we were to see that type of environment does that all flow to the bottom line or is there anything from a spending perspective maybe pent up that would mitigate that flowing through or how should we think about that scott matthew colosi  president  chief financial officer this is scott certainly weve had some pretty good years in the past when there was beef deflation in the market so you certainly hope a lot of that would flow and wed get some margin – overall margin back that weve given up the last few years in protecting the average check for us but to quantify exactly how much and what that range is thats just something that were just not able to provide you with at this time andrew strelzik  bmo capital markets united states okay and then a question around capital deployment obviously the share repurchase has slowed from last year and the stocks been doing very well so im just wondering how we should think about that going forward you had mentioned wanting to do some franchise acquisitions if those presented themselves is there anything on the horizon from that front or you just looking to be more opportunistic around share repurchase and capital deployment wayne kent taylor  chairman  chief executive officer id say beyond our dividend were going to be very consistent with the dividend and the increasing of that dividend share repurchases franchise acquisitions would be very opportunistic andrew strelzik  bmo capital markets united states okay great thank you operator thank you and well take our next question from john ivankoe with jp morgan john william ivankoe  jpmorgan securities llc hi thank you obviously you involved the operators and the district managers very very closely in the pricing decisions that are being made at the store level with a lot of input kent that you described i think the conversation happens in a week ago so the context of the question is when your operators are seeing much higher than expected increases in cogs and theyre starting to see an uptick in labor in the beginning of this quarter in the second quarter is there any thought of allowing them to do an offcycle pricing like to do a pricing for example when you start to see problems if you price down to april  or may  or whatever it is as a – just bringing that a little bit faster to market as cost and their overall store profitability might actually dictate scott matthew colosi  president  chief financial officer hey john this is scott we might do that if its a wage rate challenge we have actually where youve got lets say alaska or california maybe in new york where youve got midyear pretty big wage rate changes we might do something in those states and we might do it in multiple parts we might do it in one whole swing it varies in the past weve taken multiple price increases throughout a year if the cost structure changed in a certain way but if its something where we think the prices of some item like beef are coming back down throughout the year and if were floating a lot of product we might not take a price increase sooner if you will to offset that well be patient and let that play through and so – which means maybe our guys are losing a little bit in q maybe theyre winning a little bit more in q and q so well look at all the angles on that stuff john william ivankoe  jpmorgan securities llc thank you operator thank you and well go next to kurt moeller with calvert kurt moeller  calvert investments good afternoon i apologize if this is a redundant question but im still puzzled in trying to figure it out why exactly are beef costs rising so much faster at texas roadhouse than at competitors scott matthew colosi  president  chief financial officer i will tell you it depends on how they bought their beef last year were they locked in were they floating it also depends on how theyre buying it this year are they locked in are they floating you just cant look at just one quarter i would look at what their full year forecasts are for inflation in those commodities and then lastly i would tell you are they using the same cut of beef yeartoyear or have they changed the type of beef that theyre buying or something in their process wayne kent taylor  chairman  chief executive officer and i would reiterate what scott just said i think youll find that some of the competitors that maybe used to be selling choice steaks are now selling select kurt moeller  calvert investments would it be fair also to say that as texas roadhouse is buying i think a higher percentage in the spot market than at least some of your competitors that that differential is contributing to the differential in beef cost increases scott matthew colosi  president  chief financial officer it could be dependent upon what the cuts are kurt moeller  calvert investments all right and finally how do we get credibility in the beef forecast for the second half of the year given whats happened in the first half of the year tonya robinson  senior director of investor relations and financial reporting well i think anytime youre floating your beef theres going to be some shortterm volatility to it and i think thats just something were comfortable with were comfortable with that volatility on a shortterm basis so – and we feel like thats the best choice to make kurt moeller  calvert investments does this imply that the pricing increase was just frankly too small back in the fourth quarter of last year and it should have been higher wayne kent taylor  chairman  chief executive officer wow i wish i had a crystal ball to forecast what beef will be a year from now but we really dont we are – we go to the suppliers and theyll give you a contract for next year right now but it would be significantly higher versus what we think were going to pay for the overall year so its really tough to know say three out of four years we win the way that we play the game and then maybe one year the way we play the game we dont really hit it like we thought we would but thats kind of how weve done it over the last  years and in general we do quite well with it scott matthew colosi  president  chief financial officer yeah i think its just – its just sometimes we know going into the year were not going to take enough pricing to offset inflation and so were going to need to grow traffic quite a bit if dollar for dollar were going to make up that difference weve grown traffic quite a bit and we think based on our sales growth were doing a lot of the right things sometimes you take a little bit on the chin in the short term to keep things going great in the long term and our average unit volumes now are going to pass  million this year i think its more than  million dollars more than most of who you would consider to be our steak competitors so we think were doing some things right with this longterm approach were taking to balance the equation of pricing versus the cost of running the business kurt moeller  calvert investments yes sales have been fantastic thats been great to see operator thank you and well take our final question today from david carlson with keybanc david carlson  keybanc capital markets inc hey guys just real quick just to piggyback off of that last question were really only a third of the way into the quarter at this point you indicated that youre still floating a lot of your needs that was the case last quarter do you have any better visibility this quarter incrementally than you had last quarter to what that cost is going to be are you incrementally more locked than you were in the last quarter im just really trying to get a better handle on really this confidence in the back half which is a pretty dramatic shift down scott matthew colosi  president  chief financial officer yeah were not going to give exact numbers on how much were locked or how much were floating except to say were floating a lot of product and so there is some risk there there is a lot of seasonal history in where beef costs go and theres already been a pretty dramatic change even from where beef price has peaked back in midapril – down quite a bit so we are believing that those trends will continue as the year goes on and you get past the fourth of julys and labor days and that kind of thing and so weve got a very experienced beef buying team in our company and were standing behind their forecast right now david carlson  keybanc capital markets inc thank you operator and we do have one more question in the queue well go next to brian vaccaro with raymond james brian m vaccaro  raymond james  associates inc yeah thank you most of mine have been already answered but i wanted to just go back to the third quarter i understand obviously the drivers of the preopening shift but if maybe we could get a little tighter help on the third quarter versus fourth quarter preopening time just to kind of get everybody on the same page given the magnitude of the shift i think that would helpful thank you tonya robinson  senior director of investor relations and financial reporting sure no problem brian yeah i would say just with  openings during the quarter were going to see a pretty big increase you could call it a  million  million versus what we saw this year i think is what well be seeing probably in q brian m vaccaro  raymond james  associates inc okay thank you operator and there are no more questions in the queue i will now turn it back to tonya robinson for closing remarks tonya robinson  senior director of investor relations and financial
