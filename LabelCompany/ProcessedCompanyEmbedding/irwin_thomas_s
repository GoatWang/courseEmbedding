thomass strat  any info and your thoughts about sd stacked singles « on july    pm » hey allafter whatching it reminded me how much i like the tone irwin gets with this strat irwin thomasjack jones was in my office a couple of years back with his strat checking out pedals im pretty sure its the same strat that he uses in this utube clip old gibson paf in the bridge and some sort of seymour duncan stacks that looked vintage  poles no rails  in the middle and bridge he could not remember which ones but he hit the strings harder than anyone ive ever seen and got an brilliant tone if anyone has any more info on his strat i would be very interested including what value pots hes using i think there is something clever going on to get such a great clean strat sound but not have any noise but having a bucker in the bridge means maybe k pots so has anyone had any experience running k pots with sd stracked singles i know they have a reputation of being a bit muddy but perhaps with k pots they would sing my woodstocks are good but they are extremely midrangy which is great for somethings but i would prefer a more strat sounding strat i have some very bad wiring around my studiooffice so noiseless is a bonus at least on one of my strats any and all suggestions most welcome logged jules  thepedalman wwwmyspacecomthepedalman gary aggh supporting member posts  re irwin thomass strat  any info and your thoughts about sd stacked singles « reply  on july    am » hi jules if the sd stacked pickups are the old models from the s they used to come with red covers and were deeper than a regular strat pickup you could change the covers though and it wouldnt matter from memory they sounded ok bigger than a strat sound but in the same family i seem to remember though that they some had  blades i know youve been looking at this noise thing for a while now i still think kinmans or the suhr bpscc would be a good choice i am setting up two guys systems next week one with a sd humbucker who wants a couple of suhr fl singles and a bpscc to get rid of the noise and another who is getting a set of brierleys and wants to fit a bpscc with them the brierleys work well with the bpscc les rankin has installed some in his personal guitar and ive passed along some info from john suhr to mick so that his pickups would work seemlessly  that clip is irwin doing im buzzed a mike landau tune he does a great job with it mike is using suhr pickups and guitars and amps now ssv humbucker fl singles fl  fletcherlandau with built in ssc systemgary logged disclosure i like good coffee bushmills irish whiskey i also import suhr products mickb aggh supporting member posts  re irwin thomass strat  any info and your thoughts about sd stacked singles « reply  on july    am »  thanks for that gary
