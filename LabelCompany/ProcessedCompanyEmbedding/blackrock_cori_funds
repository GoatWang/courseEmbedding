annuity yet gives consumers the ability to walk away like a traditional mutual fund no long surrender charge like most annuitiesthis interesting new products details it is supposed to debut in the spring of  were actually sent to us from a consumer who was wondering how this blackrock retirement product will be different than a traditional annuity that could be purchased from an insurance carrier although we dont have all of the fine details as this new cori indexed product is not available yet we did our best to give a completely independent of review of the blackrock cori retirement fund product vs the proscons of a traditional annuityas you most already know no retirement product we ever talk about is perfect for everyone but this certainly has its place for the right consumer moreover we imagine because of blackrocks strong name in the financial world this cori retirement income product will fare quite well according to blackrocks website the cori retirement index cori index provides a daily level that can be used to calculate an estimate of how much annual income your current savings could generate as early as  years before retirement specifically your cori index level helps you determine an estimate of how much money you need today to generate each dollar of future inflationadjusted annual lifetime income starting at age httpwwwblackrockcomcoriwhatisfor more

retirement business with new funds indexes money manager turns focus to retirement income distribution vs accumulation feb     am by darla mercado  zoom blackrock led by ceo larry fink is extending its push into the retirement business bloomberg news blackrock inc is pushing further into the retirement income sphere this time launching a lineup of bond funds and indexes that try to measure the cost of lifetime income back in july the asset management juggernaut filed a lineup of bond funds with the securities and exchange commission dubbing this new product the blackrock cori funds the bond funds primarily invest in corporate bonds us government bonds and treasuries the funds themselves which opened for investing on jan  have maturity dates ranging from  to  and theyre aimed at clients aged  to  blackrock also launched a series of indexes with corresponding maturity dates which will track the changes over time to the expected median cost of lifetime income for a person turning  at the target year the funds will aim to track the indexesinvestors and advisers can track the indexes on the new york stock exchange to determine how much estimated income the client will get from his or her retirement savings or the amount the client needs to save in order to reach a set amount of income the initial launch of the indexes last summer followed by the opening of the funds are part of a greater strategy by blackrock in which the company is putting more emphasis on life at and after retirement as opposed to concentrating merely on accumulation “were seeing four stages in the investor lifecycle accumulation up to age  preretirement — where you see the retirement horizon but you still have enough time to correct course early retirement and late retirement cori is critical in preretirement and early retirement” said chip castille head of blackrocks definedcontribution business and us retirement group at the target date investors have a couple of options they can choose to stay in the fund which will liquidate over the course of  years they can also opt to liquidate their holdings and work with an adviser to move into a retirement income product such as an annuity the goal of the fund isnt to compete with the insurance industry but rather to complement the many types of annuities that are already out there mr castille noted “youre getting ready for the annuity purchase cori shows your ability to purchase lifetime income” he said mr castille also said that for the first  years in retirement investors can receive income payouts get yields of  in todays rate environment and still maintain the ability to buy the annuity at some point in the future as a bond fund and not an insurance product cori has no guarantees the development of the suite is the latest salvo from the asset management side on distributing retirement income according to geoff bobroff a mutual fund industry consultant life insurers have dominated that battle against asset managers due to carriers ability to provide guaranteed income “the asset management industry continues to fuss with some kind of payout product but nothing has really worked to attract the attention of the individual” mr bobroff said “without a guarantee and with the current level of interest rates its hard to see people committing the necessary level of assets to buy a stream of income”  comments what
