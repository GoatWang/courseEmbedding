in the roots music businessconstant touring promotional work and recording projects all done with an energy enthusiasm and gusto that marks her out as a winner but that would be nothing if she wasnt also seriously talented as you will hear on this album she is a great songwriter a unique and distinctive singer and one of the best guitarists on the planet i remember inviting deborah to make an album for me nearly  years ago now but that was in the days when there were people in the game who believed there was gold to be mined in this indie blues label game and were splashing the cash about but what is meant to be happens in the end and here we are with a wonderful album  contemporary relevant and high energy but also with the realness of the old time stuff check out the sheer catchiness of the instrumental motor city ii the telling personal lyrics to stop the game and zero the absolute amount of inventiveness of the guitar everywhere the soulful passion of the singing and the
