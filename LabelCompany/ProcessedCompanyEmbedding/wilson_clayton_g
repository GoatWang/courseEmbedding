glove on with your batting glove you should always wear one inside your baseball glove to protect the insides from dirt and salts from your hands which can deteriorate the leather your glove should also have enough padding to protect the palm area for catching balls offcenter make sure your glove is easily adjustable to ensure a snug fit top of guide how do i break in my glove your baseball glove is a part of you and how you break it in can mean the difference between a glove that serves you well and one youll pitch into the trash getting it off to a good start will reward you with a wellperforming comfortable glove some baseball gloves are prebroken in but for a custom fit its best to do it yourself youll know your new glove is broken in right when its comfortable and performs well breaking in a baseball glove can take anywhere from a couple of weeks to half a season depending on how often you use it with patience and a little knowhow your glove will endure many seasons there are basically three phases to breaking in your new glove youll need to condition the leather the first thing youll want to do when breaking in a baseball glove is to soften it you can do this by lubricating it a new leather glove will feel very stiff at first youll need to apply a special glove conditioner lexol and kelley leather products are good they condition the leather without coating it and weighing it down put a little of the oil on a sponge or clean cloth and apply it to the hinge and palm areas fingers back and strings of your glove work it in and then remove any excess oil lubricate your glove a couple times a year to keep it soft and prevent cracking now work your glove put your glove on and flex it at the hinge the spot that allows your glove to open and close usually found at the base of the little finger pad near the heel remove your glove and gently keep folding your glove back and forth at the hinge do this several times or as often as it takes until it softens shape the glove next youll want to shape your baseball glove place a ball inside the glove and securely wrap it with a band to form a pocket and store it overnight at room temperature you should always store your glove when youre not using it and get in the habit of tucking a ball in the pocket and wrapping it securely to retain its shape these first two phases of breaking in a baseball glove prepare your glove for use and now youre ready to use it break it in now you should just get out and play a lot of catch in your new baseball glove use your glove at least once a day because this will help to form the pocket for a custom fit some people like to use a special round mallet to prepare the pocket of the glove for catching the ball others like to punch it either way the idea is to form a nice deep pocket for catching the ball while youre playing keep flexing your glove at the hinges as often as you can even between catches until opening and closing the glove feels natural and comfortable conclusion hopefully weve covered some helpful tips for breaking in a baseball glove remember the three phases of breaking in your glove are softening the leather shaping your glove and using it it could take a couple weeks or up to half a season depending on how often you use your glove in any case when it comes down to baseball theres nothing like a great customfitting baseball glove top of guide how do i care for my glove though leather baseball gloves are tough and durable theyre made from an organic hide thats naturally vulnerable to deterioration the right baseball glove care will extend the life of your glove and reward you with years of use first of all take a look at what the glove manufacturers care instructions say for your general information weve provided a few practical tips for routine maintenance for keeping your baseball glove in great shape break in your glove naturally best way to break in your glove is to play ball with it dont try and force your glove using the old home remedies such as soaking lubricating baking beating etc which will do nothing more than wreck your glove make baseball glove care a routine regular maintenance of your glove in between uses or at least once per season will keep your glove in top condition routine maintenance clean your baseball glove after each use remove it from your equipment bag wipe the dirt and debris off with a clean rag and store it on a shelf store your glove between uses on a shelf in a cool dry place or at room temperature dont leave your glove sitting around outside near a heater or in your equipment bag keep your glove dry if your glove gets wet dry if off as well as you can with a clean absorbent rag and let it naturally air dry be aware that air drying tends to stiffen the leather dont worry it should soften again naturally with use do not blow dry it put it near a furnace or in the dryer as this can dry the leather out and make it crack apply a safe leather conditioner to the glove after it has dried to soften it protect the inside of your glove sweat and dirt from your hands can take a toll on the inside of your glove protect it by wearing a light glove such as your batting glove inside of your baseball glove clean and condition your baseball glove using safe leather product such as lexol leather cleaner and conditioner or kelley glovolution some people recommend using a lanolin shaving cream dont spit on your glove as the material in your saliva can deteriorate it reshape your glove at least once a season place a softball in the pocket of your glove and wrap it with a binder tighten or retie the laces in the fingers and web of your glove best to use square and overhand knots check in between the fingers of your gloves for open seams and palms and check for broken laces if you find any have them repaired as soon as possible to prevent injury and mishaps how to clean your baseball glove a little tender loving care between uses or at least once a season and youll have a glove that lasts you many seasons heres what to do brush the dirt and dust off your glove with a light brush use a damp cloth or sponge to apply a small amount of glove leather cleaner lexol leather cleaner is good wipe the entire glove with it remove the cleaner from the glove with a damp cloth or sponge and allow to air dry rub in an oil product safe for baseball glove leather such as lexol leather conditioner kelley glovolution or a lanolinbased product to the entire glove and store do not use too much leather cleaner or your glove will never forgive you over oil or use oil conditioners such as linseed oil mink oil neatsfoot oil silicon or petroleumbased products as the oil will to tend to close the pores and build up on the glove your best bet is to stick with products known to be safe for baseball glove leather or follow your manufacturers recommendations conclusion baseball glove leather is organic and vulnerable to deterioration over time glove leather requires care and regular maintenance to keep it performing well remember to break your glove in naturally store at room or cool temperatures indoors after games and practices and in between seasons dont heatdry your glove and keep it clean and conditioned with safe products  preferably those specifically designed for glove leather with the right baseball glove care youll be enjoying your glove for many seasons to come top of guide whats the difference between a baseball glove and a softball glove baseball and softball are similar games requiring similar equipment gloves are designed to simply retrieve the ball during games so whats the difference between the two gloves the main differences have to do with size and design in order to accommodate a larger ball and a little different pitching style gloves all look the same to me whats the difference baseball and softball gloves share the same basic glove features involving construction webbing and materials but with variations in size both softball and baseball gloves are available in fullgrain leather or synthetic materials manufacturers of both styles of baseball make positionspecific gloves such as catchers and first baseman mitts baseball and softball gloves are both sized according to infield and outfield positions you can also buy allposition gloves for both kinds of ball play unlike baseball softball gloves offer specific sizes for fastpitch and slowpitch whats the difference between fastpitch and slowpitch softball fastpitch and slowpitch softball the difference is the speed and style of the pitch fastpitch is closer to baseball and is the most competitive form of softball played by both men and women underhand balls are thrown hard at speeds of up to  mph and at distances of up to  feet pitchers use a windmill style of pitching the ball with a low arc slowpitch is the most common recreation form of softball in which an underhand ball is pitched slower and with a higher arc the two styles use similar gloves but with a few subtle differences fastpitch softball gloves vs slowpitch softball gloves size of balls slowpitch being a little larger than fastpitch and pitching styles command slight design variations because slowpitch batters tend to hit balls toward the outfield slowpitch gloves have slightly larger webbing and pockets to make catching easier on outfielders since fastpitch softballs travel more quickly batters tend to hit ground balls in the infield more than toward the outfield so fastpitch glove pockets are a little deeper to allow infielders to more easily
