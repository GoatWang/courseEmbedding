would need to be vigorously investigated but maintains we are not in crisis yet i beg to differ there are as many theories about why this is happening as there are scientists researching the problem perhaps it is the increased levels of oestrogen in the diet perhaps it is exposure to pesticides or perhaps it is the use of bpa plastics but only one has produced convincing evidence of causation –

favourite colour is or even that tomorrow is your birthday to him you are one of just three things a meal entertainment or too nasty to bother with the tiger will test you he will growl bare his teeth or make an imperceptible but swift movement in your direction these are all tests he is probing you monitoring you for signs of strength or weakness he will use every faculty millions of years of adaptation have given him to determine whether you are trouble or lunch you cannot reason with him you cannot threaten him you cannot plead for mercy your only chance of survival is to convince him that you are more trouble than you are worth if you manage that he will turn and walk away without a backward glance if you can’t your goose is cooked well eaten the tiger’s cold assessment of your

a  per cent increase over the past decade south australia has had a fluoridated water supply since  can we finally abandon the idiotic notion that tooth decay is caused by an absence of fluoride can we finally admit that the problem is and always has been sugar can we finally stop stop consigning children to wholemouth clearances all teeth removed because the sugar industry has our health

july  at pm · lengthy article on the new book in this weekends courier mail brisbane but heres the best bit the aim of taming toxic people is not to point the finger at anyone but to give people tools to assess someone as “potentially being this type of person” and give them ways to defend themselves in a work environment for ­example gillespie advises anyone who fears the boss may be a psychopath to take contemporaneous notes “be polite be professional and record everything” ­gillespie says “as soon as whatever conversation has ­occurred make notes in your own time and they will come in handy because one of the things psychopaths have difficulty with is maintaining a consistent story” documented abuse makes company lawyers nervous he adds he further advises if you are working for a psychopath – and he identifies excessive micromanagement and centralising all decisionmaking as key indicators – then your only choice is scrupulous personal honesty politeness and compliance doing exactly what you are asked to do without responding emotionally  see moreyour boss is most likely a psychopathbrace yourself not only were mother teresa winston churchill and gandhi possible

according to this expert diabetes isn’t caused by having too much sugar but by a failure of the pancreas to produce enough insulin to control glucose levels in the blood says caroline butler a care adviser for diabetes uk this means having too much sugar cannot in itself cause it however type  diabetes can be triggered by excess weight gain perhaps through eating too many sugary foods this is typical of the sort of advice dispensed by diabetes organisations in australia too it is the equivalent of saying a car accident wasnt caused by brake failure it was caused by running into another car the fact that socalled professionals can generate such utter codswallop and not ask the simple question but what causes the pancreas to fail shows how shallow the talent pool is in nutritional science the answer by the way is insulin resistance brought on by accumulation of fatty acids in the liver in turn brought on my over consumption of fructose  how do i know that because the science is old and freely available but clearly accessing it is beyond the ken of those employed to look after our health see moresugar triggers diabetes and eight other health myths that arent strictly trueleading

updated their cover photo · july  at am · david gillespie · june  · another stonkingly good piece from peter fitzsimons this time he takes aim at the dietitians association of australia daa often you see daa spokespeople instead of sounding the sirens on the dangers of sugar as youd expect actively playing down the dangers  australia is in the middle of an obesity epidemic in large part because instead of the  kilograms a year of sugar that humans are equipped to eat without damage the average australian is consuming  to  times that amount and the association is saying stuff that could only please sugar interests do you find it perchance weird and even troubling that just last month the daa held a seminar for its dietitians on the future of foods within the offices of cocacola in north sydney wouldnt that be like the lung foundation having a meeting of its medical professionals in the offices of british american tobacco all good friends and jolly good company and of course this column will draw a robust denial from the daa that the food and beverage companies have any influence on it whatsoever but let it answer this if the likes of cocacola kelloggs and nestle dont have any influence on you daa what are they getting for their money see morethe notsosweet link between big sugar and the peak body for dietitianswe need a government that insists the public health infrastructure be freed from the influence of big sugarsmhcomaudavid gillespie · june  · when the dietitians association and the heart foundation fly into a frenzy to decry a diet which asks people to avoid processed food any thinking person would ask why is there science behind this or have these two venerable organisations simply become mouthpieces for the processed food industry that provides them with such significant financial support such is the corrosive power of conflicts of interest there are now very persuasive reasons to worry about their advice that we should consume seed oils vegetable oils and there is just as compelling evidence that ignoring sugar is taking a daily toll on the health of all australians we need the heart foundation to follow the lead of the canadian heart foundation and immediately trash its tick program and we need our dietitians to throw off the yoke of corporate sponsorship and provide evidence based dietary advice untainted by the smell of food industry money we don’t need the guardians of our health attacking a scientifically and logically defensible aversion to processed food we need them guarding our health without fear or favour especially without favour see moreif the heart foundation and dietitians association didn’t exist would the food industry need to invent themspend quite a bit of their time attacking what they call “fad diets”  unfortunately their flat out disregard for the evidence is making their statements sound more and more like press releases issued by the processed food industrydavidgillespieorgdavid gillespie · june  · theres been a flurry of stories over the report this week that coconut oil is as unhealthy as animal fat that is true but not in the sense i think they mean they are both the best possible sources of fat you can get the report is a highly selective analysis of studies conducted in the s i say highly selective because they manage to completely ignore two of the largest randomized controlled trials ever conducted on the question of healthy fat the mce and the sydney diet heart trial both linked in comments below unpublished results from both have recently been analysed by the us national institutes of health the conclusion from the mce a trial of almost  people was that substitution of vegetable oils for animal fats did lower cholesterol but increased death rates from all causes by  and did nothing to improve your chances of having a heart attack the sydney trial arrived at similar conclusions vegetable oils increased death from all causes by  and death
