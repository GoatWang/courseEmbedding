december    am eastern standard time port townsend wabusiness wireintellicheck mobilisa inc nyse amexidn was featured on fox business news discussing how its defense id® access control product could have prevented the terrorist attack aboard an airliner in detroit in the segment titled “minimizing the threat” cheryl casone interviews steve williams chief operating officer of intellicheck mobilisa and asks him how defense id could have prevented the attack on the detroit bound plane since the attempted bomber had identification mr williams commented “we would have scanned his id and run the id against multiple databases he was previously turned away in london and as a result we could have used those databases literally an unlimited number of data sources to validate that person and make sure they weren’t on a watch list or a no fly list or a wanted list for that matter just like a tsa officer you would scan a drivers license or a passport and it would run a ‘bad guy’ check in about a second” when asked if the company is getting more interest in its product mr williams replied “absolutely we have about  locations already in the us and we are including more data sources every day we are obviously getting more requests today our stock is up  and we speculate it is due to the interest by tsa” ms casone asked mr williams how quickly he could get a device to an airport if they called up tomorrow mr williams replied “by the time they hang up the phone we can have a device to them we have a national distribution channel of major vendors throughout the country” when ms casone asked how this gentleman was able to travel from lagos to amsterdam to detroit with a bomb strapped to his body mr williams answered “you can add bomb detection machinery but a bomb is a bomb and it takes a bomber to detonate it whether it be a bomb or anything else you have to screen individuals that is the way you are going to catch the bad guy” to watch the segment online please visit
