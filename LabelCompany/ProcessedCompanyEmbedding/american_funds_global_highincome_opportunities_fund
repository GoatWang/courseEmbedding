nextshares work differently when nextshares investors sell their shares they don’t normally transact with the fund instead they trade through a broker to sell their shares to someone else buyers may include other longterm investors or professional traders acting as market makers in the funds shares because the nextshares fund itself is not involved in these transactions the fund isnt required to sell securities to raise cash – so no capital gains distributions are triggered for remaining fund shareholders when market makers and other large investors accumulate sufficient shares of a

source morningstar® the style box reveals a funds investment style for credit quality of the bonds owned morningstar combines credit rating information provided by the fund companies only using ratings assigned by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization  nrsro with an average default rate calculation to come up with a weightedaverage credit quality the weightedaverage credit quality is currently a letter that roughly corresponds to the scale used by a leading nrsro funds with a low credit quality style box placement are those whose weightedaverage credit quality is less than bbb medium are those less than aa but greater or equal to bbb and high are those of aa or higher when classifying a bond portfolio morningstar first maps the nrsro credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates as determined by morningstars analysis of actual historical default rates morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average default rate for the entire bond fund finally morningstar maps this average default rate to its corresponding credit rating along a convex curve for interestrate sensitivity morningstar obtains from fund companies the average effective duration generally morningstar classifies a fixedincome funds interestrate sensitivity based on effective duration of the morningstar core bond index mcbi which is currently three years the classification of limited will be assigned to those funds whose average effective duration is between  to  of mcbis average effective duration average effective duration

two halves early in the month european central bank ecb president mario draghi led the eurozone towards continued excessive accommodation which caused rates to move much lower across europe however coordinated hawkish central bank messaging at the end of the month reversed the relentless flattening of the yield curve while the testimony of former fbi director james comey was a nonevent as far as financial markets were concerned the fed raised the fed funds rate for the second time this year in midmonth while laying out a plan to reduce its massive  trillion balance sheet which should start in the near term as of now it appears the fed will allow  billion of us treasury exposure to roll off monthly and  billion for agency mortgages with these caps increasing over time to limit market impact while one would expect this to cause interest rates to rise a lack of global inflation has yield curves flattening with rates near their yeartodate lows yet again although this reversed somewhat at the end of the month looking forward commodity prices are again on top of investors’ minds due to the large oil selloff and the implications this has for global investors in addition we may learn of nominations to fill vacant fed seats in addition to janet yellen’s future as her term is set to expire in february  this of course would have implications for global markets looking ahead the first half of the year was fairly quiet from a historical volatility perspective and we do expect more volatility in the back half of  global energy prices impact everything from the health of emerging markets to consumer spending habits so we will be keeping a close eye on commodity prices and the impact for global risk and rate markets most market participants believe it’s a close call whether the fed hikes again in  however our team also believes it will be imperative to watch the impact of the beginning of the wind down of the fed’s balance sheet we are also paying close attention to the ecb as any sign of inflation may cause a change in policy the ecb has remained very accommodative however growth and labor markets are improving in addition a reduction in geopolitical risks may make it more likely that the ecb moves towards a less accommodative policy in the third quarter fees and minimums fees widget loading  portfolio portfolio widget loading  management fund managers william
