values added of all resident and institutional units engaged in production plus any taxes and minus any subsidies on products not included in the value of their outputs” an imf publication states that gdp measures the monetary value of final goods and services  that is those that are bought by the final user  produced in a country in a given period of time say a quarter or a year total gdp can also be broken down into the contribution of each industry or sector of the economy the ratio of gdp to the total population of the region is the per capita gdp and the same is called mean standard of living historyedit william petty came up with a basic concept of gdp to defend landlords against unfair taxation during warfare between the dutch and the english between  and  charles davenant developed the method further in  the modern concept of gdp was first developed by simon kuznets for a us congress report in  in this report kuznets warned against its use as a measure of welfare see below under limitations and criticisms after the bretton woods conference in  gdp became the main tool for measuring a countrys economy at that time gross national product gnp was the preferred estimate which differed from gdp in that it measured production by a countrys citizens at home and abroad rather than its resident institutional units see oecd definition above the switch from gnp to gdp in the us was in  trailing behind most other nations the history of the concept of gdp should be distinguished from the history of changes in ways of estimating it the value added by firms is relatively easy to calculate from their accounts but the value added by the public sector by financial industries and by intangible asset creation is more complex these activities are increasingly important in developed economies and the international conventions governing their estimation and their inclusion or exclusion in gdp regularly change in an attempt to keep up with industrial advances in the words of one academic economist the actual number for gdp is therefore the product of a vast patchwork of statistics and a complicated set of processes carried out on the raw data to fit them to the conceptual framework determining gross domestic product gdpedit economics a supply and demand diagram illustrating the effects of an increase in demand index outline category history types

knowledge labour law managerial monetary  financial natural resource organizational personnel public  welfare economics regional rural service urban welfare lists economists publications journals business and economics portal v t e gdp can be determined in three ways all of which should in principle give the same result they are the production or output or value added approach the income approach or the expenditure approach the most direct of the three is the production approach which sums the outputs of every class of enterprise to arrive at the total the expenditure approach works on the principle that all of the product must be bought by somebody therefore the value of the total product must be equal to peoples total expenditures in buying things the income approach works on the principle that the incomes of the productive factors producers colloquially must be equal to the value of their product and determines gdp by finding the sum of all producers incomes production approachedit this approach mirrors the oecd definition given above estimate the gross value of domestic output out of the many various economic activities determine the intermediate consumption ie the cost of material supplies and services used to produce final goods or services deduct intermediate consumption from gross value to obtain the gross value added gross value added  gross value of output – value of intermediate consumption value of output  value of the total sales of goods and services plus value of changes in the inventory the sum of the gross value added in the various economic activities is known as gdp at factor cost gdp at factor cost plus indirect taxes less subsidies on products  gdp at producer price for measuring output of domestic product economic activities ie industries are classified into various sectors after classifying economic activities the output of each sector is calculated by any of the following two methods by multiplying the output of each sector by their respective market price and adding them together by collecting data on gross sales and inventories from the records of companies and adding them together the gross value of all sectors is then added to get the gross value added gva at factor cost subtracting each sectors intermediate consumption from gross output gives the gdp at factor cost adding indirect tax minus subsidies in gdp at factor cost gives the gdp at producer prices income approachedit list of countries by gdp ppp per capita by  international monetary fund countries by  gdp nominal per capita        –     –     –     –     –     –     –        unavailable us gdp computed on the income basis the second way of estimating gdp is to use the sum of primary incomes distributed by resident producer units if gdp is calculated this way it is sometimes called gross domestic income gdi or gdp i gdi should provide the same amount as the expenditure method described later by definition gdi  gdp in practice however measurement errors will make the two figures slightly off when reported by national statistical agencies this method measures gdp by adding incomes that firms pay households for factors of production they hire  wages for labour interest for capital rent for land and profits for entrepreneurship the us national income and expenditure accounts divide incomes into five categories wages salaries and supplementary labour income corporate profits interest and miscellaneous investment income farmers incomes income from nonfarm unincorporated businesses these five income components sum to net domestic income at factor cost two adjustments must be made to get gdp indirect taxes minus subsidies are added to get from factor cost to market prices depreciation or capital consumption allowance is added to get from net domestic product to gross domestic product total income can be subdivided according to various schemes leading to various formulae for gdp measured by the income approach a common one is gdp  compensation of employees  gross operating surplus  gross mixed income  taxes less subsidies on production and imports gdp  coe  gos  gmi  tp  m – sp  m compensation of employees coe measures the total remuneration to employees for work done it includes wages and salaries as well as employer contributions to social security and other such programs gross operating surplus gos is the surplus due to owners of incorporated businesses often called profits although only a subset of total costs are subtracted from gross output to calculate gos gross mixed income gmi is the same measure as gos but for unincorporated businesses this often includes most small businesses the sum of coe gos and gmi is called total factor income it is the income of all of the factors of production in society it measures the value of gdp at factor basic prices the difference between basic prices and final prices those used in the expenditure calculation is the total taxes and subsidies that the government has levied or paid on that production so adding taxes less subsidies on production and imports converts gdp at factor cost to gdpi total factor income is also sometimes expressed as total factor income  employee compensation  corporate profits  proprietors income  rental income  net interest expenditure approachedit the third way to estimate gdp is to calculate the sum of the final uses of goods and services all uses except intermediate consumption measured in purchasers prices market goods which are produced are purchased by someone in the case where a good is produced and unsold the standard accounting convention is that the producer has bought the good from themselves therefore measuring the total expenditure used to buy things is a way of measuring production this is known as the expenditure method of calculating gdp components of gdp by expenditureedit us gdp computed on the expenditure basis gdp y is the sum of consumption c investment i government spending g and net exports x – m y  c  i  g  x − m here is a description of each gdp component c consumption is normally the largest gdp component in the economy consisting of private expenditures in the economy household final consumption expenditure these personal expenditures fall under one of the following categories durable goods nondurable goods and services examples include food rent jewelry gasoline and medical expenses but not the purchase of new housing i investment includes for instance business investment in equipment but does not include exchanges of existing assets examples include construction of a new mine purchase of software or purchase of machinery and equipment for a factory spending by households not government on new houses is also included in investment in contrast to its colloquial meaning investment in gdp does not mean purchases of financial products buying financial products is classed as saving as opposed to investment this avoids doublecounting if one buys shares in a company and the company uses the money received to buy plant equipment etc the amount will be counted toward gdp when the company spends the money on those things to also count it when one gives it to the company would be to count two times an amount that only corresponds to one group of products buying bonds or stocks is a swapping of deeds a transfer of claims on future production not directly an expenditure on products g government spending is the sum of government expenditures on final goods and services it includes salaries of public servants purchases of weapons for the military and any investment expenditure by a government it does not include any transfer payments such as social security or unemployment benefits x exports represents gross exports gdp captures the amount a country produces including goods and services produced for other nations consumption therefore exports are added m imports represents gross imports imports are subtracted since imported goods will be included in the terms g i or c and must be deducted to avoid counting foreign supply as domestic note that c g and i are expenditures on final goods and services expenditures on intermediate goods and services do not count intermediate goods and services are those used by businesses to produce other goods and services within the accounting year according to the us bureau of economic analysis which is responsible for calculating the national accounts in the united states in general the source data for the expenditures components are considered more reliable than those for the income components see income method below gdp vs gniedit gdp can be contrasted with gross national product gnp or as it is now known gross national income gni the difference is that gdp defines its scope according to location while gni defines its scope according to ownership in a global context world gdp and world gni are therefore equivalent terms gdp is product produced within a countrys borders gni is product produced by enterprises owned by a countrys citizens the two would be the same if all of the productive enterprises in a country were owned by its own citizens and those citizens did not own productive enterprises in any other countries in practice however foreign ownership makes gdp and gni nonidentical production within a countrys borders but by an enterprise owned by somebody outside the country counts as part of its gdp but not its gni on the other hand production by an enterprise located outside the country but owned by one of its citizens counts as part of its gni but not its gdp for example the gni of the usa is the value of output produced by americanowned firms regardless of where the firms are located similarly if a country becomes increasingly in debt and spends large amounts of income servicing this debt this will be reflected in a decreased gni but not a decreased gdp similarly if a country sells off its resources to entities outside their country this will also be reflected over time in decreased gni but not decreased gdp this would make the use of gdp more attractive for politicians in countries with increasing national debt and decreasing assets gross national income gni equals gdp plus income receipts from the rest of the world minus income payments to the rest of the world in  the united states switched from using gnp to using gdp as its primary measure of production the relationship between united states gdp and gnp is shown in table  of the national income and product accounts international standardsedit the international standard for measuring gdp is contained in the book system of national accounts  which was prepared by representatives of the international monetary fund european union organization for economic cooperation and development united nations and world bank the publication is normally referred to as sna to distinguish it from the previous edition published in  called sna  sna provides a set of rules and procedures for the measurement of national accounts the standards are designed to be flexible to allow for differences in local statistical needs and conditions this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it august  national measurementedit within each country gdp is normally measured by a national government statistical agency as private sector organizations normally do not have access to the information required especially information on expenditure and production by governments main article national agencies responsible for gdp measurement nominal gdp and adjustments to gdpedit the raw gdp figure as given by the equations above is called the nominal historical or current gdp when one compares gdp figures from one year to another it is desirable to compensate for changes in the value of money – ie for the effects of inflation or deflation to make it more meaningful for yeartoyear comparisons it may be multiplied by the ratio between the value of money in the year the gdp was measured and the value of money in a base year for example suppose a countrys gdp in  was  million and its gdp in  was  million suppose also that inflation had halved the value of its currency over that period to meaningfully compare its gdp in  to its gdp in  we could multiply the gdp in  by onehalf to make it relative to  as a base year the result would be that the gdp in  equals  million × onehalf   million in  monetary terms we would see that the countrys gdp had realistically increased  percent over that period not  percent as it might appear from the raw gdp data the gdp adjusted for changes in money value in this way is called the real or constant gdp the factor used to convert gdp from current to constant values in this way is called the gdp deflator unlike consumer price index which measures inflation or deflation in the price of household consumer goods the gdp deflator measures changes in the prices of all domestically produced goods and services in an economy including investment goods and government services as well as household consumption goods constantgdp figures allow us to calculate a gdp growth rate which indicates how much a countrys production has increased or decreased if the growth rate is negative compared to the previous year real gdp growth rate for year n  real gdp in year n − real gdp in year n −   real gdp in year n −  another thing that it may be desirable to account for is population growth if a countrys gdp doubled over a certain period but its population tripled the increase in gdp may not mean that the standard of living increased for the countrys residents the average person in the country is producing less than they were before percapita gdp is a measure to account for population growth crossborder comparison and purchasing power parityedit the level of gdp in different countries may be compared by converting their value in national currency according to either the current currency exchange rate or the purchasing power parity exchange rate current currency exchange rate is the exchange rate in the international foreign exchange market purchasing power parity exchange rate is the exchange rate based on the purchasing power parity ppp of a currency relative to a selected standard usually the united states dollar this is a comparative and theoretical exchange rate the only way to directly realize this rate is to sell an entire cpi basket in one country convert the cash at the currency market rate  then rebuy that same basket of goods in the other country with the converted cash going from country to country the distribution of prices within the basket will vary typically nontradable purchases will consume a greater proportion of the baskets total cost in the higher gdp country per the balassasamuelson effect the ranking of countries may differ significantly based on which method is used the current exchange rate method converts the value of goods and services using global currency exchange rates the method can offer better indications of a countrys international purchasing power for instance if  of gdp is being spent on buying hitech foreign arms the number of weapons purchased is entirely governed by current exchange rates since arms are a traded product bought on the international market there is no meaningful local price distinct from the international price for high technology goods the ppp method of gdp conversion is more relevant to nontraded goods and services in the above example if hitech weapons are to be produced internally their amount will be governed by gdpppp rather than nominal gdp there is a clear pattern of the purchasing power parity method decreasing the disparity in gdp between high and low income gdp countries as compared to the current exchange rate method this finding is called the penn effect for more information see measures of national income and output standard of living and gdp wealth distribution and externalitiesedit gdp per capita is often used as an indicator of living standards the major advantage of gdp per capita as an indicator of standard of living is that it is measured frequently widely and consistently it is measured frequently in that most countries provide information on gdp on a quarterly basis allowing trends to be seen quickly it is measured widely in that some measure of gdp is available for almost every country in the world allowing intercountry comparisons it is measured consistently in that the technical definition of gdp is relatively consistent among countries gdp does not include several factors that influence the standard of living in particular it fails to account for externalities – economic growth may entail an increase in negative externalities that are not directly measured in gdp increased industrial output might grow gdp but any pollution is not counted nonmarket transactions– gdp excludes activities that are not provided through the market such as household production bartering of goods and services and volunteer or unpaid services nonmonetary economy– gdp omits economies where no money comes into play at all resulting in inaccurate or abnormally low gdp figures for example in countries with major business transactions occurring informally portions of local economy are not easily registered bartering may be more prominent than the use of money even extending to services quality improvements and inclusion of new products– by not fully adjusting for quality improvements and new products gdp understates true economic growth for instance although computers today are less expensive and more powerful than computers from the past gdp treats them as the same products by only accounting for the monetary value the introduction of new products is also difficult to measure accurately and is not reflected in gdp despite the fact that it may increase the standard of living for example even the richest person in  could not purchase standard products such as antibiotics and cell phones that an average consumer can buy today since such modern conveniences did not exist then sustainability of growth– gdp is a measurement of economic historic activity and is not necessarily a projection wealth distribution – gdp does not account for variances in incomes of various demographic groups see income inequality metrics for discussion of a variety of inequalitybased economic measures it can be argued that gdp per capita as an indicator standard of living is correlated with these factors capturing them indirectly as a result gdp per capita as a standard of living is a continued usage because most people have a fairly accurate idea of what it is and know it is tough to come up with quantitative measures for such constructs as happiness quality of life and wellbeing limitations and criticismsedit this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it february  limitations at introductionedit simon kuznets the economist who developed the first comprehensive set of measures of national income stated in his first report to the us congress in  in a section titled uses and abuses of national income measurements the valuable capacity of the human mind to simplify a complex situation in a compact characterization becomes dangerous when not controlled in terms of definitely stated criteria with quantitative measurements especially the definiteness of the result suggests often misleadingly a precision and simplicity in the outlines of the object measured measurements of national income are subject to this type of illusion and resulting abuse especially since they deal with matters that are the center of conflict of opposing social groups where the effectiveness of an argument is often contingent upon oversimplification  all these qualifications upon estimates of national income as an index of productivity are just as important when income measurements are interpreted from the point of view of economic welfare but in the latter case additional difficulties will be suggested to anyone who wants to penetrate below the surface of total figures and market values economic welfare cannot be adequately measured unless the personal distribution of income is known and no income measurement undertakes to estimate the reverse side of income that is the intensity and unpleasantness of effort going into the earning of income the welfare of a nation can therefore scarcely be inferred from a measurement of national income as defined above in  kuznets stated distinctions must be kept in mind between quantity and quality of growth between costs and returns and between the short and long run goals for more growth should specify more growth of what and for what further criticismsedit ever since the development of gdp multiple observers have pointed out limitations of using gdp as the overarching measure of economic and social progress many environmentalists argue that gdp is a poor measure of social progress because it does not take into account harm to the environment although a high or rising level of gdp is often associated with increased economic and social progress within a country a number of scholars have pointed out that this does not necessarily play out in many instances for example jean drèze and amartya sen have pointed out that an increase in gdp or in gdp growth does not necessarily lead to a higher standard of living particularly in areas such as healthcare and education another important area that does not necessarily improve along with gdp is political liberty which is most notable in china where gdp growth is strong yet political liberties are heavily restricted gdp does not account for the distribution of income among the residents of a country because gdp is merely an aggregate measure an economy may be highly developed or growing rapidly but also contain a wide gap between the rich and the poor in a society these inequalities often occur on the lines of race ethnicity gender religion or other minority status within countries this can lead to misleading characterizations of economic wellbeing if the income distribution is heavily skewed toward the high end as the poorer residents will not directly benefit from the overall level of wealth and income generated in their country even gdp per capita measures may have the same downside if inequality is high for example south africa during apartheid ranked high in terms of gdp per capita but the benefits of this immense wealth and income were not shared equally among the countrycitation needed gdp does not take into account the value of household and other unpaid work some including martha nussbaum argue that this value should be included in measuring gdp as household labor is largely a substitute for goods and services that would otherwise be purchased for value even under conservative estimates the value of unpaid labor in australia has been calculated to be over  of the countrys gdp a later study analyzed this value in other countries with results ranging from a low of about  in canada using conservative estimates to high of nearly  in the united kingdom using more liberal estimates for the united states the value was estimated to be between about  on the low end to nearly  on the high end depending on the methodology being used because many public policies are shaped by gdp calculations and by the related field of national accounts the noninclusion of unpaid work in calculating gdp can create distortions in public policy and some economists have advocated for changes in the way public policies are formed and implemented the uks natural capital committee highlighted the shortcomings of gdp in its advice to the uk government in  pointing out that gdp focuses on flows not stocks as a result an economy can run down its assets yet at the same time record high levels of gdp growth until a point is reached where the depleted assets act as a check on future growth they then went on to say that it is apparent that the recorded gdp growth rate overstates the sustainable growth rate broader measures of wellbeing and wealth are needed for this and there is a danger that shortterm decisions based solely on what is currently measured by national accounts may prove to be costly in the longterm proposals to overcome gdp limitationsedit in response to these and other limitations of using gdp alternative approaches have emerged in the s amartya sen and martha nussbaum developed the capability approach which focuses on the functional capabilities enjoyed by people within a country rather than the aggregate wealth held within a country these capabilities consist of the functions that a person is able to achieve in  mahbub ul haq a pakistani economist at the united nations introduced the human development index hdi the hdi is a composite index of life expectancy at birth adult literacy rate and standard of

institute of management introduced the first secular gross national happiness index aka gross national wellbeing framework and index to complement gdp economics with additional seven dimensions including environment education and government work social and health mental and physical indicators the proposal was inspired by the king of bhutans gnh philosophy in  the european union released a communication titled gdp and beyond measuring progress in a changing world that identified five actions to improve the indicators of progress in ways that make it more responsive to the concerns of its citizens introduced a proposal to complementing gdp with environmental and social indicators in  professors joseph stiglitz amartya sen and jeanpaul fitoussi at the commission on the measurement of economic performance and social progress cmepsp formed by french president nicolas sarkozy published a proposal to overcome the limitation of gdp economics to expand the focus to wellbeing

added of all resident and institutional units engaged in production plus any taxes and minus any subsidies on products not included in the value of their outputs” an imf publication states that gdp measures the monetary value of final goods and services  that is those that are bought by the final user  produced in a country in a given period of time say a quarter or a year total gdp can also be broken down into the contribution of each industry or sector of the economy the ratio of gdp to the total population of the region is the per capita gdp and the same is called mean standard of living historyedit william petty came up with a basic concept of gdp to defend landlords against unfair taxation during warfare between the dutch and the english between  and  charles davenant developed the method further in  the modern concept of gdp was first developed by simon kuznets for a us congress report in  in this report kuznets warned against its use as a measure of welfare see below under limitations and criticisms after the bretton woods conference in  gdp became the main tool for measuring a countrys economy at that time gross national product gnp was the preferred estimate which differed from gdp in that it measured production by a countrys citizens at home and abroad rather than its resident institutional units see oecd definition above the switch from gnp to gdp in the us was in  trailing behind most other nations the history of the concept of gdp should be distinguished from the history of changes in ways of estimating it the value added by firms is relatively easy to calculate from their accounts but the value added by the public sector by financial industries and by intangible asset creation is more complex these activities are increasingly important in developed economies and the international conventions governing their estimation and their inclusion or exclusion in gdp regularly change in an attempt to keep up with industrial advances in the words of one academic economist the actual number for gdp is therefore the product of a vast patchwork of statistics and a complicated set of processes carried out on the raw data to fit them to the conceptual

monetary  financial natural resource organizational personnel public  welfare economics regional rural service urban welfare lists economists publications journals business and economics portal v t e gdp can be determined in three ways all of which should in principle give the same result they are the production or output or value added approach the income approach or the expenditure approach the most direct of the three is the production approach which sums the outputs of every class of enterprise to arrive at the total the expenditure approach works on the principle that all of the product must be bought by somebody therefore the value of the total product must be equal to peoples total expenditures in buying things the income approach works on the principle that the incomes of the productive factors producers colloquially must be equal to the value of their product and determines gdp by finding the sum of all producers incomes production approachedit this approach mirrors the oecd definition given above estimate the gross value of domestic output out of the many various economic activities determine the intermediate consumption ie the cost of material supplies and services used to produce final goods or services deduct intermediate consumption from gross value to obtain the gross value added gross value added  gross value of output – value of intermediate consumption value of output  value of the total sales of goods and services plus value of changes in the inventory the sum of the gross value added in the various economic activities is known as gdp at factor cost gdp at factor cost plus indirect taxes less subsidies on products  gdp at producer price for measuring output of domestic product economic activities ie industries are classified into various sectors after classifying economic activities the output of each sector is calculated by any of the following two methods by multiplying the output of each sector by their respective market price and adding them together by collecting data on gross sales and inventories from the records of companies and adding them together the gross value of all sectors is then added to get the gross value added gva at factor cost subtracting each sectors intermediate consumption from gross output gives the gdp at factor cost adding indirect tax minus subsidies in gdp at factor cost gives the gdp at producer prices income approachedit list of countries by gdp ppp per capita by  international monetary fund countries by  gdp nominal per capita        –     –     –     –     –     –     –        unavailable us gdp computed on the income basis the second way of estimating gdp is to use the sum of primary incomes distributed by resident producer units if gdp is calculated this way it is sometimes called gross domestic income gdi or gdp i gdi should provide the same amount as the expenditure method described later by definition gdi  gdp in practice however measurement errors will make the two figures slightly off when reported by national statistical agencies this method measures gdp by adding incomes that firms pay households for factors of production they hire  wages for labour interest for capital rent for land and profits for entrepreneurship the us national income and expenditure accounts divide incomes into five categories wages salaries and supplementary labour income corporate profits interest and miscellaneous investment income farmers incomes income from nonfarm unincorporated businesses these five income components sum to net domestic income at factor cost two adjustments must be made to get gdp indirect taxes minus subsidies are added to get from factor cost to market prices depreciation or capital consumption allowance is added to get from net domestic product to gross domestic product total income can be subdivided according to various schemes leading to various formulae for gdp measured by the income approach a common one is gdp  compensation of employees  gross operating surplus  gross mixed income  taxes less subsidies on production and imports gdp  coe  gos  gmi  tp  m – sp  m compensation of employees coe measures the total remuneration to employees for work done it includes wages and salaries as well as employer contributions to social security and other such programs gross operating surplus gos is the surplus due to owners of incorporated businesses often called profits although only a subset of total costs are subtracted from gross output to calculate gos gross mixed income gmi is the same measure as gos but for unincorporated businesses this often includes most small businesses the sum of coe gos and gmi is called total factor income it is the income of all of the factors of production in society it measures the value of gdp at factor basic prices the difference between basic prices and final prices those used in the expenditure calculation is the total taxes and subsidies that the government has levied or paid on that production so adding taxes less subsidies on production and imports converts gdp at factor cost to gdpi total factor income is also sometimes expressed as total factor income  employee compensation  corporate profits  proprietors income  rental income  net interest expenditure approachedit the third way to estimate gdp is to calculate the sum of the final uses of goods and services all uses except intermediate consumption measured in purchasers prices market goods which are produced are purchased by someone in the case where a good is produced and unsold the standard accounting convention is that the producer has bought the good from themselves therefore measuring the total expenditure used to buy things is a way of measuring production this is known as the expenditure method of calculating gdp components of gdp by expenditureedit us gdp computed on the expenditure basis gdp y is the sum of consumption c investment i government spending g and net exports x – m y  c  i  g  x − m here is a description of each gdp component c consumption is normally the largest gdp component in the economy consisting of private expenditures in the economy household final consumption expenditure these personal expenditures fall under one of the following categories durable goods nondurable goods and services examples include food rent jewelry gasoline and medical expenses but not the purchase of new housing i investment includes for instance business investment in equipment but does not include exchanges of existing assets examples include construction of a new mine purchase of software or purchase of machinery and equipment for a factory spending by households not government on new houses is also included in investment in contrast to its colloquial meaning investment in gdp does not mean purchases of financial products buying financial products is classed as saving as opposed to investment this avoids doublecounting if one buys shares in a company and the company uses the money received to buy plant equipment etc the amount will be counted toward gdp when the company spends the money on those things to also count it when one gives it to the company would be to count two times an amount that only corresponds to one group of products buying bonds or stocks is a swapping of deeds a transfer of claims on future production not directly an expenditure on products g government spending is the sum of government expenditures on final goods and services it includes salaries of public servants purchases of weapons for the military and any investment expenditure by a government it does not include any transfer payments such as social security or unemployment benefits x exports represents gross exports gdp captures the amount a country produces including goods and services produced for other nations consumption therefore exports are added m imports represents gross imports imports are subtracted since imported goods will be included in the terms g i or c and must be deducted to avoid counting foreign supply as domestic note that c g and i are expenditures on final goods and services expenditures on intermediate goods and services do not count intermediate goods and services are those used by businesses to produce other goods and services within the accounting year according to the us bureau of economic analysis which is responsible for calculating the national accounts in the united states in general the source data for the expenditures components are considered more reliable than those for the income components see income method below gdp vs gniedit gdp can be contrasted with gross national product gnp or as it is now known gross national income gni the difference is that gdp defines its scope according to location while gni defines its scope according to ownership in a global context world gdp and world gni are therefore equivalent terms gdp is product produced within a countrys borders gni is product produced by enterprises owned by a countrys citizens the two would be the same if all of the productive enterprises in a country were owned by its own citizens and those citizens did not own productive enterprises in any other countries in practice however foreign ownership makes gdp and gni nonidentical production within a countrys borders but by an enterprise owned by somebody outside the country counts as part of its gdp but not its gni on the other hand production by an enterprise located outside the country but owned by one of its citizens counts as part of its gni but not its gdp for example the gni of the usa is the value of output produced by americanowned firms regardless of where the firms are located similarly if a country becomes increasingly in debt and spends large amounts of income servicing this debt this will be reflected in a decreased gni but not a decreased gdp similarly if a country sells off its resources to entities outside their country this will also be reflected over time in decreased gni but not decreased gdp this would make the use of gdp more attractive for politicians in countries with increasing national debt and decreasing assets gross national income gni equals gdp plus income receipts from the rest of the world minus income payments to the rest of the world in  the united states switched from using gnp to using gdp as its primary measure of production the relationship between united states gdp and gnp is shown in table  of the national income and product accounts international standardsedit the international standard for measuring gdp is contained in the book system of national accounts  which was prepared by representatives of the international monetary fund european union organization for economic cooperation and development united nations and world bank the publication is normally referred to as sna to distinguish it from the previous edition published in  called sna  sna provides a set of rules and procedures for the measurement of national accounts the standards are designed to be flexible to allow for differences in local statistical needs and conditions this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it august  national measurementedit within each country gdp is normally measured by a national government statistical agency as private sector organizations normally do not have access to the information required especially information on expenditure and production by governments main article national agencies responsible for gdp measurement nominal gdp and adjustments to gdpedit the raw gdp figure as given by the equations above is called the nominal historical or current gdp when one compares gdp figures from one year to another it is desirable to compensate for changes in the value of money – ie for the effects of inflation or deflation to make it more meaningful for yeartoyear comparisons it may be multiplied by the ratio between the value of money in the year the gdp was measured and the value of money in a base year for example suppose a countrys gdp in  was  million and its gdp in  was  million suppose also that inflation had halved the value of its currency over that period to meaningfully compare its gdp in  to its gdp in  we could multiply the gdp in  by onehalf to make it relative to  as a base year the result would be that the gdp in  equals  million × onehalf   million in  monetary terms we would see that the countrys gdp had realistically increased  percent over that period not  percent as it might appear from the raw gdp data the gdp adjusted for changes in money value in this way is called the real or constant gdp the factor used to convert gdp from current to constant values in this way is called the gdp deflator unlike consumer price index which measures inflation or deflation in the price of household consumer goods the gdp deflator measures changes in the prices of all domestically produced goods and services in an economy including investment goods and government services as well as household consumption goods constantgdp figures allow us to calculate a gdp growth rate which indicates how much a countrys production has increased or decreased if the growth rate is negative compared to the previous year real gdp growth rate for year n  real gdp in year n − real gdp in year n −   real gdp in year n −  another thing that it may be desirable to account for is population growth if a countrys gdp doubled over a certain period but its population tripled the increase in gdp may not mean that the standard of living increased for the countrys residents the average person in the country is producing less than they were before percapita gdp is a measure to account for population growth crossborder comparison and purchasing power parityedit the level of gdp in different countries may be compared by converting their value in national currency according to either the current currency exchange rate or the purchasing power parity exchange rate current currency exchange rate is the exchange rate in the international foreign exchange market purchasing power parity exchange rate is the exchange rate based on the purchasing power parity ppp of a currency relative to a selected standard usually the united states dollar this is a comparative and theoretical exchange rate the only way to directly realize this rate is to sell an entire cpi basket in one country convert the cash at the currency market rate  then rebuy that same basket of goods in the other country with the converted cash going from country to country the distribution of prices within the basket will vary typically nontradable purchases will consume a greater proportion of the baskets total cost in the higher gdp country per the balassasamuelson effect the ranking of countries may differ significantly based on which method is used the current exchange rate method converts the value of goods and services using global currency exchange rates the method can offer better indications of a countrys international purchasing power for instance if  of gdp is being spent on buying hitech foreign arms the number of weapons purchased is entirely governed by current exchange rates since arms are a traded product bought on the international market there is no meaningful local price distinct from the international price for high technology goods the ppp method of gdp conversion is more relevant to nontraded goods and services in the above example if hitech weapons are to be produced internally their amount will be governed by gdpppp rather than nominal gdp there is a clear pattern of the purchasing power parity method decreasing the disparity in gdp between high and low income gdp countries as compared to the current exchange rate method this finding is called the penn effect for more information see measures of national income and output standard of living and gdp wealth distribution and externalitiesedit gdp per capita is often used as an indicator of living standards the major advantage of gdp per capita as an indicator of standard of living is that it is measured frequently widely and consistently it is measured frequently in that most countries provide information on gdp on a quarterly basis allowing trends to be seen quickly it is measured widely in that some measure of gdp is available for almost every country in the world allowing intercountry comparisons it is measured consistently in that the technical definition of gdp is relatively consistent among countries gdp does not include several factors that influence the standard of living in particular it fails to account for externalities – economic growth may entail an increase in negative externalities that are not directly measured in gdp increased industrial output might grow gdp but any pollution is not counted nonmarket transactions– gdp excludes activities that are not provided through the market such as household production bartering of goods and services and volunteer or unpaid services nonmonetary economy– gdp omits economies where no money comes into play at all resulting in inaccurate or abnormally low gdp figures for example in countries with major business transactions occurring informally portions of local economy are not easily registered bartering may be more prominent than the use of money even extending to services quality improvements and inclusion of new products– by not fully adjusting for quality improvements and new products gdp understates true economic growth for instance although computers today are less expensive and more powerful than computers from the past gdp treats them as the same products by only accounting for the monetary value the introduction of new products is also difficult to measure accurately and is not reflected in gdp despite the fact that it may increase the standard of living for example even the richest person in  could not purchase standard products such as antibiotics and cell phones that an average consumer can buy today since such modern conveniences did not exist then sustainability of growth– gdp is a measurement of economic historic activity and is not necessarily a projection wealth distribution – gdp does not account for variances in incomes of various demographic groups see income inequality metrics for discussion of a variety of inequalitybased economic measures it can be argued that gdp per capita as an indicator standard of living is correlated with these factors capturing them indirectly as a result gdp per capita as a standard of living is a continued usage because most people have a fairly accurate idea of what it is and know it is tough to come up with quantitative measures for such constructs as happiness quality of life and wellbeing limitations and criticismsedit this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it february  limitations at introductionedit simon kuznets the economist who developed the first comprehensive set of measures of national income stated in his first report to the us congress in  in a section titled uses and abuses of national income measurements the valuable capacity of the human mind to simplify a complex situation in a compact characterization becomes dangerous when not controlled in terms of definitely stated criteria with quantitative measurements especially the definiteness of the result suggests often misleadingly a precision and simplicity in the outlines of the object measured measurements of national income are subject to this type of illusion and resulting abuse especially since they deal with matters that are the center of conflict of opposing social groups where the effectiveness of an argument is often contingent upon oversimplification  all these qualifications upon estimates of national income as an index of productivity are just as important when income measurements are interpreted from the point of view of economic welfare but in the latter case additional difficulties will be suggested to anyone who wants to penetrate below the surface of total figures and market values economic welfare cannot be adequately measured unless the personal distribution of income is known and no income measurement undertakes to estimate the reverse side of income that is the intensity and unpleasantness of effort going into the earning of income the welfare of a nation can therefore scarcely be inferred from a measurement of national income as defined above in  kuznets stated distinctions must be kept in mind between quantity and quality of growth between costs and returns and between the short and long run goals for more growth should specify more growth of what and for what further criticismsedit ever since the development of gdp multiple observers have pointed out limitations of using gdp as the overarching measure of economic and social progress many environmentalists argue that gdp is a poor measure of social progress because it does not take into account harm to the environment although a high or rising level of gdp is often associated with increased economic and social progress within a country a number of scholars have pointed out that this does not necessarily play out in many instances for example jean drèze and amartya sen have pointed out that an increase in gdp or in gdp growth does not necessarily lead to a higher standard of living particularly in areas such as healthcare and education another important area that does not necessarily improve along with gdp is political liberty which is most notable in china where gdp growth is strong yet political liberties are heavily restricted gdp does not account for the distribution of income among the residents of a country because gdp is merely an aggregate measure an economy may be highly developed or growing rapidly but also contain a wide gap between the rich and the poor in a society these inequalities often occur on the lines of race ethnicity gender religion or other minority status within countries this can lead to misleading characterizations of economic wellbeing if the income distribution is heavily skewed toward the high end as the poorer residents will not directly benefit from the overall level of wealth and income generated in their country even gdp per capita measures may have the same downside if inequality is high for example south africa during apartheid ranked high in terms of gdp per capita but the benefits of this immense wealth and income were not shared equally among the countrycitation needed gdp does not take into account the value of household and other unpaid work some including martha nussbaum argue that this value should be included in measuring gdp as household labor is largely a substitute for goods and services that would otherwise be purchased for value even under conservative estimates the value of unpaid labor in australia has been calculated to be over  of the countrys gdp a later study analyzed this value in other countries with results ranging from a low of about  in canada using conservative estimates to high of nearly  in the united kingdom using more liberal estimates for the united states the value was estimated to be between about  on the low end to nearly  on the high end depending on the methodology being used because many public policies are shaped by gdp calculations and by the related field of national accounts the noninclusion of unpaid work in calculating gdp can create distortions in public policy and some economists have advocated for changes in the way public policies are formed and implemented the uks natural capital committee highlighted the shortcomings of gdp in its advice to the uk government in  pointing out that gdp focuses on flows not stocks as a result an economy can run down its assets yet at the same time record high levels of gdp growth until a point is reached where the depleted assets act as a check on future growth they then went on to say that it is apparent that the recorded gdp growth rate overstates the sustainable growth rate broader measures of wellbeing and wealth are needed for this and there is a danger that shortterm decisions based solely on what is currently measured by national accounts may prove to be costly in the longterm proposals to overcome gdp limitationsedit in response to these and other limitations of using gdp alternative approaches have emerged in the s amartya sen and martha nussbaum developed the capability approach which focuses on the functional capabilities enjoyed by people within a country rather than the aggregate wealth held within a country these capabilities consist of the functions that a person is able to achieve in  mahbub ul haq a pakistani economist at the united nations introduced the human development index hdi the hdi is a composite index of life expectancy at birth adult literacy rate and standard of living measured as a logarithmic function of gdp adjusted to purchasing power parity in  john b cobb and herman daly introduced index of sustainable economic welfare isew by taking into account various other factors such as consumption of nonrenewable resources and degradation of the environment the new formula deducted from gdp personal consumption  public nondefensive expenditures  private defensive expenditures  capital formation  services from domestic labour  costs of environmental degradation  depreciation of natural capital in  med jones an american economist at the international institute of management introduced the first secular gross national happiness index aka gross national wellbeing framework and index to complement gdp economics with additional seven dimensions including environment education and government work social and health mental and physical indicators the proposal was inspired by the king of bhutans gnh philosophy in  the european union released a communication titled gdp and beyond measuring progress in a changing world that identified five actions to improve the indicators of progress in ways that make it more responsive to the concerns of its citizens introduced a proposal to complementing gdp with environmental and social indicators in  professors joseph stiglitz amartya sen and jeanpaul fitoussi at the commission on the measurement of economic performance and social progress cmepsp formed by french president nicolas sarkozy published a proposal to overcome the limitation of gdp economics to expand the focus to wellbeing economics with wellbeing framework consisting of health environment work physical safety economic safety political freedom in  the karma ura of the center for bhutan studies published bhutan local gnh index contributors to happiness—physical mental and spiritual health timebalance social and community vitality cultural vitality education living standards good governance and ecological vitality the bhutan gnh index in  oecd better life index was published by the oecd the dimensions of the index included health economic workplace income jobs housing civic engagement life satisfaction in  professors john helliwell

in usd world bank  selection of gdp ppp data top  countries and blocks  in no particular order gross domestic product gdp is a monetary measure of the market value of all final goods and services produced in a period quarterly or yearly nominal gdp estimates are commonly used to determine the economic performance of a whole country or region and to make international comparisons nominal gdp per capita does not however reflect differences in the cost of living and the inflation rates of the countries therefore using a basis of gdp per capita at purchasing power parity ppp is arguably more useful when comparing differences in living standards between nations contents  definition  history  determining gross domestic product gdp  production approach  income approach  expenditure approach

and gdp wealth distribution and externalities  limitations and criticisms  limitations at introduction  further criticisms  proposals to overcome gdp limitations  lists of countries by their gdp  see also  notes and references  further reading  external links  global  data  articles and books definitionedit the oecd defines gdp as an aggregate measure of production equal to the sum of the gross values added of all resident and institutional units engaged in production plus any taxes and minus any subsidies on products not included in the value of their outputs” an imf publication states that gdp measures the monetary value of final goods and services  that is those that are bought by the final user  produced in a country in a given period of time say a quarter or a year total gdp can also be broken down into the contribution of each industry or sector of the economy the ratio of gdp to the total population of the region is the per capita gdp and the same is called mean standard of living historyedit william petty came up with a basic concept of gdp to defend landlords against unfair taxation during warfare between the dutch and the english between  and  charles davenant developed the method further in  the modern concept of gdp was first developed by simon kuznets for a us congress report in  in this report kuznets warned against its use as a measure of welfare see below under limitations and criticisms after the bretton woods conference in  gdp became the main tool for measuring a countrys economy at that time gross national product gnp was the preferred estimate which differed from gdp in that it measured production by a countrys citizens at home and abroad rather than its resident institutional units see oecd definition above the switch from gnp to gdp in the us was in  trailing behind most other nations the history of the concept of gdp should be distinguished from the history of changes in ways of estimating it the value added by firms is relatively easy to calculate from their accounts but the value added by the public sector by financial industries and by intangible asset creation is more complex these activities are increasingly important in developed economies and the international conventions governing their estimation and their inclusion or exclusion in gdp regularly change in an attempt to keep up with industrial advances in the words of one academic economist the actual number for gdp is therefore the product of a vast patchwork of statistics and a complicated set of processes carried out on the raw data to fit them to the conceptual framework determining gross domestic product gdpedit economics a supply and demand diagram illustrating the effects of an increase in demand index outline category history types

knowledge labour law managerial monetary  financial natural resource organizational personnel public  welfare economics regional rural service urban welfare lists economists publications journals business and economics portal v t e gdp can be determined in three ways all of which should in principle give the same result they are the production or output or value added approach the income approach or the expenditure approach the most direct of the three is the production approach which sums the outputs of every class of enterprise to arrive at the total the expenditure approach works on the principle that all of the product must be bought by somebody therefore the value of the total product must be equal to peoples total expenditures in buying things the income approach works on the principle that the incomes of the productive factors producers colloquially must be equal to the value of their product and determines gdp by finding the sum of all producers incomes production approachedit this approach mirrors the oecd definition given above estimate the gross value of domestic output out of the many various economic activities determine the intermediate consumption ie the cost of material supplies and services used to produce final goods or services deduct intermediate consumption from gross value to obtain the gross value added gross value added  gross value of output – value of intermediate consumption value of output  value of the total sales of goods and services plus value of changes in the inventory the sum of the gross value added in the various economic activities is known as gdp at factor cost gdp at factor cost plus indirect taxes less subsidies on products  gdp at producer price for measuring output of domestic product economic activities ie industries are classified into various sectors after classifying economic activities the output of each sector is calculated by any of the following two methods by multiplying the output of each sector by their respective market price and adding them together by collecting data on gross sales and inventories from the records of companies and adding them together the gross value of all sectors is then added to get the gross value added gva at factor cost subtracting each sectors intermediate consumption from gross output gives the gdp at factor cost adding indirect tax minus subsidies in gdp at factor cost gives the gdp at producer prices income approachedit list of countries by gdp ppp per capita by  international monetary fund countries by  gdp nominal per capita        –     –     –     –     –     –     –        unavailable us gdp computed on the income basis the second way of estimating gdp is to use the sum of primary incomes distributed by resident producer units if gdp is calculated this way it is sometimes called gross domestic income gdi or gdp i gdi should provide the same amount as the expenditure method described later by definition gdi  gdp in practice however measurement errors will make the two figures slightly off when reported by national statistical agencies this method measures gdp by adding incomes that firms pay households for factors of production they hire  wages for labour interest for capital rent for land and profits for entrepreneurship the us national income and expenditure accounts divide incomes into five categories wages salaries and supplementary labour income corporate profits interest and miscellaneous investment income farmers incomes income from nonfarm unincorporated businesses these five income components sum to net domestic income at factor cost two adjustments must be made to get gdp indirect taxes minus subsidies are added to get from factor cost to market prices depreciation or capital consumption allowance is added to get from net domestic product to gross domestic product total income can be subdivided according to various schemes leading to various formulae for gdp measured by the income approach a common one is gdp  compensation of employees  gross operating surplus  gross mixed income  taxes less subsidies on production and imports gdp  coe  gos  gmi  tp  m – sp  m compensation of employees coe measures the total remuneration to employees for work done it includes wages and salaries as well as employer contributions to social security and other such programs gross operating surplus gos is the surplus due to owners of incorporated businesses often called profits although only a subset of total costs are subtracted from gross output to calculate gos gross mixed income gmi is the same measure as gos but for unincorporated businesses this often includes most small businesses the sum of coe gos and gmi is called total factor income it is the income of all of the factors of production in society it measures the value of gdp at factor basic prices the difference between basic prices and final prices those used in the expenditure calculation is the total taxes and subsidies that the government has levied or paid on that production so adding taxes less subsidies on production and imports converts gdp at factor cost to gdpi total factor income is also sometimes expressed as total factor income  employee compensation  corporate profits  proprietors income  rental income  net interest expenditure approachedit the third way to estimate gdp is to calculate the sum of the final uses of goods and services all uses except intermediate consumption measured in purchasers prices market goods which are produced are purchased by someone in the case where a good is produced and unsold the standard accounting convention is that the producer has bought the good from themselves therefore measuring the total expenditure used to buy things is a way of measuring production this is known as the expenditure method of calculating gdp components of gdp by expenditureedit us gdp computed on the expenditure basis gdp y is the sum of consumption c investment i government spending g and net exports x – m y  c  i  g  x − m here is a description of each gdp component c consumption is normally the largest gdp component in the economy consisting of private expenditures in the economy household final consumption expenditure these personal expenditures fall under one of the following categories durable goods nondurable goods and services examples include food rent jewelry gasoline and medical expenses but not the purchase of new housing i investment includes for instance business investment in equipment but does not include exchanges of existing assets examples include construction of a new mine purchase of software or purchase of machinery and equipment for a factory spending by households not government on new houses is also included in investment in contrast to its colloquial meaning investment in gdp does not mean purchases of financial products buying financial products is classed as saving as opposed to investment this avoids doublecounting if one buys shares in a company and the company uses the money received to buy plant equipment etc the amount will be counted toward gdp when the company spends the money on those things to also count it when one gives it to the company would be to count two times an amount that only corresponds to one group of products buying bonds or stocks is a swapping of deeds a transfer of claims on future production not directly an expenditure on products g government spending is the sum of government expenditures on final goods and services it includes salaries of public servants purchases of weapons for the military and any investment expenditure by a government it does not include any transfer payments such as social security or unemployment benefits x exports represents gross exports gdp captures the amount a country produces including goods and services produced for other nations consumption therefore exports are added m imports represents gross imports imports are subtracted since imported goods will be included in the terms g i or c and must be deducted to avoid counting foreign supply as domestic note that c g and i are expenditures on final goods and services expenditures on intermediate goods and services do not count intermediate goods and services are those used by businesses to produce other goods and services within the accounting year according to the us bureau of economic analysis which is responsible for calculating the national accounts in the united states in general the source data for the expenditures components are considered more reliable than those for the income components see income method below gdp vs gniedit gdp can be contrasted with gross national product gnp or as it is now known gross national income gni the difference is that gdp defines its scope according to location while gni defines its scope according to ownership in a global context world gdp and world gni are therefore equivalent terms gdp is product produced within a countrys borders gni is product produced by enterprises owned by a countrys citizens the two would be the same if all of the productive enterprises in a country were owned by its own citizens and those citizens did not own productive enterprises in any other countries in practice however foreign ownership makes gdp and gni nonidentical production within a countrys borders but by an enterprise owned by somebody outside the country counts as part of its gdp but not its gni on the other hand production by an enterprise located outside the country but owned by one of its citizens counts as part of its gni but not its gdp for example the gni of the usa is the value of output produced by americanowned firms regardless of where the firms are located similarly if a country becomes increasingly in debt and spends large amounts of income servicing this debt this will be reflected in a decreased gni but not a decreased gdp similarly if a country sells off its resources to entities outside their country this will also be reflected over time in decreased gni but not decreased gdp this would make the use of gdp more attractive for politicians in countries with increasing national debt and decreasing assets gross national income gni equals gdp plus income receipts from the rest of the world minus income payments to the rest of the world in  the united states switched from using gnp to using gdp as its primary measure of production the relationship between united states gdp and gnp is shown in table  of the national income and product accounts international standardsedit the international standard for measuring gdp is contained in the book system of national accounts  which was prepared by representatives of the international monetary fund european union organization for economic cooperation and development united nations and world bank the publication is normally referred to as sna to distinguish it from the previous edition published in  called sna  sna provides a set of rules and procedures for the measurement of national accounts the standards are designed to be flexible to allow for differences in local statistical needs and conditions this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it august  national measurementedit within each country gdp is normally measured by a national government statistical agency as private sector organizations normally do not have access to the information required especially information on expenditure and production by governments main article national agencies responsible for gdp measurement nominal gdp and adjustments to gdpedit the raw gdp figure as given by the equations above is called the nominal historical or current gdp when one compares gdp figures from one year to another it is desirable to compensate for changes in the value of money – ie for the effects of inflation or deflation to make it more meaningful for yeartoyear comparisons it may be multiplied by the ratio between the value of money in the year the gdp was measured and the value of money in a base year for example suppose a countrys gdp in  was  million and its gdp in  was  million suppose also that inflation had halved the value of its currency over that period to meaningfully compare its gdp in  to its gdp in  we could multiply the gdp in  by onehalf to make it relative to  as a base year the result would be that the gdp in  equals  million × onehalf   million in  monetary terms we would see that the countrys gdp had realistically increased  percent over that period not  percent as it might appear from the raw gdp data the gdp adjusted for changes in money value in this way is called the real or constant gdp the factor used to convert gdp from current to constant values in this way is called the gdp deflator unlike consumer price index which measures inflation or deflation in the price of household consumer goods the gdp deflator measures changes in the prices of all domestically produced goods and services in an economy including investment goods and government services as well as household consumption goods constantgdp figures allow us to calculate a gdp growth rate which indicates how much a countrys production has increased or decreased if the growth rate is negative compared to the previous year real gdp growth rate for year n  real gdp in year n − real gdp in year n −   real gdp in year n −  another thing that it may be desirable to account for is population growth if a countrys gdp doubled over a certain period but its population tripled the increase in gdp may not mean that the standard of living increased for the countrys residents the average person in the country is producing less than they were before percapita gdp is a measure to account for population growth crossborder comparison and purchasing power parityedit the level of gdp in different countries may be compared by converting their value in national currency according to either the current currency exchange rate or the purchasing power parity exchange rate current currency exchange rate is the exchange rate in the international foreign exchange market purchasing power parity exchange rate is the exchange rate based on the purchasing power parity ppp of a currency relative to a selected standard usually the united states dollar this is a comparative and theoretical exchange rate the only way to directly realize this rate is to sell an entire cpi basket in one country convert the cash at the currency market rate  then rebuy that same basket of goods in the other country with the converted cash going from country to country the distribution of prices within the basket will vary typically nontradable purchases will consume a greater proportion of the baskets total cost in the higher gdp country per the balassasamuelson effect the ranking of countries may differ significantly based on which method is used the current exchange rate method converts the value of goods and services using global currency exchange rates the method can offer better indications of a countrys international purchasing power for instance if  of gdp is being spent on buying hitech foreign arms the number of weapons purchased is entirely governed by current exchange rates since arms are a traded product bought on the international market there is no meaningful local price distinct from the international price for high technology goods the ppp method of gdp conversion is more relevant to nontraded goods and services in the above example if hitech weapons are to be produced internally their amount will be governed by gdpppp rather than nominal gdp there is a clear pattern of the purchasing power parity method decreasing the disparity in gdp between high and low income gdp countries as compared to the current exchange rate method this finding is called the penn effect for more information see measures of national income and output standard of living and gdp wealth distribution and externalitiesedit gdp per capita is often used as an indicator of living standards the major advantage of gdp per capita as an indicator of standard of living is that it is measured frequently widely and consistently it is measured frequently in that most countries provide information on gdp on a quarterly basis allowing trends to be seen quickly it is measured widely in that some measure of gdp is available for almost every country in the world allowing intercountry comparisons it is measured consistently in that the technical definition of gdp is relatively consistent among countries gdp does not include several factors that influence the standard of living in particular it fails to account for externalities – economic growth may entail an increase in negative externalities that are not directly measured in gdp increased industrial output might grow gdp but any pollution is not counted nonmarket transactions– gdp excludes activities that are not provided through the market such as household production bartering of goods and services and volunteer or unpaid services nonmonetary economy– gdp omits economies where no money comes into play at all resulting in inaccurate or abnormally low gdp figures for example in countries with major business transactions occurring informally portions of local economy are not easily registered bartering may be more prominent than the use of money even extending to services quality improvements and inclusion of new products– by not fully adjusting for quality improvements and new products gdp understates true economic growth for instance although computers today are less expensive and more powerful than computers from the past gdp treats them as the same products by only accounting for the monetary value the introduction of new products is also difficult to measure accurately and is not reflected in gdp despite the fact that it may increase the standard of living for example even the richest person in  could not purchase standard products such as antibiotics and cell phones that an average consumer can buy today since such modern conveniences did not exist then sustainability of growth– gdp is a measurement of economic historic activity and is not necessarily a projection wealth distribution – gdp does not account for variances in incomes of various demographic groups see income inequality metrics for discussion of a variety of inequalitybased economic measures it can be argued that gdp per capita as an indicator standard of living is correlated with these factors capturing them indirectly as a result gdp per capita as a standard of living is a continued usage because most people have a fairly accurate idea of what it is and know it is tough to come up with quantitative measures for such constructs as happiness quality of life and wellbeing limitations and criticismsedit this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it february  limitations at introductionedit simon kuznets the economist who developed the first comprehensive set of measures of national income stated in his first report to the us congress in  in a section titled uses and abuses of national income measurements the valuable capacity of the human mind to simplify a complex situation in a compact characterization becomes dangerous when not controlled in terms of definitely stated criteria with quantitative measurements especially the definiteness of the result suggests often misleadingly a precision and simplicity in the outlines of the object measured measurements of national income are subject to this type of illusion and resulting abuse especially since they deal with matters that are the center of conflict of opposing social groups where the effectiveness of an argument is often contingent upon oversimplification  all these qualifications upon estimates of national income as an index of productivity are just as important when income measurements are interpreted from the point of view of economic welfare but in the latter case additional difficulties will be suggested to anyone who wants to penetrate below the surface of total figures and market values economic welfare cannot be adequately measured unless the personal distribution of income is known and no income measurement undertakes to estimate the reverse side of income that is the intensity and unpleasantness of effort going into the earning of income the welfare of a nation can therefore scarcely be inferred from a measurement of national income as defined above in  kuznets stated distinctions must be kept in mind between quantity and quality of growth between costs and returns and between the short and long run goals for more growth should specify more growth of what and for what further criticismsedit ever since the development of gdp multiple observers have pointed out limitations of using gdp as the overarching measure of economic and social progress many environmentalists argue that gdp is a poor measure of social progress because it does not take into account harm to the environment although a high or rising level of gdp is often associated with increased economic and social progress within a country a number of scholars have pointed out that this does not necessarily play out in many instances for example jean drèze and amartya sen have pointed out that an increase in gdp or in gdp growth does not necessarily lead to a higher standard of living particularly in areas such as healthcare and education another important area that does not necessarily improve along with gdp is political liberty which is most notable in china where gdp growth is strong yet political liberties are heavily restricted gdp does not account for the distribution of income among the residents of a country because gdp is merely an aggregate measure an economy may be highly developed or growing rapidly but also contain a wide gap between the rich and the poor in a society these inequalities often occur on the lines of race ethnicity gender religion or other minority status within countries this can lead to misleading characterizations of economic wellbeing if the income distribution is heavily skewed toward the high end as the poorer residents will not directly benefit from the overall level of wealth and income generated in their country even gdp per capita measures may have the same downside if inequality is high for example south africa during apartheid ranked high in terms of gdp per capita but the benefits of this immense wealth and income were not shared equally among the countrycitation needed gdp does not take into account the value of household and other unpaid work some including martha nussbaum argue that this value should be included in measuring gdp as household labor is largely a substitute for goods and services that would otherwise be purchased for value even under conservative estimates the value of unpaid labor in australia has been calculated to be over  of the countrys gdp a later study analyzed this value in other countries with results ranging from a low of about  in canada using conservative estimates to high of nearly  in the united kingdom using more liberal estimates for the united states the value was estimated to be between about  on the low end to nearly  on the high end depending on the methodology being used because many public policies are shaped by gdp calculations and by the related field of national accounts the noninclusion of unpaid work in calculating gdp can create distortions in public policy and some economists have advocated for changes in the way public policies are formed and implemented the uks natural capital committee highlighted the shortcomings of gdp in its advice to the uk government in  pointing out that gdp focuses on flows not stocks as a result an economy can run down its assets yet at the same time record high levels of gdp growth until a point is reached where the depleted assets act as a check on future growth they then went on to say that it is apparent that the recorded gdp growth rate overstates the sustainable growth rate broader measures of wellbeing and wealth are needed for this and there is a danger that shortterm decisions based solely on what is currently measured by national accounts may prove to be costly in the longterm proposals to overcome gdp limitationsedit in response to these and other limitations of using gdp alternative approaches have emerged in the s amartya sen and martha nussbaum developed the capability approach which focuses on the functional capabilities enjoyed by people within a country rather than the aggregate wealth held within a country these capabilities consist of the functions that a person is able to achieve in  mahbub ul haq a pakistani economist at the united nations introduced the human development index hdi the hdi is a composite index of life expectancy at birth adult literacy rate and standard of living measured as a logarithmic function of gdp adjusted to purchasing power parity in  john b cobb and herman daly introduced index of sustainable economic welfare isew by taking into account various other factors such as consumption of nonrenewable resources and degradation of the environment the new formula deducted from gdp personal consumption  public nondefensive expenditures  private defensive expenditures  capital formation  services from domestic labour  costs of environmental degradation  depreciation of natural capital in  med jones an american economist at the international institute of management introduced the first secular gross national happiness index aka gross national wellbeing framework and index to complement gdp economics with additional seven dimensions including environment education and government work social and health mental and physical indicators the proposal was inspired by the king of bhutans gnh philosophy in  the european union released a communication titled gdp and beyond measuring progress in a changing world that identified five actions to improve the indicators of progress in ways that make it more responsive to the concerns of its citizens introduced a proposal to complementing gdp with environmental and social indicators in  professors joseph stiglitz amartya sen and jeanpaul fitoussi at the commission on the measurement of economic performance and social progress cmepsp formed by french president nicolas sarkozy published a proposal to overcome the limitation of gdp economics to expand the focus to wellbeing economics with wellbeing framework consisting of health environment work physical safety economic safety political freedom in  the karma ura of the center for bhutan studies published bhutan local gnh index contributors to happiness—physical mental and spiritual health timebalance social and community vitality cultural vitality education living standards good governance and ecological vitality the bhutan gnh index in  oecd better life index was published by the oecd the dimensions of the index included health economic workplace income jobs housing civic engagement life satisfaction in  professors john helliwell richard layard and jeffrey sachs published world happiness report and proposed to measure other wellbeing indicators in addition to gdp the evaluation framework included gdp

values added of all resident and institutional units engaged in production plus any taxes and minus any subsidies on products not included in the value of their outputs” an imf publication states that gdp measures the monetary value of final goods and services  that is those that are bought by the final user  produced in a country in a given period of time say a quarter or a year total gdp can also be broken down into the contribution of each industry or sector of the economy the ratio of gdp to the total population of the region is the per capita gdp and the same is called mean standard of living historyedit william petty came up with a basic concept of gdp to defend landlords against unfair taxation during warfare between the dutch and the english between  and  charles davenant developed the method further in  the modern concept of gdp was first developed by simon kuznets for a us congress report in  in this report kuznets warned against its use as a measure of welfare see below under limitations and criticisms after the bretton woods conference in  gdp became the main tool for measuring a countrys economy at that time gross national product gnp was the preferred estimate which differed from gdp in that it measured production by a countrys citizens at home and abroad rather than its resident institutional units see oecd definition above the switch from gnp to gdp in the us was in  trailing behind most other nations the history of the concept of gdp should be distinguished from the history of changes in ways of estimating it the value added by firms is relatively easy to calculate from their accounts but the value added by the public sector by financial industries and by intangible asset creation is more complex these activities are increasingly important in developed economies and the international conventions governing their estimation and their inclusion or exclusion in gdp regularly change in an attempt to keep up with industrial advances in the words of one academic economist the actual number for gdp is therefore the product of a vast patchwork of statistics and a complicated set of processes carried out on the raw data to fit them

business and economics portal v t e gdp can be determined in three ways all of which should in principle give the same result they are the production or output or value added approach the income approach or the expenditure approach the most direct of the three is the production approach which sums the outputs of every class of enterprise to arrive at the total the expenditure approach works on the principle that all of the product must be bought by somebody therefore the value of the total product must be equal to peoples total expenditures in buying things the income approach works on the principle that the incomes of the productive factors producers colloquially must be equal to the value of their product and determines gdp by finding the sum of all producers incomes production approachedit this approach mirrors the oecd definition given above estimate the gross value of domestic output out of the many various economic activities determine the intermediate consumption ie the cost of material supplies and services used to produce final goods or services deduct intermediate consumption from gross value to obtain the gross value added gross value added  gross value of output – value of intermediate consumption value of output  value of the total sales of goods and services plus value of changes in the inventory the sum of the gross value added in the various economic activities is known as gdp at factor cost gdp at factor cost plus indirect taxes less subsidies on products  gdp at producer price for measuring output of domestic product economic activities ie industries are classified into various sectors after classifying economic activities the output of each sector is calculated by any of the following two methods by multiplying the output of each sector by their respective market price and adding them together by collecting data on gross sales and inventories from the records of companies and adding them together the gross value of all sectors is then added to get the gross value added gva at factor cost subtracting each sectors intermediate consumption from gross output gives the gdp at factor cost adding indirect tax minus subsidies in gdp at factor cost gives the gdp at producer prices income approachedit list of countries by gdp ppp per capita by  international monetary fund countries by  gdp nominal per capita        –     –     –     –     –     –     –        unavailable us gdp computed on the income basis the second way of estimating gdp is to use the sum of primary incomes distributed by resident producer units if gdp is calculated this way it is sometimes called gross domestic income gdi or gdp i gdi should provide the same amount as the expenditure method described later by definition gdi  gdp in practice however measurement errors will make the two figures slightly off when reported by national statistical agencies this method measures gdp by adding incomes that firms pay households for factors of production they hire  wages for labour interest for capital rent for land and profits for entrepreneurship the us national income and expenditure accounts divide incomes into five categories wages salaries and supplementary labour income corporate profits interest and miscellaneous investment income farmers incomes income from nonfarm unincorporated businesses these five income components sum to net domestic income at factor cost two adjustments must be made to get gdp indirect taxes minus subsidies are added to get from factor cost to market prices depreciation or capital consumption allowance is added to get from net domestic product to gross domestic product total income can be subdivided according to various schemes leading to various formulae for gdp measured by the income approach a common one is gdp  compensation of employees  gross operating surplus  gross mixed income  taxes less subsidies on production and imports gdp  coe  gos  gmi  tp  m – sp  m compensation of employees coe measures the total remuneration to employees for work done it includes wages and salaries as well as employer contributions to social security and other such programs gross operating surplus gos is the surplus due to owners of incorporated businesses often called profits although only a subset of total costs are subtracted from gross output to calculate gos gross mixed income gmi is the same measure as gos but for unincorporated businesses this often includes most small businesses the sum of coe gos and gmi is called total factor income it is the income of all of the factors of production in society it measures the value of gdp at factor basic prices the difference between basic prices and final prices those used in the expenditure calculation is the total taxes and subsidies that the government has levied or paid on that production so adding taxes less subsidies on production and imports converts gdp at factor cost to gdpi total factor income is also sometimes expressed as total factor income  employee compensation  corporate profits  proprietors income  rental income  net interest expenditure approachedit the third way to estimate gdp is to calculate the sum of the final uses of goods and services all uses except intermediate consumption measured in purchasers prices market goods which are produced are purchased by someone in the case where a good is produced and unsold the standard accounting convention is that the producer has bought the good from themselves therefore measuring the total expenditure used to buy things is a way of measuring production this is known as the expenditure method of calculating gdp components of gdp by expenditureedit us gdp computed on the expenditure basis gdp y is the sum of consumption c investment i government spending g and net exports x – m y  c  i  g  x − m here is a description of each gdp component c consumption is normally the largest gdp component in the economy consisting of private expenditures in the economy household final consumption expenditure these personal expenditures fall under one of the following categories durable goods nondurable goods and services examples include food rent jewelry gasoline and medical expenses but not the purchase of new housing i investment includes for instance business investment in equipment but does not include exchanges of existing assets examples include construction of a new mine purchase of software or purchase of machinery and equipment for a factory spending by households not government on new houses is also included in investment in contrast to its colloquial meaning investment in gdp does not mean purchases of financial products buying financial products is classed as saving as opposed to investment this avoids doublecounting if one buys shares in a company and the company uses the money received to buy plant equipment etc the amount will be counted toward gdp when the company spends the money on those things to also count it when one gives it to the company would be to count two times an amount that only corresponds to one group of products buying bonds or stocks is a swapping of deeds a transfer of claims on future production not directly an expenditure on products g government spending is the sum of government expenditures on final goods and services it includes salaries of public servants purchases of weapons for the military and any investment expenditure by a government it does not include any transfer payments such as social security or unemployment benefits x exports represents gross exports gdp captures the amount a country produces including goods and services produced for other nations consumption therefore exports are added m imports represents gross imports imports are subtracted since imported goods will be included in the terms g i or c and must be deducted to avoid counting foreign supply as domestic note that c g and i are expenditures on final goods and services expenditures on intermediate goods and services do not count intermediate goods and services are those used by businesses to produce other goods and services within the accounting year according to the us bureau of economic analysis which is responsible for calculating the national accounts in the united states in general the source data for the expenditures components are considered more reliable than those for the income components see income method below gdp vs gniedit gdp can be contrasted with gross national product gnp or as it is now known gross national income gni the difference is that gdp defines its scope according to location while gni defines its scope according to ownership in a global context world gdp and world gni are therefore equivalent terms gdp is product produced within a countrys borders gni is product produced by enterprises owned by a countrys citizens the two would be the same if all of the productive enterprises in a country were owned by its own citizens and those citizens did not own productive enterprises in any other countries in practice however foreign ownership makes gdp and gni nonidentical production within a countrys borders but by an enterprise owned by somebody outside the country counts as part of its gdp but not its gni on the other hand production by an enterprise located outside the country but owned by one of its citizens counts as part of its gni but not its gdp for example the gni of the usa is the value of output produced by americanowned firms regardless of where the firms are located similarly if a country becomes increasingly in debt and spends large amounts of income servicing this debt this will be reflected in a decreased gni but not a decreased gdp similarly if a country sells off its resources to entities outside their country this will also be reflected over time in decreased gni but not decreased gdp this would make the use of gdp more attractive for politicians in countries with increasing national debt and decreasing assets gross national income gni equals gdp plus income receipts from the rest of the world minus income payments to the rest of the world in  the united states switched from using gnp to using gdp as its primary measure of production the relationship between united states gdp and gnp is shown in table  of the national income and product accounts international standardsedit the international standard for measuring gdp is contained in the book system of national accounts  which was prepared by representatives of the international monetary fund european union organization for economic cooperation and development united nations and world bank the publication is normally referred to as sna to distinguish it from the previous edition published in  called sna  sna provides a set of rules and procedures for the measurement of national accounts the standards are designed to be flexible to allow for differences in local statistical needs and conditions this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it august  national measurementedit within each country gdp is normally measured by a national government statistical agency as private sector organizations normally do not have access to the information required especially information on expenditure and production by governments main article national agencies responsible for gdp measurement nominal gdp and adjustments to gdpedit the raw gdp figure as given by the equations above is called the nominal historical or current gdp when one compares gdp figures from one year to another it is desirable to compensate for changes in the value of money – ie for the effects of inflation or deflation to make it more meaningful for yeartoyear comparisons it may be multiplied by the ratio between the value of money in the year the gdp was measured and the value of money in a base year for example suppose a countrys gdp in  was  million and its gdp in  was  million suppose also that inflation had halved the value of its currency over that period to meaningfully compare its gdp in  to its gdp in  we could multiply the gdp in  by onehalf to make it relative to  as a base year the result would be that the gdp in  equals  million × onehalf   million in  monetary terms we would see that the countrys gdp had realistically increased  percent over that period not  percent as it might appear from the raw gdp data the gdp adjusted for changes in money value in this way is called the real or constant gdp the factor used to convert gdp from current to constant values in this way is called the gdp deflator unlike consumer price index which measures inflation or deflation in the price of household consumer goods the gdp deflator measures changes in the prices of all domestically produced goods and services in an economy including investment goods and government services as well as household consumption goods constantgdp figures allow us to calculate a gdp growth rate which indicates how much a countrys production has increased or decreased if the growth rate is negative compared to the previous year real gdp growth rate for year n  real gdp in year n − real gdp in year n −   real gdp in year n −  another thing that it may be desirable to account for is population growth if a countrys gdp doubled over a certain period but its population tripled the increase in gdp may not mean that the standard of living increased for the countrys residents the average person in the country is producing less than they were before percapita gdp is a measure to account for population growth crossborder comparison and purchasing power parityedit the level of gdp in different countries may be compared by converting their value in national currency according to either the current currency exchange rate or the purchasing power parity exchange rate current currency exchange rate is the exchange rate in the international foreign exchange market purchasing power parity exchange rate is the exchange rate based on the purchasing power parity ppp of a currency relative to a selected standard usually the united states dollar this is a comparative and theoretical exchange rate the only way to directly realize this rate is to sell an entire cpi basket in one country convert the cash at the currency market rate  then rebuy that same basket of goods in the other country with the converted cash going from country to country the distribution of prices within the basket will vary typically nontradable purchases will consume a greater proportion of the baskets total cost in the higher gdp country per the balassasamuelson effect the ranking of countries may differ significantly based on which method is used the current exchange rate method converts the value of goods and services using global currency exchange rates the method can offer better indications of a countrys international purchasing power for instance if  of gdp is being spent on buying hitech foreign arms the number of weapons purchased is entirely governed by current exchange rates since arms are a traded product bought on the international market there is no meaningful local price distinct from the international price for high technology goods the ppp method of gdp conversion is more relevant to nontraded goods and services in the above example if hitech weapons are to be produced internally their amount will be governed by gdpppp rather than nominal gdp there is a clear pattern of the purchasing power parity method decreasing the disparity in gdp between high and low income gdp countries as compared to the current exchange rate method this finding is called the penn effect for more information see measures of national income and output standard of living and gdp wealth distribution and externalitiesedit gdp per capita is often used as an indicator of living standards the major advantage of gdp per capita as an indicator of standard of living is that it is measured frequently widely and consistently it is measured frequently in that most countries provide information on gdp on a quarterly basis allowing trends to be seen quickly it is measured widely in that some measure of gdp is available for almost every country in the world allowing intercountry comparisons it is measured consistently in that the technical definition of gdp is relatively consistent among countries gdp does not include several factors that influence the standard of living in particular it fails to account for externalities – economic growth may entail an increase in negative externalities that are not directly measured in gdp increased industrial output might grow gdp but any pollution is not counted nonmarket transactions– gdp excludes activities that are not provided through the market such as household production bartering of goods and services and volunteer or unpaid services nonmonetary economy– gdp omits economies where no money comes into play at all resulting in inaccurate or abnormally low gdp figures for example in countries with major business transactions occurring informally portions of local economy are not easily registered bartering may be more prominent than the use of money even extending to services quality improvements and inclusion of new products– by not fully adjusting for quality improvements and new products gdp understates true economic growth for instance although computers today are less expensive and more powerful than computers from the past gdp treats them as the same products by only accounting for the monetary value the introduction of new products is also difficult to measure accurately and is not reflected in gdp despite the fact that it may increase the standard of living for example even the richest person in  could not purchase standard products such as antibiotics and cell phones that an average consumer can buy today since such modern conveniences did not exist then sustainability of growth– gdp is a measurement of economic historic activity and is not necessarily a projection wealth distribution – gdp does not account for variances in incomes of various demographic groups see income inequality metrics for discussion of a variety of inequalitybased economic measures it can be argued that gdp per capita as an indicator standard of living is correlated with these factors capturing them indirectly as a result gdp per capita as a standard of living is a continued usage because most people have a fairly accurate idea of what it is and know it is tough to come up with quantitative measures for such constructs as happiness quality of life and wellbeing limitations and criticismsedit this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it february  limitations at introductionedit simon kuznets the economist who developed the first comprehensive set of measures of national income stated in his first report to the us congress in  in a section titled uses and abuses of national income measurements the valuable capacity of the human mind to simplify a complex situation in a compact characterization becomes dangerous when not controlled in terms of definitely stated criteria with quantitative measurements especially the definiteness of the result suggests often misleadingly a precision and simplicity in the outlines of the object measured measurements of national income are subject to this type of illusion and resulting abuse especially since they deal with matters that are the center of conflict of opposing social groups where the effectiveness of an argument is often contingent upon oversimplification  all these qualifications upon estimates of national income as an index of productivity are just as important when income measurements are interpreted from the point of view of economic welfare but in the latter case additional difficulties will be suggested to anyone who wants to penetrate below the surface of total figures and market values economic welfare cannot be adequately measured unless the personal distribution of income is known and no income measurement undertakes to estimate the reverse side of income that is the intensity and unpleasantness of effort going into the earning of income the welfare of a nation can therefore scarcely be inferred from a measurement of national income as defined above in  kuznets stated distinctions must be kept in mind between quantity and quality of growth between costs and returns and between the short and long run goals for more growth should specify more growth of what and for what further criticismsedit ever since the development of gdp multiple observers have pointed out limitations of using gdp as the overarching measure of economic and social progress many environmentalists argue that gdp is a poor measure of social progress because it does not take into account harm to the environment although a high or rising level of gdp is often associated with increased economic and social progress within a country a number of scholars have pointed out that this does not necessarily play out in many instances for example jean drèze and amartya sen have pointed out that an increase in gdp or in gdp growth does not necessarily lead to a higher standard of living particularly in areas such as healthcare and education another important area that does not necessarily improve along with gdp is political liberty which is most notable in china where gdp growth is strong yet political liberties are heavily restricted gdp does not account for the distribution of income among the residents of a country because gdp is merely an aggregate measure an economy may be highly developed or growing rapidly but also contain a wide gap between the rich and the poor in a society these inequalities often occur on the lines of race ethnicity gender religion or other minority status within countries this can lead to misleading characterizations of economic wellbeing if the income distribution is heavily skewed toward the high end as the poorer residents will not directly benefit from the overall level of wealth and income generated in their country even gdp per capita measures may have the same downside if inequality is high for example south africa during apartheid ranked high in terms of gdp per capita but the benefits of this immense wealth and income were not shared equally among the countrycitation needed gdp does not take into account the value of household and other unpaid work some including martha nussbaum argue that this value should be included in measuring gdp as household labor is largely a substitute for goods and services that would otherwise be purchased for value even under conservative estimates the value of unpaid labor in australia has been calculated to be over  of the countrys gdp a later study analyzed this value in other countries with results ranging from a low of about  in canada using conservative estimates to high of nearly  in the united kingdom using more liberal estimates for the united states the value was estimated to be between about  on the low end to nearly  on the high end depending on the methodology being used because many public policies are shaped by gdp calculations and by the related field of national accounts the noninclusion of unpaid work in calculating gdp can create distortions in public policy and some economists have advocated for changes in the way public policies are formed and implemented the uks natural capital committee highlighted the shortcomings of gdp in its advice to the uk government in  pointing out that gdp focuses on flows not stocks as a result an economy can run down its assets yet at the same time record high levels of gdp growth until a point is reached where the depleted assets act as a check on future growth they then went on to say that it is apparent that the recorded gdp growth rate overstates the sustainable growth rate broader measures of wellbeing and wealth are needed for this and there is a danger that shortterm decisions based solely on what is currently measured by national accounts may prove to be costly in the longterm proposals to overcome gdp limitationsedit in response to these and other limitations of using gdp alternative approaches have emerged in the s amartya sen and martha nussbaum developed the capability approach which focuses on the functional capabilities enjoyed by people within a country rather than the aggregate wealth held within a country these capabilities consist of the functions that a person is able to achieve in  mahbub ul haq a pakistani economist at the united nations introduced the human development index hdi the hdi is a composite index of life expectancy at birth adult literacy rate and standard of living measured as a logarithmic function of gdp adjusted to purchasing power parity in  john b cobb and herman daly introduced index of sustainable economic welfare isew by taking into account various other factors such as consumption of nonrenewable resources and degradation of the environment the new formula deducted from gdp personal consumption  public nondefensive expenditures  private defensive expenditures  capital formation  services from domestic labour  costs of environmental degradation  depreciation of natural capital in  med jones an american economist at the international institute of management introduced the first secular gross national happiness index aka gross national wellbeing framework and index to complement gdp economics with additional seven dimensions including environment education and government work social and health mental and physical indicators the proposal was inspired by the king of bhutans gnh philosophy in  the european union released a communication titled gdp and beyond measuring progress in a changing world that identified five actions to improve the indicators of progress in ways that make it more responsive to the concerns of its citizens introduced a proposal to complementing gdp with environmental and social indicators in  professors joseph stiglitz amartya sen and jeanpaul fitoussi at the commission on the measurement of economic performance and social progress cmepsp formed by french president nicolas sarkozy published a proposal to overcome the limitation of gdp economics to expand the focus to wellbeing

added of all resident and institutional units engaged in production plus any taxes and minus any subsidies on products not included in the value of their outputs” an imf publication states that gdp measures the monetary value of final goods and services  that is those that are bought by the final user  produced in a country in a given period of time say a quarter or a year total gdp can also be broken down into the contribution of each industry or sector of the economy the ratio of gdp to the total population of the region is the per capita gdp and the same is called mean standard of living historyedit william petty came up with a basic concept of gdp to defend landlords against unfair taxation during warfare between the dutch and the english between  and  charles davenant developed the method further in  the modern concept of gdp was first developed by simon kuznets for a us congress report in  in this report kuznets warned against its use as a measure of welfare see below under limitations and criticisms after the bretton woods conference in  gdp became the main tool for measuring a countrys economy at that time gross national product gnp was the preferred estimate which differed from gdp in that it measured production by a countrys citizens at home and abroad rather than its resident institutional units see oecd definition above the switch from gnp to gdp in the us was in  trailing behind most other nations the history of the concept of gdp should be distinguished from the history of changes in ways of estimating it the value added by firms is relatively easy to calculate from their accounts but the value added by the public sector by financial industries and by intangible asset creation is more complex these activities are increasingly important in developed economies and the international conventions governing their estimation and their inclusion or exclusion in gdp regularly change in an attempt to keep up with industrial advances in the words of one academic economist the actual number for gdp is therefore the product of a vast patchwork of statistics and a complicated set of processes carried out on the raw data to fit them to the conceptual

monetary  financial natural resource organizational personnel public  welfare economics regional rural service urban welfare lists economists publications journals business and economics portal v t e gdp can be determined in three ways all of which should in principle give the same result they are the production or output or value added approach the income approach or the expenditure approach the most direct of the three is the production approach which sums the outputs of every class of enterprise to arrive at the total the expenditure approach works on the principle that all of the product must be bought by somebody therefore the value of the total product must be equal to peoples total expenditures in buying things the income approach works on the principle that the incomes of the productive factors producers colloquially must be equal to the value of their product and determines gdp by finding the sum of all producers incomes production approachedit this approach mirrors the oecd definition given above estimate the gross value of domestic output out of the many various economic activities determine the intermediate consumption ie the cost of material supplies and services used to produce final goods or services deduct intermediate consumption from gross value to obtain the gross value added gross value added  gross value of output – value of intermediate consumption value of output  value of the total sales of goods and services plus value of changes in the inventory the sum of the gross value added in the various economic activities is known as gdp at factor cost gdp at factor cost plus indirect taxes less subsidies on products  gdp at producer price for measuring output of domestic product economic activities ie industries are classified into various sectors after classifying economic activities the output of each sector is calculated by any of the following two methods by multiplying the output of each sector by their respective market price and adding them together by collecting data on gross sales and inventories from the records of companies and adding them together the gross value of all sectors is then added to get the gross value added gva at factor cost subtracting each sectors intermediate consumption from gross output gives the gdp at factor cost adding indirect tax minus subsidies in gdp at factor cost gives the gdp at producer prices income approachedit list of countries by gdp ppp per capita by  international monetary fund countries by  gdp nominal per capita        –     –     –     –     –     –     –        unavailable us gdp computed on the income basis the second way of estimating gdp is to use the sum of primary incomes distributed by resident producer units if gdp is calculated this way it is sometimes called gross domestic income gdi or gdp i gdi should provide the same amount as the expenditure method described later by definition gdi  gdp in practice however measurement errors will make the two figures slightly off when reported by national statistical agencies this method measures gdp by adding incomes that firms pay households for factors of production they hire  wages for labour interest for capital rent for land and profits for entrepreneurship the us national income and expenditure accounts divide incomes into five categories wages salaries and supplementary labour income corporate profits interest and miscellaneous investment income farmers incomes income from nonfarm unincorporated businesses these five income components sum to net domestic income at factor cost two adjustments must be made to get gdp indirect taxes minus subsidies are added to get from factor cost to market prices depreciation or capital consumption allowance is added to get from net domestic product to gross domestic product total income can be subdivided according to various schemes leading to various formulae for gdp measured by the income approach a common one is gdp  compensation of employees  gross operating surplus  gross mixed income  taxes less subsidies on production and imports gdp  coe  gos  gmi  tp  m – sp  m compensation of employees coe measures the total remuneration to employees for work done it includes wages and salaries as well as employer contributions to social security and other such programs gross operating surplus gos is the surplus due to owners of incorporated businesses often called profits although only a subset of total costs are subtracted from gross output to calculate gos gross mixed income gmi is the same measure as gos but for unincorporated businesses this often includes most small businesses the sum of coe gos and gmi is called total factor income it is the income of all of the factors of production in society it measures the value of gdp at factor basic prices the difference between basic prices and final prices those used in the expenditure calculation is the total taxes and subsidies that the government has levied or paid on that production so adding taxes less subsidies on production and imports converts gdp at factor cost to gdpi total factor income is also sometimes expressed as total factor income  employee compensation  corporate profits  proprietors income  rental income  net interest expenditure approachedit the third way to estimate gdp is to calculate the sum of the final uses of goods and services all uses except intermediate consumption measured in purchasers prices market goods which are produced are purchased by someone in the case where a good is produced and unsold the standard accounting convention is that the producer has bought the good from themselves therefore measuring the total expenditure used to buy things is a way of measuring production this is known as the expenditure method of calculating gdp components of gdp by expenditureedit us gdp computed on the expenditure basis gdp y is the sum of consumption c investment i government spending g and net exports x – m y  c  i  g  x − m here is a description of each gdp component c consumption is normally the largest gdp component in the economy consisting of private expenditures in the economy household final consumption expenditure these personal expenditures fall under one of the following categories durable goods nondurable goods and services examples include food rent jewelry gasoline and medical expenses but not the purchase of new housing i investment includes for instance business investment in equipment but does not include exchanges of existing assets examples include construction of a new mine purchase of software or purchase of machinery and equipment for a factory spending by households not government on new houses is also included in investment in contrast to its colloquial meaning investment in gdp does not mean purchases of financial products buying financial products is classed as saving as opposed to investment this avoids doublecounting if one buys shares in a company and the company uses the money received to buy plant equipment etc the amount will be counted toward gdp when the company spends the money on those things to also count it when one gives it to the company would be to count two times an amount that only corresponds to one group of products buying bonds or stocks is a swapping of deeds a transfer of claims on future production not directly an expenditure on products g government spending is the sum of government expenditures on final goods and services it includes salaries of public servants purchases of weapons for the military and any investment expenditure by a government it does not include any transfer payments such as social security or unemployment benefits x exports represents gross exports gdp captures the amount a country produces including goods and services produced for other nations consumption therefore exports are added m imports represents gross imports imports are subtracted since imported goods will be included in the terms g i or c and must be deducted to avoid counting foreign supply as domestic note that c g and i are expenditures on final goods and services expenditures on intermediate goods and services do not count intermediate goods and services are those used by businesses to produce other goods and services within the accounting year according to the us bureau of economic analysis which is responsible for calculating the national accounts in the united states in general the source data for the expenditures components are considered more reliable than those for the income components see income method below gdp vs gniedit gdp can be contrasted with gross national product gnp or as it is now known gross national income gni the difference is that gdp defines its scope according to location while gni defines its scope according to ownership in a global context world gdp and world gni are therefore equivalent terms gdp is product produced within a countrys borders gni is product produced by enterprises owned by a countrys citizens the two would be the same if all of the productive enterprises in a country were owned by its own citizens and those citizens did not own productive enterprises in any other countries in practice however foreign ownership makes gdp and gni nonidentical production within a countrys borders but by an enterprise owned by somebody outside the country counts as part of its gdp but not its gni on the other hand production by an enterprise located outside the country but owned by one of its citizens counts as part of its gni but not its gdp for example the gni of the usa is the value of output produced by americanowned firms regardless of where the firms are located similarly if a country becomes increasingly in debt and spends large amounts of income servicing this debt this will be reflected in a decreased gni but not a decreased gdp similarly if a country sells off its resources to entities outside their country this will also be reflected over time in decreased gni but not decreased gdp this would make the use of gdp more attractive for politicians in countries with increasing national debt and decreasing assets gross national income gni equals gdp plus income receipts from the rest of the world minus income payments to the rest of the world in  the united states switched from using gnp to using gdp as its primary measure of production the relationship between united states gdp and gnp is shown in table  of the national income and product accounts international standardsedit the international standard for measuring gdp is contained in the book system of national accounts  which was prepared by representatives of the international monetary fund european union organization for economic cooperation and development united nations and world bank the publication is normally referred to as sna to distinguish it from the previous edition published in  called sna  sna provides a set of rules and procedures for the measurement of national accounts the standards are designed to be flexible to allow for differences in local statistical needs and conditions this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it august  national measurementedit within each country gdp is normally measured by a national government statistical agency as private sector organizations normally do not have access to the information required especially information on expenditure and production by governments main article national agencies responsible for gdp measurement nominal gdp and adjustments to gdpedit the raw gdp figure as given by the equations above is called the nominal historical or current gdp when one compares gdp figures from one year to another it is desirable to compensate for changes in the value of money – ie for the effects of inflation or deflation to make it more meaningful for yeartoyear comparisons it may be multiplied by the ratio between the value of money in the year the gdp was measured and the value of money in a base year for example suppose a countrys gdp in  was  million and its gdp in  was  million suppose also that inflation had halved the value of its currency over that period to meaningfully compare its gdp in  to its gdp in  we could multiply the gdp in  by onehalf to make it relative to  as a base year the result would be that the gdp in  equals  million × onehalf   million in  monetary terms we would see that the countrys gdp had realistically increased  percent over that period not  percent as it might appear from the raw gdp data the gdp adjusted for changes in money value in this way is called the real or constant gdp the factor used to convert gdp from current to constant values in this way is called the gdp deflator unlike consumer price index which measures inflation or deflation in the price of household consumer goods the gdp deflator measures changes in the prices of all domestically produced goods and services in an economy including investment goods and government services as well as household consumption goods constantgdp figures allow us to calculate a gdp growth rate which indicates how much a countrys production has increased or decreased if the growth rate is negative compared to the previous year real gdp growth rate for year n  real gdp in year n − real gdp in year n −   real gdp in year n −  another thing that it may be desirable to account for is population growth if a countrys gdp doubled over a certain period but its population tripled the increase in gdp may not mean that the standard of living increased for the countrys residents the average person in the country is producing less than they were before percapita gdp is a measure to account for population growth crossborder comparison and purchasing power parityedit the level of gdp in different countries may be compared by converting their value in national currency according to either the current currency exchange rate or the purchasing power parity exchange rate current currency exchange rate is the exchange rate in the international foreign exchange market purchasing power parity exchange rate is the exchange rate based on the purchasing power parity ppp of a currency relative to a selected standard usually the united states dollar this is a comparative and theoretical exchange rate the only way to directly realize this rate is to sell an entire cpi basket in one country convert the cash at the currency market rate  then rebuy that same basket of goods in the other country with the converted cash going from country to country the distribution of prices within the basket will vary typically nontradable purchases will consume a greater proportion of the baskets total cost in the higher gdp country per the balassasamuelson effect the ranking of countries may differ significantly based on which method is used the current exchange rate method converts the value of goods and services using global currency exchange rates the method can offer better indications of a countrys international purchasing power for instance if  of gdp is being spent on buying hitech foreign arms the number of weapons purchased is entirely governed by current exchange rates since arms are a traded product bought on the international market there is no meaningful local price distinct from the international price for high technology goods the ppp method of gdp conversion is more relevant to nontraded goods and services in the above example if hitech weapons are to be produced internally their amount will be governed by gdpppp rather than nominal gdp there is a clear pattern of the purchasing power parity method decreasing the disparity in gdp between high and low income gdp countries as compared to the current exchange rate method this finding is called the penn effect for more information see measures of national income and output standard of living and gdp wealth distribution and externalitiesedit gdp per capita is often used as an indicator of living standards the major advantage of gdp per capita as an indicator of standard of living is that it is measured frequently widely and consistently it is measured frequently in that most countries provide information on gdp on a quarterly basis allowing trends to be seen quickly it is measured widely in that some measure of gdp is available for almost every country in the world allowing intercountry comparisons it is measured consistently in that the technical definition of gdp is relatively consistent among countries gdp does not include several factors that influence the standard of living in particular it fails to account for externalities – economic growth may entail an increase in negative externalities that are not directly measured in gdp increased industrial output might grow gdp but any pollution is not counted nonmarket transactions– gdp excludes activities that are not provided through the market such as household production bartering of goods and services and volunteer or unpaid services nonmonetary economy– gdp omits economies where no money comes into play at all resulting in inaccurate or abnormally low gdp figures for example in countries with major business transactions occurring informally portions of local economy are not easily registered bartering may be more prominent than the use of money even extending to services quality improvements and inclusion of new products– by not fully adjusting for quality improvements and new products gdp understates true economic growth for instance although computers today are less expensive and more powerful than computers from the past gdp treats them as the same products by only accounting for the monetary value the introduction of new products is also difficult to measure accurately and is not reflected in gdp despite the fact that it may increase the standard of living for example even the richest person in  could not purchase standard products such as antibiotics and cell phones that an average consumer can buy today since such modern conveniences did not exist then sustainability of growth– gdp is a measurement of economic historic activity and is not necessarily a projection wealth distribution – gdp does not account for variances in incomes of various demographic groups see income inequality metrics for discussion of a variety of inequalitybased economic measures it can be argued that gdp per capita as an indicator standard of living is correlated with these factors capturing them indirectly as a result gdp per capita as a standard of living is a continued usage because most people have a fairly accurate idea of what it is and know it is tough to come up with quantitative measures for such constructs as happiness quality of life and wellbeing limitations and criticismsedit this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it february  limitations at introductionedit simon kuznets the economist who developed the first comprehensive set of measures of national income stated in his first report to the us congress in  in a section titled uses and abuses of national income measurements the valuable capacity of the human mind to simplify a complex situation in a compact characterization becomes dangerous when not controlled in terms of definitely stated criteria with quantitative measurements especially the definiteness of the result suggests often misleadingly a precision and simplicity in the outlines of the object measured measurements of national income are subject to this type of illusion and resulting abuse especially since they deal with matters that are the center of conflict of opposing social groups where the effectiveness of an argument is often contingent upon oversimplification  all these qualifications upon estimates of national income as an index of productivity are just as important when income measurements are interpreted from the point of view of economic welfare but in the latter case additional difficulties will be suggested to anyone who wants to penetrate below the surface of total figures and market values economic welfare cannot be adequately measured unless the personal distribution of income is known and no income measurement undertakes to estimate the reverse side of income that is the intensity and unpleasantness of effort going into the earning of income the welfare of a nation can therefore scarcely be inferred from a measurement of national income as defined above in  kuznets stated distinctions must be kept in mind between quantity and quality of growth between costs and returns and between the short and long run goals for more growth should specify more growth of what and for what further criticismsedit ever since the development of gdp multiple observers have pointed out limitations of using gdp as the overarching measure of economic and social progress many environmentalists argue that gdp is a poor measure of social progress because it does not take into account harm to the environment although a high or rising level of gdp is often associated with increased economic and social progress within a country a number of scholars have pointed out that this does not necessarily play out in many instances for example jean drèze and amartya sen have pointed out that an increase in gdp or in gdp growth does not necessarily lead to a higher standard of living particularly in areas such as healthcare and education another important area that does not necessarily improve along with gdp is political liberty which is most notable in china where gdp growth is strong yet political liberties are heavily restricted gdp does not account for the distribution of income among the residents of a country because gdp is merely an aggregate measure an economy may be highly developed or growing rapidly but also contain a wide gap between the rich and the poor in a society these inequalities often occur on the lines of race ethnicity gender religion or other minority status within countries this can lead to misleading characterizations of economic wellbeing if the income distribution is heavily skewed toward the high end as the poorer residents will not directly benefit from the overall level of wealth and income generated in their country even gdp per capita measures may have the same downside if inequality is high for example south africa during apartheid ranked high in terms of gdp per capita but the benefits of this immense wealth and income were not shared equally among the countrycitation needed gdp does not take into account the value of household and other unpaid work some including martha nussbaum argue that this value should be included in measuring gdp as household labor is largely a substitute for goods and services that would otherwise be purchased for value even under conservative estimates the value of unpaid labor in australia has been calculated to be over  of the countrys gdp a later study analyzed this value in other countries with results ranging from a low of about  in canada using conservative estimates to high of nearly  in the united kingdom using more liberal estimates for the united states the value was estimated to be between about  on the low end to nearly  on the high end depending on the methodology being used because many public policies are shaped by gdp calculations and by the related field of national accounts the noninclusion of unpaid work in calculating gdp can create distortions in public policy and some economists have advocated for changes in the way public policies are formed and implemented the uks natural capital committee highlighted the shortcomings of gdp in its advice to the uk government in  pointing out that gdp focuses on flows not stocks as a result an economy can run down its assets yet at the same time record high levels of gdp growth until a point is reached where the depleted assets act as a check on future growth they then went on to say that it is apparent that the recorded gdp growth rate overstates the sustainable growth rate broader measures of wellbeing and wealth are needed for this and there is a danger that shortterm decisions based solely on what is currently measured by national accounts may prove to be costly in the longterm proposals to overcome gdp limitationsedit in response to these and other limitations of using gdp alternative approaches have emerged in the s amartya sen and martha nussbaum developed the capability approach which focuses on the functional capabilities enjoyed by people within a country rather than the aggregate wealth held within a country these capabilities consist of the functions that a person is able to achieve in  mahbub ul haq a pakistani economist at the united nations introduced the human development index hdi the hdi is a composite index of life expectancy at birth adult literacy rate and standard of living measured as a logarithmic function of gdp adjusted to purchasing power parity in  john b cobb and herman daly introduced index of sustainable economic welfare isew by taking into account various other factors such as consumption of nonrenewable resources and degradation of the environment the new formula deducted from gdp personal consumption  public nondefensive expenditures  private defensive expenditures  capital formation  services from domestic labour  costs of environmental degradation  depreciation of natural capital in  med jones an american economist at the international institute of management introduced the first secular gross national happiness index aka gross national wellbeing framework and index to complement gdp economics with additional seven dimensions including environment education and government work social and health mental and physical indicators the proposal was inspired by the king of bhutans gnh philosophy in  the european union released a communication titled gdp and beyond measuring progress in a changing world that identified five actions to improve the indicators of progress in ways that make it more responsive to the concerns of its citizens introduced a proposal to complementing gdp with environmental and social indicators in  professors joseph stiglitz amartya sen and jeanpaul fitoussi at the commission on the measurement of economic performance and social progress cmepsp formed by french president nicolas sarkozy published a proposal to overcome the limitation of gdp economics to expand the focus to wellbeing economics with wellbeing

values added of all resident and institutional units engaged in production plus any taxes and minus any subsidies on products not included in the value of their outputs” an imf publication states that gdp measures the monetary value of final goods and services  that is those that are bought by the final user  produced in a country in a given period of time say a quarter or a year total gdp can also be broken down into the contribution of each industry or sector of the economy the ratio of gdp to the total population of the region is the per capita gdp and the same is called mean standard of living historyedit william petty came up with a basic concept of gdp to defend landlords against unfair taxation during warfare between the dutch and the english between  and  charles davenant developed the method further in  the modern concept of gdp was first developed by simon kuznets for a us congress report in  in this report kuznets warned against its use as a measure of welfare see below under limitations and criticisms after the bretton woods conference in  gdp became the main tool for measuring a countrys economy at that time gross national product gnp was the preferred estimate which differed from gdp in that it measured production by a countrys citizens at home and abroad rather than its resident institutional units see oecd definition above the switch from gnp to gdp in the us was in  trailing behind most other nations the history of the concept of gdp should be distinguished from the history of changes in ways of estimating it the value added by firms is relatively easy to calculate from their accounts but the value added by the public sector by financial industries and by intangible asset creation is more complex these activities are increasingly important in developed economies and the international conventions governing their estimation and their inclusion or exclusion in gdp regularly change in an attempt to keep up with industrial advances in the words of one academic economist the actual number for gdp is therefore the product of a vast patchwork of statistics and a complicated set of processes carried out on the raw data to fit them to the conceptual framework determining gross domestic product gdpedit economics a supply and demand diagram illustrating the effects of an increase in demand index outline category history types

knowledge labour law managerial monetary  financial natural resource organizational personnel public  welfare economics regional rural service urban welfare lists economists publications journals business and economics portal v t e gdp can be determined in three ways all of which should in principle give the same result they are the production or output or value added approach the income approach or the expenditure approach the most direct of the three is the production approach which sums the outputs of every class of enterprise to arrive at the total the expenditure approach works on the principle that all of the product must be bought by somebody therefore the value of the total product must be equal to peoples total expenditures in buying things the income approach works on the principle that the incomes of the productive factors producers colloquially must be equal to the value of their product and determines gdp by finding the sum of all producers incomes production approachedit this approach mirrors the oecd definition given above estimate the gross value of domestic output out of the many various economic activities determine the intermediate consumption ie the cost of material supplies and services used to produce final goods or services deduct intermediate consumption from gross value to obtain the gross value added gross value added  gross value of output – value of intermediate consumption value of output  value of the total sales of goods and services plus value of changes in the inventory the sum of the gross value added in the various economic activities is known as gdp at factor cost gdp at factor cost plus indirect taxes less subsidies on products  gdp at producer price for measuring output of domestic product economic activities ie industries are classified into various sectors after classifying economic activities the output of each sector is calculated by any of the following two methods by multiplying the output of each sector by their respective market price and adding them together by collecting data on gross sales and inventories from the records of companies and adding them together the gross value of all sectors is then added to get the gross value added gva at factor cost subtracting each sectors intermediate consumption from gross output gives the gdp at factor cost adding indirect tax minus subsidies in gdp at factor cost gives the gdp at producer prices income approachedit list of countries by gdp ppp per capita by  international monetary fund countries by  gdp nominal per capita        –     –     –     –     –     –     –        unavailable us gdp computed on the income basis the second way of estimating gdp is to use the sum of primary incomes distributed by resident producer units if gdp is calculated this way it is sometimes called gross domestic income gdi or gdp i gdi should provide the same amount as the expenditure method described later by definition gdi  gdp in practice however measurement errors will make the two figures slightly off when reported by national statistical agencies this method measures gdp by adding incomes that firms pay households for factors of production they hire  wages for labour interest for capital rent for land and profits for entrepreneurship the us national income and expenditure accounts divide incomes into five categories wages salaries and supplementary labour income corporate profits interest and miscellaneous investment income farmers incomes income from nonfarm unincorporated businesses these five income components sum to net domestic income at factor cost two adjustments must be made to get gdp indirect taxes minus subsidies are added to get from factor cost to market prices depreciation or capital consumption allowance is added to get from net domestic product to gross domestic product total income can be subdivided according to various schemes leading to various formulae for gdp measured by the income approach a common one is gdp  compensation of employees  gross operating surplus  gross mixed income  taxes less subsidies on production and imports gdp  coe  gos  gmi  tp  m – sp  m compensation of employees coe measures the total remuneration to employees for work done it includes wages and salaries as well as employer contributions to social security and other such programs gross operating surplus gos is the surplus due to owners of incorporated businesses often called profits although only a subset of total costs are subtracted from gross output to calculate gos gross mixed income gmi is the same measure as gos but for unincorporated businesses this often includes most small businesses the sum of coe gos and gmi is called total factor income it is the income of all of the factors of production in society it measures the value of gdp at factor basic prices the difference between basic prices and final prices those used in the expenditure calculation is the total taxes and subsidies that the government has levied or paid on that production so adding taxes less subsidies on production and imports converts gdp at factor cost to gdpi total factor income is also sometimes expressed as total factor income  employee compensation  corporate profits  proprietors income  rental income  net interest expenditure approachedit the third way to estimate gdp is to calculate the sum of the final uses of goods and services all uses except intermediate consumption measured in purchasers prices market goods which are produced are purchased by someone in the case where a good is produced and unsold the standard accounting convention is that the producer has bought the good from themselves therefore measuring the total expenditure used to buy things is a way of measuring production this is known as the expenditure method of calculating gdp components of gdp by expenditureedit us gdp computed on the expenditure basis gdp y is the sum of consumption c investment i government spending g and net exports x – m y  c  i  g  x − m here is a description of each gdp component c consumption is normally the largest gdp component in the economy consisting of private expenditures in the economy household final consumption expenditure these personal expenditures fall under one of the following categories durable goods nondurable goods and services examples include food rent jewelry gasoline and medical expenses but not the purchase of new housing i investment includes for instance business investment in equipment but does not include exchanges of existing assets examples include construction of a new mine purchase of software or purchase of machinery and equipment for a factory spending by households not government on new houses is also included in investment in contrast to its colloquial meaning investment in gdp does not mean purchases of financial products buying financial products is classed as saving as opposed to investment this avoids doublecounting if one buys shares in a company and the company uses the money received to buy plant equipment etc the amount will be counted toward gdp when the company spends the money on those things to also count it when one gives it to the company would be to count two times an amount that only corresponds to one group of products buying bonds or stocks is a swapping of deeds a transfer of claims on future production not directly an expenditure on products g government spending is the sum of government expenditures on final goods and services it includes salaries of public servants purchases of weapons for the military and any investment expenditure by a government it does not include any transfer payments such as social security or unemployment benefits x exports represents gross exports gdp captures the amount a country produces including goods and services produced for other nations consumption therefore exports are added m imports represents gross imports imports are subtracted since imported goods will be included in the terms g i or c and must be deducted to avoid counting foreign supply as domestic note that c g and i are expenditures on final goods and services expenditures on intermediate goods and services do not count intermediate goods and services are those used by businesses to produce other goods and services within the accounting year according to the us bureau of economic analysis which is responsible for calculating the national accounts in the united states in general the source data for the expenditures components are considered more reliable than those for the income components see income method below gdp vs gniedit gdp can be contrasted with gross national product gnp or as it is now known gross national income gni the difference is that gdp defines its scope according to location while gni defines its scope according to ownership in a global context world gdp and world gni are therefore equivalent terms gdp is product produced within a countrys borders gni is product produced by enterprises owned by a countrys citizens the two would be the same if all of the productive enterprises in a country were owned by its own citizens and those citizens did not own productive enterprises in any other countries in practice however foreign ownership makes gdp and gni nonidentical production within a countrys borders but by an enterprise owned by somebody outside the country counts as part of its gdp but not its gni on the other hand production by an enterprise located outside the country but owned by one of its citizens counts as part of its gni but not its gdp for example the gni of the usa is the value of output produced by americanowned firms regardless of where the firms are located similarly if a country becomes increasingly in debt and spends large amounts of income servicing this debt this will be reflected in a decreased gni but not a decreased gdp similarly if a country sells off its resources to entities outside their country this will also be reflected over time in decreased gni but not decreased gdp this would make the use of gdp more attractive for politicians in countries with increasing national debt and decreasing assets gross national income gni equals gdp plus income receipts from the rest of the world minus income payments to the rest of the world in  the united states switched from using gnp to using gdp as its primary measure of production the relationship between united states gdp and gnp is shown in table  of the national income and product accounts international standardsedit the international standard for measuring gdp is contained in the book system of national accounts  which was prepared by representatives of the international monetary fund european union organization for economic cooperation and development united nations and world bank the publication is normally referred to as sna to distinguish it from the previous edition published in  called sna  sna provides a set of rules and procedures for the measurement of national accounts the standards are designed to be flexible to allow for differences in local statistical needs and conditions this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it august  national measurementedit within each country gdp is normally measured by a national government statistical agency as private sector organizations normally do not have access to the information required especially information on expenditure and production by governments main article national agencies responsible for gdp measurement nominal gdp and adjustments to gdpedit the raw gdp figure as given by the equations above is called the nominal historical or current gdp when one compares gdp figures from one year to another it is desirable to compensate for changes in the value of money – ie for the effects of inflation or deflation to make it more meaningful for yeartoyear comparisons it may be multiplied by the ratio between the value of money in the year the gdp was measured and the value of money in a base year for example suppose a countrys gdp in  was  million and its gdp in  was  million suppose also that inflation had halved the value of its currency over that period to meaningfully compare its gdp in  to its gdp in  we could multiply the gdp in  by onehalf to make it relative to  as a base year the result would be that the gdp in  equals  million × onehalf   million in  monetary terms we would see that the countrys gdp had realistically increased  percent over that period not  percent as it might appear from the raw gdp data the gdp adjusted for changes in money value in this way is called the real or constant gdp the factor used to convert gdp from current to constant values in this way is called the gdp deflator unlike consumer price index which measures inflation or deflation in the price of household consumer goods the gdp deflator measures changes in the prices of all domestically produced goods and services in an economy including investment goods and government services as well as household consumption goods constantgdp figures allow us to calculate a gdp growth rate which indicates how much a countrys production has increased or decreased if the growth rate is negative compared to the previous year real gdp growth rate for year n  real gdp in year n − real gdp in year n −   real gdp in year n −  another thing that it may be desirable to account for is population growth if a countrys gdp doubled over a certain period but its population tripled the increase in gdp may not mean that the standard of living increased for the countrys residents the average person in the country is producing less than they were before percapita gdp is a measure to account for population growth crossborder comparison and purchasing power parityedit the level of gdp in different countries may be compared by converting their value in national currency according to either the current currency exchange rate or the purchasing power parity exchange rate current currency exchange rate is the exchange rate in the international foreign exchange market purchasing power parity exchange rate is the exchange rate based on the purchasing power parity ppp of a currency relative to a selected standard usually the united states dollar this is a comparative and theoretical exchange rate the only way to directly realize this rate is to sell an entire cpi basket in one country convert the cash at the currency market rate  then rebuy that same basket of goods in the other country with the converted cash going from country to country the distribution of prices within the basket will vary typically nontradable purchases will consume a greater proportion of the baskets total cost in the higher gdp country per the balassasamuelson effect the ranking of countries may differ significantly based on which method is used the current exchange rate method converts the value of goods and services using global currency exchange rates the method can offer better indications of a countrys international purchasing power for instance if  of gdp is being spent on buying hitech foreign arms the number of weapons purchased is entirely governed by current exchange rates since arms are a traded product bought on the international market there is no meaningful local price distinct from the international price for high technology goods the ppp method of gdp conversion is more relevant to nontraded goods and services in the above example if hitech weapons are to be produced internally their amount will be governed by gdpppp rather than nominal gdp there is a clear pattern of the purchasing power parity method decreasing the disparity in gdp between high and low income gdp countries as compared to the current exchange rate method this finding is called the penn effect for more information see measures of national income and output standard of living and gdp wealth distribution and externalitiesedit gdp per capita is often used as an indicator of living standards the major advantage of gdp per capita as an indicator of standard of living is that it is measured frequently widely and consistently it is measured frequently in that most countries provide information on gdp on a quarterly basis allowing trends to be seen quickly it is measured widely in that some measure of gdp is available for almost every country in the world allowing intercountry comparisons it is measured consistently in that the technical definition of gdp is relatively consistent among countries gdp does not include several factors that influence the standard of living in particular it fails to account for externalities – economic growth may entail an increase in negative externalities that are not directly measured in gdp increased industrial output might grow gdp but any pollution is not counted nonmarket transactions– gdp excludes activities that are not provided through the market such as household production bartering of goods and services and volunteer or unpaid services nonmonetary economy– gdp omits economies where no money comes into play at all resulting in inaccurate or abnormally low gdp figures for example in countries with major business transactions occurring informally portions of local economy are not easily registered bartering may be more prominent than the use of money even extending to services quality improvements and inclusion of new products– by not fully adjusting for quality improvements and new products gdp understates true economic growth for instance although computers today are less expensive and more powerful than computers from the past gdp treats them as the same products by only accounting for the monetary value the introduction of new products is also difficult to measure accurately and is not reflected in gdp despite the fact that it may increase the standard of living for example even the richest person in  could not purchase standard products such as antibiotics and cell phones that an average consumer can buy today since such modern conveniences did not exist then sustainability of growth– gdp is a measurement of economic historic activity and is not necessarily a projection wealth distribution – gdp does not account for variances in incomes of various demographic groups see income inequality metrics for discussion of a variety of inequalitybased economic measures it can be argued that gdp per capita as an indicator standard of living is correlated with these factors capturing them indirectly as a result gdp per capita as a standard of living is a continued usage because most people have a fairly accurate idea of what it is and know it is tough to come up with quantitative measures for such constructs as happiness quality of life and wellbeing limitations and criticismsedit this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it february  limitations at introductionedit simon kuznets the economist who developed the first comprehensive set of measures of national income stated in his first report to the us congress in  in a section titled uses and abuses of national income measurements the valuable capacity of the human mind to simplify a complex situation in a compact characterization becomes dangerous when not controlled in terms of definitely stated criteria with quantitative measurements especially the definiteness of the result suggests often misleadingly a precision and simplicity in the outlines of the object measured measurements of national income are subject to this type of illusion and resulting abuse especially since they deal with matters that are the center of conflict of opposing social groups where the effectiveness of an argument is often contingent upon oversimplification  all these qualifications upon estimates of national income as an index of productivity are just as important when income measurements are interpreted from the point of view of economic welfare but in the latter case additional difficulties will be suggested to anyone who wants to penetrate below the surface of total figures and market values economic welfare cannot be adequately measured unless the personal distribution of income is known and no income measurement undertakes to estimate the reverse side of income that is the intensity and unpleasantness of effort going into the earning of income the welfare of a nation can therefore scarcely be inferred from a measurement of national income as defined above in  kuznets stated distinctions must be kept in mind between quantity and quality of growth between costs and returns and between the short and long run goals for more growth should specify more growth of what and for what further criticismsedit ever since the development of gdp multiple observers have pointed out limitations of using gdp as the overarching measure of economic and social progress many environmentalists argue that gdp is a poor measure of social progress because it does not take into account harm to the environment although a high or rising level of gdp is often associated with increased economic and social progress within a country a number of scholars have pointed out that this does not necessarily play out in many instances for example jean drèze and amartya sen have pointed out that an increase in gdp or in gdp growth does not necessarily lead to a higher standard of living particularly in areas such as healthcare and education another important area that does not necessarily improve along with gdp is political liberty which is most notable in china where gdp growth is strong yet political liberties are heavily restricted gdp does not account for the distribution of income among the residents of a country because gdp is merely an aggregate measure an economy may be highly developed or growing rapidly but also contain a wide gap between the rich and the poor in a society these inequalities often occur on the lines of race ethnicity gender religion or other minority status within countries this can lead to misleading characterizations of economic wellbeing if the income distribution is heavily skewed toward the high end as the poorer residents will not directly benefit from the overall level of wealth and income generated in their country even gdp per capita measures may have the same downside if inequality is high for example south africa during apartheid ranked high in terms of gdp per capita but the benefits of this immense wealth and income were not shared equally among the countrycitation needed gdp does not take into account the value of household and other unpaid work some including martha nussbaum argue that this value should be included in measuring gdp as household labor is largely a substitute for goods and services that would otherwise be purchased for value even under conservative estimates the value of unpaid labor in australia has been calculated to be over  of the countrys gdp a later study analyzed this value in other countries with results ranging from a low of about  in canada using conservative estimates to high of nearly  in the united kingdom using more liberal estimates for the united states the value was estimated to be between about  on the low end to nearly  on the high end depending on the methodology being used because many public policies are shaped by gdp calculations and by the related field of national accounts the noninclusion of unpaid work in calculating gdp can create distortions in public policy and some economists have advocated for changes in the way public policies are formed and implemented the uks natural capital committee highlighted the shortcomings of gdp in its advice to the uk government in  pointing out that gdp focuses on flows not stocks as a result an economy can run down its assets yet at the same time record high levels of gdp growth until a point is reached where the depleted assets act as a check on future growth they then went on to say that it is apparent that the recorded gdp growth rate overstates the sustainable growth rate broader measures of wellbeing and wealth are needed for this and there is a danger that shortterm decisions based solely on what is currently measured by national accounts may prove to be costly in the longterm proposals to overcome gdp limitationsedit in response to these and other limitations of using gdp alternative approaches have emerged in the s amartya sen and martha nussbaum developed the capability approach which focuses on the functional capabilities enjoyed by people within a country rather than the aggregate wealth held within a country these capabilities consist of the functions that a person is able to achieve in  mahbub ul haq a pakistani economist at the united nations introduced the human development index hdi the hdi is a composite index of life expectancy at birth adult literacy rate and standard of living measured as a logarithmic function of gdp adjusted to purchasing power parity in  john b cobb and herman daly introduced index of sustainable economic welfare isew by taking into account various other factors such as consumption of nonrenewable resources and degradation of the environment the new formula deducted from gdp personal consumption  public nondefensive expenditures  private defensive expenditures  capital formation  services from domestic labour  costs of environmental degradation  depreciation of natural capital in  med jones an american economist at the international institute of management introduced the first secular gross national happiness index aka gross national wellbeing framework and index to complement gdp economics with additional seven dimensions including environment education and government work social and health mental and physical indicators the proposal was inspired by the king of bhutans gnh philosophy in  the european union released a

upstream business segment consists of integrated liquid natural gas lng operations from liquefaction to gasification as well as a power generation business and stakes in multiple photovoltaic developers totals french origins give the company an advantage over many western oil majors as it has larger reserve and production bases in young highyield regions like africa and the middle east total is even one of the few companies that has operations in iran these regions however are associated with high risk because of their political violence and associations with terrorists for the most part its familiarity with regional cultures and the dependence of impoverished nations on international capital has allowed total to avoid problems in these regions totals lack of experience across

increase cooperation with china oil majors  french origins give total a geopolitical advantage in africa and the middle east  but put it at a disadvantage in latin america  a focus on growing its upstream activities will allow total to avoid volatile refining margins  canadian climate change regulations threaten totals oil sands projects  total is dipping its hand in the renewable energy pool  competition  notes the downstream portion of the oil and gas industry involving chemicals and refining is a traditionally volatile sector as margins can shift in two directions changing input costs oil prices and changing product prices for this reason total had been focusing much of its capital expenditures on upstream development in a price environment where a barrel of oil traded at over  the margins for this sector were at historical highs these high oil prices however have combined with worries about climate change to threaten significant portions of totals business for example costs for the companys canadian oil sands operations will skyrocket if that countrys proposed greenhouse gas emissions mandates are passed and the oil sands projects are far less profitable in an environment where oil prices are soft since hitting a barrel of oil hit record highs of over  dollars during the summer of  there has been a significant pull back in the price bottoming out at roughly  a barrel during the depths of the recession and by the beginning of  had returned to trade between a range of  but still well off its highs economic and environmental worries are also driving the development of a booming alternative energy sector and total is one of the few oil majors that has jumped on the bandwagon to use and develop clean energy alternatives like wind solar and tidal totals competitors are the other international oil majors including exxon mobil conocophillips bp chevron royal dutch shell and eni spa another aspect of total is its diversification the company produces fertilizers and petrochemicals and makes specialty chemicals for a variety of markets total is also involved in performance polymers and products that are made from petroleum the fact that total pumps its own crude for these purposes help cuts costs while providing revenue streams business and financials francebased total sa tot previously known as total fina elf sa is among the top five publicly traded global integrated oil and gas companies based on production volumes proved reserves and market capitalization the companys operations can be divided into upstream exploration and production downstream refining and marketing and chemical businesses fiscal year  summary in  totals net income was  billion a  increase from the previous year with sales of  billion a  increase from the previous year this increase was driven by increased global demand for oil and natural gas products as well as increased refining margins during the year brent oil price averaged at b a  increase compared to  total produced an average of  thousand boed a  increase from the previous year totals upstream business also consists of a gas and power segment which encompasses natural gas and liquid natural gas lng operations power generation and sales and new renewable energies in a boost to its upstream activities on january   total completed the purchase of dc energy services for  million dollars the dc energy has seven primary locations in western and northern canada and adds  pieces of rental equipment  heavy trucks and  trailers to totals business base the company is a leader in the lng segment lng is used mainly as a transportation medium for natural gas which is difficult to move via pipeline and not economical to move via tanker total is a major worldwide distributor of natural gas it is the number two gas distributor in the uk number one in france and owns the largest liquefaction facility in the world located in indonesia regasification of lng is used to turn the liquid form back to the usable gas form and is a relatively young technology that is necessary to make lng usable total has interestes in three major regasification terminals  one in the large us market and two in the emerging markets of mexico and india total believes these terminals will give it access to key growth markets as research firm sanford c bernstein estimates global demand for lng to grow by  percent in  totals electricity business uses cogeneration facilities as well as highefficiency gas plants for power generation the company sells electricity in the middle east south america and asia and is the secondlargest power company in argentina it also uses wind turbines and has a  stake in european solar panel vendor photovoltech the solar sector in particular is becoming increasingly competitive with companies like sunpower and first solar reaching efficiencies of  and manufacturing costs as low as  per watt respectively currently photovoltechs panels have  efficiencies  around the industry average  but is working with europes interuniversity microelectronics center to research ways of making their cells more costefficient totals solar production capacity is less than  mw but the company is planning to reach  mw by  total has the additional advantages of being based in europe a highgrowth region for solar and having far more money than most other photovoltaics manufacturers to spend on expansion and rd being one of the oil supermajors chemicals is totals lowestmargins segment but many investors often worry that because it has the most employees it will get unnecessary managerial attention due to frances laborcentric culture trends and forces media scrutiny affects consumer confidence in the midst of controversy surrounding bp and transoceans oil spill and adding to the negative image of the oil industry on june   a uk jury found a joint venture owned by total and chevron corporation cvx in which total had majority stake as well as an operating role to be guilty of failing to prevent a fire at the buncefield depot in december  negligence in maintenance prevented alarms from triggering when fuel tanks were filled over a certain level resulting in the injury of  people safety has been increasingly more important for oil companiesregulators will become more strict and companies will become more scrutinized foreign exchange risk almost all of totals sales are done in dollars the international currency of the oil and natural gas markets but most of totals operating expenses and income taxes are denominated in euros thus adverse fluctuations between the two currencies could lead to lower booked income and revenue the current greek debt crisis has had the effect of weakening the euro which in turn means that when total converts its revenue back into euros it books a much larger value and its proportional cost of operating expenses decrease oil product price volatility the price of a barrel of oil and natural gas prices have fluctuated wildly over the past two years reaching highs of  in mid  before plummeting to  however despite the volatility present in these prices total has not significantly collared the price that it receives for its product by entering into derivative agreements that set a floor and a ceiling for a certain percentage of totals production as a result even a  decrease in crude oil would have the effect of reducing profits by  million euros  thus the price of oil is hugely important to the bottom line of the company totals production distribution allows it to minimize exposure to mature regions  but increases political risk total has invested most of its productive energies in europe africa and the middle east  with africa and the middle east accounting for over half of total production total sa regional production breakdown for  africa north america south america asiapacific europe middle east rest of world total production liquids mbbld         natural gas mcfd         combined liquids and gasmboeday         africa is a relatively young development region for oil and gas explorers in the past most of the worlds oil production came from areas like north america and europe as well as cartelcontrolled opec nations since these regions have started to mature especially north america and europe areas where output is uncontrolled and publiclytraded oil companies can drill to their hearts content exploration in africa and the middle east has increased as has the overall output of the regions while its true that a large portion of totals production comes from maturing european markets like the north sea areas where the company has seen declining production and will need to exit to increase production the lions share of the its holdings are in highoutput highpotential areas in africa and the middle east the tradeoff however is that the countries in these regions are often in states of political turmoil or are breeding grounds for islamic terrorists internal disturbance and hostility toward outsiders can lead to violence damaging costly equipment or killing employees furthermore many of these countries see nearconstant regime changes and each time this happens total runs a risk that its assets will be seized by the new government with plans to nationalizethe countrys oil output total seeks to increase cooperation with china oil majors in a policy that has been met with failures before total sa ceo christophe de margerie has sought to cooperate with rising chinese oil majors rather than strictly competing with them in pursuing the policy total has entered into several agreements around the world in politically sensitive regions as one example total will make a joint bid with cnpc to develop a heavyoil block in venezuelas carabobo region where each block is estimated to cost between  and  billion the two are also collaborating on developing fields in iran venezuela and northern china however in the past the two companies have had difficulty in joint ventures total and cnpc were also trying to work out a deal to develop irans giant south pars field before the deal broke down cnpc then effectively replaced total and signed a deal with iran to develop the field this highlights the riskreward inherent in the strategy that total is pursuing they could gain access to more fields with their combined resources but at the same time as the china oil majors grow they could also threaten the position of total by serveing as direct competitors and total may be pushed aside as in the development of the iranian south pars field french origins give total a geopolitical advantage in africa and the middle east historically the french have had a strong colonizing influence in africa and parts of asia the french have done business in these regions ever since building a stronger understanding of local cultures than most western firms have furthermore the french government has had the tendency to speak out against the westerninfluenced wars that have in recent years swept the middle east because of this many governments in these regions are much more keen on doing business with the french than with americans or the british totals french origin gives it access to oilrich regions that oil majors from other countries cannot or do not enter for example conocophillips sees  of its crude oil production come from the us and europe and only  come from africa and the middle east the proportion is approximately reversed for total with well over half the companys liquids production coming from africa and the middle east furthermore total has operations in iran a country that has been denounced by even the french government as well as myanmar a country that is rife with political violence in july  however total announced that it would freeze further investment in iran as the countrys missile tests created too much controversy for the company to continue to defy french sanctions but put it at a disadvantage in latin america the french did little expanding in latin america another hotspot of oil exploration and production especially deepwater oil exploration total has had little experience dealing with the finer points of latin american politicsunlike american competitors like exxon mobil and chevron though latin america like africa is often plagued by the political instability of developing nations african nations tend to lack the capital necessary to develop their own oil fields countries like venezuela however have the resources to maintain their own fields as their economies have been built on commodities like bananas and sugar cane these nations have fewer qualms about nationalizing assets within the country that are owned by outsiders in  for example venezuelas statecontrolled oil company pdvsa took control of totals  bpd jusepin oil field while american companies like exxon mobil faced the same problem the uss proximity to these countries and its strength as one of their trading partners makes it easier for american companies to fight such nationalist actions and get results  the reason that exxon and conocophillips went to court with venezuela while shell and total simply accepted meager compensation and walked away a focus on growing its upstream activities will allow total to avoid volatile refining margins in  total spent € billion on investing in growing its upstream segment by contrast the company invested € billion in its refining and marketing segment and € billion in its chemicals segment together totaling around a quarter of upstream spending total is spending more on developing its exploration and production segment because oil prices have been rising and the company predicts they will continue to rise oil and gas prices have fluctuated heavily over the past few years though the most recent trend is a rise in prices with a barrel of oil trading in international markets a day after the  new year at just over  because both are nonrenewable forms of energy they will eventually run out slowing discoveries of new sources combined with increasing demand has led to rising prices  and to speculation that production is approaching peak oil quantities whether this is true or not oil and gas are commodities one companys oil can only be differentiated from another companys oil based on price so when oil prices are high all vendors of crude benefit from larger margins on the flip side companies that earn most of their revenue from downstream operations tend to see margins shrink when oil prices rise as crude oil is the main input for refined petroleum products refining margins tend to be volatile because oil the main input is a commodity but so are the diesel gasoline and jet fuels that are produced these products also are prone to cyclical prices as higher demand tends to raise prices as does refining undercapacity because margins for refined products change from two sides they can be very unpredictable so totals investment in the more profitable more predictable upstream market will allow it to decrease its reliance on refining revenues canadian climate change regulations threaten totals oil sands projects total has interests in two major oil sands in alberta canada  one of which is worth  billion and both of which are expected to produce over  bpd in their first phases these investments have already proven expensive and will take years to develop but canadian climate change legislation threatens to make these projects even costlier in march of  john baird the environment minister of canada announced proposals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions for industrial projects by  by   which includes oil sands development the oil sands are the fastestgrowing source of greenhouse gases in canada and emissions control methods would be extremely costly for total to implement since canada has yet to meet the kyoto protocol reductions it agreed to they are likely targets for further emissions restrictions  and would be less profitable for total to develop total is dipping its hand in the renewable energy pool fossil fuels though highly costefficient forms of energy are heavy polluters when burned increasing environmental concern over environmental degradation and global climate change is fueling a consumerdriven push away from dirty fuels toward such cleaner ones as biodiesel ethanol and cellulosic ethanol especially in developed politicallyprogressive regions like europe and now the us this could lead to a longterm decrease in the demand for oil and gas total is one of the few oil majors bp and chevron being the others to invest in developing alternative energies like solar wind and even tidal the company has also introduced a petroleum based fuel called evolution that is supposed to produce lower emissions and increase fuel efficiency in cars on november   total announced the construction a of photovoltaic panel production and assembly unit at composite park in france the plant will increase totals production by  mwp per year around  photovoltaic panels with the two production lines housed in the plant construction begins early  and the first line is expected to bring  mwp when it is finished by
