theater review ‘six degrees of separation’ nyc city life performing arts theater review ‘six degrees of separation’ what we are willing to believe and why by judd hollander  may   at  pm last updated june    pm ouisa allison janney finds a wouldbe son in the stranger paul corey hawkins who comes into her life in six degrees of separation joan marcus new york—there’s a fine line between believing the truth of a situation and wanting to believe it  the powerful broadway revival of john guare’s  drama “six degrees of separation” based on a true story examines that fine line one night in their comfortable new york apartment husband and wife flan john benjamin hickey and ouisa allison janney and their friend geoffrey michael siberry are interrupted by the sudden arrival of paul corey hawkins a young man who has been attacked and stabbed brought in by their doorman tony carlin paul claims to be a classmate of flan and ouisa’s children and since he knew they lived nearby this was the first place he thought to go any serious attempt to judge the different characters is left up to the audience paul knows many details about their family—down to the kandinsky painting hanging in their home flan and ouisa take him in treat his wounds and offer him a place to stay however as is soon discovered just about everything paul says is a lie including his claim to be the son of the famous actor sidney poitier who is working on the movie version of the broadway musical “cats” as the play unfolds it becomes apparent that paul doesn’t pull his scams with financial gain in mind—though he does begrudgingly take  when offered rather he demonstrates an almost pathological need to be one of the “beautiful people” and enjoy the advantages he feels he would never experience otherwise coupled with this need is paul’s desire to see just how much he can actually get away with it’s a weakness that ultimately backfires on him l–r paul corey hawkins cons his way into the lives of the affluent couple flan john benjamin hickey and ouisa allison janney while their friend geoffrey michael siberry looks on in “six degrees of separation” joan marcus the entire play turns on the question of what people want to believe why would flan ouisa and their friends who were also the victims of paul’s lies willingly accept this man into their homes without first checking with their children to see if his story is true paul claims to know all of them after all  the children’s eventual comments on the subject reveal more than a bit of contempt for their elders—not only in how their parents were so easily duped but also in how they feel treated by them in general yet one has to ask if the kids would have been the wiser if paul had targeted them  an interesting irony is that the adults have an easier time relating to paul than they do to their own children which points back to the undercurrent that paul’s stories are ones these adults want to believe as time goes on though and one sees paul creating one story after another the entire effect takes on a much more ominous meaning this comes into play when paul spins his tales for a young couple peter mark kendall and sarah mezzanotte who can’t afford to lose what he takes from them lisa emery michael countryman allison janney ned eisenberg and john benjamin hickey in a scene from “six degrees of separation” joan marcus more significantly any serious attempt at judging the different characters is left up to the audience rather than those on stage we just like the parents are left to believe the best or the worst of people this especially applies to paul who goes from affable to desperate as the play progresses also coming into play in paul’s schemes is the almost unspoken question of race as it applies to those in flan and ouisa’s circle would they have so easily welcomed an unknown black man into their homes if he were not in a suit and tie and continually dropping the names of their kids and of his supposed lineage janney is excellent as ouisa a woman determined to ensure this entire episode does not simply become an afterdinner anecdote she demonstrates a deep passion to understand this man who comes from a world so different from her own hawkins plays the role of paul perfectly—a highly intelligent and driven yet selfdestructive young man who always sounds perfectly believable in whatever he says even when it’s apparent to the audience what the truth really is hickey does well as flan a man who just wants things to go back to the way they were read moretheater review ‘pacific overtures’ mark wendland’s set is nicely done with just the right mix of the tasteful and the ostentatious direction by trip cullman is strong he ably blends both humor and tension while never letting the characters seem anything less than real when all is said and done “six degrees of separation” will leave you asking if you’ll ever be able to trust others in the same way again even more importantly should you

sharetweetemail pinterest joan marcus we gave it an a if there’s one thing to be learned from the beautifully unsettling broadway revival of six degrees of separation it’s this there’s no expiration date on a cats joke nearly  years after john guare’s drama premiered the most absurd and absurdly funny thread isn’t that a clutch of wealthy manhattanites were hoodwinked by a sweettalking stranger claiming to be sidney poitier’s son it’s that he promised them all parts in the movie version of cats — and they were thrilled “you went to cats you said it was an alltime low in a lifetime of theatergoing” spits tess colby minifie accusingly to her parents louisa aka ouisa seventime emmy winner allison janney absolutely sublime and flanders aka flan the normal heart tony winner john benjamin hickey “film is a different medium” ouisa sighs as for the rest of guare’s delicious social satire it’s aged nearly as well as the cats quips — far better than you’d expect considering that the title phrase is now firmly entrenched in our vernacular “i am bound to everyone on this planet by a trail of six people” says ouisa “it’s a profound thought” side note does anyone still play the resultant popculture parlor game “six degrees of kevin bacon” the way that ouisa and flan — and their friends — get fooled by paul straight outta compton’s corey hawkins appropriately mysterious the faux poitier provides plenty of comic fodder a faceoff with a hyperactive naked hustler the appearance of assorted sullen rancorous collegeage children sample insult “dad sometimes it is so obvious to me why mom left” the suspicious delivery of a pot of jam but there’s plenty of profundity as well in the span of  minutes ouisa goes from talking about touring south africa to see superpoor people to promising paul that she’ll take him under her wing teach him and love him she’s no longer content with her highstakes artdealer husband on the outside she is polished and buffed and shined to perfection — not a hair out of place in that shellacked east side matron bob but inside she’s “a collage of unaccountedfor brush strokes” in an argument with flan she asks him this question — one that

telephone interview “i’m actually a little nervous about it because i’ve been away from the theater for a bit but it’s what i love and i feel like it is what i was meant to do”ms janney said she found herself drawn to the conceit expressed in the play’s title as well as the details of the story“i love the idea of six degrees of separation — that we’re all connected somehow universally — and there are some really human things that drive this play with the con artist and the art” she said “it’s a lovely multilayered play that’s complex and i can’t wait to discover the character”the play was
