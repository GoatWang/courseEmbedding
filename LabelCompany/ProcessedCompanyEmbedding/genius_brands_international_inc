may    genius brands international gnus recently released a letter to shareholders from chairman  ceo andy heyward the complete letter followsdear shareholders and friendslast week genius brands made an important announcement regarding our upcoming animated series rainbow rangers and the team that will now be bringing this to the global marketplacerainbow rangers will be important becausethe  ranked kids network nickelodeon will be the broadcasterthe  toy company in the world mattel will be the master toy licensethe  creative team assembled for animated television series created by rob minkoff the director of disneys lion king shane morris the cowriter of disneys frozen and show run by elise allen the emmy nominated writer currently doing disney channels lion king spinoff lion guard i dont make such a statement lightly but to the best of my knowledge there has never been a team with the mega hit disney animated motion picture pedigree of this stature which has come together to create a new brandin addition to this winning tripod we have been joined by shelly hirsch as coexecutive producer shelly is the founder and ceo of beacon media the largest childrens media buying service in the us shelly will be a coexecutive producer of the series along with myself the significance of shelly hirsch as part of our rainbow rangers series is the huge strategic insight that shelly brings to the table in successful content distribution and consumer product licensing as the single largest spender of kids media dollars shelly is the foremost authority on what makes kids programs succeed and their licensing business explode the tactics which shelly will help engineer to maximize the success of rainbow rangers cannot be overstatedsince announcing rainbow rangers pickup last week by nickelodeon we have been contacted by licensees of product across all the major categories from publishing to apparel and all points in between the licensing community quickly smells a hot property and our expectations are that we will have deals written in virtually every major category with the tiffany licensees in each category by end of licensing show in las vegas at the end of this month in october we will be exhibiting rainbow rangers at brand licensing europe in london and we expect similar results from the international licensee community for those categories where we have not already done global licensesi share this with you because in the kids content business rainbow rangers represents the perfect stormbest in class creativebest in class distributionbest in class master toy licensebest in class licensee base this means that we expect the property will be on air and on shelf with content and consumer products in virtually every major category including toys electronics video games apparel publishing music stationary party goods school supplies backpacks bedding costumes role play and confections to name a few strawberry shortcake had over  licensees globally and ultimately did  billion dollars of retail sales each and every licensee pays an advance and provides a monetary guarantee for the rights to license our characters and put it on their products with every single item of every single product sold a percentage of the sale price is paid to genius brands as a royaltyof course nobody can guarantee what property becomes the next billion dollar brand nevertheless every year there is another power rangers another strawberry shortcake another ninja turtles pokemon barney or paw patrol we think that rainbow rangers has every chance to become such a property this month for the first time genius brands will begin hosting quarterly earnings conference calls as a means to explain our performance and highlight key trends and activity within the business we are excited with what we are seeing and we believe our shareholders will be as well i have always said that it takes three years from the time the first property is created until it is developed produced and on the screen with consumer products on shelf now we are just beginning to see the fruits of that processadding to the excitement of rainbow rangersllama llama will be delivered to netflix in october and product will begin to appear on shelf at retail this th quarterspacepop will go into its second season this th quarter with more product more retail distribution
