announce virtaus a new supply chain finance solution kaitlyn mcavoy  november    am  categories finance industry news technology trade financing  tags general news l einvoicing and purchasetopay solution provider basware and europeanfocused alternative asset manager arrowgrass capital partners llp have teamed up to introduce a new company virtaus which spend matters uk has called “a significant new supply chain finance product” in basware and arrowgrass’ words “virtaus enables any bb network such as the basware commerce network to offer innovative new financing services basware advance — the first innovation of virtaus — is a new powerful online solution that allows small and medium enterprises to receive early payment for invoices and to gain better control and management of their cash flow” managing supply chain risk the intersection of contract “invisibility” and risk management be afraid be very afraid virtaus will manage basware advance which can help organizations gain visibility into the payment process offering better control over cash flow basware ceo esa tihilä said in the press release that with realtime and flexible financing alternatives suppliers and buyers will benefit from being able to optimize cash and working capital possibly leading to further investment and growth “virtaus the financing engine and joint venture between basware and arrowgrass has been created to offer financing across the open basware commerce network connecting over  million organizations globally today offering a fresh easy and online alternative to traditional lending options” esa said peter smith chief research officer and managing director of spend matters ukeurope expanded on the news “but the key point is that this is not dependent on any agreement from the buyer or indeed even on the invoice being approved at the point of financing that differentiates advance from most scf offerings basware and arrowgrass presumably are taking the risk that the invoice may not be authorised or paid — presumably the supplier would then have to be chased to recover the money but in the usual situation when the buyer pays after   days or whenever that money flows back to basware so again there is some risk there if the buyer does not pay to terms” you can also check out peter’s coverage of this announcement basware advance – an innovative new
