are irrelevant and fail to reach the best possible responder with this feature users who are paged have the ability to route an existing incident to individual users teams of users andor escalation policies rather than routing obscure confusing alerts via email manual incident creation provides the ability to notify the right people or teams and have them immediately focused on the incident with a single click with this feature users explain the parent problem and synthesize oneoff noisy alerts into a single comprehensive incident delivered directly to the developers and other experts who can take action victorops’ manual incident creation and manual rerouting features are available in both standard and enterprise editions of the victorops product they enable users to manually create new
