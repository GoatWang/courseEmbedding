of  bcategory breakdown a sales  marketing b costs  contract b complaints  service b bbb rating overviewfounded in  ironwood payments iwpmtscom is a merchant account provider that was created via the acquisition of elitepay global‘s merchant portfolio the owners of ironwood financial ironwood payments’s parent company did not realize at the time of purchase that there were severe issues with the structure culture and business practices of elitepay global as a result ironwood payments received a high number of complaints over approximately one year that were similar to the complaints filed against elitepay global our rating for ironwood payments was very low during this period due to the company’s prior dealings with elitepay global documented proof that many of ironwood’s employees were former elitepay global employees and many complaints that described exorbitant leasing fees and deceptive sales tacticseventually ironwood hired a third party to conduct a full review of the company’s practices and suggest necessary changes ironwood also began to reach out directly to dissatisfied merchants and attempt to resolve their issues ironwood has contacted cpo to offer a significant amount of background information about the company and insight into its practices and cpo has separately verified as much of this information as possible cpo is now satisfied that ironwood payments has severed all ties with elitepay global and is committed to a total reform of its business practices in fact ironwood payments has taken proactive steps documented in this review to become a highly transparent and dependable merchant account providerhowever it is worth noting that in december  a class action lawsuit was filed against ironwood financial in illinois northern district court this complaint accuses ironwood of secretly recording phone calls in which merchants disclosed sensitive financial information and it also names andy bentley brian bentley adam bentley fifth third bank first data vantiv wells fargo and international payment services as defendants the plaintiffs are seeking  per violation plus attorney fees the lawsuit’s case number is cv and it can also be found under searches for “wang et al v wells fargo na et al” ironwood believes that it will successfully defend the suit this suit appears to be a remnant of the company’s holdover business practices from elitepay global and does not appear to be reflective of ironwood’s current conductironwood financial llc is headquartered in at  west oxford loop suite  oxford mississippi  ironwood

telemarketing or independent sales agents to sell its products the company promotes interchangeplus pricing but will offer tiered pricing if merchants request it ironwood also clearly displays the cost of each piece of processing hardware which can be purchased outright purchased in installments or rented for a fixed monthly cost ironwood has done away with longterm equipment leases and does not plan to partner with equipment leasing companies such as northern leasing systems in the futureironwood payments does not list specific pertransaction pricing on its website but its wemployed sales representatives are trained to disclose all rates and fees these practices constitute a dramatic turnaround for the company’s sales approach and have resulted in an equally striking decrease in complaints we will assign ironwood an “a” in this section because the processes it has implemented are worthy of an “a” rating but we will continue to monitor its performance very closelyphillip’s top

merchants to keep purchased equipment sell the equipment back to ironwood or terminate their rental agreements with no further cost these terms offer merchants a great deal of flexibility and do not expose merchants to exorbitant cancellation feeswe are currently able to locate a handful of merchant complaints about ironwood’s contract terms but all of these complaints are related to the contract terms that the company offered prior to its restructuring by all accounts these terms were not competitive within the industry and it is likely that some merchants are still stuck in longterm equipment leases they signed during that period we will assign ironwood a “b” rating in this section to reflect the fact that its contract terms are highly transparent and flexible but that this was

the company has made a serious effort to improve its online reputation by contacting complainants and resolving their issues directly the reviews that are currently available are generally more than four months old and can only be found by looking through several merchant and employee review websites some of them describe exorbitant fees and longterm leases that would negatively impact any company’s score however the total absence of complaints in recent months indicates that ironwood’s efforts at reformation have paid off ironwood receives a “b” rating in this section to reflect its

have assigned ironwood payments a “b” rating at this time due to its sharply reduced complaint total the company still has some complaints trickling in from its early days and it will need to continue

me only for  and a  attorney fee along with hours on the phone and frustration don’t use them they are unethical and liars i will research more before i ever make a move from my current processorironwood payments response “thank you for your feedback we would like to be of assistance to you and help you resolve your issue we would encourage you to call the ironwood customer service department at  and ask to speak with a manager we look forward to helping you” ironwood attempted to resolve the complaint above but the merchant declined to participatereplyi was approached by coutney fightmaster on march   at my restaurant business i always been approached by different companies offering their services but i listened to her sales pitch she was offering a terminal that you can go up to tables and have customers sign on the spot and that were supporting the chip integration then she proceeded to tell me how they have flat rates for the credit card processing fees and proceeded to compare my current credit card processor and her prices her claim after she did calculations was that i would be paying about  less that my current processor i thought it would be a good deal since a lot of my transactions are credit cards so i went ahead and gave her my information and i asked her if i wasn’t happy with it after a month i could cancel and she said yes she made a mistake in the application since she used my middle name instead of my first name so she had me sign another contract which i thought was the same a couple of days later i received the equipment and then i received a letter on the mail saying that my contract was noncancellable my heart sank and i immediately thought i had made a huge mistake i immediately called her and got no response i called customer service and they told me i was basically stuck because i should have read the contract since it clearly said it was non cancelable i then thought about the second contract she sent me that i thought it was to correct my name issue the lady over the phone was super rude to me and told that there is no way out of this then i proceeded to sent courtney some texts asking her what was going on and how come no one had told me or called me on what to do next i got no response from her so i called customer service again they told me that everything was fine but by that time i had already gotten two charges for the rentals of two terminals which are chip integrated but are hard to use i told them i needed to integrate them to my pos to which they responded they had been trying to get in contact with after i called squirrel systems which is the company that runs my pos they told me that they hadn’t gotten a call from them so they have me bouncing around from person to person and courtney finally calls back and says she’s been out sick i tell her that i want out and she tells me she is going to make it work and get everything fixed that my pos is the one not cooperating after several email and calls and texts and six weeks after they change my pos system but the chip machines are still not compatible with it so it means that i got them for nothing there is no way that i can reconcile my payments with the pos and the card machine so i’m basically stuck with two useless machines even the people that work at squirrel systems say it can’t be done my pos has their credit card that cost me over  a month my pos is integrated with their software but are still not chip compliant i wait to see how much my charge is going to be and to my surprise it is over  which is  over what i was paying before i am extremely unhappy with their customer service and the way they have handled the whole process i feel like a complete idiot for even giving them the time of day to hear their sales pitch i believe they are taking advantage of small businesses and they should not be allowed to do business i have tried to talk to chris ligan a supervisor but he never responds to my voicemails or emails they are a horrible company and i have constant anxiety for getting suckered into anything with themreplybeen in business for  years and this is by far the worst processing company out there not just did they get me to sign up with them and promise me that they would save me an average of  per month they use a leasing company called northern leasing for the verifone stand a lone terminal so now i’m fighting  company’s one to break the lease agreement and the other to break the  year agreement what a bunch of bs both of these companies should be out of business if
