marketmar  about jernigan capital jcap apbk capital special situations portfolio strategy macro commoditiessummaryjernigan capital was founded by dean jernigan former ceo of cubesmart and storage usa the company aims to refinance riskier loans that are coming due with highyield structured deals the reit should generate better than average returns given the risk adjustment overview jernigan capital pendingjcap is tendering  million shares in its initial public offering which is set for the week of march  the stock is priced in the range of  per share and is expected to raise  million in capital jernigan is formed as a mortgagebased reit focused on lending to self storage facilities net proceeds from the ipo will go towards structure loan products to finance self storage facilities the final market cap of the company will be around  million jernigan is an interesting investment because of its founder dean jernigan a successful name in self storage reits investors looking to get in early on another success story should consider adding jernigan to their portfolio dean jernigan most reviews of reits will start off by examining and analyzing capital structure investment prospects and yield outlook but this stock is different the most important factor for jernigan is dean jernigan dean is a veteran of the industry and served as ceo of both cubesmart nysecube and storage usa which was purchased by ge capital nysege in his latest venture the goal is not to launch or build a selfstorage company rather he is lending money to unit owneroperators the primary driver behind the new business is the  billion in commercial mortgagebacked security loans that come due within the next five years refinancing these loans will present a great opportunity for experienced lenders who could create value not only though loan interest but also providing industry expertise the company will focus on lending to a market niche units in the large metro areas with higher loantovalue ratios these units typically struggle to finance loans with traditional lenders current prospects proceeds from the ipo have already been spent not literally however jernigan has been working since october to secure term sheets with several project sites the following list shows prospective candidates for financing source jernigan s the reit current term sheets appear to consistently carry an interest rate of  with many deals also including  equity participation these deals should translate to excellent cash flow for the company the question will be how will the market value this company once the cash flow starts coming in at  interest rate and half of the company owner by insiders the market would command about a  dividend yield assuming ownership interest covers the companys operating expenses if the company can produce excess equity cash flow it may push current yield up slightly toward  source jernigan s market risks the big question is how will the rest of the market respond to jernigan right now a  yield on self storage reits is above average however jernigan is lending to a riskier subset of the market therefore risk adjusted yield appears to be inline with expectations nevertheless investors might not see it that way there are two other possibilities first they may find a tremendous amount of confidence in jernigan and drive the yield down by inflating the stock price compared to the current offering the other option is investors may not know how to price the risk and drive yield up and stock price down until the company has some proven operating history in any event the investment prospect is solid in scenario  investors get an outstanding dividend with limited price movement in the underlying stock  win in scenario  stock price is driven up investors can take shortterm gains and wait for stabilization  win and in scenario  investors can cost average the purchase price of the stock after a dip command a higher interest rate and wait for stabilization  win  with or without eventual stabilization summary jernigan is structured to be a very attractive reit and it clearly has very knowledgeable and proven leadership behind it the self storage industry has been booming over the past decade outperforming most other reit categories adding jernigan to any reit portfolio is an excellent investment play disclosure the author has no

media financial tech mom  pops reits operations auctions about contact write this blog ← previous post next post → former cubesmart ceo dean jernigan jumps into selfstorage lending business alexander harris january    dean jernigan might have retired recently from the top spot at cubesmart lp but the industry veteran isn’t finished working in the selfstorage sector in fact he’s looking to lend millions of dollars to selfstorage operators following his longplanned exit as ceo of publicly traded selfstorage reit cubesmart jernigan just launched his new venture jernigan capital llc “i’m still a young guy” the yearold jernigan told the storage facilitator “i stay very active and have no interest in retiring storage has been my life for  years now” from borrower to lender jernigan capital based in miami beach fl is a merchant bank and advisory firm catering solely to the selfstorage industry jernigan said he’s investing his own money to back the loans he’s also recruiting an institutional joint venture partner to contribute capital “i decided that all the things i’ve learned over the years being a borrower i’d like to use as a lender” jernigan said “i think i have a unique perspective to offer many people out there looking to build buy or refinance a facility” jernigan entered the selfstorage business in  after building his first facility in memphis tn the company jernigan founded storage usa went on to become the first publicly traded storage reit after ge capital bought that company jernigan started a development firm but it was only a few years later in  that he was recruited as ceo of ustorit now known as cubesmart with his latest venture jernigan will be looking to issue loans to operators starting at  million for singleasset acquisitions he said most loans should be in the  million to  million range jernigan expects to start signing deals in march in the meantime jernigan is working on hiring staff he already has assembled an advisory board to help vet deals spurred by cmbs one motivating factor jernigan cites for entering the lending side of the business is the  billion in selfstorage cmbs loans that are coming due over the next five years “many of these people will struggle to refinance their existing loan amounts” jernigan said why many selfstorage properties built between  and  didn’t perform as well as forecast he said and aren’t able to borrow much under traditional refinancing programs “my plan is to be a source for those people” jernigan said jernigan capital will be considering deals in the top  metro areas with higher loantovalue ratios than typical lenders would the firm also will provide loans for acquisitions and development projects “we are coming back into a development cycle and banks that have traditionally been lenders for people who are developing storage facilities are fairly hamstrung nowadays with all kinds of regulatory requirements” jernigan said for development loans jernigan will focus only on the top  metro areas keeping an eye on interest rates jernigan is monitoring the effect that rising interest rates will have on the selfstorage industry rates are creeping up and he said that’s likely to prevent the volume of acquisitions like the industry saw in  “potential sellers out there are going to have to adjust their expectations on values because the cost of capital is going up” said jernigan citing news that the year treasury yield is hovering above  percent a rise in interest rates will push up cap rates which will diminish the appetite for large portfolios jernigan said however he still expects the industry to keep consolidating one and twofacility deals “will continue in a pretty big way” jernigan said top photo courtesy of reitcom   tweet tags » dean jernigan

trust jernigan capital began trading on the new york stock exchange in  shares of the reit performed poorly in late  and early  similar to national storage affiliates nysensa i believe there is a buying opportunity right now for shares of jcap my last article mentioned jcap and focused on national storage affiliates in this article i will dive into the benefits and caveats of owning jcaps shares what is jernigan capital to answer questions about the selfstorage lending reit it helps to know about dean jernigan who is dean jernigan source jernigan capital dean jernigan knows storage dean knows lending dean knows what it takes to build a team of professionals that create value back in  mr jernigan started with a single property that grew into more than  properties at its peak if you invested in storage usa you know that the company returned over  compounded annual return while dean was at the helm storage usa was eventually sold to ge nysege capital while most wealthy individuals would hang it up after a smashing success like storage usa dean forged ahead and accepted another challenge in  dean jernigan was asked to lead a  billion reit in need of rebuilding and rebranding dean accepted the position of ceo at ustoreit and the company became cubesmart nysecube as i referenced in my previous article cubesmart performed very well coming out of the great recession and deans lasting impact continues to be a theme for cube and storage industry when mr jernigan left cube the company had grown to a  billion market capitalization considering the storage usa and cubesmart track record mr jernigan seems to have the midas touch in the industry source cubesmart with mr jernigan leading the way jernigan capital was formed in  it is laser focused on lending to selfstorage developers a significant amount of its value proposition is based on its expertise mr jernigan has passed his knowledge to a team of hard working professionals who are truly committed to their partners the industry and to their shareholders jcap went public in early  and raised over  million of funds to commit to storage developers how does the jernigan capital lending platform operate a typical selfstorage developer needs capital and expertise while industrial and multifamily developers can easily obtain capital and expertise in their respective areas a selfstorage developer doesnt have the same luxury municipalities tend to frown upon storage developers because they dont create as many jobs or as much tax revenue compared to an industrial plant or a multifamily apartment in addition banks are less excited about funding self storage for today i will focus more on the lending aspect of a selfstorage development source jernigan capital lending  in the s was described as such borrow capital at  lend at  and tee off at the golf course by pm shares of bank stocks ripped higher and ample selfstorage supply came to market while selfstorage industry leader public storage nysepsa grew relatively slowly in the s banks including jpmorgan chase nysejpm performed very well following the global financial crisis the invisible hand moved capital away from banks and into stable growers and dividend payers for example shares of jpm showed very little growth from  to  meanwhile a lack of selfstorage supply allowed storage reits such as psa to fill units raise rents and provide an excellent return to shareholders the rules have changed banks are no longer excited about lending to tech startups or firsttime selfstorage developer as they once were the tech bubble burst and the real estate market crashed bankers are no longer hanging out it in hot tubs with newt gingrich janeane garofalo and scottie pippen source simpsonsworldcom the great recession and the concurrent global financial crisis created new rules for lenders the basel accords doddfrank and other various regulations have altered the banking landscape in short it is more difficult for a developer to get capital for their projects solution borrow from jernigan capital a developer in colorado needs a line of credit to develop a stateoftheart selfstorage facility the facility is climate controlled and has all the necessary entitlements building permits and cumbersome details figured out the developer wants a development partner with deep pockets the developer knows dean jernigan because nearly everyone in the storage industry has heard his name so jernigan capital provides an  million development loan to fund the investment in colorado the multistory  unit facility will deliver  net rentable square feet of climatecontrolled storage to a highincome underserved area of suburban denver the same story has played out with jernigan capital providing a credit line earning  interest in addition to origination and underwriting fees paid to the company while the  interest rate is commensurate with the risk jernigan capital is taking there is an added bonus equity for every development that jcap funds a  equity interest in the development is given to it this is a very important concept for a jcap shareholder to understand essentially jernigan capital is loaning capital to become coowners in highquality facilities according to my model jcap has more than  of book value per share that is not accounted for in the current book value until a facility sells the equity that jernigan capital retains will not be reflected on the companys reported book value given the opportunity to deliver quality product to undersupplied markets developers have jumped on the opportunity to partner with jernigan capital source jernigan capital the lending model appeals to developers who need capital and expertise thus far jernigan capital has funded developments across the country in undersupplied markets there is not a single facility that has been funded without a rigorous analysis by mr jernigans team of experts in fact i have personally presented many funding opportunities to mr jernigans team and found it is extremely cautious it wants to fund highquality developments and so far it is doing just that similar to the growth model used by national storage affiliates jernigan is carving a niche in the storage world where nsa is taking advantage of the opportunity to acquire or partner with regional storage operators jcap is taking advantage of the opportunity to develop mr jernigan has spoken highly of national storage affiliates on conference calls and there could be a potential transaction between the two in the future as nsa continues to

access to capital has been obtained by jcap and should allow the company to grow quite quickly initially expenses at jernigan capital were higher than most sellside analysts anticipated this was addressed earlier in the year and for now expenses seem to be in line the jernigan capital lending model appears to be valid based on early results as the company has made progress on developments shares have turned around after hitting an alltime low earlier in the year jcaps shares are now trading above  valuation reits and banks often trade above book value for example many banks in the sp
