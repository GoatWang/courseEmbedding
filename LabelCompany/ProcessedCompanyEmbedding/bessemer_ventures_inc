grow our current portfolio we define cloud computing as the umbrella encompassing softwareasaservice saas platformsasaservice paas and infrastructureasaservice iaas historically we have been very active in the saas space and will continue to do so  however as cloud computing has expanded beyond just providing applications as a service so has our practice consumer with a history that includes

partners we believe that our long history and successful track record in cyber security provide us a key advantage in identifying and assisting the most important security startups – our investors have been involved in starting or funding over forty cyber security companies over the last two decades including eight ipos and  large acquisitions developer platforms in today’s programmable world developers embody many archetypes they are the creators that build our software the heroes that solve real issues the outlaws and jesters testing the limitations of cyber security as a result

software industryspecific cloud software companies don’t get as much attention as their horizontal brethren like salesforce or workday why it’s been assumed that the markets they serve are simply too small and sleepy we think that’s misguided while companies like guidewire athenahealth dealertrack veeva demandware and realpage don’t get much fanfare in the press they are solving real problems in each of their industries and they have quietly grown to become multibilliondollar publiclytraded companies this is just the beginning we’re convinced that many more industries—from banking to mining to agriculture—will be transformed by ditching their legacy vendors and migrating to the cloud infrastructure  bessemer has been investing in industryleading it infrastructure companies for close to

consider companies at many stages from seed to growth and across a number of sectors  software internet semiconductors storage communications and cleantech marketplaces as investors we believe that the best business model ever conceived could be the marketplace model  because marketplaces benefit from powerful network effects – supply and demand follow each other – it’s often a highstakes battle for leadership when one marketplace achieves undisputed leadership it can generate huge profits retain customers and keep competitors at bay we admire this winnertakeall or occasionally winnertakemost dynamic and are actively evaluating marketplace investments mobile bessemer’s history in communications spans more than three decades dating back to companies like ungermannbass which pioneered local area networking the term “lan” was actually coined in the living room of bvp’s neill brownstein  our investments have followed the rapid evolution of the communications landscape with many of our recent investments focused on the mobile space around the themes of mobile device penetration the consumer experiences they enable and the challenges these devices bring to operators space tech throughout history the exploration of new frontiers has yielded economic bounties in the forms of resources living space military advantage and scientific research  today our new frontiers lie in space which humanity must eventually colonize for minerals energy and new homelands as carl sagan observed “all civilizations become either spacefaring or extinct” video since the first cat video

making a blip on the silicon valley radar jeremy levine tells us why he decided it was a good bet by eb boyd minute readbessemer venture partners led pinterest’s series a financing last year the startup now has  in investments including a series b led by andreessen horowitz the pinboard site where users create visual collections of things they love has recently exploded into the public consciousness causing some observers to wonder what makes it so specialadvertisementjeremy levine who led bessemer’s investment tells us about all the ways pinterest can make money why it’s not thinking about that right now and why the company is more like google than you might imaginejeremy levine five or six years ago in the pretechcrunch era when most venture capitalists on sand hill road and in silicon valley wouldn’t touch a consumer company with a foot pole “consumer” was almost a dirty word we at bessemer got pretty excited about one idea that you could build a really valuable media company based entirely on usergenerated content we made four or five investments in  and every single one of them turned out to do pretty well yelp linkedin wikia and olx a global online classifieds and auction servicebut there was one particular kind of company that we were scouting for constantly–a usergenerated content media property around products because products are so wildly monetizable so at the beginning of  when i first learned about pinterest it struck a nerve immediately i said this is essentially the company i was looking for six year ago that’s why we jumped on it at a time it was probably not quite as intuitive or obvious as it is todayhow does a “productrelated usergenerated” media company like pinterest make moneythere are no specific ideas or projects in the works much to the pinterest team’s credit they subscribe to the facebook theory on how to build a really valuable business you don’t worry about monetization for a while you focus on one and only one thing which is building a product or a platform that consumers love to use over and over again if you have a rabid fan base among consumers eventually you’ll have so many ways of monetizing it that you just don’t worry about thatin fact if you focus too early on how to make money off of something like this then you start to build features designed to cater to the paying constituents like businesses brands advertisers at the expense of building more and more great stuff for consumers the chance that you overextend your consumers’ patience by not doing the things they want and ultimately turning them off and having them abandon your product is quite highadvertisementso until you feel superconfident that you’ve got a really durable relationship with your consumers it just makes no sense to focus on the monetizationso in the long run where do the opportunities to make money lieat a foot level anytime consumers are talking about products there’s inevitably some subset of those products they might buy and anytime consumers are playing around with or exploring or touching products they might buy the people who sell those products would love to be in on the conversation in some form and will pay for thatthere are lots of different ways you can imagine that happening cofounder ben silbermann and the team at pinterest are incredibly innovative and when they come to solve that problem i suspect they’re going to come up with some new and exciting ways of making it happen but they’re just not there yetbut it seems like so much on pinterest isn’t necessarily related to commerce does that theory really holdthe company i admire most on this particular dimension is google ninetyfive percent of the time we use google we’re doing things that are completely unmonetizable if i google you for example i’m not doing anything that’s going to lead to a purchase so most of the time it’s about research and informationadvertisementbut that’s fine google serves all those needs because if it didn’t we would get in the habit of searching somewhere else but in the  of instances where we’re searching for something commercial an airline ticket or a valentine’s day present for example google monetizes the heck out of those opportunities and their business model works incredibly well those searches are monetized so well that google’s more than happy to play a public service roll the other  of the time to help us find the information we’re looking forthat general idea applies to more and more online media sites the trick is–and this is one of the reasons i think a company like pinterest is best served by doing nothing but serving consumers–is that you have to serve lots of consumers a lot of times in order for the math to workpinterest’s success has kind of taken silicon valley by surprise what do you think they figured out that other folks here didn’t seethere are a whole bunch of core needs that make us human one of them as evidenced by facebook is this desire to communicate with each other another and it’s probably bigger or smaller depending on who you’re talking about is this desire to collect things as a kid growing up i was a baseball card collector why it makes no sense it’s irrational but you get this weird human enjoyment out of it there’s beanie babies or pokemon cards but i think it goes much beyond fads it gets at a underlying human desire what pinterest has done is create a platform that makes it really easy for people to exercise that particular muscleso where does pinterest go from herethe big ambition is that

objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate
