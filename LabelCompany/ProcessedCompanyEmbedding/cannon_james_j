cannon was an important factional leader in the american communist movement of the s sitting on the governing central executive committee of the party in alliance with william z foster a chicagobased group which looked to nativeborn american workers in the unions later in the decade cannon broke to an extent with foster heading up instead the partys legal defense arm international labor defense ild this organization served as a power base for cannon and his associates cannon was the workers communist partys candidate for congress in the new york th district in  cannons turn to trotskyismedit cannon and felix morrow with a bust of trotsky while in russia in  cannon read a critique of the direction of the communist international written by trotsky which the comintern had mistakenly circulated he was convinced of the arguments and attempted to form a left opposition within the workers communist party this resulted in his expulsion on october   together with his cothinkers max shachtman and martin abern outside of the communist party cannon shachtman and abern founded a new political party the communist league of america and began publishing the militant they came to see hitlers crushing of the communist movement in germany as evidence that the comintern was no longer able to play a revolutionary role internationally and with the remainder of the third international under stalins control unable to be internally reformed such that a new international and new parties were required concretely this meant that they no longer considered the communist league to be a faction of the communist party but rather considered it the nucleus of a future revolutionary party it also meant that they were far more inclined to look at working with other sections of the reviving socialist and workers movements from this point forth although the communist league had been a small organization — opponents dubbing cannon abern and shachtman three generals without an army — it had won a majority of the communist party branch in minneapolis and st paul therefore when the labor movement revived in the early s the communist league was well placed to put its ideas into action in the twin cities and through their influence in the international brotherhood of teamsters the union rapidly grew after an historic dispute in  cannon played a major role in this dispute directing the work of the communist league on a daily basis along with shachtman in december  the communist league of america merged with pacifist a j mustes american workers party to form the workers party of the united statescitation needed throughout  and into  the workers party was deeply divided over the socalled french turn the trotskyist organization in france had entered the social democratic party of that country — the section française de linternationale ouvrière sfio — and while maintaining themselves as an organized faction in the broader organization had made what were felt to be significant gains in advancing their programmatic goals and in winning adherents to their cause among young party members this tactic had been subsequently endorsed by trotsky himself but the american party was deeply divided over the advisability of the maneuver jim cannon was a forceful advocate of this tactic and was embroiled an innerparty fight to dissolve the workers party in favor of entry into the socialist party of america early in  a convention of the workers party finally decided that the organization should enter the sp this decision came at a cost however with a left wing faction led by hugo oehler refusing to join the socialists and exiting to form the revolutionary workers league a j muste became disgusted as well and left the radical political movement to return to his roots in the churchcitation needed the trotskyists stay inside the socialist party lasted only about a year from mid until mid admissions were made on an individual basis rather than en masse chicago attorney and devoted trotskyist albert goldman who entered the sp about a year earlier than his comrades launched a factionallyoriented newspaper called the socialist appeal while cannon headed west to tujunga california a suburb of los angeles to launch a western paper oriented to the trade union movement called labor action daytoday operations of the organized trotskyist faction in the socialist party during  were handled by shachtman and james burnham in new york while cannon made what he later deemed as futile attempts to participate in correspondence in the work of the new york center as the factional situation in the socialist party intensified early in  the decision was made by the hostile new york party organization to expel the trotskyists which took place late in the spring of  a large percentage of the spas youth organization the young peoples socialist league left with the expelled left wing james cannon was noted to have said that when the trotskyist were expelled from the socialist party that “they had expelled the heart of their party trotsky had won over all the serious young activists leaving only a dead husk” in the summer of  cannon returned to new york from california where he conducted organizational activities which led to the formation of the socialist workers party at a convention held from december   to january   jim cannon was elected as the groups first national secretarycitation neededjames cannon latter wrote that our round trip through the socialist party had resulted in gains all along the line we formed the socialist workers party and began once again an independent struggle with good prospects and good hopes cannon in the swpedit in addition to his activity in the socialist workers party cannon was a leading figure in the fourth international the international trotskyist movement and visited britain in  with the intention of aiding the unification of the competing british groups the result was a patched together unification the revolutionary socialist league which rapidly disintegrated in  shachtman left with a large part of the membership to form the workers party with shachtman and burnham arguing that the stalinists constituted a new bureaucratic class in the soviet union while cannon like trotsky felt that the soviet union should be defended despite stalins dictatorship and invasion of finland this dispute is recorded in cannons book the struggle for the proletarian party and in trotskys in defense of marxism nonetheless stalinists sought to punish both cannon and trotsky for their earlier defection from the stalincontrolled third international trotsky was killed by one of stalins nkvd agents and the cpusa supported the us governments prosecution of cannon and other american trotskyites under the smith act following the german invasion of the soviet union the largely sovietcontrolled cpusa started to support us entry into the war this gave the cpusa a common interest with the us government preparing to go to war as against cannons swp which was aiming to mobilize the working class against the war even after his conviction on the charge of conspiring to overthrow the government and his jailing cannons influence on the swp was strong and he wrote to party leaders regularly for example recommending a change the party line on the warsaw rising cannons book letters from prison contains many of these missives following the war cannon resumed leadership of the swp but this role declined after he left the post of national secretary in  to farrell dobbs cannon retired to california in the mids however he remained an active member of the partys political committee cannon was very much involved in the splits which developed in both the swp and the fi in  he took a leading role in guiding the public faction supported by the swp the international committee of the fourth international and supported the eventual reunification of the two sides in  which led to the formation of the united secretariat of the fourth international he took no part in the various tendency disputes that developed between  and  except to decry firmer organizational norms

served to radicalize the socialist party of america and brought cannon back to the organization he was an active participant in the left wing section of the socialist party an organized faction which sought to transform the spa into a revolutionary socialist organization in  he was a founding member of the communist labor party clp forerunner of the communist party of america cpa although he did not personally attend the chicago convention of the clp due to insufficient party tenure in the spa he was however a part of the clps leadership from its earliest days serving as district secretary of the clp for the states of kansas missouri and nebraska from the time of founding he was also the editor of the leftwing kansas city weekly workers world from  to  assuming the position when fellow kansas syndicalist earl browder was sent to prison for his previous antiwar activities in may  the clp merged with a section of the cpa headed by c e ruthenberg and cannon was elected as a member of the central executive committee of the new organization by the founding convention he worked variously as the st louis district organizer of the ucp in the summer of  and as editor of the organizations labor newspaper the toiler in october of that same year this brought cannon to new york city where he was able to regularly sit on the meetings of the central executive committee after merger of the ucp with the remaining cpa organization headed by charles dirba cannon was named the first subdistrict organizer of the unified organization for duluth minnesota cannon was on the executive board of the american labor alliance one of the underground cpas most important legal organizations intended to bring mainstream trade unionists into common cause with the persecuted underground communist movement in december  cannon delivered the keynote speech to the founding convention of the legal political party formed in parallel to the underground cpa the workers party of america wpa and was elected national chairman by that convention cannon was elected by the cec of the unified cpa as delegate of that organization to the enlarged plenum of the executive committee of the communist international ecci and as formal party representative to the red international of labor unions rilu leaving the usa in midmay  and arriving finally in moscow on june  he stayed on there as a delegate of the american party to the th world congress of the comintern where he was elected to the ecci presidium serving from august through november  back in america cannon was a member of the executive committee of the friends of soviet russia from  he was also a candidate of the wpa for the united states congress from the new york th district in  cannon remained on the cec of the wpa throughout this period on january   cannon was named assistant executive secretary of the workers party of america working under his faction rival ruthenberg he was the wpas candidate for governor of new york in  and again returned to moscow as a delegate of the party to the th enlarged plenum of ecci held in march and april  cannon was an important factional leader in the american communist movement of the s sitting on the governing central executive committee of the party in alliance with william z foster a chicagobased group which looked to nativeborn american workers in the unions later in the decade cannon broke to an extent with foster heading up instead the partys legal defense arm international labor defense ild this organization served as a power base for cannon and his associates cannon was the workers communist partys candidate for congress in the new york th district in  cannons turn to trotskyismedit cannon and felix morrow with a bust of trotsky while in russia in  cannon read a critique of the direction of the communist international written by trotsky which the comintern had mistakenly circulated he was convinced of the arguments and attempted to form a left opposition within the workers communist party this resulted in his expulsion on october   together with his cothinkers max shachtman and martin abern outside of the communist party cannon shachtman and abern founded a new political party the communist league of america and began publishing the militant they came to see hitlers crushing of the communist movement in germany as evidence that the comintern was no longer able to play a revolutionary role internationally and with the remainder of the third international under stalins control unable to be internally reformed such that a new international and new parties were required concretely this meant that they no longer considered the communist league to be a faction of the communist party but rather considered it the nucleus of a future revolutionary party it also meant that they were far more inclined to look at working with other sections of the reviving socialist and workers movements from this point forth although the communist league had been a small organization — opponents dubbing cannon abern and shachtman three generals without an army — it had won a majority of the communist party branch in minneapolis and st paul therefore when the labor movement revived in the early s the communist league was well placed to put its ideas into action in the twin cities and through their influence in the international brotherhood of teamsters the union rapidly grew after an historic dispute in  cannon played a major role in this dispute directing the work of the communist league on a daily basis along with shachtman in december  the communist league of america merged with pacifist a j mustes american workers party to form the workers party of the united statescitation needed throughout  and into  the workers party was deeply divided over the socalled french turn the trotskyist organization in france had entered the social democratic party of that country — the section française de linternationale ouvrière sfio — and while maintaining themselves as an organized faction in the broader organization had made what were felt to be significant gains in advancing their programmatic goals and in winning adherents to their cause among young party members this tactic had been subsequently endorsed by trotsky himself but the american party was deeply divided over the advisability of the maneuver jim cannon was a forceful advocate of this tactic and was embroiled an innerparty fight to dissolve the workers party in favor of entry into the socialist party of america early in  a convention of the workers party finally decided that the organization should enter the sp this decision came at a cost however with a left wing faction led by hugo oehler refusing to join the socialists and exiting to form the revolutionary workers league a j muste became disgusted as well and left the radical political movement to return to his roots in the churchcitation needed the trotskyists stay inside the socialist party lasted only about a year from mid until mid admissions were made on an individual basis rather than en masse chicago attorney and devoted trotskyist albert goldman who entered the sp about a year earlier than his comrades launched a factionallyoriented newspaper called the socialist appeal while cannon headed west to tujunga california a suburb of los angeles to launch a western paper oriented to the trade union movement called labor action daytoday operations of the organized trotskyist faction in the socialist party during  were handled by shachtman and james burnham in new york while cannon made what he later deemed as futile attempts to participate in correspondence in the work of the new york center as the factional situation in the socialist party intensified early in  the decision was made by the hostile new york party organization to expel the trotskyists which took place late in the spring of  a large percentage of the spas youth organization the young peoples socialist league left with the expelled left wing james cannon was noted to have said that when the trotskyist were expelled from the socialist party that “they had expelled the heart of their party trotsky had won over all the serious young activists leaving only a dead husk” in the summer of  cannon returned to new york from california where he conducted organizational activities which led to the formation of the socialist workers party at a convention held from december   to january   jim cannon was elected as the groups first national secretarycitation neededjames cannon latter wrote that our round trip through the socialist party had resulted in gains all along the line we formed the socialist workers party and began once again an independent struggle with good prospects and good hopes cannon in the swpedit in addition to his activity in the socialist workers party cannon was a leading figure in the fourth international the international trotskyist movement and visited britain in  with the intention of aiding the unification of the competing british groups the result was a patched together unification the revolutionary socialist league which rapidly disintegrated in  shachtman left with a large part of the membership to form the workers party with shachtman and burnham arguing that the stalinists constituted a new bureaucratic class in the soviet union while cannon like trotsky felt that the soviet union should be defended despite stalins dictatorship and invasion of finland this dispute is recorded in cannons book the struggle for the proletarian party and in trotskys in defense of marxism nonetheless stalinists sought to punish both cannon and trotsky for their earlier defection from the stalincontrolled third international trotsky was killed by one of stalins nkvd agents and the cpusa supported the us governments prosecution of cannon and other american trotskyites under the smith act following the german invasion of the soviet union the largely sovietcontrolled cpusa started to support us entry into the war this gave the cpusa a common interest with the us government preparing to go to war as against cannons swp which was aiming to mobilize the working class against the war even after his conviction on the charge of conspiring to overthrow the government and his jailing cannons influence on the swp was strong

legal defense arm international labor defense ild this organization served as a power base for cannon and his associates cannon was the workers communist partys candidate for congress in the new york th district in  cannons turn to trotskyismedit cannon and felix morrow with a bust of trotsky while in russia in  cannon read a critique of the direction of the communist international written by trotsky which the comintern had mistakenly circulated he was convinced of the arguments and attempted to form a left opposition within the workers communist party this resulted in his expulsion on october   together with his cothinkers max shachtman and martin abern outside of the communist party cannon shachtman and abern founded a new political party the communist league of america and began publishing the militant they came to see hitlers crushing of the communist movement in germany as evidence that the comintern was no longer able to play a revolutionary role internationally and with the remainder of the third international under stalins control unable to be internally reformed such that a new international and new parties were required concretely this meant that they no longer considered the communist league to be a faction of the communist party but rather considered it the nucleus of a future revolutionary party it also meant that they were far more inclined to look at working with other sections of the reviving socialist and workers movements from this point forth although the communist league had been a small organization — opponents dubbing cannon abern and shachtman three generals without an army — it had won a majority of the communist party branch in minneapolis and st paul therefore when the labor movement revived in the early s the communist league was well placed to put its ideas into action in the twin cities and through their influence in the international brotherhood of teamsters the union rapidly grew after an historic dispute in  cannon played a major role in this dispute directing the work of the communist league on a daily basis along with shachtman in december  the communist league of america merged with pacifist a j mustes american workers party to form the workers party of the united statescitation needed throughout  and into  the workers party was deeply divided over the socalled french turn the trotskyist organization in france had entered the social democratic party of that country — the section française de linternationale ouvrière sfio — and while maintaining themselves as an organized faction in the broader organization had made what were felt to be significant gains in advancing their programmatic goals and in winning adherents to their cause among young party members this tactic had been subsequently endorsed by trotsky himself but the american party was deeply divided over the advisability of the maneuver jim cannon was a forceful advocate of this tactic and was embroiled an innerparty fight to dissolve the workers party in favor of entry into the socialist party of america early in  a convention of the workers party finally decided that the organization should enter the sp this decision came at a cost however with a left wing faction led by hugo oehler refusing to join the socialists and exiting to form the revolutionary workers league a j muste became disgusted as well and left the radical political movement to return to his roots in the churchcitation needed the trotskyists stay inside the socialist party lasted only about a year from mid until mid admissions were made on an individual basis rather than en masse chicago attorney and devoted trotskyist albert goldman who entered the sp about a year earlier than his comrades launched a factionallyoriented newspaper called the socialist appeal while cannon headed west to tujunga california a suburb of los angeles to launch a western paper oriented to the trade union movement called labor action daytoday operations of the organized trotskyist faction in the socialist party during  were handled by shachtman and james burnham in new york while cannon made what he later deemed as futile attempts to participate in correspondence in the work of the new york center as the factional situation in the socialist party intensified early in  the decision was made by the hostile new york party organization to expel the trotskyists which took place late in the spring of  a large percentage of the spas youth organization the young peoples socialist league left with the expelled left wing james cannon was noted to have said that when the trotskyist were expelled from the socialist party that “they had expelled the heart of their party trotsky had won over all the serious young activists leaving only a dead husk” in the summer of  cannon returned to new york from california where he conducted organizational activities which led to the formation of the socialist workers party at a convention held from december   to january   jim cannon was elected as the groups first national secretarycitation neededjames cannon latter wrote that our round trip through the socialist party had resulted in gains all along the line we formed the socialist workers party and began once again an independent struggle with good prospects and good hopes cannon in the swpedit in addition to his activity in the socialist workers party cannon was a leading figure in the fourth international the international trotskyist movement and visited britain in  with the intention of aiding the unification of the competing british groups the result was a patched together unification the revolutionary socialist league which rapidly disintegrated in  shachtman left with a large part of the membership to form the workers party with shachtman and burnham arguing that the stalinists constituted a new bureaucratic class in the soviet union while cannon like trotsky felt that the soviet union should be defended despite stalins dictatorship and invasion of finland this dispute is recorded in cannons book the struggle for the proletarian party and in trotskys in defense of marxism nonetheless stalinists sought to punish both cannon and trotsky for their earlier defection from the stalincontrolled third international trotsky was killed by one of stalins nkvd agents and the cpusa supported the us governments prosecution of cannon and other american trotskyites under the smith act following the german invasion of the soviet union the largely sovietcontrolled cpusa started to support us entry into the war this gave the cpusa a common interest with the us government preparing to go to war as against cannons swp which was aiming to mobilize the working class against the war even after his conviction on the charge of conspiring to overthrow the government and his jailing cannons influence on the swp was strong and he wrote to party leaders regularly for example recommending a change the party line on the warsaw rising cannons book letters from prison contains many of these missives following the war cannon resumed leadership of the swp but this role declined after he left the post of national secretary in  to farrell dobbs cannon retired to california in the mids however he remained an active member of the partys political committee cannon was very much involved in the splits which developed in both the swp and the fi in  he took a leading role in guiding the public faction supported by the swp the international committee of the fourth international and supported the eventual reunification of the two sides in  which led to the formation of the united secretariat of the fourth international he took no part in the various tendency disputes that developed between  and  except to decry firmer organizational norms developed by his erstwhile supporters these letters are collected in dont strangle the party death and legacyedit james p cannon

member of the communist labor party clp forerunner of the communist party of america cpa although he did not personally attend the chicago convention of the clp due to insufficient party tenure in the spa he was however a part of the clps leadership from its earliest days serving as district secretary of the clp for the states of kansas missouri and nebraska from the time of founding he was also the editor of the leftwing kansas city weekly workers world from  to  assuming the position when fellow kansas syndicalist earl browder was sent to prison for his previous antiwar activities in may  the clp merged with a section of the cpa headed by c e ruthenberg and cannon was elected as a member of the central executive committee of the new organization by the founding convention he worked variously as the st louis district organizer of the ucp in the summer of  and as editor of the organizations labor newspaper the toiler in october of that same year this brought cannon to new york city where he was able to regularly sit on the meetings of the central executive committee after merger of the ucp with the remaining cpa organization headed by charles dirba cannon was named the first subdistrict organizer of the unified organization for duluth minnesota cannon was on the executive board of the american labor alliance one of the underground cpas most important legal organizations intended to bring mainstream trade unionists into common cause with the persecuted underground communist movement in december  cannon delivered the keynote speech to the founding convention of the legal political party formed in parallel to the underground cpa the workers party of america wpa and was elected national chairman by that convention cannon was elected by the cec of the unified cpa as delegate of that organization to the enlarged plenum of the executive committee of the communist international ecci and as formal party representative to the red international of labor unions rilu leaving the usa in midmay  and arriving finally in moscow on june  he stayed on there as a delegate of the american party to the th world congress of the comintern where he was

workers party of america working under his faction rival ruthenberg he was the wpas candidate for governor of new york in  and again returned to moscow as a delegate of the party to the th enlarged plenum of ecci held in march and april  cannon was an important factional leader in the american communist movement of the s sitting on the governing central executive committee of the party in alliance with william z foster a chicagobased group which looked to nativeborn american workers in the unions later in the decade cannon broke to an extent with foster heading up instead the partys legal defense arm international labor defense ild this organization served as a power base for cannon and his associates cannon was the workers communist partys candidate for congress in the new york th district in  cannons turn to trotskyismedit cannon and felix morrow with a bust of trotsky while in russia in  cannon read a critique of the direction of the communist international written by trotsky which the comintern had mistakenly circulated he was convinced of the arguments and attempted to form a left opposition within the workers communist party this resulted in his expulsion on october   together with his cothinkers max shachtman and martin abern outside of the communist party cannon shachtman and abern founded a new political party the communist league of america and began publishing the militant they came to see hitlers crushing of the communist movement in germany as evidence that the comintern was no longer able to play a revolutionary role internationally and with the remainder of the third international under stalins control unable to be internally reformed such that a new international and new parties were required concretely this meant that they no longer considered the communist league to be a faction of the communist party but rather considered it the nucleus of a future revolutionary party it also meant that they were far more inclined to look at working with other sections of the reviving socialist and workers movements from this point forth although the communist league had been a small organization — opponents dubbing cannon abern and shachtman three generals without an army — it had won a majority of the communist party branch in minneapolis and st paul therefore when the labor movement revived in the early s the communist league was well placed to put its ideas into action in the twin cities and through their influence in the international brotherhood of teamsters the union rapidly grew after an historic dispute in  cannon played a major role in this dispute directing the work of the communist league on a daily basis along with shachtman in december  the communist league of america merged with pacifist a j mustes american workers party to form the workers party of the united statescitation needed throughout  and into  the workers party was deeply divided over the socalled french turn the trotskyist organization in france had entered the social democratic party of that country — the section française de linternationale ouvrière sfio — and while maintaining themselves as an organized faction in the broader organization had made what were felt to be significant gains in advancing their programmatic goals and in winning adherents to their cause among young party members this tactic had been subsequently endorsed by trotsky himself but the american party was deeply divided over the advisability of the maneuver jim cannon was a forceful advocate of this tactic and was embroiled an innerparty fight to dissolve the workers party in favor of entry into the socialist party of america early in  a convention of the workers party finally decided that the organization should enter the sp this decision came at a cost however with a left wing faction led by hugo oehler refusing to join the socialists and exiting to form the revolutionary workers league a j muste became disgusted as well and left the radical political movement to return to his roots in the churchcitation needed the trotskyists stay inside the socialist party lasted only about a year from mid until mid admissions were made on an individual basis rather than en masse chicago attorney and devoted trotskyist albert goldman who entered the sp about a year earlier than his comrades launched a factionallyoriented newspaper called the socialist appeal while cannon headed west to tujunga california a suburb of los angeles to launch a western paper oriented to the trade union movement called labor action daytoday operations of the organized trotskyist faction in the socialist party during  were handled by shachtman and james burnham in new york while cannon made what he later deemed as futile attempts to participate in correspondence in the work of the new york center as the factional situation in the socialist party intensified early in  the decision was made by the hostile new york party organization to expel the trotskyists which took place late in the spring of  a large percentage of the spas youth organization the young peoples socialist league left with the expelled left wing james cannon was noted to have said that when the trotskyist were expelled from the socialist party that “they had expelled the heart of their party trotsky had won over all the serious young activists leaving only a dead husk” in the summer of  cannon returned to new york from california where he conducted organizational activities which led to the formation of the socialist workers party at a convention held from december   to january   jim cannon was elected as the groups first national secretarycitation neededjames cannon latter wrote that our round trip through the socialist party had resulted in gains all along the line we formed the socialist workers party and began once again an independent struggle with good prospects and good hopes cannon in the swpedit in addition to his activity in the socialist workers party cannon was a leading figure in the fourth international the international trotskyist movement and visited britain in  with the intention of aiding the unification of the competing british groups the result was a patched together unification the revolutionary socialist league which rapidly disintegrated in  shachtman left with a large part of the membership to form the workers party with shachtman and burnham arguing that the stalinists constituted a new bureaucratic class in the soviet union while cannon like trotsky felt that the soviet union should be defended despite stalins dictatorship and invasion of finland this dispute is recorded in cannons book the struggle for the proletarian party and in trotskys in defense of marxism nonetheless stalinists sought to punish both cannon and trotsky for their earlier defection from the stalincontrolled third international trotsky was killed by one of stalins nkvd agents and the cpusa supported the us governments prosecution of cannon and other american trotskyites under the smith act following the german invasion of the soviet union the largely sovietcontrolled cpusa started to support us entry into the war this gave the cpusa a common interest with the us government preparing to go to war as against cannons swp which was aiming to mobilize the working class against the war even after his conviction on the charge of conspiring to overthrow the government and his jailing cannons influence on the swp was strong and he wrote to party leaders regularly for example recommending a change the party line on the warsaw rising cannons book letters from prison contains many of these missives following the war cannon resumed leadership of the swp but this role declined after he left the post of national secretary in  to farrell dobbs cannon retired to california in the mids however he remained an active member of the partys political committee cannon was very much involved in the splits which developed in both the swp and the fi in  he took a leading role in guiding the public faction supported by the swp the international committee of the fourth international and supported the eventual reunification of the two sides in  which led to the formation of the united secretariat of the fourth international he took no part in the various tendency disputes that developed between  and  except to decry firmer organizational norms developed by his erstwhile supporters these letters are collected in dont strangle the party death and legacyedit james p cannon
