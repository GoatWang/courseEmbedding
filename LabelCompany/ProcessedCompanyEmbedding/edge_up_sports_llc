products llc was born mark had started a shortened career in retail out of college in  on nantucket island  scott began shaping bodyboards in southern california while attending college in   the bodyboard company whom scott was working for in  was bought by a company in hyannis massachusetts  mark joined that company in   one on the west coast the other on the east coast we joined forces with charlie and michael  years later mark worked out of his home for the first  years while scott opened our first office in oceanside in   mark handled the sales and marketing while scott designed our product line from bodyboards to surf and sup boards to winter snow sleds while running the operations side  charlie and michael handled the prototypes testing packaging and ultimately all of the production we hired our first assistant in   as the years grew our family grew  dugie and chuckie long time industry veterans and good friends were among the first to join us  our rep base grew with long time buddies like stretch kb sully jamie pete  paul the walrus and giff and schifty and most recently kyle  each one of them instrumental in getting us from “there” to “here” along the way we

quickly and takes very little effort to get moving we found that it plowed through chop and wind with ease and although it won’t keep up with a longer and more streamlined touring sup it definitely did not feel sluggish the lightweight keeps it very portable and convenient to take anywhere although the ’ quest can in fact hold quite a bit of weight it is also small enough that it can easily be paddled by a smaller person or a child as well click to read the full review the wet lifethe foam construction also means that the board is lightweight weighing only  lbs which is excellent for easy maneuverability cbc  stand up paddle board reviewif you are new to paddle boarding you may have had some serious sticker shock paddle boards average in price around  and can reach prices in the many thousands of dollars no way can a beginner be expected to fork over that kind of money especially if they aren’t even sure about the sport yet fortunately you may have found a board on amazon or dicks sporting goods from a company called california board company that is half the cost of most boards but at such a steep discount can the board be any good is this thing going to sink like a rock when i launch it in the water will this board crack in half if i strap it too tight to the roof of my car even with a cheap board like the california board company  six we need answers click to read the full
