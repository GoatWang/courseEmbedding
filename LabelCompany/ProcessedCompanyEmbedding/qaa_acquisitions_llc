jacobs and john paul dejoria jd acquisitions posted on march th anyone looking for proof that a lot can change in a year need only look at jd acquisitions’ presence at this year’s miami international boat show and yacht  brokerage showlast february the company – created by former genmar chairman irwin jacobs and entrepreneur john paul dejoria – had just completed the purchase of six of the former genmar brands and had limited exposure at the shows this year all six of its brands could be seen at one show or the otherjd acquisitions owns the larson fincraft seaswirl triumph marquis and carver brands the latter two – carver and marquis – are built in pulaski wis larson seaswirl triumph and fincraft are built in little falls minnjacobs  is chairman of jacobs management corp and jd acquisitions he is also chairman of vec technology in greenville pa which has a proprietary closedmold process for molding composites he has owned andor controlled large small and startup companies in a number of fieldsdejoria  is chairman and ceo of john paul mitchell systems a wellknown manufacturer of haircare products and cofounder of patrón spirits co which imports and markets a portfolio of liqueurs and other spirits including its signature patrón tequila linesoundings trade only caught up with jacobs and dejoria feb  at the marquis display at the yacht  brokerage showq i know it’s still early in the show but what’s been the response so far how are you feeling about the showjpd i’m feeling very very good as you may know we rebought the company within the last year and put  people back to work what’s unique for example if we take just marquis yachts we have about  craftsmen that work with us and some of our craftsmen are third generation with a lot of other boat companies if you want to have a custommade boat they outsource they’ll outsource the upholstery they’ll outsource everything else at our factory which is about  square feet for marquis we have everything inside we don’t go to outside vendors we do the upholstery we do the metal everything is done in our own factory we’ll compare our craftsmen to anyone in the world of course our design is very italian we work with a group out of italy that does our designq how are the other five lines doingjpd the first thing we did after buying the companies was get people back to work and we were rather surprised … how quick all of our boat lines are coming around now they’re not where they were a couple of years ago because the industry’s gone down but they’re certainly on their way up and one of the reasons i think has to do with the fact that it is americanmade and the quality is second to noneq what do you think people are looking for right nowjpd people want first of all luxury that’s dependable and longterm – that’s very very important they don’t want something that’s going to fall apart in a few years if they make an investment in a yacht they want one that they know through history has a beautiful design and is going to hold together for a long long timebut also we see a lot of people want to enter yachting but maybe don’t have  million for our big ones but for around  they can start with a footer that’s a yacht in other words it makes it very affordable so you have the whole gamut from  to a little over  million but it’s highquality and longlasting so it’s affordable luxuryq last year at this time you had only just bought the genmar lines out of bankruptcy what’s the last year been likejpd it’s a turnaround year – retooling and rehiring marquis yachts have been made for  years and we’ve already sold over  – from inception to right now so for the last year it’s been getting everybody back to work getting all systems full all inventories full and move forward and we were rather surprised – about six months ago some of the bigger yachts were just starting to sell again we thought well that’s a good signbut we are global we’re in monaco we’re of course here in the united states and then china and some other places irwin and i put whatever money in that was necessary to get everything up to date re   inventoried get all of our workers back to work and start producing models – and improving them we have new models coming out in all of our linesij i believed in it or i never would have done it i didn’t put a timetable on it i told him “we aren’t going to sit there and make money the first day we get into business” it’s like starting a steel mill back up – you’ve got to bring your people back your craftsmen we’ve got the same people back that have been there for   yearsour designers – nuvolarilenard in venice italy — are worldrenowned they’ve stayed with us through thick or thin if i knew i had them on our side to do the design work i knew we had it it’s just a case of let’s do it the right way and be careful how we do it to make sure we build the same quality boats we’ve always builtjust think about what this company’s been able to do in  months i’ve been in business  years this is the proudest moment of my life the fact is people accepted us back after what took place and we did hurt a lot of people – not on purpose i can tell you both of us lost a lot of money i lost  million of my own but i’m not going to sit here and expect to make  million back off my new customerq how are you seeing international sales versus domesticjpd we have orders that we’ve already filled from monaco from russia and from china so it’s starting to happen internationally as well as  nationallyij it’s not like any market is booming we’re picking up market share everywhere we’re going but it’s a boat here a boat there it isn’t like  here  thereq on a personal note john paul what made you want to get into the boating businessjpd through a mutual friend i met irwin and i was really intrigued by some of the boats that were being made and i saw this marquis and i thought wow what a boat and of course some of the others like the triumph which were indestructible and i thought the market’s depressed now but it’s going to come backand then once i went to our factory in the northeastern part of wisconsin – it was like my god this is a class act and it’s all americans building american boats with italian designers i knew that come    the market is going to really start taking off so i thought it was good timing – worth the millions that we put into itand plus pride of ownership – that’s another thing too to be proud of owning something like this is phenomenalij everything john paul owns or is associated with has a level of acceptance to him he wants to be the best at whatever that is this man started with nothing and has built an empireq after the genmar bankruptcy there were some people in the industry some vendors suppliers etc who weren’t happy with how things turned out some were even bitter what would you say to those peoplejpd i would say to them money was lost on genmar i lost money there too but we had enough faith in our workers and where this industry is going that we went ahead and invested millions and i mean millions more into this because we believed in its futureso instead of putting x dollars into the stock market i put it into this because i believe in what we do i believe in our craftsmanship and i believe there’s a future so people shouldn’t be bitter people … are going back to work and we’re putting all the vendors back to work again which is kind of neat so they should be happyi think also as our different boat lines become successful and our yacht lines become successful the industry will come along with it so we all benefitq what are people looking for these days in their boats how important is it to have all the latest technology availablejpd everybody would want as much as they could put on any boat but it’s what’s affordable because we are custommade we can adjust to one’s budget whether it’s a  boat you want to buy a  boat – we have so many lines that we can adjust to the various budgets we have it all under one big roof so we use one company to benefit the other company alsoq are you looking at purchasing any more boat linesjpd one can never tell you never can tell about the futureij i learned a lesson i’m not going to make the same mistake i made with genmar i had lines that were competing with lines and i had people on top of people that were competing i had people in my own company badmouthing some of my other companies i didn’t know about this stuff until after the factif the right situation comes along that fits the niche that we’re in … we’ll look at it but i’ll tell you it will have to be more than compelling because we’ve got a lot of work to do yet i know what we have on our drawing board right now and i know our distribution system’s being rebuiltq now that we’re seeing the light at the end of the tunnel following the prolonged recession what makes this industry one that will grow in the futurejpd people like boats people like to be around things that are fun what will make this industry grow in the future is it’s outdoors it’s a way of life most people can associate with and because we have so many different lines and so many price points there’s something for everybody whether it’s entrylevel or not and as the economy is now coming back people are getting more spendable cash people feel they deserve affordable luxuryq how has it been for the two of you to work togetherij it’s been phenomenal from my standpointjpd for me too – great partnerij he’s the best partner i’ve ever had and i’ll tell you why john paul came to me and he said “irwin i’ll be the best partner you ever had” and why would he be the best partner if you don’t trust your partner and you don’t have the chemistry for decisions … if i call him he says great idea go for it and you’ve got my support some people would say send me a page writeup he’s never been big on that kind of stuff he doesn’t like thatjpd and we both agree on high quality affordable quality on everything we do from triumph all the way upij it’s a unique partnership because you don’t see people spend the kind of money he and i are spending to retool look around this place and see what we’ve done here it’s unheard of in the industryq there are some economic indicators that are lagging behind others how big an issue are these factors to the industryij there’s  percent unemployment we’re dealing with  percent – that’s what we’re looking at i’d like to do business with those other  percent but i know i can’t so there’s still  percent of the world out there that’s still got a job paying their billsfrom our standpoint we’re not looking for the masses in marquis and carver where we’re looking for the masses is in our entrylevel product we believe there’s a bigger group of buyers out there for entrylevel than are actually boating today they have to be reeducated that boats are affordable and that they can get financing everybody can’t get financing but there are people who canand that’s healthy by the way because the world got out of hand there was much too much leverage and the consumer out there overspent the people today who are coming into the market such as in boating you don’t get in for  percent down i’m just closing a deal on a  million boat and the buyer said to me “look i want a cash deal i’ve got no trades i’ve got no nothing” there are people out there writing a check for  million there’s not hundreds or thousands of those people but we just want those people who are ableq do you think there are too many manufacturersij yes positively my dad used to always say “pray in life for  good competitors versus one bad one one bad one can hurt it for all ” the theory behind this is we have too many people in this industry but you get a bad boat out there and it gives a bad name to the industrywe need standards that are met that’s one of the things we’re pushing for in our industry and in our association we do have national marine manufacturers association certification … but it still needs to be tightened up it’s not where it needs to bewe’ll win the day – trust me we will just look around and see every boat you see here will be sold by saturday the best thing we can hope for is i can have a year’s production laid out and then i can increase production and go out and look for more business that’s what we’re trying to doq what do you think about the relaunched discover boating campaignij anything out there that promotes the outdoors and boating can’t be bad it’s just a case of how good will it be people have got cabin fever right now they’ve been suppressed for a long time there are a lot of people who had money who wouldn’t go out and spend it during this downturn because they thought it was the wrong thing to do they’re ready to buyq where do you see the industry five years from nowij the market two or three years ago was  boats a year last year it was  – so it was off twothirds i believe we will surpass that number over the next three four five years there’s no product out there relative to the consumers that are out there the demand should exceed what’s availablewe have no inventories in the field there’s no repos out there none of that stuff is around anymore the people that were stealing the stuff at halfprice – that party’s overjpd those that lasted lasted with quality and people know that and so as the industry comes back and i think it is right now starting to come back those with quality are the ones people are going to gravitate toward those that didn’t have the quality may not be in businessij i believe when you see the consumer’s trends this next year two years they’re going to demand newer better … and to do that you need money i pushed the button i went to john paul and i said “john paul we’re going to retool like no one in the world has ever done” we’ve done in nine months what’s never been done in two three years in a company if you look around and you see what’s on this dock here right now this is star wars in the industry right now it’s brandnew stuff unheard ofwhen you take our larson line – we’ve got  new models in larson three new cruisers it’s usually a cruiser a year is what you put out we put out three of them in one year we signed up  new dealers in  months there are people that don’t have  dealersjpd when you look at your industry having collectively fewer distributors that’s true in other industries too in the professional beauty industry we have half the distributors we had  years ago in the alcohol business the industry now has less distributors than they had  years ago so i think more industries are consolidating their distribution and the strong ones survive i’m sure that there were some really good ones that were small that somehow  didn’t survive but many industries are like that fewer moving partsi think it’s all about quality people don’t mind spending a couple extra dollars for quality or sticking by qualityij that doesn’t mean the highest price when you talk about quality what that means is it’s a work ethic of what you believe your product has to be in order to be accepted you can’t be all things to all people but we’re trying to be more things to more peoplethis article originally appeared in the april  issuecomments one comment on “qa with with irwin jacobs and john paul dejoria jd

fidelity® vip overseas portfolio portfolio manager qa december   view as pdf fund managers vincent montemaggiore qa an interview with former portfolio manager graeme rockett and new lead portfolio manager vincent montemaggiore how did the fund perform for the year ending december   graeme gr the funds share classes returned roughly  trailing the  return of the benchmark msci eafe index the fund also fell short of the peer group average this was a difficult month stretch for the fund because international equities were influenced mostly by macroeconomic and political factors especially in the united kingdom this proved a challenging environment for my investment strategy and my focus on fundamental company analysis to identify earnings potential which i believe drives stock prices over the longer term please tell us more about the investment backdrop the past  months gr within the msci eafe index europe and the uk returned  and  respectively combined these two regions comprised roughly twothirds of the benchmark this period the weight of these regions and the magnitude of their underperformance were in contrast to the stronger returns in japan and the rest of asia i think the decline in uk equities primarily can be attributed to the negative impact of the brexit vote this referendum resulted in increased macro and political uncertainty in both the uk and continental europe as a consequence uk and european equity prices declined the negative impact was exacerbated by a corresponding decline in the value of the british pound relative to the us dollar what hurt most relative to the benchmark gr on a geographical basis stock selection in the uk was the largest detractor followed closely by picks in the rest of europe the magnitude of these relative detractions accounted for a large part of the funds underperformance of the benchmark this period the fund was overweighted the uk when both its currency and equities underperformed both prior to and following the brexit referendum unfavorable positioning in japan also hurt the biggest individual detractor was howden joinery group a londonbased supplier of kitchen cabinetry appliances and other products between brexit which hurt domesticallyfocused firms the hardest pressure on growth prospects and a subsequent analyst downgrade our position returned  for the year the secondlargest relative detractor was next co shares of this japanbased online real estate services firm returned  the past  months falling sharply from midmay to the end of june after the firm lowered its fiscalyear  guidance both howden and next were outofindex positions and next was sold by period end an overweighting novo nordisk the denmarkbased supplier of insulin and diabetesrelated treatments also hurt the stocks performance was weak this period due to concerns regarding pricing pressure in the us market what helped relative performance gr overweighting technology and underweighting both the utilities and telecom services sectors helped our largest individual contributor was hong kongbased tencent holdings one of the worlds largest internet and gaming companies stock of the socialmedia multibusiness giant benefited from positive earnings results and upgrades to earnings forecasts global internet and entertainment group naspers also had a strong showing gaining  the past  months due to solid earnings results also naspers stake in tencent exceeded its own market capitalization in  our stake in welcia holdings also added value as well shares of this japanbased drugstore operator outperformed due to a positive earnings release and a rosier outlook by analysts all three contributors mentioned are outofbenchmark holdings turning to you vince what changes have you made since transitioning to lead pm vm specifically i have steered away from the internet theme graeme highlighted in the portfolio it is my belief that a number of these stocks have become expensive and in keeping with my investment philosophy i closed a number of positions in this space for example i sold tencent and naspers just mentioned as contributors i also trimmed our position in welcia but purchased japenese drugstore tsuruha holdings a position i found more attractive i have and will continue to gradually align the fund more closely with the investment philosophy and process ive implemented as manager of fidelity® overseas fund ive been working to construct a portfolio of highquality businesses with what i consider good mediumterm growth prospects and that are trading at what i think are attractive valuations andrew sergeant will assist me as comanager and i am confident his effort will be highly complementary we work closely together and i expect andrew through his analysis and direct responsibility for a sleeve within the fund to become an excellent source of newidea generation what is your outlook at yearendvm the dominant economic theme i foresee is reflation driven by the anticipated move from monetary to fiscal stimulus coupled with improving commodity prices and growth prospects the outperformance of cyclical stocks and sectors has been pronounced since summers brexitrelated bottom and seems to have picked up steam in the week or so following donald trumps victory given my focus on buying goodquality businesses at attractive valuations this has been a nearterm stylistic headwind this topdown view rapidly is becoming the consensus opinion and is reflected in stock prices and expectations despite considerable uncertainty as to whether were more likely to have inflation or stagflation and whether any potential benefits might be limited to the us at the expense of other regions i continue to focus on identifying what i view as superior businesses and buying them when i think theyre undervalued a lot of positive expectations have been built into some lowquality stocks and some great businesses have sold off to more reasonable levels although they are still not broadly cheap im hoping the market gives me opportunities to upgrade the portfolio with great businesses that are being irrationally sold for what in my opinion are nonfundamental reasons ■ vince montemaggiore on key upcoming elections as we witnessed with the june brexit vote and the election of donald trump there is a growing populist sentiment that is driving election outcomes that run counter to the status quo while predicting politics is difficult i think its important to be conscious of several upcoming events in the next  months i think have the potential to affect stock prices in a meaningful way in december italy voted on a major constitutional referendum intended to reform the countrys legislative process following the referendums resounding defeat – a confirmation that populists are ascendant in europe – matteo renzi italys prime minister tendered his resignation i think italy may be in for prolonged instability that may be a harbinger of things to come elsewhere down the road dutch general elections will be held in march  for all  members of that countrys house of representatives also a french presidential election is scheduled to begin in april later in the year german voters will elect members of that nations parliament the bundestag and decide whether chancellor angela merkel will serve another term in my view these are extremely important elections that likely will give the market clues as to whether or not the eurozone is becoming more united or divided i think its reasonable to assume theres a good possibility of heightened volatility around these events potentially setting up excellent buying opportunities for the highquality businesses im pursuing key takeaways for the year ending december   the funds share classes posted returns of roughly  trailing the  return of the msci eafe index this was a difficult year for the fund with international equities affected more by macroeconomic and political factors especially in the uk than by company earnings and fundamentals versus the benchmark unfavorable stock selection in europe and the uk hurt most especially in the brexit aftermath positioning in japan also dragged on relative performance an outofbenchmark allocation to emerging markets helped slightly among sectors overweighting technology and underweighting utilities helped

china took action to reignite their economies the us federal reserve added fuel by softening its ratehike stance stock prices recovered nicely from midfebruary until the uks latejune vote to exit the european union brexit touched off neartumult in global markets after a sharp initial rebound the msci index traced a generally upward arc through yearend with only a modest retreat in the fourth quarter regionally canada  and emerging markets  benefited from rising commodity prices meanwhile japan  lagged the index and the rest of the asia pacific group  europe  and the uk  were beset by brexit stress among sectors energy  and materials  overcame early lows information technology  also performed well financials  benefited from rising interest rates which conversely proved a drag on the recently created real estate sector  utilities  and telecom services  declined amid a mode switch from risk off to risk on meanwhile health care  suffered amid political and regulatory uncertainty
