from venture capital to the public markets the fund tends to focus on pharmaceutical and medical device companies as opposed to hospitals and insurers products one might say as opposed to services sam isaly’s orbimed advisors is a large health care fund investing in companies at various stages from venture capital to the public markets the fund tends to focus on pharmaceutical and medical device companies as opposed to hospitals and insurers products one might say as opposed to servicesthe nature of healthcare investments requires orbimed advisors to take on significant regulatory risks and make sure they are up to date on major announcements and other events which can have an enormous impact on an individual stock’s price of course the fund also has to ensure that its analysts understand the regulatory environment as well as the science behind a company’s product line samuel isaly himself has been covering healthcare for over  years roughly half of which has come as an investment manager and half of which came as an analyst for companies such as chase manhattan  merrill lynch and legg masonorbimed advisors’ grand strategy is to run a portfolio that is more or less balanced between large healthcare companies and smallercap companies where the investment team believes that future growth is not being reflected in the current price when we look at its most recent portfolio we see a fairly small number of positions worth over  million and then a fairly broad range of healthcare stocks in addition while there were some large increases or decreases many of orbimed’s top picks remained the same and we’d assume that most of them are still close to the top of the portfolio show more fund profile filing period                            fund name orbimed
