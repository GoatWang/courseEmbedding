expenditures on diabetes will account for  of the total healthcare expenditure in the world in  about  of the countries will spend  or more and about  of the countries will spend between  and  of

expressed in international dollars id which correct for differences in purchasing power the global expenditures on diabetes will be at least id  billion in  and at least id  billion in  an average of  id  per person will be spent on diabetes in  globally expenditures spent on diabetes care are not evenly distributed across age and gender groups more than threequarters of the global expenditure in

diabetes between regions and countries more than  of the global expenditures on diabetes are made in the world’s economically richest countries not in the low and middleincome countries where  of people with diabetes will soon live the north american and caribbean region will spend  billion or  of the global total on diabetes in  in contrast the african region will spend in total  billion for diabetes or  of the global total the united states of america usa will alone spend  billion or  of global expenditures india the country with the largest population of people living with diabetes will spend an estimated  billion or less than  of the global total the largest economic burden caused by diabetes is the monetary value associated with disability and loss of life as a result of the disease itself and its related complications including heart kidney eye and foot disease economists have used different methods to value disability and loss of life associated with diseases and the most appropriate method is still under debate no matter what method is used it is very likely the economic burden that is measured by the monetary value associated with this disability and loss of life would be far larger than the estimated economic burden using measures described above fortunately the economic burden of diabetes can be reduced by implementing many inexpensive easytouse interventions and most of the interventions are costeffective or costsaving even in the poorest countries tragically these interventions are not widely used in poor and middle income countries more resources should be invested to deliver these cost effective interventions in particular to those in the developing countries where the great majority of persons with diabetes live   source idf

about us cell medx corp is an early development stage company focused on the discovery development and commercialization of therapeutic products for patients with diseases such as diabetes by developing technologies to help manage the illness and related complications the future of healthcare is a renewed priority and is dedicated to helping people stay healthy emerging practices and technologies are being used to detect and treat medical problems sooner and all with the ultimate goal of achieving better health outcomes traditionally healthcare has evolved around treating illness with chemical pharmaceuticals however at cell medx we have expanded the management of difficult chronic illnesses like diabetes to encompass electrochemical methods of treatment and are achieving exceptional results many universities are still teaching that life is based on a chemical model given the explosive growth in electrical technologies and our ever increasing understanding of physics it is more realistic in the st century to view biological processes on an electrochemical basis rather than on a chemical basis alone what may seem like a subtle shift could have major implications for the healthcare industry the growing aging population worldwide the increasing number of people with chronic conditions expanded regulatory requirements insufficient healthcare resources and rising costs are all burdening today’s health system and creating the impetus for major changes everyone knows they should have a healthy lifestyle but knowing what to do and which tools to use can be overwhelming patients can now manage diets medications and health goals much easier in addition social networking sites enable people to connect with others with the same medical issues to discuss options and available resources combining this knowledge with the creation of effective medical devices now puts healthcare in a new medical context that is directtoconsumer wellness at cell medx we are at the leading edge in the development of devices that treat chronic and acute conditions for both clinical and selfmanagement care we are pioneering safe results oriented technologies combining
