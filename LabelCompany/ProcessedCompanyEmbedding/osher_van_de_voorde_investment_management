linkscontact us sub menu our processequity selection criteriafinancial planning market snapshot equity selection criteria osher van de voorde investment management employs both quantitative and qualitativefundamental analysis select quantitative screens help automate the search for quality growth companies selling at reasonable valuations fundamental research analyzes the unique investment characteristics of individual companies as well as how particular industries react to economic trends technical analysis the usage of charts to identify price trends is used as an auxiliary tool to help identify favorable entry pointsthe crux of our research and analysis incorporates both growth and value investing whereas growth investing favors those companies with consistently increasing earnings value investing looks for underpriced opportunities among comparable companies with sound fundamentals osher van de voorde investment managements core equity investment strategy is often described as growth at a reasonable price or garpour equity investment strategy is focused on finding highquality growth companies that sell at reasonable valuations we screen for companies with historically consistent earnings growth and greater than  estimated earnings growth for the next  years while this quantitative filter keeps our focus on growth we are also particular about finding attractive entry points attention to growth and value is key to longterm success in the stock market as such we further filter our list of growth stocks to find those companies that are selling at low levels relative to their own historical valuations based on earnings dividends cash flow and book value and relative to the overall marketthis quantitative screening for garp produces a focus list that is then further filtered through the lenses of our fundamental criteria  good business with elongated product cycle  proven management  leading brand franchise and market share for respective industry  welldefined international prospects and  superior financial strength this fundamental or qualitative approach requires us to understand companies from the bottomupin addition to bottomup fundamental analysis we also consider topdown investment themes to screen for companies that are participating in sectors likely to drive economic growth for the foreseeable future these thematic engines include globalization mobile broadband demographics and outsourcing owning companies that are entrenched in such thriving business trends is particularly comforting during periods of market uncertaintyhaving screened for growth valuation fundamentals and thematic engines we also identify potential catalysts that might help catapult the stock price within a relatively short period of time less than one year significant share repurchases new products or services industry consolidation turnaround of a key customer or foreign market and insider purchases are all potential catalysts that boost our confidence in the entry point selectedseeking broad diversification we are ultimately looking to own between  and  companies for the core equity portion of each portfolio we use the sp  index as a benchmark for how the portfolio is weighted by economic sector desired sector weighting relative to the sp  is largely influenced by thematic engines and the longterm prospects for each sector while implementation and actual weighting is driven by market fluctuation and valuation considerationsosher van de voorde investment management also considers special situation stocks that vary from our core philosophy but possess other unique qualities that are appropriate for meeting certain investment objectives unless requested by the client special situation stocks typically represent a small portion of the overall portfoliothough it is our intention to buy and hold securities for the longterm more than one year there are circumstances when we will sell a stock within a shorter period of time the following are instances when we might consider selling a stock within one year of purchase  the stock may get ahead of the underlying fundamentals and become overvalued  the underlying fundamentals may change and so change our investment thesis  tax circumstances may warrant the realization of losses and  the market presents us with more attractive opportunitiesby constructing a welldiversified core portfolio of bluechip growth companies that sell with a relative margin of safety we are looking to achieve consistent returns while minimizing risk copyright

always a good idea to compare the services of different investment managers having quality alternatives increases ones confidence in ultimately choosing the most suitable manager investment philosophy experience and trust are essential selection criteria ask each prospective advisor to explain their investment process and decide whether it is a discipline that employs common sense since any investment program requires a longterm commitment make sure that the firms investment philosophy increases your confidence and comfort level study the background of the firms decision makers and compare their investment experience meet personally with each one and spend sufficient time discussing your needs thorough understanding of investment philosophy and comparisons of experience will help ensure that you choose an advisor you can trust what distinguishes osher van de voorde investment management from larger institutional investment advisory firms osher van de voorde investment management is focused on managing quality portfolios not a vast quantity of employees unlike large institutions we have no dedicated sales force and rely instead on qualified referrals from satisfied clients and professionals our familyowned environment is more suitable for knowing each client and tailoring portfolios to their specific objectives in contrast investment managers at large institutions monitor so many portfolios that primary contact with clients is delegated to sales staff i am considering mutual funds am i better off with an investment manager while the cost is nearly identical mutual funds lack the ability to tailor portfolios to unique priorities such as income needs tax considerations and risk tolerance for instance investors have no influence over a funds tax planning and so may receive unpleasant capital gains surprises at yearend if invested in a fund your wealth is pooled with others whose objectives vary significantly from your own a financial advisor provides the personal attention and individualized supervision not offered by mutual funds other considerations that lessen the appeal of mutual funds include investment limitations due to extensive size and reporting that is often mysterious and less frequent i have relied on my stockbroker for many years am i able to take advantage of the services provided by an investment advisor yet maintain the relationship with my broker we make all investment decisions and then implement buy and sell orders through a broker because of the synergy that exists between investment advisors and brokers replacing your broker is not necessary in fact brokers often refer clients that desire independent portfolio management to us in utilizing our services clients may choose their own custodian either broker or bank we are pleased to recommend preferred custodians to our clients what is your fee and how is it based our  annual fee is calculated quarterly as a percentage of assets under management as a feeonly investment advisor we do not subscribe to wrap fee programs and receive no commission compensation what is the best way to measure performance there is no singular uniform way to measure and compare performance it is important however to gauge performance relative to underlying risk additionally it is always important to remember that past performance does not guarantee future results means of performance comparison include benchmarking ones portfolio to an appropriate index such as the sp  this will provide a sense of how the portfolio has fared relative to a widely used barometer of the overall market other clients are more interested in analyzing their returns on an absolute basis factoring for risk and the attainment of longterm objectives osher van de voorde investment
