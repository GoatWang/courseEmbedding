spuds first wildcat for ophir in thailandoct  about vantage drilling vtgdf fun trading special situations contrarian longshort equity valuesummarythe jackup emerald driller spudded its first well in thailand for uk ophir a potential eightwell option could be exercised until march  depending on the resultsthe emerald driller secured a twowell extension at a reduced day rate of kd until january  or a day contractwe are still waiting for official news regarding what the company intends to do a restructuring seems unavoidable at the moment the question is what will it bethis article is an update of my preceding article on vantage drilling otcpkvtgdf published on sept   image jackup emerald driller taken from vantages website on oct   we learned the following from upstreamonlinecom the independent spun the bit on the soy siam prospect probe on block g in the western part of the gulf with the jackup emerald driller the g well is targeting tertiary miocene sandstones that are equivalent in age to ophirs producing bualuang oilfield just  kilometres to the north soy siam has estimated mean prospective resources of  million barrels of oil with a  chance of success once the first probe is drilled the vantage drillingowned rig will move onto the parichat south west prospect where there is a cluster of four fault blocks each fault block has multiple stacked miocene and oligocene reservoir targets ophir said the southwest fault block is the initial target with mean prospective resources again of  million barrels of oil but with a  chance of success if that well is successful ophir said the parichat south east prospect would form an immediate followon location there is considerable additional potential in the event of success in either of these wells the company said source personal composite the estimated cost of the two firm wells is around  million with drilling expected to take a combined  days initially the ju emerald driller was contracted initially by ophir until september  at a dayrate of kd however after renegotiating  blend and extend type  vantage drilling was able to push the contract for twowell until early january  and also secure an option for eightwell at a new dayrate of kd applied retroactively from june  depending on the new results the company will probably be able to secure a two or threemonth extension at kd vantage drilling

 platinum explorer  dsmeudw   ongc india  titanium explorer  dsmeudw  terminated  dispute in court  texas  petrobras actually in the gom new orleans  tungsten explorer  dsmeudw   total congo  cobalt explorer contract canceled dsmeudw dual derrick th generation   since the termination of the titanium explorer we havent heard anything from the company and what they intend to do a restructuring under chapter  is probably on its way but unfortunately ceo paul bragg has been totally silent the stock price totally collapsed to just a few pennies after being delisted from nyse to pink sheets where it is still trading under the ticker vtgdf vtgdf data by ycharts this situation is not dramatic in and of itself and a few investors  such as myself  expected this outcome especially after the termination of the titanium explorer however the most damaging is this type of inadmissible nonchalance and the lack of basic respect toward shareholders that public companies in financial trouble always exhibit it should be required by law that a company maintains a sufficient and timely communication flow with its shareholders especially in those situations i cant imagine the distress of so many small investors being forced to wait without knowing their ultimate fate it also creates a material disadvantage compared to the bondholders who are negotiating now and probably trade the stock somehow i have seen this exact situation with hercules offshore otcpkheroq and recently with paragon offshore pgn as soon as financial troubles are on the horizon the umbilical connection between the company and its shareholders is definitely severed thus nothing has been announced regarding what the final decision will be worse after delisting some traders are not even able to trade the stock anymore also vantage drilling is involved with numerous lawsuits and disputes that havent been solved until now for instance a huge dispute arose regarding the executive hsin chi su known as nobu su and his alleged manipulation while on the vantage drilling board of directors su was involved with vantage drilling through f capital which owns a significant number of vtgdf shares and has been disputed by vantage drilling claiming wrongdoing and asking the court in texas to return the shares to the company this whole affair is like the petrobras bribery case in connection with the titanium explorer now terminated by petrobras which was working in the gulf of mexico at the time as noted on aug   brazilian prosecutors on thursday presented formal charges against jorge zelada the former head of staterun oil firm petrobras international division and five others saying they favored us company vantage drilling in a rig contract the most recent charges presented in brazils largestever corruption scandal included money laundering and corruption and zelada will stand trial with dozens of other engineering tycoons and former petrobras executives if a judge accepts them one of the six charged by the prosecutor was hsin chi su chief executive of taiwanese shipping firm tmt the federal prosecutors office in the southern city of curitiba said in a statement that su and the others paid bribes of  million to zelada other expetrobras officials and brazils pmbd political party the pmdb or brazil democratic movement party is part of president dilma rousseffs governing coalition of course on oct   f capital denied any or all allegations of misconduct  what a surprise f capital denies any involvement in misconduct or corruption whatsoever in relation to all of the matters concerning the drillship titanium explorer vantage drilling and petrobras i am hopeful that this situation will be resolved soon i believe the company has a strong case against nobu suf capital and should get a favorable judgement however the titanium explorer has been terminated and petrobras alleged some unclear technical breach to refuse to pay any compensation which has been contested by the company in a texas court the other dispute is about the underconstruction cobalt explorer termination by vantage drilling the matter is still being negotiated with the shipyard and legal claims have been filed conclusion vantage drilling is drifting and has now been frozen in time in a few weeks the shares totally collapsed and were delisted the company and paul bragg who is supposedly in charge of the communication between the company and its shareholders are refusing to come up with any updates that could help us figure out whats going on just an honest global assessment would be sufficient we still do not know why petrobras terminated the titanium explorer and when we can expect a court judgement in the nobu case if ever in this condition whats left for all shareholders is perhaps a little hope that somehow the restructuring in progress will leave some crumbs for the common shareholders however i do not have any high expectations at the moment only time will tell disclosure iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next  hours i wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions i am not receiving compensation for
