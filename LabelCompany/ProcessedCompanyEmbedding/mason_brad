contentbychristopher m rogerson june  format amazon videoverified purchaseterrible waste of time and money who ever gave this  stars is obviously brads friend or was paid by him most of the video is just him with a dslr tripod and some notes he just sits in front of the camera and just mindlessly read his notes you would think by the cover picture that he was going to go to schools and show examples of actual gifted children instead he bores you to death with material easily found on the internet the nd half of the video is him interviewing white gifted adults with the conversation feeling kind of pretentiousalso the overall image is overexposed just about the entire timeclearly he made this video himself brad if you are going to charge me money for this terrible video maybe you

interviews with gifted adults it is not engaging to watchthere are some good points but they are repeated over and over again there is also no factual information research etc beyond the case studies he presents in the interviewsi rented this to preview for a class i was teaching on working with exceptional childrenthis was not appropriate for that purpose since it is very short on factscomment
