macmillan gap a chronic shortage of longterm investment capital for small and mediumsized businesses it recommended the formation of a company to devote itself particularly to these smaller industrial and commercial issues this company would in addition to its ordinary capital issue preference share capital backed by the debentures or shares of the companies which it financed and therefore serve as an intermediary between small investors and small and mediumsized industrial borrowers hence is roots were laid through the establishment of icfc industrial and commercial financial corporation and the fci finance corporation for industry in  under the uks labour government led by clement atlee following the second world war the icfc was established to serve small and medium sized businesses through the provision of long term and permanent capital typical investments of ££ it was exclusively funded by the major clearing banks and the bank of england who collectively agreed to provide share and loan capital up to £m led by lord william piercy as its first chairman in the same year the fci was founded with £m of capital and the ability to borrow a further £m share capital was subscribed by insurance companies investment trust companies and the bank of england with a remit to provide capital principally in the form of debt in larger amounts than the icfc to facilitate the rationalisation and restructuring of key sectors of british industry and for postwar reequipment the s saw the merger of the fci and icfc forming finance for industry ffi which during the s was
