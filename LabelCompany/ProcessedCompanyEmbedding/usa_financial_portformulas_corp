financial portformulas video get to know portformulas usa financial portformulas is known as the formulaic trending money manager as an sec registered investment advisor portformulas manages a clients portfolio through a systematic formulaic process portformulas applies a strict quantitative methodology to each of its models with the goal of removing human emotion from the investment process in short the portformulas strategy will identify which holdings to own how long to own them and when to sell them   formulaic trending video why we use a formulaic approach the first decade of the st century has taught us that the buy and hold philosophy requires an extensive amount of time to rebuild a portfolio after significant losses in the market as an alternative to buy and hold many investors and financial advisors have resorted to market timing in an effort to time the bottoms and the tops of the market this strategy has proven to be a higher risk with greater inconsistency market trending is a different type of approach that shares some of the positive characteristics of both philosophies historically it is easy to look at charts of the stock market and point to upward trends and downward trends it goes without saying that if you could be invested in the market during the upward trends and be repositioned in a more stable investment during the downward trends you may experience greater long term success the challenge is in identifying what may likely happen in the months and years to come the goal of market trending is to verify trends and act upon them however unlike market timing market trending is not a reaction to the market nor is it a daily buysell routine in an effort to predict whether the market will go up or down next instead market trending seeks to identify longer term trends to potentially increase your odds for long term success this is what we do at usa financial portformulas this is formulaic trending our process video how we do what we do at the beginning of each month the models we manage are reevaluated in an effort to help determine what positions should continue to be owned and which positions we may wish to add each model that is managed has a unique a specific set of criteria that is followed that determines where the clients assets will be invested some models utilize the patented ram® score feature which is a proprietary management tool utilized to help gauge the overall trend of the stock market in addition some models use this same type of scoring feature but apply it to each individual holding every month these unique asset management tools help to guide us in the unemotional asset management decisions for each client clearingcustodial firm usa financial portformulas has custodial relationships with three of the largest custodians in the financial industry td ameritrade trust company of america and pershing these three custodial firms were chosen for their advanced technology
