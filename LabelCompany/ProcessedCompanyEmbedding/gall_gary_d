gallstones may be suspected based on symptoms diagnosis is then typically confirmed by ultrasound complications may be detected on blood tests prevention is by maintaining a healthy weight and eating a diet high in fiber and low in simple carbohydrates if there are no symptoms treatment is usually not needed in those who are having gallbladder attacks surgery to remove the gallbladder is typically

in the gallbladder is referred to as cholelithiasis from the greek chol bile  lith stone  iasis process if gallstones migrate into the ducts of the biliary tract the condition is referred to as choledocholithiasis from the greek chol bile  docho duct  lith stone  iasis process choledocholithiasis is frequently associated with obstruction of the biliary tree which in turn can lead to acute ascending cholangitis from the greek chol bile  ang vessel  itis inflammation a serious infection of the bile ducts gallstones within the ampulla of vater can obstruct the exocrine system of the pancreas which in turn can result in pancreatitis signs and symptomsedit gallstones gallstones may be asymptomatic even for years these gallstones are called silent stones and do not require treatment the size and number of gallstones present does not appear to influence whether or not people are symptomatic or asymptomatic0 a characteristic symptom of gallstones is a gallstone attack in which a person may experience colicky pain in the upperright side of the abdomen often accompanied by nausea and vomiting that steadily increases for approximately  minutes to several hours a person may also experience referred pain between the shoulder blades or below the right shoulder these symptoms may resemble those of a kidney stone attack often attacks occur after a particularly fatty meal and almost always happen at night and after drinking in addition to pain nausea and vomiting a person may experience a fever if the stones block the duct and cause bilirubin to leak into the bloodstream and surrounding tissue there may also be jaundice and itching this can also lead to confusion if this is the case the liver enzymes are likely to be raised other complicationsedit rarely in cases of severe inflammation gallstones may erode through the gallbladder into adherent bowel potentially causing an obstruction termed gallstone ileus other complications include ascending cholangitis if there is a bacterial infection which can cause purulent inflammation in the biliary tree and liver and acute pancreatitis as blockage of the bile ducts can prevent active enzymes being secreted into the bowel instead damaging the pancreas risk factorsedit gallstone risk increases for females especially before menopause and for people near or above 0 years the condition is more prevalent among both north and south americans and among those of european descent than among other ethnicities a lack of melatonin could significantly contribute to gallbladder stones as melatonin inhibits cholesterol secretion from the gallbladder enhances the conversion of cholesterol to bile and is an antioxidant which is able to reduce oxidative stress to the gallbladder researchers believe that gallstones may be caused by a combination of factors including inherited body chemistry body weight gallbladder motility movement and low calorie dietcitation needed the absence of such risk factors does not however preclude the formation of gallstones nutritional factors that may increase risk of gallstones include constipation eating fewer meals per day low intake of the nutrients folate magnesium calcium and vitamin c low fluid consumption and at least for men a high intake of carbohydrate a high glycemic load and high glycemic index diet wine and wholegrained bread may decrease the risk of gallstones rapid weight loss increases risk of gallstones patients taking orlistat a weight loss drug may already be at increased risk for the formation of gall stones weight loss with orlistat can increase the risk of gall stones on the contrary ursodeoxycholic acid ucda a bile acid also a drug marketed as ursodiol appears to prevent formation of gallstones during weight loss a high fat diet during weight loss also appears to prevent gallstones cholecystokinin deficiency caused by celiac disease increases risk of gallstone formation especially when diagnosis of celiac disease is delayed pigment gallstones are most commonly seen in the developing world risk factors for pigment stones include hemolytic anemias such as from sicklecell disease and hereditary spherocytosis cirrhosis and biliary tract infections people with erythropoietic protoporphyria epp are at increased risk to develop gallstones additionally prolonged use of proton pump inhibitors has been shown to decrease gallbladder function potentially leading to gallstone formation pathophysiologyedit cholesterol gallstones develop when bile contains too much cholesterol and not enough bile salts besides a high concentration of cholesterol two other factors are important in causing gallstones the first is how often and how well the gallbladder contracts incomplete and infrequent emptying of the gallbladder may cause the bile to become overconcentrated and contribute to gallstone formation this can be caused by high resistance to the flow of bile out of the gallbladder due to the complicated internal geometry of the cystic duct the second factor is the presence of proteins in the liver and bile that either promote or inhibit cholesterol crystallization into gallstones in addition increased levels of the hormone estrogen as a result of pregnancy or hormone therapy or the use of combined estrogencontaining forms of hormonal contraception may increase cholesterol levels in bile and also decrease gallbladder movement resulting in gallstone formation compositionedit gallstones can vary in size and shape from as small as a grain of sand to as large as a golf ball the gallbladder may contain a single large stone or many smaller ones pseudoliths sometimes referred to as sludge are thick secretions that may be present within the gallbladder either alone or in conjunction with fully formed gallstones the clinical presentation is similar to that of cholelithiasiscitation needed the composition of gallstones is affected by age diet and ethnicity on the basis of their composition gallstones can be divided into the following types gallbladder opened to show small cholesterol gallstones µct of a gallstone the large yellow stone is largely cholesterol while the greentobrown stones are mostly composed of bile pigments play media images of a ct of gallstones large gallstone cholesterol stonesedit cholesterol stones vary from light yellow to dark green or brown or chalk white and are oval usually solitary between  and  cm long each often having a tiny dark central spot to be classified as such they must be at least 0 cholesterol by weight or 0 according to the japanese–classification system between  and 0 of stones are cholesterol stones bilirubin stonesedit bilirubin pigment black pigment stones are small dark often appearing black and usually numerous they are composed primarily of bilirubin insoluble bilirubin pigment polymer and calcium calcium phosphate salts that are found in bile they contain less than  of cholesterol or  according to the japaneseclassification system between  and  of stones are bilirubin stones mixed stonesedit mixed brown pigment stones typically contain –0 cholesterol or –0 according to the japanese classification system other common constituents are calcium carbonate palmitate phosphate bilirubin and other bile pigments calcium bilirubinate calcium palmitate and calcium stearate because of their calcium content they are often radiographically visible they typically arise secondary to infection of the biliary tract which results in the release of βglucuronidase by injured hepatocytes and bacteria which hydrolyzes bilirubin glucuronides and increases the amount of unconjugated bilirubin in bile between  and  of stones are mixed diagnosisedit diagnosis is than typically confirmed by ultrasound complications may be detected on blood tests a positive murphys sign is a common finding on physical examination during a gallbladder attack a  cm gallstone impacted in the neck of the gallbladder and leading to cholecystitis as seen on ultrasound there is  mm gall bladder wall thickening gallstones as seen on plain xray large gallstone as seen on ct play media a normal gallbladder on ultrasound with bowel peristalsis creating the false appearance of stones treatmentedit surgicaledit cholecystectomy gallbladder removal has a  chance of eliminating the recurrence of cholelithiasis surgery is only indicated in symptomatic patients the lack of a gallbladder may have no negative consequences in many people however there is a portion of the population—between 0 and —who develop a condition called postcholecystectomy syndrome which may cause gastrointestinal distress and persistent pain in the upperright abdomen as well as a 0 risk of developing chronic diarrhea there are two surgical options for cholecystectomy open cholecystectomy is performed via an abdominal incision laparotomy below the lower right ribs recovery typically requires – days of hospitalization with a return to normal diet a week after release and to normal activity several weeks after release laparoscopic cholecystectomy introduced in the 0s is performed via three to four small puncture holes for a camera and instruments postoperative care typically includes a sameday release or a one night hospital stay followed by a few days of home rest and pain medication laparoscopic cholecystectomy patients can in general resume normal diet and light activity a week after release with some decreased energy level and minor residual pain continuing for a month or two studies have shown that this procedure is as effective as the more invasive open cholecystectomy provided the stones are accurately located by cholangiogram prior to the procedure so that they can all be removedcitation needed medicaledit cholesterol gallstones can sometimes be dissolved with ursodeoxycholic acid taken by mouth but it may be necessary for the person to take this medication for years gallstones may recur however once the drug is stopped obstruction of the common bile duct with gallstones can sometimes be relieved by endoscopic retrograde sphincterotomy ers following endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ercp gallstones can be broken up using a procedure called extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy often simply called lithotripsy which is a method of concentrating ultrasonic shock waves onto the stones to break them into tiny pieces they are then passed safely in the feces however this form of treatment is suitable only when there is a small number of gallstones other animalsedit gallstones are a valuable byproduct of animals butchered for meat because their use as a purported antipyretic and antidote in the folk remedies of some cultures in particular in china the finest gallstones tend to be sourced from old dairy cows which are called niuhuang yellow thing of cattle in chinese much as in the manner of diamond mines slaughterhouses
