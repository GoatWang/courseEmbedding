office support and terrible infrastructure most of the hsbc employees phone agents and tellers have a polite demeanour  best intentions on the contrary the banking system and norms they use are really painstaking my time to open an account for a promotion i received was  hour and  mins that included a waiting for  mins account details gathering for  mins waiting for  mins and then finally  mins with the teller hsbc corporate run promotions without staffing the local branch with the right infrastructure in my case they couldnt accept the check because they let me walk in at p and by the time they could operate my account they were over p now lets get to the promotion itself no one from the call center or the administration team could tell you whether you are on track or not to receive your bonus in fact the call center team has no clue what promotion you signed up on they will ask you to reach via bankmailtheir secure messaging platform and the mail team will redirect you to the call center its cyclic now if you were reading between the lines my frustration is not the promotion for a global bank of this footprint their card systems online account management  websites before you can sign in  mins of call wait time and the whole experience is so terrible so in short not only avoid this branch great staff avoid the bank like plague for domestic us banking at the least so my reason visiting the bank was to open a new checking account and take advantage of their promotional sign up first off when entering the bank i was confused and felt lost the entrance to the bank is not the traditional chase or bofa you walk pass the advisers offices before reaching the teller at the end of the hallway layout of the bank i would give  star because it didnt feel welcoming at all i met the teller first christine a traditional chinese lady if you understand the chinese culture then you know what i mean she handed me some documents to fill out but didnt give me a pen luckily i had my own towards the end of my trip she opened up more and i was able to understand the banking process more there i give her  stars the person who assisted me in opening up my account was jeff liao i was pretty honest with my feelings with the bank and told him i felt foreign in entering the banking facility he is a very nice person and took the time to explain to me the different options they have he was pretty patient and was able to answer all the questions i have and even walked me through th online sign on process i would give him  stars strongly recommend him if you need services at the bank there was another lady her office was second to the right of the teller she looked like the dragon lady at the office not friendly or helpful when she saw me and pretty much ignored me i would give her  stars im just so very glad jeff made my experience at hsbc bank so much better also i wouldnt recommend coming here in a rush their computer system is pretty slow great office location which prompted me to open an account here but really bad day to day working the asked for all sorts of stupid and unrequited documents  even after dl and  credit cards work id they asked for home pge billing or comcast after the account was opened  i kept being logged out and had to reset my password everytime in some complicated format when calling you would have to give all details including anything personal  it was painfull and so finally closed the account really bad experience  had to spend  min on call to cancel a credit which had not been used for  months  if you done tell usa at the end of address  they will question which country so i added planet earth too the address will stick to chase  wf  even boa stay away the most atrocious bank of the world and most atrocious branch of the year award goes to hsbc mountain view they will extract as much fee as possible  eventhough you have a premier account the relationship manager will never contact you premier customers are supposed to not wait in the queue with the customer support but you will end up in a queue they will recommend you mutual funds with higher load fiduciary duty for a toss they are not open on weekends and close early at pm it is hard to understand the tellers wells fargo bank and others are a blessing in comparison jemma b said it all really our hsbc experience mirrored hers almost to the letter we experienced employees who simply did not know how to handle our seemingly standard requests but were friendly and at times apologetic we were tagteamed on both visits by two women one who seemed to be some sort of expeditor and one a teller this type of interaction meant having to repeat ones request at least twice i dont know how this type of scenario is meant to be efficient which i think might have been the goal but it wasnt the poor slob in line in front of us was in for an address change his request like those of many an hsbc customer in the bay area was one relating to a move from abroad we showed up in line behind him fifteen minutes prior to his having had the task completed goodness knows how long hed already been standing there in my experience both nyc and uk hsbc banks run a lot more smoothly not sure why the ca affiliate would function any differently but it does those relocating to the bay area with an already existing hsbc acct would do well to close it and bank elsewhere they dont deserved to be called as bank reception try to push you out the door by showing her know it all knowledge even you point out her mistake she still refuse to let you to a banker she just tell you stay where you are and she will going inside and ask wtf canceling my hsbc account right now terrible i had an hsbc account in the uk so thought the experience here would be the same how very wrong i was when you walk in its like a ghost town and when you do finally find someone to help you they pass you from one clueless employee to the next nothing is simple there  even something as quick as depositing a cheque can take up to half an hour couple that with the fact that i have to repeat everything three or four times because the lady who is serving me somehow cant understand my clear london accent if you really feel like you absolutely must bank here ask for alvin he seems to be the only person who has any idea whats going on coming to this bank is always an exercise in frustration i am now using my visits to train myself in principles of mindfulness detachment and deep breathing there is always something here to practice deep breathing about from making me sign again because my signature doesnt look the same to performing basic tasks at the speed of molasses the layout of the branch is absurd the rest of hsbcs services are similarly terrible including the nonfunctioning relationship manager and the app and site which are so secure that i can never log on only if i can give them zero star instead of one they are simply terrible theyre absolutely the worst bank you can ever meet the front desk lady is mean impolite antigay and racist they ask you questions like theyre an immigration officer and they are new to gay thing obviously when i told them i want to open a joint account as a gay couple the front desk lady simply gave me the ohmygod face which i can never forget beside she doesnt know nothingnun professional at all odd layout odd employees closest location to me sigh thankfully hsbc is simply an emergency cash account for me and not a main bank holding so when you first walk in youre in a waiting room of sorts with no employee there behind the podium ok should i sign in or just sit down wait there is no sign in sheet should i walk down this flat hallway across these glass offices ummmhello anyone here finally an account specialist comes out and oh you just need a teller its all the way down at the end of the hallway silly me why didnt i see a teller window all the way in the back how could i not see the invisible signs that read this way idiot ah the teller windowwhy hello cranky teller who looks at me like i just woke him up or interrupted his favorite cat youtube video zero professionalism and actually the person he spoke with over the phone did all the work ugh thankfully first republic will soon have another south bay location the worst bank ive dealt with in  decades i spent k for a premier account my premier relationship manager doesnt pick up the phone and doesnt respond to emails at the palo alto branch you cant park because the employees park in the visitor spots i was told to find parking on the road  they tout ease of withdrawing money around the world what a joke if you go to asia they will treat you like crap unless you are fair skinned their online site is a pathetic joke i wish i had never opened this account oh and i think the positive reviews are from their own employees do not bank with hsbc i had my mortgage checking  brokerage accounts and credit card with hsbc at one point they provided the worst customer service the palo alto branch account manager never responded to my calls or emails the only way to talk to her was to keep calling back hoping one time she would pick up the phone this bank has countless doesntmakesense policies for example i called to get a copy of my  form the rude representative said she couldnt mail one to me without my account number but she just looked up my account information using my ssn a simplest transaction must be done in writing via fax no emails or phone this bank is ridiculous exercise no common sense poorest customer service i will never give business to them again let me first sum up that this is not your bank you are not a customer youre an asset they seem nice and are very willing to help you setup an account but thats because youve given them control of your money once they have your money they act like they are doing you a service by controlling it they can decide not to give you your money yes you heard right they refused a cash with drawl from the teller not because of insufficient funds or due to not having the proper id and account information they suggest that they dont always have sufficient funds to allow for cash with drawls sums that are perfectly ok at other banks bofa for example if you with drawl funds regularly this is not the bank for you the place seems more like an old world investment bank between the teller in the back the sense of questioning as to why you would make a with drawl the rude indian manager if you ask for your money expect resistance and even a fight with all the headache they caused i cant say enough of how frustrating it is to work with this bank yes most banks suck for one reason or another but in the end all the other banks never refused me access to my money do not bank here the worst customer service i have ever experienced the staff dont even know how their online banking works zero stars hsbc unclaimed this business has not yet been claimed
