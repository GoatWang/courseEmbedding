patients the science testimonials evidence gel powder training and videos white papers faq what is collagen info for your doctor testimonials “i noticed a rough quarterinch patch of skin on my forehead that would not go away the texture felt different enough to visit a dermatologist the doctor told me the skin had a  chance of being cancerous and suggested freezing it off i was warned that the procedure would cause pain and sensitivity for a week then develop into a bump for the next ten days and finally turn into a monthlong scab i went ahead and told the doctor to freeze it off that day when i returned home i immediately put celleraterx gel on the wound using my finger i applied the gel and noticed the pain went away in a very short period of time i did this every morning when i woke up the gel stayed on open and uncovered for the entire day the area never got red or had any inflammation and in two days a very reasonable scab formed that was nowhere near as ugly as the doctor suggested in just two weeks the scab fell off in the shower with absolutely no scarring celleraterx made a normal sixweek healing process last just two weeks without getting into a long drawn out story i heard about wound management technologies and celleraterx at a conference in san francisco listened to the story and went online and bought some product after my experience i believe celleraterx can fix it all” steve handy cfo and cto of elite financial communications group llc ”i have been using celleraterx since  i can say for certain that this one product revolutionized my wound healing to a costeffective and patient compliant model from one of highend product use and lowcost effectiveness the ease and use of the product mandates that every wound clinician have this as part of their own arsenal against every violation of the skin from head to toe i can also say that without celleraterx on some of my patients i am not sure if they would have healed the way they did” eric j lullove dpm faccws fapwca “about a year ago i was trying to deal with a wound on my foot that refused to heal as the weeks went by with no improvement i began to lose hope an acquaintance who is an rn who’s specialty has been advanced wound care for the last  years heard about my wound and suggested i mention celleraterx to my doctor the way she described her experiences with it sounded to good to be true but at the point it was added to my regimen everything began to improve every time the bandage was changed i could see improvement and finally complete healing a few months ago a nearby area sustained a new wound this time celleraterx was was part of the treatment from the beginning in little more than a week i observed the wound fill and close phenomenal i’ve told every doctor i know about celleraterx i’ve never done that before but real miracles in medicine are few and far between please feel free to use this to to tell other people about this great product” charles

training and videos white papers faq what is collagen info for your doctor celleraterx  skin care there are approximately  million people in the united states over the age of  and this number is projected to grow to  million by  this age group has specific challenges as related to wound care one of which is skin tears the skin is the largest organ of the body and has many important functions it protects from the environment helps control body temperature assists in controlling fluid and electrolyte imbalance and contains nerve receptors skin changes are among the most visible signs of aging and also among the most problematic for the elderly with aging the outer skin layer thins and changes in the connective tissue reduce the skins strength and elasticity this increases the risk for a skin tear which is a traumatic wound resulting from the separation of the skin layers rubbing pulling or even the simple act of removing a band aid may result in a skin tear tears can be problematic as aging skin repairs itself more slowly and wound healing may be much slower this can contribute to pressure ulcer and infections diabetes cardiac conditions poor nutritional status and lowered immunity can also affect healing celleraterx® advanced wound collagen powder or gel has been shown to be a very effective product in managing these challenging skin tears in the elderly as evidenced by a study in this population celleraterx® activated collagen skin tear study completed evaluation it included skin tears as well as severe skin flaps a majority were resolved within a week with just one treatment this study supports the role of celleraterx in the resolution of skin tears here is what a treatment nurse in a long term care facility who deals with these challenges on a regular basis had to say i think that celleraterx is a fantastic product i have a patient that i have treated five times in the last  years for skin tears when she gets one she always manages to do the job well the first skin tear was on her leg and was cm long and   cm wide it was almost cm deep on this little  lb lady that is pretty large thanks to celleraterx it healed within   weeks this is a  year old lady with skin that is so frail and fragile that you can hardly tell if she has any subcutaneous tissue as well as any adipose tissue healing any skin tear on this patient is a challenge fortunately for us we have celleraterx on our formulary great product celleraterx is ideal for management of these difficult and challenging tears for people both in facilities and for those who are at home managing their own care click here to download a pdf on skin tears click here to download a pdf on burns the science testimonials evidence gel powder training and videos white papers faq what
