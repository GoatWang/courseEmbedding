capitalizations fall within the normal range of these indexes the fund may also invest in other types of equity securities such as preferred stocks or convertible securities the fund may also invest to a limited extent in companies outside the us management process portfolio management aims to add value through stock selection in choosing securities portfolio management employs a riskbalanced bottomup selection process to identify companies it believes are wellpositioned and that have above average and sustainable growth potential portfolio management utilizes a proprietary investment process designed to identify attractive investments by utilizing proprietary research conducted by inhouse analysts the investment process also takes into consideration various valuation metrics to assess the attractiveness of stocks and assists portfolio management in devising allocations among investable securities all investment decisions are made within risk parameters set by portfolio management portfolio management may favor different types of securities from different industries and companies at different times portfolio management will normally sell a stock when its price fully reflects portfolio management’s estimate of its fundamental value its fundamentals have deteriorated other investments offer better opportunities or in the course of adjusting the fund’s exposure to a given sector derivatives portfolio management generally may use futures contracts which are a type of derivative a contract whose value is based on for example indices currencies or securities as a substitute for direct investment in a particular asset class to keep cash on hand to meet shareholder redemptions or for other needs while maintaining exposure to the stock market the fund may also use other types of derivatives i for hedging purposes ii for risk management iii for nonhedging purposes to seek to enhance potential gains or iv as a substitute for direct investment in a particular asset class or to keep cash on hand to meet shareholder redemptions securities lending the fund may lend securities up to onethird of total assets to approved institutions fund information for mutual

investment risksreturn to topan investment in the fund is subject to the following risks which are described in more detail in the statutory prospectus there are several risk factors that could hurt the fund’s performance cause you to lose money or cause the fund’s performance to trail that of other investments the fund may not achieve its investment objective and is not intended to be a complete investment program an investment in the fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other governmental agency stock market risk when stock prices fall you should expect the value of your investment to fall as well stock prices can be hurt by poor management on the part of the stock’s issuer shrinking product demand and other business risks these may affect single companies as well as groups of companies in addition movements in financial markets may adversely affect a stock’s price regardless of how well the company performs the market as a whole may not favor the types of investments the fund makes which could affect the funds ability to sell them at an attractive price to the extent the fund invests in a particular capitalization or sector the fund’s performance may be affected by the general performance of that particular capitalization or sector growth investing risk as a category growth stocks may underperform value stocks and the stock market as a whole over any period of time because the prices of growth stocks are based largely on the expectation of future earnings growth stock prices can decline rapidly and significantly in reaction to negative news about such factors as earnings the economy political developments or other news security selection risk the securities in the fund’s portfolio may decline in value portfolio management could be wrong in its analysis of industries companies economic trends the relative attractiveness of different securities or other matters mediumsized company risk mediumsized company stocks tend to be more volatile than large company stocks because stock analysts are less likely to follow mediumsized companies less information about them is available to investors industrywide reversals may have a greater impact on mediumsized companies since they lack the financial resources of larger companies mediumsized company stocks are typically less liquid than large company stocks small company risk small company stocks tend to be more volatile than mediumsized or large company stocks because stock analysts are less likely to follow small companies less information about them is available to investors industrywide reversals may have a greater impact on small companies since they may lack the financial resources of larger companies small company stocks are typically less liquid than large company stocks foreign investment risk the fund faces the risks inherent in foreign investing adverse political economic or social developments could undermine the value of the fund’s investments or prevent the fund from realizing the full value of its investments in june  citizens of the united kingdom approved a referendum to leave the european union eu creating economic and political uncertainty significant uncertainty exists regarding the timing of the united kingdom’s anticipated withdrawal from the eu and the effects such withdrawal may have on the united kingdom other eu countries and the global economy financial reporting standards for companies based in foreign markets differ from those in the us additionally foreign securities markets generally are smaller and less liquid than us markets to the extent that the fund invests in nonus dollar denominated foreign securities changes in currency exchange rates may affect the us dollar value of foreign securities or the income or gain received on these securities derivatives risk risks associated with derivatives may include the risk that the derivative is not well correlated with the security index or currency to which it relates the risk that derivatives may result in losses or missed opportunities the risk that the fund will be unable to sell the derivative because of an illiquid secondary market the risk that a counterparty is unwilling or unable to meet its obligation and the risk that the derivative transaction could expose the fund to the effects of leverage which could increase the fund’s exposure to the market and magnify potential losses securities lending risk any decline in the value of a portfolio security that occurs while the security is out on loan is borne by the fund and will adversely affect performance also there may be delays in recovery of securities loaned or even a loss of rights in the collateral should the borrower of the securities fail financially while holding the security counterparty risk a financial institution or other counterparty with whom the fund does business or that underwrites distributes or guarantees any investments or contracts that the fund owns or is otherwise exposed to may decline in financial health and become unable to honor its commitments this could cause losses for the fund or could delay the return or delivery of collateral or other assets to the fund liquidity risk in certain situations it may be difficult or impossible to sell an investment andor the fund may sell certain investments at a price or time that is not advantageous in order to meet redemption requests or other cash needs unusual market conditions such as an unusually high volume of redemptions or other similar conditions could increase liquidity risk for the fund pricing risk if market conditions make it difficult to value some investments the fund may value these investments using more subjective methods such as fair value pricing in such cases the value determined for an investment could be different from the value realized upon such investment’s sale as a result you could pay more than the market value when buying fund shares or receive less than the market value when selling fund shares operational and technology risk cyberattacks disruptions or failures that affect the fund’s service providers or counterparties issuers of securities held by the fund or other market participants may adversely affect the fund and its shareholders including by causing losses for the fund or
