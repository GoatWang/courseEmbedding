 unaudited   note  nature of business   organization   sichuan leaders petrochemical company we us our or the company formally known as quality wallbeds inc was incorporated under the laws of the state of florida on june   from our inception through may  we provided quality space saving custom home furniture and closet organizing systems to the general public we offered our services to people and companies needing assistance in the organization of their livingwork space in may  our board of directors the board determined that to continue to protect and increase shareholder value it would be to the advantage welfare and best interests of our shareholders to consider alternative corporate strategies to generate new business revenue for the company the board proposed that we pursue opportunities in asia to acquire companies in the wholesale and resale of products in the automotive oil industry to facilitate this action the board voted to dispose of all of our assets related to the retail operation of the wall bed products this action was approved on may   by shareholders representing  of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock   note  going concern   the accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business the company had no ongoing business or other source of income and incurred a net loss of  for the six month period ended june   these factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time   the company is currently evaluating acquisitions and other business opportunities the ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the company generating profitable operations in the future and or obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due no assurance can be given that the company will be successful in these efforts   note  summary of significant accounting policies   basis of presentation   the accompanying unaudited financial statements of the company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap for interim financial information and in accordance with the instructions to form q and article  of regulation sx accordingly they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by gaap for complete financial statements in the opinion of management all adjustments consisting of normal recurring accruals considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included in the opinion of management there have been no changes to the companys significant accounting policies referred to in the audited consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the companys annual report on form k for the year ended december   filed march   all amounts referenced in these financial statements and this report are in us dollars unless otherwise stated   in the opinion of management all adjustments consisting of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of a the result of operations for the six month period ended june   and  b the financial position at june   and c cash flows for the six month period ended june   and  have been made management believes that these estimates are reasonable and have been discussed with the board of directors however actual results could differ from those estimates operating results for the six month period ended june   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ended december     reclassification   during the six month period ended june   the company reclassified certain prior period amounts to conform to current period presentation      table of contents     use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period the company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to the recoverability of deferred income tax asset valuation allowances the company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources the actual results experienced by the company may differ materially and adversely from the companys estimates to the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results future results of operations will be affected   cash and cash equivalents   the majority of cash is maintained with a major financial institution in the united states generally these deposits may be redeemed on demand and therefore bear minimal risk the company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of six months or less to be cash equivalents as of june   and december   the companys deposits with this bank did not exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits all cash stated in us unless otherwise stated    fair value of financial instruments   fasb asc  fair value measurements and disclosures defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date this asc also establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between  market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources observable inputs and  an entitys own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances unobservable inputs the fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level    the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below   level  unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical unrestricted assets or liabilities   level  inputs other than quoted prices included in level  that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability eg interest rates and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable data by correlation or other means   level  inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable   currently there are no assets that are required to be fair valued   the companys financial instruments consist principally of cash prepaid expenses and accounts payable the recorded values of all these financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of the short term nature of these financial instruments      table of contents     impairment of longlived assets   fasb asc  requires that longlived assets and certain identifiable intangibles held and used by an entity be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable we assess the potential impairment of longlived assets principally property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable we determine if there is impairment by comparing undiscounted future cash flows from the related longlived assets with their respective carrying values in determining future cash flows significant estimates are made by us with respect to future operating results of the restaurant over its remaining lease term if assets are determined to be impaired the impairment charge is measured by calculating the amount by which the asset carrying amount exceeds its fair value this process of assessing fair values requires the use of estimates and assumptions which are subject to a high degree of judgment if these assumptions change in the future we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets the company owned no longlived assets as of june   or december     income taxes   we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date   we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized in making such determination we consider all available positive and negative evidence including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent financial operations in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income taxes   revenue recognition   the company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned the company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer iii the sales price is fixed or determinable and iv collectability is reasonably assured   stockbased compensation   the company accounts for stockbased instruments issued to employees in accordance with asc topic  asc topic  requires companies to recognize in the statement of operations the grantdate fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees the value of the portion of an award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense over the requisite service periods using the straightline attribution methodthe company accounts for nonemployee sharebased awards in accordance with the measurement and recognition provisions asc topic  the company estimates the fair value of stock options at the grant date by using the blackscholes optionpricing model no stock based compensation was issued or outstanding during the six month period ended june   or    net earnings loss per share   the company computes net income loss per share in accordance with asc  earnings per share asc  requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share eps on the face of the income statement basic eps is computed by dividing net income loss available to common shareholders numerator by the weighted average number of shares outstanding denominator during the period diluted eps gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the ifconverted method in computing diluted eps the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants diluted eps excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is antidilutive no potentially dilutive debt or equity instruments were issued and outstanding during the six month periods ended june   and    recent accounting pronouncements   we have reviewed all the recently issued but not yet effective accounting pronouncements and we do not believe any of these pronouncements will have a material impact on the company financial statements      table of contents     note  related party transactions   there were no new related party transactions that occurred during the six month period ended june     note  income taxes   as of june   and december   the company has net operating losses from operations the carry forwards expire through the year  the companys net operating loss carry forward may be subject to annual limitations which could reduce or defer the utilization of the losses as a result of an ownership change as defined in section  of the internal revenue code a valuation allowance has been applied due to the uncertainty of realization   the companys tax expense differs from the expected tax expense for federal income tax purposes computed by applying the united states federal tax rate of  and state tax rate of  to income before taxes as follows     six month period ended june  unaudited   us dollars            tax expense benefit at the statutory rate           state income taxes net of federal income tax benefit             change in valuation allowance             total               the tax effects of the temporary differences between reportable financial statement income and taxable income are recognized as deferred tax assets and liabilities   in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment   a valuation allowance has been applied due to the uncertainty of realization   as of june   and june   the company has net operating losses from operations the carry forwards expire through the year  the companys net operating loss carry forward may be subject to annual limitations which could reduce or defer the utilization of the losses as a result of an ownership change as defined in section  of the internal revenue code a

revenue from operations   for the three month period ended june   and june    total revenue was  as we have not commenced revenue generating operations following the discontinuance of our florida wall bed operation in may       table of contents     general and administrative expenses – related party   for the three month period ended june   and june   related party operating expenses were  and  respectively the decrease in expenses between the two periods is directly related to the reduction of management fees paid to the service provider   general and administrative expenses   for the three month period ended june   and june   general and administrative expenses were  and  respectively which consist of those expenses related to the current operations of the company   net income loss   as a result of the factors described above there was a net loss of  and  for the three month period ended june   and  respectively   liquidity and capital resources   general   at june   we had cash and cash equivalents of  we have historically met our cash needs through cash flows from operating activities however since the discontinuation of our florida wall bed operation the controlling shareholders have pledged to continue their support to fund the continuing operations as necessary  our cash requirements are generally for general and administrative activities we have raised capital through officer loans during the current previous fiscal year we believe that our cash balance is not sufficient to finance our cash requirements for expected operational activities capital improvements and therefore we will require additional funding through officer loans   in the event we are unable to generate sufficient funds to continue our business efforts or if we are pursued by a larger company for a business combination we will analyze all strategies to continue the company and maintain or increase shareholder value under these circumstances we would consider a merger acquisition joint venture strategic alliance a rollup or other business combination for the purposes of continuing the business and maintaining or increasing shareholder value management believes its responsibility to maintain shareholder value is of paramount importance which means we should consider the aforementioned alternatives in the event funding is not available on favorable terms to us when needed   operating activities   our continuing operating activities used cash of  and of  for the six month period ended june   and  respectively   investing activities   we neither generated nor used funds in continuing investing activities during the six month period ended month period ended june   or    financing activities   cash provided in our financing activities was  for the six month period ended june   compared to cash provided of  during the comparable period in  during the six month period ended june   the majority shareholder loaned the company       table of contents     going concern   the accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business we had no ongoing business or other source of income and incurred a net loss of  for the six month period ended june   these factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time   we are currently evaluating acquisitions and other business opportunities the ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon us generating profitable operations in the future andor obtaining the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due no assurance can be given that we will be successful in these efforts   income taxes   we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date   we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized in making such determination we consider all available positive and negative evidence including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent financial operations in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income taxes   inflation   inflation does not materially affect our business or the results of our operations   offbalance sheet arrangements   we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements   critical accounting policies   we prepare our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of the united states gaap gaap represents a comprehensive set of accounting and disclosure rules and requirements the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period our actual results could differ from those estimates we use historical data to assist in the forecast of our future results deviations from our projections are addressed when our financials are reviewed on a monthly basis this allows us to be proactive in our approach to managing our business it also allows us to rely on proven data rather than having to make assumptions regarding our estimates      table of contents     recent accounting pronouncements   we have reviewed all the recently issued but not yet effective accounting pronouncements and we do not believe any of these pronouncements will have a material impact on the company financial statements   item  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   we are a smaller reporting company as defined by item f of regulation sk and as such are not required to provide the information contained in this item pursuant to item  of regulation sk   item  controls and procedures   disclosure controls and procedures   the management of the company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting the companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the companys chief executive officer and chief financial officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the companys financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles     with respect to the period ending june   under the supervision and with the participation of our management we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules ae and de promulgated under the securities exchange act of      based upon our evaluation regarding the period ending june   the companys management including its principal executive officer has concluded that its disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the companys limited internal resources and lack of ability to have multiple levels of transaction review material weaknesses noted are lack of an audit committee lack of a majority of outside directors on the board of directors resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures and management is dominated by two individuals without adequate compensating controls however management believes the financial statements and other information presented herewith are materially correct     the companys disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives however the companys management including its principal executive officer does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected      table of contents     part ii – other information   item  legal proceedings   we were not subject to any legal proceedings during the six months ended june   nor to the best of our knowledge and belief are any

materially from those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements as a result of certain factors discussed elsewhere in this annual report overview we were incorporated in the state of florida on june   under the name quality wallbeds inc in december  we changed our name in anticipation of new business opportunities in the distribution of petrochemical products in the automotive industry from our inception through may  we provided custom home furniture and closet organizing systems we discontinued our wall bed operations in may  since then we have focused our efforts on exploring various business opportunities to determine the best strategic business direction although we have not abandoned the business model for the distribution of petrochemical products in the automotive industry we are also pursuing mergers and acquisitions of nonpetrochemical companies in asia and the united states since the change in the business model current management has seen a direct impact on our revenues future cash flows if any are impossible to predict at this time we may raise cash from sources other than our operations our only other source for cash at this time is loans from our chairman andy fan any change in our strategic business direction may take years to complete and future cash flows if any are impossible to predict at this time  table of contents results of operations the following table provides a comparison of a summary of our results for the fiscal years ended december   and  fiscal years ended december     change revenue       general and administrative  expense      general and administrative  related party     income loss from operations         net income loss        income loss per share basic  and diluted      revenue from operations for the fiscal year ended december   there was no revenue general and administrative expenses during the fiscal year ended december   general and administrative expenses of  consist of those expenses related to the payment of our securities and exchange commission sec and exchange act reporting filing expenses including associated accounting fees and any potential business ventures general and administrative expenses  related party during the fiscal year ended december   operating expenses of  consist of those expenses related to the management fees paid to the service provider net income loss as a result of the factors described above we show a net loss of  for the fiscal year ended december   as compared to  for the fiscal year ended december   management believes the loss from operations is consistent with the change in direction liquidity and capital resources general at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of  we have met our cash needs through cash flows from officer loans throughout the current fiscal year our cash requirements are generally for general and administrative activities we believe that our cash balance is not sufficient to finance our cash requirements for expected operational activities capital improvements and therefore we will require additional funding in the event we are unable to generate sufficient funds to continue our business efforts or if we are pursued by a larger company for a business combination we will analyze all strategies to continue the company and maintain or increase shareholder value under these circumstances we would consider a merger acquisition joint venture strategic alliance a rollup or other business combination for the purposes of continuing the business and maintaining or increasing shareholder value management believes its responsibility to maintain shareholder value is of paramount importance which means we should consider the aforementioned alternatives in the event funding is not available on favorable terms to us when needed  table of contents operating activities our continuing operating activities used cash of  and  for the fiscal years ended december   and  respectively investing activities we neither generated nor used funds in continuing investing activities during the fiscal years ended december   or  financing activities net cash from our financing activities was  for the fiscal year ended december   compared to  for the fiscal year ended december   as of december   our current assets exceed our liabilities going concern the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business we had no ongoing business or other source of income and incurred a net loss of  for the fiscal year ended december   these factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time we are currently evaluating acquisitions and other business opportunities the ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon us generating profitable operations in the future andor obtaining the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due no assurance can be given that we will be successful in these efforts income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized in making such determination we consider all available positive and negative evidence including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent financial operations in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income taxes inflation inflation does not materially affect our business or the results of our operations  table of contents offbalance sheet arrangements we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements critical accounting policies we prepare our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of the united states gaap gaap represents a comprehensive set of accounting and disclosure rules and requirements the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period our actual results could differ from those estimates we use historical data to assist in the forecast of our future results deviations from our projections are addressed when our financials are reviewed on a monthly basis this allows us to be proactive in our approach to managing our business it also allows us to rely on proven data rather than having to make assumptions regarding our estimates management does not believe that our actual results are related to any sensitivity in estimates made by management the yearend consistency of our results has shown that our prior years historical data is the best projector of our future results recent accounting pronouncements we have reviewed all the recently issued but not yet effective accounting pronouncements and we do not believe any of these pronouncements will have a material impact on our financial statements edgar online source glimpses  latest news on sichuan

shares of common stock will be eligible for sale under the securities act we will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the common stock offered through this prospectus we will however incur all costs associated with this registration statement and prospectus there is no minimum amount of shares that must be sold during this offering to compete effectively in our industry a company must understand and then respond to the specific needs of the client many of our competitors have greater financial resources than we have enabling them to finance acquisition and development opportunities or develop and support their own operations in addition many of these companies can offer additional product offerings not provided by us many also have greater name recognition our competitors may have the luxury of sacrificing profitability in order to capture a greater portion of the market consequently we may encounter significant competition in our efforts to achieve our growth objectives our competitors have methods of operation that have been proven over time to be successful since we are in a recessionary period our large competitors have chosen to advertise low prices in an effort to gain sales our former president lloyd burkley chose not to compete on a price basis and continued an advertising campaign based on quality our incoming president catherine a bradaick has extensive experience in advertising and the company has chosen to compete by offering quality products and time sensitive installations as the main selling points of our services it is too early to be able to analyze the results of this new advertising approach company description since incorporation on june   quality wallbeds inc has engaged in the operation of a furniture retail store specializing in the design construction and installation of wall beds closets and shelving quality wallbeds inc will continue to rely on its experience to try to be competitive in the marketing of its specialty wall bed systems closets and shelves we believe that because we use personnel experienced as spacesaving specialists for the home and business we may have a competitive advantage our company will continue to use personnel with experience in the design and installation of our product to try to maintain what we believe is a strong competitive edge due to recession that began in  we have seen a fluctuation in the number of clients utilizing our space saving options we believe we can increase our market share due to the quality of our organizing systems however there is no guarantee we will be able to do so by analyzing the advertising of other competitive companies we know that a low price advertising campaign for us will not be successful because competition has brought the pricing of our type of products to essentially the same price we believe that by concentrating our efforts on the quality of our products while providing for cost effectiveness we can grow and expand our business however there is no guarantee that we will be successful at achieving growth and expansion our st petersburg store is our sole location and our efforts at expansion are focused solely on gaining additional market share for this location through a concentrated advertising effort while our key personnel have over twelve  years’ experience in this business we do not believe that we have a competitive advantage as a result of this experience our competitors have personnel with more experience that may place us at a disadvantage with larger projects due to the number of competitors that have entered our target market experience has become less of a competitive advantage being in a market segment with a high number of competitors makes any investment in our company a high risk we do compete with many national wall bed businesses such as murphy’s bed outlet closets by design bedder bed and comfort zone wall beds these firms have experienced personnel years in business capitalization and a reputation that make it difficult for us to compete with as a result of such competition we will concentrate our efforts on trying to more fully develop the personal relationship approach to our
