product to earn ndis approval from the fbi approval represents major step toward widespread adoption of rapid dna analysis with potential to transform the use of dna in criminal justice april    am eastern daylight time waltham massbusiness wirenetbio announced today that its dnascan™ rapid dna analysis™ system has received national dna index system ndis approval from the federal bureau of investigation fbi the approval allows accredited ndis laboratories to upload dna samples processed by dnascan and match them against dna profiles associated with the fbi’s combined dna index system codis program without manual interpretation or technical review the fbi’s codis software is used to support criminal justice dna databases and to operate ndis this represents the fbi’s first and only approval of a fully automated system for “swab in profile out” rapid dna analysis rapid dna analysis technology accelerates the process of dna profile generation from days weeks or even months to less than  minutes the revolutionary technology can be used to quickly enroll qualifying offenders in ndis help generate and confirm investigative leads and exonerate the innocent because it allows dna samples to be processed outside of the existing laboratory workflow rapid dna technology empowers labs to focus resources on more complicated dna sample analyses and to help reduce sample backlogs a comprehensive developmental validation study evaluated the dnascan system’s overall process – from inserting swabs to profile generation including the instrument biochipset™ cassette str chemistry and data interpretation by the onboard expert system software the forensic science community expects this validation process to be undertaken for any new scientific technology introduced in the criminal justice system more than  samples were tested by leading forensic laboratories and the dnascan system successfully produced accurate reliable reproducible and robust results without manual processing ed davis former commissioner of the boston police department and member of netbio’s board of directors commented “a critical role of accredited codis laboratories is to evaluate new technology to ensure it adheres to federal and state standards prior to implementation since dnascan is the first rapid dna instrument to be considered for ndis approval it was important to make sure the study design was objective and robust this approval represents many years of hard work on the part of both netbio and federal and state law enforcement agencies approval for accredited ndis laboratory use is a critical first step and i look forward to the day when rapid dna analysis is an integral part of police station operations to improve public safety a fully automated rapid dna system has the potential to be a gamechanging tool for law enforcement” “ndis approval of the dnascan system is a major milestone here in the united states as well as in the many countries that look to the fbi as a global leader in forensic dna analysis” said richard selden ceo of netbio “we are thankful for the support and guidance from the fbi swgdam scientific working group on dna analysis methods and many forensic laboratories and law enforcement agencies over the years we have worked closely with our partner in the law enforcement market ge healthcare life sciences to ensure that our dnascan rapid dna analysis system generates results equivalent to those from a forensic laboratory we believe the dnascan system has the potential to contribute significantly to a safer society” about the developmental

the fbi’s rapid dna initiative the fbi’s rapid dna initiative aims to integrate rapid dna instruments effectively within the existing codis structure the fbi is leading the development of the regulatory and policy approach for use of rapid dna analysis both in forensic laboratories and during the booking process about the dnascan and ande systems the dnascan rapid dna analysis system is a
