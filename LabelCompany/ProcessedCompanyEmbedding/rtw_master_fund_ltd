investing institutional investors drawn to healthcare sector by keith button · july    am · updated  am opportunities in healthcare investing through hedge funds private equity funds and longonly equity strategies seem to be drawing increasing interest from institutional investors but not all areas of the sector are flourishingone indicator of the interest is the growth of us healthcare mutual funds for institutional investors over the last  months according to morningstar total net assets for those funds have increased to  billion as of may  up from  billion as of nov   and from  billion as of june   institutional investors are very interested in the healthcare sector now especially because of excellent returns in healthcare subsectors including the stocks of drug manufacturers insurance companies and providers said roderick wong chief investment officer and managing partner of rtw investments llc a healthcare hedge fund firm in new york with  million in assets under management for some sectors the returns are about  so far in  mr wong said related coverage why venture capital firms are pouring money into health insurance drug royalties in a real asset portfolio healthcare royalties fund closes at  billion equities energy strategies give some firms the edge in quarter rtws offshore fund rtw master fund ltd was up  for  through june and up  for  both net of fees according to the firmthe hfri eh sector — technologyhealthcare index is up  for  through june in comparison the hfri fund weighted composite index is up  for the same periodhealthcare reform also is driving institutional investor interest in the space mr wong said the affordable healthcare act will add up to  million people to the insured rolls the aca is “clearly a short and mediumterm net positive for many players in health care” mr wong saidcarter neild a general partner at healthcare investment firm orbimed advisors llc new york said he sees institutional investor interest in the healthcare sector driven more by innovation in the industry and drug launches and less by the aca changes last year for example the us food and drug administration approved  new drugs a year highorbimed is considered the largest healthcare investment manager in the world with about  billion under management that includes about  billion in hedge funds  billion in longonly equity funds  billion in private equity funds and  million in healthcare royalty fundswithin health care investor interest has varied according to wide disparities in returns royalty funds the illiquid investment vehicles that monetize royalties for drugs or medical devices are “white hot” and wildly oversubscribed because they provide great returns and steady cash flow in a lownointerest environment mr neild said and only a handful of health care royalty fund managers exist including orbimed dri capital corp of toronto royalty healthcare partners of stamford conn capital royalty lp of houston and royalty pharma of new york venture capital an exception in contrast the returns for healthcare venture capital funds are tanking along with investor interest in the space mr neild said healthcare venture capital primarily investing in the biopharmaceutical or medical device space has typically made up about  of the total venture spaceawful returns for the space are killing fundraising “those funds are just dying theres massive attrition” mr neild said “many of these groups that have been in business for a long long time will just disband”among the established venture capital firms that have publicly indicated they will not raise another health care venture fund are skyline ventures of palo alto calif scale venture partners of foster city calif essex woodlands health ventures of palo alto and prospect venture partners also of palo altofor longonly healthcare strategies and longshort equity healthcare hedge funds returns have generally reflected the healthy returns of healthcare public equities and the nasdaq biotechnology index for one benchmark is up about  for  through july  whether the healthcare sector in general experiences a longterm sustainable profit boost as a result of aca reforms will depend on what mechanisms are created to control prices and healthcare utilization mr wong said but the drug and biotech sectors are wellpositioned for longterm profitability he saidthe current productivity boom in drug discovery will translate into “real value creation” through important new drugs that have a significant impact on disease mr wong said “we are in the early stages of a research productivity boom that should fill pipelines for the next decade or more” he saidendowments and foundations in the  million to  billion range and larger family offices seem to have a real appetite for the health care investment strategies followed by ra capital management llc said michael calore director of investor relations for the hybrid hedgeprivate equity fund manager the bostonbased manager runs more than  million investing in smallcap developmentstage biotech companiesuncorrelated alpha health care has become attractive for institutional investors in part because uncorrelated alpha which is harder to find in other segments is available from the good managers in the space mr calore said and with health care product development companies developing technologies at faster rates and deeppocketed big pharmaceutical companies looking to acquire technologies through mergers and acquisitions fund managers have a lot of opportunities in the space he saidferenc sanderson a partner in previnvest a pension fund advisory a pension fund consultant and research firm based in cleveland and rome italy said institutional investor interest in health care has definitely received a boost from the acaover the first five months of the year longshort equity hedge funds have moved more into healthcare stocks mr sanderson said through april yeartodate stock prices in the health care sector of the sp  were up  second only to the utilities sectoranother factor has been the high level of consolidation in the healthcare industry especially with hospitals in urban areas mostly driven by pressure to reduce costs he saida third factor has been the boom in retirement and specialty healthcare facilities such as those that treat alzheimers patients as occupancy rates have increased because this sector is characterized by steady returns over the long term a lot of private equity firms and some institutional investors such as university endowments with large real estate portfolios are jumping in mr sanderson saidother exposure a lot of the hedge fund money invested in health care is through multistrategy funds not pure health care plays rather in stocks of large companies that are outside of the sector but stand to benefit from changes in technology platforms insurance and pharmaceuticals that aca will bring“thats the opportunity its the big picture which is the real alpha story i think” mr sanderson said “when youve got consolidations of companies theres going to be winners and losers when youve got consolidation of data theres opportunities if you can capture that data and manage it”institutional investors also might have more riding on healthcare investments than what meets the eye for a typical global longshort equity hedge fund healthcare sector positions might be less than  but considering related companies — tech insurance and real estate investments that will be affected by the healthcare industry changes — the exposure could be more than  mr sanderson said“the opportunity is a lot bigger and its a lot more widespread than buying a cheap drug company and selling a rich one” he said “its a lot more than that its the whole ecosystem of health care which is up for grabs basically and that applies globally”“ive heard managers talk up their book that way but i havent heard any clients say yeah ive got to have some of that” mr sanderson said while a handful of health care hedge funds have performed well most of them have struggled he saidin all of the three main areas of sector hedge funds — health care energy and natural resources and technology — only a few funds have performed well over time and very few of them are anywhere near their historical asset peak the consultant said news equities hedge
