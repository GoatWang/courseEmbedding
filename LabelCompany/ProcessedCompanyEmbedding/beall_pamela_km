excerpt from the oil  gas master limited partnerships report the president of mplx lp mplx discusses company strategy and the outlook for this vital industrytwst lets start with kind of an introduction to mplx by way of some company history and a little overview of the business and assets todayms beall mplx is still a relatively new master limited partnership it became a publicly traded mlp in october of  mplx was formed by its sponsor company marathon petroleum corporation to own and operate its midstream assets and to be the primary growth vehicle for the mpc midstream business mplx is primarily feebased and is in the business of pipeline transportation for crude oil and finished products including products like gasoline and diesel and jet fuels and that represents about plus of the business mplx also has another asset in its business which is a  million barrel butane cavern located just outside of marathon petroleums catlettsburg kentucky refineryabout  of the revenues for mplx are derived from fercbased tariffs so mplx is able to maintain a relatively constant cash flow because of the tariff revenue structure of the business mplx has also entered into longterm transportation and storage agreements with mpc and that also ensures the stable cash flow for the company there is no direct exposure to commodity risk and that too allows for very consistent cash flow so those are the assets today in mplx thats what the operation is comprised oftwst does marathon petroleum remain your largest or most significant customerms beall yes and it probably will be for the foreseeable future about  of the revenue is derived from mpc and so naturally most of our business will revolve around the mpc operations as you may know marathon petroleum is the fourthlargest refiner in the united states today its the largest refiner in padd  which includes the midcontinent part of the united states and mpcs operations are situated very near some of the growing shale oil and gas developments where we see a lot of production growth that will benefit mpc and it will also create a need for midstream infrastructure investments to move production of oil and gas to consuming refineries including marathon petroleums refineriesand then in addition to the shale growth whats going on infor more of this interview and many others visit the wall street
