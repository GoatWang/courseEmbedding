delivered another quarter of solid results exceeding both our gaap and adjusted earnings guidance this was driven primarily by strong revenues in our residential segment and the continued benefits of our four pillar value creation strategy consolidated revenues of  million were down  essentially in line with our expectations the decrease was due mainly to difficult yearoveryear comparison as we sold the european industrial and solar businesses exited the us bar grating market and experience low activity levels in our industrial and infrastructure segments despite this we delivered gaap earnings of  and adjusted earnings of  per share compared to our guidance of gaap eps between  and  and adjusted eps between  and  respectfully our return on invested capital in q on a trailing month basis increased to  from  last year and our balance sheet continues to improve during the quarter we continued to advance our fourpillar strategy with several notable achievements this included delivering  basis points of operating margin enhancement through our  operational initiatives improving our competitive position and financial results by effectively integrating our recent package concierge and nexus acquisitions and advancing our innovation strategy with new product development initiatives across all our segments in fact we expect increased activity in revenues in the second half of the year as our innovation efforts begin yielding results across the organization i will expand on these strategic initiatives in more detail later in the call while we are very pleased with our performance so far this year and our ability to execute on our plan the uncertainty in the steel market and resulting raw material pricing dynamic are expected to continue to pressure our result taken in total were maintaining our full year guidance and i will speak more about our guidance and our progress on each pillar after tim reviews our financial tim tim murphy thank you frank and good morning everyone let’s move to slide  in the presentation entitled solid consolidated results versus headwinds we reported a solid second quarter with earnings exceeding our expectations strong results in our residential products segment and the full benefit of our recent acquisitions offset challenging comp on the top and bottom lines for our industrial and infrastructure and renewable and energy conservation segment as we did last quarter we want to highlight gibraltar’s performance on an applestoapples basis excluding divestiture and other nonrepeating factors our base revenues were down  essentially in line with expectation in addition to the anticipated lower backlog our bottom line was negatively affected by uncertainty in the steel markets as frank noted which impacted earnings by  during the quarter while our proactive portfolio management actions created difficult yearoveryear revenue comparison we continue to make good progress towards realizing the benefits of our divestiture including reduced investments in working capital fixed assets in overhead and an improved total return on capital we continue to see increased spending activity and growing backlogs in both our renewable energy and conservation and industrial and infrastructure segment which gives us confidence for the second half of the year next lets talk about each of our three reporting segments starting with slide  the residential product segment the continued improvement in new housing construction and repair and remodeling activity and growing demand for commercial package solutions drove the increase in sales for the quarter we continue to make very positive progress in centralized mailboxes and electronic package lockers and the integration of package concierge has contributed incremental revenues on the bottom line we benefited from increased revenues from growing demand for repair and remodeling new build housing and electronic parcel lockers along with operational efficiencies from our  mission turning the slide  the industrial and infrastructure products segment on a yearoveryear basis segment revenues reflect our exit from us bar grating and european industrial businesses accounting for  million of the  million decline in this segment the remainder of the decline was a result of reduced sales at our infrastructure business during the quarter an increased bidding in our infrastructure business translated into higher level bookings and another quarter of sequential backlog growth the infrastructure team is also expanding its geographical reach within the us and continues to focus on  initiatives with increased availability of matching funds in some of our key states we expect this business to continue to build its backlog as the year progresses on the bottom line industrial margins continue to be pressured by increases in raw material cost we expect material prices to continue to impact earnings however with  projects continuing to show good results and the continued traction of our innovative perimeter security solutions we expect improved profitability for this segment in the second half of  now turning to slide  renewable energy and conservation segment our top line was affected by declining international revenues and a difficult comparison due to our exit of european solar racking business partially offset by the benefits of the nexus acquisitions higher material costs and pricing actions along with product development costs and a few field installation issues impacted our bottom line results we had anticipated an incremental improvement in adjusted operating margins from the first quarter our adjusted operating margin of  is  basis points below the adjusted operating margin of  realized in the first quarter we encountered some unusual field installation issues relating to ground conditions varying widely throughout a few specific job sites and these challenges resulted in  basis point reduction in our second quarter margin we expect improved profitability in the second half of the year from this segment were heading into the seasonally strongest part of year with higher backlog than year ago and continuing levels of bidding activity that are higher in addition while we expect to be continued to be affected by pricing actions and material costs the benefits from volume leverage and continued simplification efforts will provide a significant improvement in segment operating margins as we make our way through reminder of the year as a remainder our solar business is a leading manufacturer and installer of fixed tilt solar rack with the leading market share domestically our solar business’ distinct advantage is in smaller scale community solar and commercial projects under  megawatts due to its unique position as the only provider offering fully integrated solutions of site layout racking design structural engineering manufacturing and installation while the large scale utility market is challenged in  the small scale projects we participate in continue to show steady albeit lower singledigit growth particularly in the southeast and northeast where we have higher market participation and with our new product development initiative we have entered an adjacent market as frank will detail later in the call finally for this segment our greenhouse business continues to take advantage of the rising organic food trend and growth of medical marijuana markets as more states finalize policies and procedures we are poised to capitalize on increased activity in those markets during the second half of the year please turn to slide  capturing the opportunity we continue to have low leverage and high liquidity which allows us to execute on our acquisition strategy and target larger size company cash increased  million from  million at december   to  million at the end of the second quarter as we said previously we’ve been targeting companies with ebitda from  million up to  million while we would still consider smaller acquisitions that could benefit us from a technology standpoint we continue to work on targets that will be material to our performance for the second half of  the financial priorities will be to accelerate sales through innovative products keep value added acquisitions in attractive end markets continue to advance our  initiatives and effectively manage higher raw material costs at this point i will turn it back to frank to review our progress on our four pillar strategy and our guidance going forward please turn to slide  four pillars driving value creation frank frank heard thanks tim our four pillar value creation strategy continues to gain traction and deliver results our first pillar of operational excellence is focused on reducing complexity adjusting costs and simplifying our product offerings through our  initiatives across the organization as i noted earlier in q our  projects contribute to  basis points of operating margin improvement and as a result we now have delivered saving of  million or  per share from simplification projects through the first half of this year and were well on our way to delivering the expected  cents per share increase from these projects in  were currently finalizing our plans for inlining activities and it begun to take advantage of opportunities to outsource our b product training new teams in  presents further opportunity to enhance our margins most recently we trained the teams from our newly acquired nexus and package concierge businesses on the  process package concierge has historically focused on one segment the multifamily residential end market and it has now developed significant complexity so the opportunity there is in using the trade folks and target selling tools and using the other tools to avoid complexity as they grow nexus business provides an opportunity to apply the complete toolkit and the team is focusing on data analysis in identifying projects that would provide meaningful improvement to its results our portfolio management pillar is focused on evaluating product lines customers and end markets to best allocate leadership time and resources to the highest potential platforms and businesses in  we exited two industrial platforms as well as our european solar racking business serving the residential rooftop market at this point the industrial asset sale was complete and the european solar operations are closed well continue to evaluate end markets and the related businesses as part of our portfolio management initiative our third pillar is innovation and we define innovative products as those with patent protection driven by internal product development or acquired product line we generated  of our sales from patented products in  todate up from  in  and were making exciting progress with new product development across all our business in the residential segment we officially launched our new expanded parcel delivery solution during the quarter at the  national apartment association education conference  exposition in atlanta in combination with our express locker this product will allow us to target larger properties in the high density multifamily residential market one customer commented that theyre happy that we have another product offered that is more affordable for their b assets and thirdparty development and another stated the express system looks great and the quality really shows also in our residential segment our new metal roofing installation system that can withstand hurricane force winds is gaining traction and were now finalizing our broader and more aggressive market launch in partnership with a dedicated dealer and installer network in our industrial segment we continue to advance our perimeter security products initiative capitalize on increasing demand for solutions that protect high value physical asset we now have a dedicated sales team for this solution and our pipeline of opportunities is actively building we continue to expect our perimeter security products to contribute to both top and bottom line growth in  and beyond in our renewable energy and conservation segment were excited to announce that weve introduced a new and innovative solar tracking solution to a few current customers in advance of a general market launch its unique technology allows us to enter our largest adjacent space relative to fixed tilt space we participate in today the economics of tracker versus fixed tilt is very sight specific and will determine which solution any customer chooses to implement combined with rbi’s unique value proposition and our current customer partnerships this exciting new tracking solution should allow us to gain incremental revenues from projects that we have not been able to participate in historically gtm research estimates that the us tracker market will grow approximately  annually between  and  we installed our first system during the second quarter and we expect to install a handful more during the remainder of the year our fourth pillar is growth through acquisition and we continue to make very good progress in this area during the quarter we completed the integration of package concierge in our residential products segment and were already seeing the benefits of combining package concierge’s proprietary software solution and deep understanding of the multifamily market with our express locker product capability with an expanded suite of integrated solutions we can grow in new markets and deliver more value to our existing customers and shareholders in our renewable energy and conservation segment we continue to see the benefits from our recent nexus acquisition which as a reminder has been accretive since the date of acquisition in concert with our rough brothers business nexus is accelerating our growth in the conservation market particularly as it relates to the commercial greenhouse segment and the rapidly growing medical marijuana market we continue to evaluate ma prospects that present opportunities to enhance our market share drive operational improvements and longterm shareholder value we’re focused on candidates with attractive end market and unique technologies that solve real end user problems with meaningful prospects for the balance of  turning to slide   guidance as i mentioned earlier were maintaining our full year  guidance we continue to expect generally favorable market conditions for our residential segment and increased bidding activities and continued backlog growth in our industrial infrastructure renewable energy and conservation segment for the third quarter we expect revenues between  million and  million up approximately  from q  on a base revenue basis we expect consolidated gaap eps between  and  per diluted share or between  and  on an adjusted basis for full year  we continue to expect sales in the range of  million to  million up  percentage points and  percentage points in base revenue with gaap eps between  and  per diluted share up from  prior year or  to  on an adjusted basis please turn to slide  and you can see a detailed bridge from our  adjusted eps to our guidance for  given the market uncertainties raw material costs did not decline as we expected at the end of the first quarter weve provided enough data bridge which includes an additional  of material costs in the second half of the year the resulting reduction in net income will be off by lower variable compensation our compensation performance programs are designed to reward making more money at a higher rate of return with a more efficient use of capital and we expect earnings to be relatively flat with return on invested capital improving modestly on a yearoveryear basis in conclusion we expect to deliver another consecutive year of solid financial improvement on a gaap basis in terms of absolute profit dollars returns in cash flow were confident that our four pillar strategy and our ability to continue to execute against it will build sustainable longterm value for our shareholders at this point we will open the call up for any questions that you may have questionandanswer session operator thank you we will now be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question will be coming from ken zener of keybanc capital markets please go ahead ken zener good morning gentlemen frank heard good morning ken how are you ken zener doing well this might be more than a two part question so i apologize in advance just on the first thing as it relates to guidance it seems as though the corporate line declined quite a bit could you go into that certainly versus what we had expected so maybe we are bad modelers but could you go into why that decline sequentially and what the bogie is for the full year on that line item frank heard yeah ken if you think about we talk about performance comp going down not all of that but a fair amount of it will come through the corporate lines so full year we’re seeing  most of that’s going to show up in corporate ken zener when you say  let see… frank heard that would equate to about – that’s worth about  million ken zener okay so lower than last year is what you are saying on a delta basis frank heard yeah ken zener and then how – could you give us sensitivity i expect  the performance comp is that related to the equity price and then what’s in sensitivity there for whatever  change if that’s the case frank heard so it’s – there’s components to it right so you’ve got a piece of it that’s related to our current year performance against targets and another piece that is current year roic generated against the targets we set and last year and year before that as we came out of sort of our historical low levels of performance we saw significant improvements in operating results in roic each year and we’ve set aggressive targets each year and we were able to exceed those this year we set aggressive targets again we are really coming at the bottom end of those ranges and so there is not a lot of performance comp coming through and that’s probably half of the cost and then the other half is share price appreciation again last year significant share price appreciation this year it looks like it’s flattening out ken zener okay that’s interesting taking a step up in the income statement because there is that offset of roughly  million could you kind of give us i guess that – and i apologize if i missed it i was looking – i thought i was looking in the slide but – because there is  million less in corporate could you kind of give us the new bogie for ebit most of my questions are going to revolve around solar so segment ebit for the year just so we can get a sense of the first second half cadence because that  million out well we are in corporate it seems like it would an impact in your segment ebit expectation so if you could clarify that that would be useful frank heard so i think it will mainly impact the industrial infrastructure and the renewables business and it will be relatively spread across those two based on revenues and it’s not – there’s some offset within there because of a little bit of that performance comp shows up in the business unit ken zener okay again driving right into solar then i think that remains the biggest element that people are trying to understand and i – it’s not – i know you guys hosted a very nice sell site event for solar but because that – not all that stuff was necessarily out there in the public domain from you i wonder if you might be able to help us out because your execution on  in your portfolio management i think everything is very good there so given some comments that have been made around solar in general it remains complex so i wonder if you might be able to bookmark a few points just so people can be clear i don’t know if you wouldn’t talk about last year’s megawatts installed and the reason i say that is that there is certainly a cause i fielded point to you guys being in some rather large projects so i don’t know if you can kind of book in if your top  projects with that  of your megawatts or a third because some people are under the impression let’s say your top  projects would be a very large percentage of your portfolio not just the  megawatt to  megawatt installation frank heard ken i would say that’s inconsistent with our historical distribution of revenues and profits we’ve consistently stated that we’re really focused on the small end of the market it’s not that we don’t have any but it’s not where we focus our business there is a small percentage ken zener okay so i would say under  i mean just from a magnitude is that a fair bookmark frank heard i’m not going to give a specific percentage but that’s directionally correct ken zener good i’m not trying to put you guys on the spot there i’m just trying to – it’s hard for me to respond to investors comment so i just kind of want you guys to directionally not specifically and the next thing is with that change in corporate could you kind of talk about the margins that you are seeing right now into q and i realized there’s been backlog shift but the backlog – generally you guys have talked about that being about a quarter out so if that is the case what is q kind of looking at i know one of you talked about q versus q you said it was going to be up and it was down and kind of highlighted these installations issues so could you give us a sense of what the cadence looks like q and what you are thinking about q because this is obviously where this has been tugofwar as well around where you are going to be normalized tim murphy yeah so i’m not sure if this will answer it but why don’t i walk you from – try to walk through from q to q on the company and i think we’ve got a pretty big increase in earnings quarter to quarter and so i would describe that as mainly driven by volume as we head into the seasonally stronger period for our renewables and conservation their third quarter and fourth quarter are significantly higher both because the greenhouse side of the business is really a second half business seasonality wise and the solar business maybe less extent than the greenhouse side but still picks up more on the second half and we see that on our industrial and infrastructure business the industrial is coming out of – we went through a process domestically where they exited half of their business at the end of the year first quarter and there were some disruption in that business and distraction that is now behind us and our sales teams are already focused on customers and then i would say some of that noise in the system is gone and so we are seeing improving order rates as we move through the year we are seeing them now so i’d say those two are the big volume drivers the residential business second third quarter are peak in there so we don’t really expect to drop off here but really the other two are going to come up with volume through seasonality so we see incremental improvement frank heard yeah and ken it’s frank the only thing i would add to that comment is that the growing backlog that we experienced in the second quarter is reflective of how that would translate into real work and revenue opportunities that’s built into our guidance and the third as it relates businesses like renewable energy and specifically solar so when you reference kind of the  days or so one quarter out that’s consistent with what we’ve seen in our backlog rising as it compares to prior year comparables as well so just to come back to your question on renewable ken zener right and i guess just and then i will be quite basically it sounds like that  million lower corporate is coming out obviously it’s segment income given that your annual ebit your annual earnings indiscernible tim murphy correct ken maybe if you go to the bridge on the slides ken zener yeah tim murphy increased material cost component by the same amount as we see the performance comp coming down we think they are just going to offset each other ken zener thank you very much frank heard thanks ken operator thank you our next is coming from daniel moore of cjs securities please go ahead daniel moore good morning frank heard good morning dan daniel moore frank i appreciate it tim just a sort of follow up on some of those things but in renewable last quarter you mentioned customers pushing out projects activity was there but things were just getting stretched a bit backlogs and activity up once again just provide a little bit more color on your confidence what you’re seeing into  this far in july in terms of bidding activity actually translating into more installed any changes in the landscape there you can describe would be really helpful frank heard i would say that we were at the end of the year we knew the first quarter was going to be below the prior year at the year of the first quarter we expected the second quarter domestically equal the prior year with growth in the back half and in the second quarter our domestic business was essentially equal to what we were last year and higher backlog forecasting our expectations both in the second half tim murphy yes dan growth in the second half and maybe an incremental tailwind with the new product launch that will gain traction as we see fit over the balance of the year daniel moore got it and any additional color you mentioned the unusual field conditions maybe it’s kind of the first time we’ve heard about that just any color you might add there and confidence that was sort of a oneoff frank heard yes so it’s a project based business and each side is different and as you know we go out to the sites and we do testing beforehand and in few specific projects this quarter and as unusual form and we’re doing install they ran into unexpected subsurface conditions around areas of the site and so it drives up labor cost and sometimes you have to switch out components as something work or maybe there is rocks underneath where we didn’t expect them tim murphy we’ve always over the two years we’ve learned that there is always these types of things in terms of puts and takes and they tend to be offsetting some projects come through with lower installation labor cost because it manages on site conditions and other times they come in the other way around overtime they tend to offset it’s the view of our management team in that business that needs particular examples were quite unusual in terms of their history in the market and they don’t see it repeating daniel moore got it helpful and then switching gears to industrial an area where you talked about some incremental activity and backlog growth as well just remind us what percentage of the segment is tied specifically to highway bridge repair et cetera and what are your expectations obviously it’s early to give  guidance but given the highway bill expectations for the potential for incremental growth as we look out to  and beyond thanks tim murphy dan so it’s about a third of the segment with the infrastructure side and we’re seeing growing backlog in there we’re seeing activity in some of our key states that we participate in historically fixed funding activity in the last six to eight months so indiscernible federal matching funds available but the states didn’t necessarily have the funds to match that seems to be generally behind them there is mechanisms in place now that the funding in place and so they are doing  the bidding activity is going on they are writing contracts and we’re seeing that in our bidding activity and the contracts but because our products going at the end of the bridge and rebuilt or built we have longer leadtime share so what we see coming in now is going to shift in  and  so too early to give guidance but our indications from what we see today is that revenues will grow in that business as we move over the next few years frank heard yes and i think tim’s commentary represents a consistent theme over the last year or two as we’ve been referencing this market and its related business within it i think the one thing that is really encouraged is that different is that want to talk about funding the matching some of things being resolved it’s not only translated into more bidding activity which has been a historical story line we’re actually starting to see us win more jobs are being crystallized not just the bidding aspect of it and we’re winning our fair share which for the first time we’re starting to see a rising backlog in the business which is a real positive trend because that’s going to drive our future revenues and ultimately some pretty significant leverage in terms of profitability because obviously over the last couple of years we’ve taken a lot of cost out of the business through the  process so incremental revenues are going to be great attractive to this business going forward daniel moore got it perfect and then lastly and i’ll jump back just in terms of new product development maybe any updated comments around perimeter security and any other – obviously you mentioned the tracker i guess too early to tell what percentage of your renewable or of your solar revenue that might turn into but any thoughts around that would be helpful thank you tim murphy yes it’s early days with the product i think what we really see with the product is we have customers today that do both fixed tilt and tracking solutions and we don’t have a product – historically we didn’t have a product to participate on the tracking side tracking market is a big market we are entering with zero share so we think there is opportunity for incremental revenue growth from a market that we don’t participate today frank heard yes and i think just a little bit more color on that this has been – we have strong relationships with the fixed tilt in the space we participate within fixed tilt and this has been a product that many of our customers have asked over the last few years because lot of times depending on the – this is all site specific as to whether or not use fixed tilt or tracker in site specific match just in terms of the land and the geography and where it’s positioned relative to the sun but it’s also which state and what power purchase agreement the particular job is attached to drives the particular choice by the developer or the utility so not having both choices we restricted our addressable market so the guys have resolved that and they’ve tried to resolve it with on a – from a solutions perspective that would provide a little bit more flexibility as to how the product could be applied to a given set of circumstances geographically and it’s a very cost effective solution so i think sometimes you have a great idea you can develop a great product solve a lot of problems but if you don’t have a channel to the market it’s just a great idea sitting on a shelf in this particular case they haven’t established route to market with long term relationship so i think that gives us some optimism as to maybe they can move into the space with similar kinds of progress that they did six or seven years ago when they moved from the greenhouse base into the initial fixed tilt space so we’ll see we’re trying to be conservative in terms of our approach to get the product right work with select group of customers and so far we’re quite pleased with the progress and we wouldn’t work on any of these initiatives unless we felt over the three year period that they would be a meaningful contribution in terms of gibraltar’s moving the needle for gibraltar’s operating income going forward so they certainly – this project certainly falls in that – through that filter and we’re pleased with their progress i think when you look at the other projects we got perimeter security the metal roofing certainly the purchase of package concierge to accelerate our expresslocker placement in the multifamily space is very quickly proving to be the right decision in terms of that acquisition i went down and participated in the nutshell in atlanta i don’t know how many thousands of people came through from that industry segment but if this was large show and package concierge in partnership with florence with expresslocker certainly was a future boost and the large property owners across the country package concierge’s leadership team certainly demonstrate it they have close relationships and partnerships with them and now that the expanded product line allowing them to – they’ve always focused on five to eight properties which is the high end  of the multifamily market new product launch that they bid that show allows them to chase the  of those eventful properties that the same owners hold but didn’t have a product solution for and since that launch they’re making some tremendous progress in terms of doing larger portfolio deals instead of selling the ones and twos they’re selling blocks of sites now so we’re quite enthusiastic about the progress they are making tim you want to comment on metal roofing residential perimeter security tim murphy yes the metal roofing initiative our team is doing some trade focused and doing some training with certified installers in one state to late launch throughout the year i think it will probably take because of the channel to market so this will take a little bit longer to get significant growth out of it and i think we’re really seeing volume in that area in the second set in  and beyond and perimeter security indiscernible occurs there is longer lead times on those projects it’s not a product sale so you’re indiscernible a couple of times before contracts get indiscernible we’re encouraged by the activity we see and the interest that our customers will demonstrate daniel moore call you again thank you frank heard thanks tim murphy thanks dan operator our next question is coming from walter liptak of seaport global securities please go ahead walter liptak hi thanks good morning guys frank heard good morning wal how are you walter liptak good thanks i’m just going to circle up on some questions that have already been asked and hope to get a little bit more color on the answers but raw material cost you call that as a headwind i wonder and you said that you’re going to be working on projects in the back half of the year to improve margins i understand the bonus compensation indiscernible is an offset but are there other things that you can do on pricing or on supply chain that can mitigate some of that price cost or raw material cost problem that you’re having frank heard yes we are certainly working on a number of actions but as we speak here today having gone through another quarter in this environment current outlook reflects what we know today so where our certainly actions being looked at customers all the time we try to fairly allocate cost and value there is just a lot of uncertainty in the raw material materials on what the future holds and so that’s only prices may be higher than we would have probably like to anticipate walter liptak okay have you gone to the market with any price increases during the quarter and can you talk about any success or push back you’ve gotten frank heard i would say yes and we’ve had some success if we would have had complete success we wouldn’t have this cost there right so every customer conversation is unique walter liptak okay just going to the renewable segment can you tell us about in your comments i think you mentioned that there was a larger job with the new product that you worked on during the second quarter if i heard that right or that there was one maybe there you would be working on the second half so wonder about the size now of these new product jobs and tracker jobs and maybe if there is anything that’s factored into the  revenue guidance for the renewable tim murphy i would say we did a small job this is our first one we did in the second quarter which is a small job we’ve got a handful of other certainly call them small jobs or not larger than what we normally will be doing in our tracker space anyway and the jobs are in backlog frank heard are in our forecast tim murphy now we have some anticipated opportunities for growth walter liptak okay all right fair enough and then on the last quarter conference call you talked about midteens margins for the renewable segment and language changed a little bit you said significant improvement in margins and i wonder if you can talk about just where you think the midteens for the full year margin is it still something that doable or is it with the second quarter margin where it is – it’s going to be a step back from your previous thoughts tim murphy so what we had anticipated was margins approaching the midteens as we move through the year so we expected them in the second half and this material cost impact on this business indiscernible   from what our previous expectations were depending on how the rest of the year plays out walter liptak okay all right great and then the last one from me is page  in the slide has the acquisitions i guess the revenue contribution from package concierge and nexus and is there – i wonder about seasonality of the revenue so for package concierge what are you expecting for contribution in the second half it’s  million for the quarter and for nexus too it looks like  million for the quarter what do you expect for the back half tim murphy so i would say package concierge is a very small business when we bought it and is growing i don’t know that there is seasonality in that business as much as just growth but i think first half second half isn’t widely different from that business other than indiscernible growth in the business walter liptak okay tim murphy and on the nexus side this we bought it in the fourth quarter of last year the beginning of the fourth quarter midfourth quarter so third quarter incremental sales and indiscernible so expect a bump from that walter liptak okay and was there any purchase accounting during the quarter that was not part of the nongaap any purchase accounting that was remained in the expense line on the quarter tim murphy no expense we trued up a couple of the balance sheet accounts as we finalize valuation but no unusual expenses walter liptak okay great all right thank you guys frank heard thanks walter tim murphy thank you operator thank you at this time i would like to turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing

print news  browse articles  fun  useful  the  worst product failures tweet  comments zac frank and tania khadder products come and go all the time but some new products fail for hilarious reasons you may not be old enough to remember the ford edsel but you’ve probably heard about it does your child have a doll odds are its not the baby weewee listening to an mp player now is it a zune probably not over the years these failures and the reasons for thems have become the stuff of myth we take a look at why these products flopped and try to separate fact from fiction even the best salesperson in the world probably couldn’t sell these… baby weeweefamosatickle his belly and this anatomically correct doll giggles gets what looks like erection and pees in your face we’re not sure what’s creepier – baby wee wee himself or the commercial used to sell him baby dolls that pee are nothing new but baby dolls with a disproportionately large penis that moves when you tickle them a commercial in which a little girl sings “his little willy moves” whaaat this doll – manufactured in spain but sold in the uk and ireland – may or may not still be on the market it appears to be unavailable on amazon how it got the green light in the first place is a mystery zunemicrosoftfirst released in november  the zune was microsoft’s “me too” answer to the ipod while it had some nifty product features that the ipod lacked like sharing music from player to player the zune despite an expensive marketing effort by microsoft never really caught on at its best it was able to crack into low doubledigit market share while the dominant ipod took around  more ominously in a filing with the sec in january microsoft disclosed that it had seen zune revenues decline  in the preceding quarter at the same time ipod revenues increased by  of all mp players listed on amazoncom currently the first zune model comes in at  behind an army of ipods and a few sansoms why did it fail on a design level the zune lacked style and the simplicity of apple’s interface the zune seemed clunky in comparison perhaps more importantly though the zune could not be used with apple’s itunes program an even more dominant product in its market than the ipod by integrating the music experience from cradle to grave so to speak apple created strong disincentives to any competitor that just could not be overcome betamaxsony betamax was the first home video recording tape to hit the market in may  sony however was not the only company that had been working on recording video data on magnetic tapes in  jvc rolled out the vhs format and a format war began as every american born before the dvd era knows betamax lost but why several explanations have been advanced to explain betamax’s market failure sony was slower to license the technology to other manufacturers vhs was for a time less expensive sony refused to let the pornography industry use betamax the main problem though was time when vhs was first introduced the tapes could hold two hours of video compared to betamax’s one by  when jvc partnered rca vhs could hold four hours as everyone knows an hour does not a movie make as a result forty production companies adopted vhs instead of betamax in  sony conceded defeat and began producing its own vhs vcrs md playersony developed in the late s following the launch of the first readwrite cd sony envisioned the minidisc md as a replacement for cassette tapes the company wanted to produce a device that combined the portability of cassettes with the magneticoptical technology being used in cds mds were introduced at a difficult market time and had to jockey for position with cds a battle which it lost part of the reason was the standalone nature of the md players cd players were being incorporated into boomboxes that also could play cassettes cds didn’t force consumers to make a choice between one medium or another it allowed them to have both while sony avoided the failure of betamax by widely licensing md’s technology record companies did not make extensive prerecorded music available for the device moreover under pressure to ensure that mds would not be used to pirate music sony made mdaudio discs incompatible with mddata discs making using the audio files on a computer impossible combined with the relatively high cost for the player most consumers said “thanks but no thanks” edselford in  ford debuted the edsel in what may have been the most elaborate product launch in history september  wasn’t just any day it was “e day” as the new brand was introduced to america that was followed by the edsel show on october  and an advertising campaign to sell the country on the charms of car whose name evoked a weasel customers however weren’t buying it and ford ended production of the edsel in  having lost  million on the car in the pantheon of product failures the edsel’s is the first lemon an unreliable clunker that was so bad no one could sell it but the truth is that the edsel was no more or less reliable than any other car on the market at the time ford’s extensive marketing campaign not only didn’t save the car it may have been what killed the edsel in the run up to its unveiling ford put out rumors that the edsel would be a revolutionary car that would change the automotive landscape when the curtain was finally pulled back though people saw that it was just another ford with a different body some have speculated that even that body was a hindrance with the car’s grill having a certain anatomical resonance what’s more the car’s market positioning was confusing and unclear though designed to be a midrange car between the ford and mercury brands the pricing didn’t reflect that customers didn’t know what to make of it the edsel also suffered from larger economic forces similar to today a recession hit and customers wanted smaller less expensive and more efficient cars united states football leaguedonald trump like so many of ventures involving donald trump the united states football league ended in failure originally conceived by an antique dealer from new orleans david dixon the usfl began as a spring and summer supplement to the nfl’s fall season after securing broadcasting deals with abc sports and espn the usfl was launched in  with teams in twelve cities from the outset the league was plagued with problems many teams had trouble finding permanent stadiums in which to play others were relocated frequently some merged with other teams or went bankrupt despite these problems the league survived and expanded following the first season in  adding six new teams a fateful decision in late  though sealed the league’s fate at the urging of trump the owners agreed to compete directly with the nfl and planned to begin playing games in the fall in  seven teams folded because they did not want to or felt they could not compete with nfl teams in their cities rather than competing with the nfl the usfl committed sports suicide never playing a game after the  spring season total loss  million windows vistamicrosoft my grandmother knew that vista was doomed before microsoft did vista was released on january   after its predecessor windows xp had been on the market for five years though designed to fix many of the security flaws in prior windows operating systems customers and not just it pros who often malign microsoft products gave it a resounding thumbs down after buying a new laptop early that year my  year old grandmother found vista unusable and paid to have it downgraded to windows xp a short time later microsoft essentially admitted failure and in april  allowed dell to start offering xp on new computers again microsoft also accelerated development of its next os windows  vista sucks the performance from a computer and can create a host of problems when using the internet euro disneylanddisney perhaps this product failure isn’t as horrific as some of the others on this list the theme park that originally beared this name is still in operation but let’s put it in context in  as euro disneyland prepared to open the media warned that there would be chaos on the roads as  would try to make it to opening day by midday the parking lot was half full with attendance of only  the following month  employees walked out on their jobs though attendance in the first year met disney’s target of  million people were not spending and the resort’s hotels were not full by september  euro disney had lost almost a billion dollars realizing that the name might be part of the problem the park was rechristened disneyland paris in  and began to turn around today while it is the most visited tourist attraction in europe it has still racked up debts of about  billion arch deluxemcdonald’swhen you think of mcdonald’s target demographic bobos and “latte drinking liberals” are not the first that come to mind nevertheless in  mcdonald’s made a play for adults with a more refined palate and spent  million in advertising to introduce the arch deluxe the only thing that really seemed to make the arch deluxe “refined” was an unnaturally round piece of peppered bacon mcdonald’s failed in thinking that it could expand to a demographic that was totally at odds with the fast food chain’s brand identity as they say you can put lipstick on a pig but it’s still a pig laserdisc do you remember laserdiscs the gigantic dvds of decades past first introduced commercially in  two years after vhs laserdiscs offered significant benefits over the image was much sharper they could carry both analog and digital audio “extras” could be included and they were organized by chapters like dvds laserdiscs had several problems though most importantly they were expensive—far more expensive than vcrs movie studios also did not produce as many films for laserdisc as they did for vhs the discs were large awkwardly shaped and they could not be used for recording by  they only existed in  of us households before the dvd boom that made them as obsolete as the vinyl record but without the charm the newtonapple in the age of ipods iphones and macbook pros it’s hard to imagine a time before everything apple touched turned to gold oh but there was one and it wasn’t all that long ago back in  apple released a handheld device they hoped would change personal computing it was officially called messagepad although it was popularly known as newton the more captivating name of its operating system it was overpriced  and clunky its handwriting recognition software – which had been touted by marketers as “unprecedented” – was highly inaccurate it was discontinued in  but the newton was not a complete debacle after all the gadget did become a template for the pda craze followed pippinapplebandaithe pippin was apple’s adventure into the game console market…or was it the stripped down computer market that confusion was why it failed launched in  the pippin sold for  far above the price of game consoles like the playstation and nintendo  but this was more than a game console it was a computer but it didn’t look like one and the only “software” available for it were a few programs produced by apple’s partner bandai only selling  units the pippin was quickly discontinued crystal pepsipepsiit was the early nineties and purity was all the rage as health and wellness moved center stage more and more consumers were picking up evian and perrier instead of cola in an attempt to snag a piece of the purity pie pepsi launched crystal its new cola was clear caffeinefree and a total failure it was hard for consumers to think of cola as a clear liquid which was not helped by the fact that crystal didn’t taste like cola at all in fact no one really knew what it tasted like – just that it was not good two years later the product was pulled from the shelves but pepsi didn’t give up completely on its quest for purity shortly after the clear cola fiasco the company decided to get in on another more widely accepted clear liquid market bottled water that went much better for them cocaineredux beverages a few years back a las vegas company launched an energy drink that would turn heads and stomachs it was called cocaine it contained three times as much caffeine as red bull and it made no apologies for its shameless brand strategy the font in its logo resembled a white powder its marketing language was rife with drug references not long after its launch the fda pulled the drink from store shelves they said redux was illegally marketing its product as an alternative to street drugs and that it had falsely claimed cocaine could treat disease and act as a dietary supplement but even without the fdas interference redux’s gimmicky energy drink was unlikely to withstand the test of time and an increasingly skeptical consumer base sure they could generate some buzz and make a quick buck but what chance would they have had at longevity when retailers like  refused to carry it the product briefly reentered the market with the ohsocatchy name “insert name here” but like its predecessor it too proved to be something to sniff at kitchen entreescolgate brand extensions can be highly successful think apple’s iphone or iams’ pet insurance they can also fail miserably think colgate kitchen entrees never heard of it you’re not the only one once upon a time colgate yes the toothpaste brand thought it wise to launch a line of frozen dinners the logic behind the pairing consumers can eat a colgate meal then brush their teeth with colgate toothpaste unfortunately for them the thought of toothpaste failed to whet consumers’ appetite for a chicken stirfry the product was a complete bust and was pulled from the shelves shortly after thirsty dog americans love to pamper their pets – that’s why there are doggy day spas gourmet pet foods and diamondstudded puppy collars so the idea of bottled water for dogs and cats isn’t all that farfetched in theory thirsty dog is kind of brilliant where did this company go wrong probably when they decided to infuse the water with flavors like crispy beef for dogs and tangy fish for cats that was going too far even for the creepiest of pet owners smokeless cigarettesrj reynolds with concern over the dangers of smoking at fever pitch in the late s tobacco giant rj reynolds set out to create a “cleaner” alternative  million later smokeless cigarettes were born they were called premier but really they were anything but the manufacturer’s own ceo complained they tasted “like sht” they were practically impossible to light there was no guarantee that they were healthier than regular cigarettes and to top it all off they were rumored to be an effective receptacle for smoking crack cocaine oops smokers didn’t enjoy them nonsmokers had no interest in trying them four months later they were pulled from the market evillasony back in  sony released an internet appliance evilla unfortunately for the electronics giant this was around the same time that the market for such devices was fizzling out what were internet appliances they were gadgets whose sole purpose was to provide access to the internet with one core functionality they were meant to be cheaper and easier to use than a personal computer that didn’t last as computers became cheaper to manufacture and more userfriendly the need for internet appliances became totally obsolete why pay  for sony’s substandard evilla when you can get a fullyequipped desktop computer for around the same price two months after its release the product was pulled but you’ve got to hand it to sony for appreciating the extent of its failure the company offered customers a full refund including the  they’d been paying for monthly internet access ismelldigiscents nothing evokes nostalgia more than a familiar scent but the ismell is one product we’d like to forget altogether in  digiscents set out to create a computerperipheral device designed to emit smells to go with sites visited or emails opened the idea behind it was that the allimportant olfactory experience was missing from internet use a perfume manufacturer for example could embed a scent into a piece of advertising or their website the device held a cartridge carrying  different primary odors and they’d be emitted in various combinations to create the appropriate scent the product never made it past the prototype stage and in  it was deemed one of the world’s  worst tech products by pc world magazine at least it was appropriately named new cokecoca cola by the early s cocacola was losing ground to pepsicola americans seemed to prefer the sweeter flavor of pepsi coke decided it was time for a taste makeover in april  new coke hit the shelves its taste was said to be “smoother rounder yet bolder” than the original drink and with the new release the company halted production of its original formula this was the company’s biggest mistake people were outraged they couldn’t get their hands on original coke and started boycotting the new product coke had underestimated the power of its iconic brand and america’s deeprooted attachment to it months later they brought back the original formula new coke stayed on the shelves until the early s but its only success was in teaching cocacola a valuable lesson in branding bonus
