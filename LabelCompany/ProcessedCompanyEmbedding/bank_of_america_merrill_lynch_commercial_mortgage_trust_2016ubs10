sensitivities for this transaction fitchs net cash flow ncf was  below the most recent years net operating income noi for properties for which a fullyear noi was provided excluding properties that were stabilizing during this period unanticipated further declines in propertylevel ncf could result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted loans and in potential rating actions on the certificates fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to bacm ubs certificates and found that the transaction displays average sensitivity to further declines in ncf in a scenario in which ncf declined a further  from fitchs ncf a downgrade of the junior aaasf certificates to asf could result in a more severe scenario in which ncf declined a further  from fitchs ncf a downgrade of
