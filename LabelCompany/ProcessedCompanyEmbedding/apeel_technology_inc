apeel sciences we believe in abundance apeel sciences creates edible products from natural plant extracts that allow organic and conventional growers to reduce reliance on pesticides increase produce quality and provide superior shelf life as the world confronts the implications of an everexpanding population agriculture will need to evolve in order to improve the efficiency with which we use our natural resources in the us the majority of our fresh water is consumed for irrigation while  of our fresh produce is lost to spoilage before it can be used this means that we are literally throwing away a portion of our available freshwater supply not to mention the added negative environmental consequences of pesticide usage associated with growing the huge fraction of produce that ultimately ends up in landfills our innovative technologies protect crops and help to significantly reduce spoilage which in turn reduces water use lowers energy costs and helps preserve natural ecosystems using agricultural byproducts–parts of the plant that are normally discarded–apeel creates products that fortify the surfaces of fresh fruits and vegetables forming an ultrathin barrier that camouflages crops and shields produce from both biotic and abiotic stressors  south los carneros road goleta california   contact us  apeel sciences inc      privacy policy mission purpose  vision  apeel sciences our mission we use our natural plantbased technologies to protect crops and harvested produce helping to eliminate food spoilage and reduce reliance on chemicals our purpose accomplishing our mission means we will waste less food water and energy helping to preserve our natural ecosystems while creating economic opportunities for the  million small family farms worldwide our vision in the future less food will be wasted we will use smarter more natural methods for growing and protecting crops and there will be an abundance of fresh food for everyone apeel sciences is committed to being a

into isolated vesicles was a vital step in the evolution of life on earth semipermeable lipid membranes provided a cradle in which biochemical reactions could proceed despite harsh external conditions a protective skin shell or peel of some kind is employed by every form of life on earth the dream how do we create an invisible edible peel that protects fresh produce naturally citrus fruits demonstrate the utility of protective coatings for food crops fruits with a peel have a  longer shelf life than fruits without a peel shelf life is determined by a combination of biological eg mold and physiological eg water loss stressors the relative severity of these stressors depends on the type of crop and stage along the agricultural value chain apeels technological innovations are based on extracting organic molecules from agricultural byproducts the molecules are then used to create waterbased formulations that coat the surface of fresh produce forming an ultrathin natural barrier to camouflage more delicate crops and protect produce from external stressors ecologic the goal of the apeel science team was to create an edible waterbased formula that could be produced from any kind of wasted plant matter protection against biotic stressors biotic stressors include bacteria fungi and insects growers face a diverse array of biotic stressors and since cropattacking microbes and insects are ubiquitous in both fields and greenhouses avoidance is nearly impossible these pests can wipe out entire crops and thus drastic preventative measures are employed in order to maintain yields such as the use of pesticides apeel takes a completely different approach based on recent developments in polymer science invisipeel uses a cloaking strategy that prevents pests from recognizing the crop as a food source bacteria fungi and pests all identify food sources via recognition of specific molecules on produce surfaces our invisipeel formula camouflages produce surfaces with an ultrathin layer of chemicallycontrasting molecules rendering crops unrecognizable to pests and thus protecting them from bacteria fungi and insects protection against abiotic stressors abiotic stressors are physical and chemical in nature and include bruising water loss and oxidation the primary causes of produce spoilage are water loss transpiration and exposure to air which causes oxidation fruits and vegetables eventually wither and shrink as the result of water evaporating out of the plant water loss causes the produce to shrink in volume resulting in poor aesthetic quality and rupture of the produce surface providing areas of ingress for bacteria and fungi oxidation refers to the reaction of the produce with oxygen like the browning that occurs on a fresh cut apple surface after a few minutes on fresh produce oxidation leads to the development of off colors and off flavors in the produce see our faq page apeels solutions will help to reduce food waste provide

on the use of pesticides to protect plants from the damaging influence of weeds disease bacteria fungi and insects although the use of pesticides has had an overwhelmingly positive impact on farming efficiency there is growing scientific evidence that pesticide use has a large number of unintended negative consequences traditional pesticides function as cytotoxic agents—poisoning both pathogenic and beneficial bacteria fungi and insects one of the most concerning repercussions of pesticide usage has been its link to declines in honeybee populations although efforts have been made to minimize the negative side effects of these chemicals the similarity in cellular metabolism between species makes it incredibly difficult to poison one bug without poisoning them all as more of these negative environmental and health consequences are brought to light regulatory agencies will have no choice but to mandate dramatic reductions in pesticide usage this is already taking place in the eu apeel sciences takes a radically different approach molecular camouflage based on the simple idea that bacteria fungi and insects all identify food sources via recognition of specific molecules on produce surfaces invisipeeltm works by fortifying these surfaces with an ultrathin layer of chemicallycontrasting molecules rendering these foods unrecognizable to pests invisipeel cloaks the surface of

significant losses and overall reduction in quality shortly before harvest fruit crops are especially vulnerable to pests invisipeel is a proprietary solution created from natural plant extracts that protects against these preharvest problems by applying a microthin layer of invisipeel onto plant surfaces crops are camouflaged against these biotic stressors providing protection for food crops with less need for traditional pesticides using invisipeel for preharvest protection will help to increase usable harvest and provide enhanced produce quality enabling growers to obtain better pricing our

happened to listen to an article about world hunger not thinking much of it i was on to the next track as i gazed out the window and noticed i was completely surrounded by lush green fields interesting timing the thought occurred to me if we are fortunate enough to have these magical seeds you can throw in the ground that passively absorb water and passively absorb sunlight and then produce food and which by the way also selfpropagate  how are there people on this planet going hungry how are we screwing this up so badly this question gnawed at me for the rest of the drive steel is a combination of iron and carbon atoms which upon mixing in very particular ratios results in a structure that is relatively lightweight and high strength the combination is so important that historians refer to the period in human history following this discovery as the steel age when i arrived at the lab i did a quick web search and learned that in the united states onethird to onehalf of harvested produce ends up in a landfill before its consumed this blew my mind we werent actually having trouble growing fresh produce the problem was storing it after it was harvested fresh produce is seasonal and perishable which means its either feast or famine ok i thought then the real question is what causes produce to spoil thank god for google the leading causes of produce spoilage are water loss and oxidation that started to ring a bell  i did my undergraduate degree in materials science and engineering at carnegie mellon university in pittsburgh pennsylvania where we studied steel steel is a combination of iron and carbon atoms which upon mixing in very particular ratios results in a structure that is relatively lightweight and high strength the combination is so important that historians refer to the period in human history following this discovery as the steel age theres just one problem iron atoms in a chunk of steel like to react with oxygen in the atmosphere to form iron oxide or rust which eats through the metal and limits the lifetime of the steel fortunately metallurgists discovered a neat trick to solve this problem by including a small number of sacrificial atoms into a chunk of iron for example chromium or molybdenum those atoms will preferentially diffuse to the surface of the iron and react with oxygen in the atmosphere to form a thin oxide barrier surrounding the outside of the iron that barrier physically occludes further oxygen from reaching the iron surface thus preventing rust formation so naturally the question arose if iron is confronted by the same challenges as fresh produce could we solve the problem in the same way using a thin barrier to protect produce just this time one not made of steel i talked to a few of my colleagues about the idea sounds like a good idea bro but no one wants to eat chemicals damn it this really annoyed me because everything is a chemical water is a chemical food is a chemical wait maybe that was it  i agreed no one would want to eat chemicals but people eat food every day i doublemajored in biomedical engineering as an undergraduate so i pulled out my old biochemistry textbook to see if there were any suitable barrierforming materials available in the foods we eat already lo and behold i opened to chapter  and right there staring me in the face were all the possible molecules you could ever need to create an edible barrier made entirely of food apeel sciences was born five years and almost  million in research and development later were now beginning to realize that vision our team has created the first natural sustainable and scalable way to protect and preserve harvested produce apeel uses the parts of plants and produce that are typically left behind on the farm like leaves and stems and repurposes them to create a natural invisible edible tasteless barrier that can be applied to protect food crops reduce reliance on chemical pesticides and keep produce as close as possible to its aspicked state the result is a doubling of the marketable and edible lifespan of fruits and vegetables and were just getting started today is a big day for apeel sciences were excited to share that weve closed a series b investment of  million led by az and dbl and that vijay pande the leader of the andreessen horowitzs bio fund and ira ehrenpreis managing partner at dbl are joining our board of directors in addition to the andreessen and dbl partnership our series b was made possible by new and existing partners at some of the most sustainabilityfocused venture capital firms in existence upfront ventures seedgrowth powerplant ventures and tao capital partners i could not possibly be more proud of the incredible scientific advances made by our team or more optimistic about what the future holds for our company i feel grateful every day to have the opportunity to work with such talented people to solve such a meaningful problem in the world looking back im reminded of

its a millionyearold idea  the spontaneous organization of lipid molecules into isolated vesicles was a vital step in the evolution of life on earth semipermeable lipid membranes provided a cradle in which biochemical reactions could proceed despite harsh external conditions a protective skin shell or peel of some kind is employed by every form of life on earth the dream how do we create an invisible edible peel that protects fresh produce naturally citrus fruits demonstrate the utility of protective coatings for food crops fruits with a peel have a  longer shelf life than fruits without a peel shelf life is determined by a combination of biological eg mold and physiological eg water loss stressors the relative severity of these stressors depends on the type of crop and stage along the agricultural value chain apeels technological innovations are based on extracting organic molecules from agricultural byproducts the molecules are then used to create waterbased formulations that coat the surface of fresh produce forming an ultrathin natural barrier to camouflage more delicate crops and protect produce from external stressors ecologic the goal of the apeel science team was to create an edible waterbased formula that could be produced from any kind of wasted plant matter protection against biotic stressors biotic stressors include bacteria fungi and insects growers face a diverse array of biotic stressors and since cropattacking microbes and insects are ubiquitous in both fields and greenhouses avoidance is nearly impossible these pests can wipe out entire crops and thus drastic preventative measures are employed in order to maintain yields such as the use of pesticides apeel takes a completely different approach based on recent developments in polymer science invisipeel uses a cloaking strategy that prevents pests from recognizing the crop as a food source bacteria fungi and pests all identify food sources via recognition of specific molecules on produce surfaces our invisipeel formula camouflages produce surfaces with an ultrathin layer of chemicallycontrasting molecules rendering crops unrecognizable to pests and thus protecting them from bacteria fungi and insects protection against abiotic stressors abiotic stressors are physical and chemical in nature and include bruising water loss and oxidation the primary causes of produce spoilage are water loss transpiration and exposure to air which causes oxidation fruits and vegetables eventually wither and shrink as the result of water evaporating out of the plant water loss causes the produce to shrink in volume resulting in poor aesthetic quality and rupture of the produce surface providing areas of ingress for bacteria and fungi oxidation refers to the reaction of the produce with oxygen like the browning that occurs on a fresh cut apple surface after a few minutes on fresh produce oxidation leads to the development of off colors and off flavors in the produce see our faq page apeels
