click to share on facebook opens in new windowclick to share on twitter opens in new windowclick to print opens in new window retired ceo craig weatherup was addressing a group of finance undergraduates at the w p carey school recently when he popped a question “how many of you would profess to have a model or a definition of how you want to grow as a leader” he asked three or four hands went up “i think everybody should raise their hand on that question and i’ll tell you why” he said weatherup himself has a model for leadership a simple yet comprehensive set of attitudes and behaviors that have shaped him in his personal life and as the leader of people and organizations — often through periods of dramatic change “leadership is something you develop and it can be developed at a very early age” weatherup told the group but he said you have to be proactive about it it’s important to decide how you want to lead and why the resulting model will be different for every individual but according to weatherup what’s important is to have a model — one that fits weatherup began to develop his model while still in his thirties and it propelled him through a career that peaked with stints as chairman and ceo of pepsi bottling group inc including leading the company’s ipo ceo of pepsicola company and president of pepsico inc the model continues to guide him today as a corporate and nonprofit board member and mentor to ceos these are given weatherup a phoenix native and a w p carey alumnus with a degree in accounting went to work for general foods immediately after graduation “i had envisioned going to work in new york at the corporate headquarters” he said “instead i ended up in kankakee illinois whose claim to fame was that it had the world’s largest dog food plant” he started as a cost analyst at the factory but his next position was in new york in the general foods financial analysis division the head of marketing who had noticed weatherup’s work on a special project in illinois took an interest in his career and weatherup was able to transfer to marketing for about five years he was a brand manager learning classic marketing then “pepsico came calling” he recounted and he moved his wife and two small children to tokyo a brief posting in new york followed then the weatherups were off to brazil back in the us again the last  years of his career were spent in top executive positions with the company now retired weatherup serves on the boards of directors of starbucks corporation macy’s inc and the arizona nature conservancy he is an active supporter of the bishop’s fund for children in connecticut tuskegee university and arizona state university how does someone build a leadership portfolio like that weatherup said that it requires focus — something more than fulfilling the core qualifications to be successful “the given here is that you have smarts you have great ethics you have great values and you work hard” he said anyone expecting to succeed is expected to possess those qualities — what he called “the givens” leadership however is what develops when you add something more and that’s where a model is needed weatherup’s model comprises six points three that involve developing yourself and three that guide your interactions with others it’s all about breadth the first three points in weatherup’s model all relate to what he calls “breadth” number one is broadening the self he said “in this case it’s about the breadth of your humanity” he said “anything you can do to get breadth is a huge huge determinant in how successful you’re going to be as a leader” he said to look for opportunities not only on the job but in all parts of life through family friends community travel volunteering church number two is professional experiential breadth he told the students that their attendance at the financial management association meeting where he was speaking was a step toward breadth other ways to broaden yourself could include working on a task force or taking a chance to do something outside your specialization “i wouldn’t ignore depth but if you’ve worked at many of the companies i’ve been involved with — the boards that i’m on — depth is a given if you’ve got a job you’ll go as deep as you need to go to know it and know it cold” he said “to me what’s far harder to get and far far more important is breadth” he noted that he started his career with an accounting degree working in a plant but when he went to new york he switched to finance and marketing then he accepted assignments oversees “breadth is the definer” he said “i’d venture to bet that the top 0 in this room are the people with the broadest set of experiences” the third point is to learn to value and use failure “it’s an absolute truism” he said “you will not grow without risk and you will not take risks if you do not value failing” individuals and companies espouse this point all the time he said but “i find this is normally not the case” however “failure in itself has great value if it was a risk worth taking” weatherup said he puts these three points — breadth of humanity breadth of experience and valuing failure — together because they are the well a leader draws from when it’s time to make a decision “nobody ever wanted the things that arrived at my desk half the facts were on the left half the facts were to the right or there were no facts” he said “often it ends up being judgment and judgment is about intuition and instinct and experience you’ll make far better decisions if you have a broad set of experiences” leadership of others his second three points related to execution you’ve articulated a vision and made a brilliant decision now you have to execute and “ percent of the time you have to execute with people” how do you get people to follow you and feel passion for your vision first he said you have to show that you truly care about those people “when things are really tough when it’s unclear when nobody knows what’s really happening they follow you because they think and because you’ve demonstrated that you really care about them” he said from the janitor to the chief of staff weatherup said affirm that person’s human dignity that’s the one thing that inspires passionate followership second he said act out of your deeply held sense of self worth “if you don’t have the strength of your convictions you cannot persevere and you certainly cannot engender those feelings and confidence in those who work for you” self worth he added is the product of broad experience “confidence comes from failing experiencing different things being challenged in different circumstances” he said weatherup said he borrowed the sixth point from a consultant who worked with him somewhere along the way do the work head heart and hands — yourself “if you aren’t out there with the troops using your hands you won’t engender the followership you want” he said lessons from the edge of change enroll simplify persevere a leader must be able to manage the status quo but if you want to get anywhere you need to be able to lead through change weatherup said “real growth is change” he said “life is change circumstances change” but to paraphrase an old song the fundamental things can be applied especially during change weatherup offered three examples from his experience scenario one in  weatherup was running the north american beverage business for pepsico when he and his director of marketing looked at the numbers and concluded that the cola category had topped out “the math of an aging population was driving it” based on that he presented a new vision to the board that pepsico had to become a total beverage company in order to continue to thrive the company needed multiple categories water bottled tea sports drink juice and coffee businesses the board disagreed he said but he told them that no matter what he did cola was not going to grow wall street responded to “stick with your knitting” and even the competition coca cola asserted at the time that it was an allcola company he said his own company didn’t believe the numbers either and certainly didn’t want to deal with the complexities of that many products that was the setting “the vision which was maybe radical in those days was relatively easy to come up with getting people to understand it and trust you and follow you was incredibly difficult because there’s nothing obvious about where you wanted to take them and why” scenario two in  pepsico international experienced a meltdown the company was on the front page of the wall street journal for weeks and pepsico took a 0 million charge the international company missed its pretax profit plan by  billion “a lot of money in those days” weatherup who had been running pepsi north america asked “where do you start” the president and ceo of pci had already departed when in the course of one week weatherup asked the other nine senior executives to resign “everybody knows you have to change — the issues were strategy culture operating philosophy business model people organization … so how do you deal with that sort of situation” he commented scenario three in  weatherup was in charge of splitting off pepsi bottling company in what was at the time the fifth largest ipo in us history it involved a 0 billion entity with 00 employees the challenge was to get everyone on board for a move that on the surface seemed to involve no major change same people same trucks same plant to those 00 employees it appeared to be a bad move weatherup said “why leave a 0 billion powerful successful pepsico for this ipo company” what were the lessons learned from the three scenarios first in each case there was a need to “enroll the organization” weatherup said each scenario was a case where there was confusion about the facts or the strategy or some other element of change to deal with it the leadership developed what weatherup called a process of enrollment to educate the entire organization quickly in the case of the ipo every individual teamster was touched by a manager “relative to what this is and why we did it” second in dealing with major change “simplify clarify” as an example weatherup pointed to the strategic direction statement for the ipo pepsi bottling company — about  words that include “we sell soda” it was all about simplicity he said because they were trying to drive behavior change third once you’ve launched a change drive through to the finish weatherup quoted a study of fortune  companies showing that in the majority of cases where companies attempted a change initiative they failed and the number one reason they failed was that they quit “there are no time outs” he said “it’s all about persevering not accepting ‘no” leadership is hard he concluded at the upper echelons it’s a  endeavor in order to maintain the effort a leader must find a compelling reason to go on — something more than making money or collecting perks in weatherup’s case it is a desire to be a servant leader “my faith has grounded me in the fact that i care about the people i lead and i do think it’s my job to serve them” he said that’s his model the question for the students in attendance was “what’s yours” — weatherup was the guest of the financial management association fma student chapter at the w p carey school of business the fma affords finance and other business students the opportunity to gain a deeper knowledge of the finance industry and the realities of working in the field the w p carey student chapter has been recognized by the fma as a “superior chapter” for several years running click to share on facebook opens in new windowclick to share on twitter opens in new

decorate the office of the pepsi bottling group’s pbg chairman and ceo a gleaming pepsi wheeler bearing the corporate motto “we sell soda” wraps around both covers of pbg’s first postipo annual report the fact that ground transportation is the hub of his business may explain the pbg chief executive’s choice of decor with only 0 of pbg’s 0 worldwide workforce based at the somers ny headquarters weatherup knows that delivering product to “the field” is the key to the beverage giant’s growth this year veteran of cola wars fights for every inch of shelf counter rack cooler and floor space from miami to montreal from madrid to moscowweatherup  took pbg which manufactures and distributes 0 percent of pepsi products worldwide public in march of  in the fifthlargest ipo in history with parent pepsico as its major stockholder holding a 0 percent stake suddenly this old bricksandmortar company was afloat in a sea of new launches where it stood out from its predominantly dotcorn neighbors thanks to several key differences a legendary centuryold brand equity deep market penetration an established customer base and distribution network including 0 trucks and sales of more than  billion with anticipated operating income in excess of  millionfor weatherup who had served as ceo of the pepsicola co from  to  the challenge of separating pepsico’s bottling and distribution arm from the parent company was enormous                and an irresistible opportunity “i didn’t want to do anything else at pepsico and i didn’t want to be ceo of some other company despite many many attractive offers” he explains “pbg was a unique event and i thought i could make a big big difference“the pepsico bottling operation had not grown profits for three straight years and we were losing market share” he adds “cocacola spun off cocacola enterprises cce in  it was our time”weatherup’s enthusiasm impressed roger enrico chairman and ceo of pepsico inc encompassing the pepsicola company fritolay and tropicana products enrico had already experienced his resolve firsthand after chris sinclair then ceo of pepsi’s troubled international operations abruptly resigned stalking out of a company meeting weatherup emerged from the meeting with sinclair’s post and 0 days later chaired a worldwide meeting of pepsico management which led to the termination of 0 senior executives and  employees  percent of the division and the closing  of  overseas offices the reorganization’s price tag was a  million writeoffironically three years later finds cocacola weathering a similar restructuring “cocacola has taken serious writeoffs million in fourth quarter and the scenario is the same as ours in ’” says weatherup “to be blunt they got ahead of themselves you can’t get too carried away with success i’ve learned that even if you are the best and overplay it you’ll pay big time”the turnabout has analysts reevaluating the cola players “wow what a difference a year makes” says bill pecoriello beverage industry analyst for sanford bernstein “there was a lot of skepticism on the street about pbg’s ipo cce was the gold standard of bottlers the reason pbg even came into existence now pbg’s got the momentum all the planets have aligned for craig”coke’s stumble offers pbg an opportunity to “really knock the cover off the ball” asserts pecoriello “craig’s performance has forced cce to reevaluate their failed us strategy of ‘market share at any cost’ ““they’re holding their own against cce and then some” he adds “that’s because of craig’s leadership he’s motivated the troops he’s in the trenches and he knows that you win on a local level store by store one vending machine at a time”a believer in handson leadership weatherup has been known to pitch in on the front lines during one field visit he recounts crawling under the bar“a slimy awful place”at the las vegas shark club to replace springs in a broken beverage dispenser “they bounced all over the place” he says “the real technicians enjoyed this to no end“people need to know that you care about them and that you’re worthy of their followership” he says explaining his belief that “the winning company with the highest stock price will be the one that has humanity”this focus on the soft side was initially met with skepticism by industry veterans but weatherup’s success has brought some former critics around tom pirko president of industry consulting firm bevmark llc who once questioned whether weatherup had the “basic brutality” to go head to head with cocacola now concedes “people trust him they perform for him”weatherup’s current challenge is to beat last year’s numbers pbg sold a billion cases of beverages to more than 0 customers in  and posted revenues of  billion reporting an impressive  percent growth that exceeded predictions of  to 0 percent net revenues were up  percent while return on invested capital was up a point to  percent earnings per share eps were up  percent over the previous year second quarter  numbers suggest continued solid growth with eps up  percent at  for the quarter versus  in with  percent of pbg’s volume in north america weatherup plans to acquire on average  to  percent of the north american pepsi bottling system annually pbg’s bottler acquisitions to date have been contiguous to existing pbg markets a growth strategy that couples adding volume with realizing cost savings in raw materials manufacturing warehousing logistics and general administration“we’re now better able to respond quickly to customers’ entire system needs as more of their outlets fall into our markets” explains weatherup “this is especially true as the grocery business consolidates the coke system has consolidated faster than the pepsi system in north america whichever system pepsi or coke consolidates best and quickest will likely have a competitive leg up with the resulting efficiencies of scale” in addition to distribution coke and pepsi continue to duke it out over market share a battle made more complicated by shifting beverage market trendsgrowth in the bottled water segment is now four times that of carbonated drinks and consumer tastes have shifted from soft drinks to noncarbonated “natural” beverages like snapple and sobe yet pepsi’s flagship carbonated brands pepsi diet pepsi and mountain dew make up more than 0 percent of its product line and its aquafina brand holds a mere  percent share of the bottled water segment while pepsi one dr pepper starbucks frappuccino and lipton’s iced tea currently make up the rest of the domestic mix weatherup promises that pbg’s “whole brand portfolio is undergoing major major change our no  charter for the balance of  is to make sure we’re really playing across the entire beverage category”for weatherup that’s a battle of epic proportions but one he has every intention of winning “the evil empire in star wars always reminds me of coke” he said “but if you remember the movie the rebellion won”vital

pepsi bottling group pbg has had more than the full measure of success in his career recently he shared some of the insights he gained during his year career at pepsico with some 0 w p carey mba masters and doctoral degree graduates at the school’s convocation weatherup talked about leadership and success but his message veered from the usual ceo script value and use failure he said “you will not grow without risk and will not risk unless you value failure as a teacher” an unconventional business guru a  graduate of the w p carey school weatherup was in the lead when pepsi marketers came up with some of the brand’s most memorable marketing initiatives there were catchy jingles that you couldn’t quit singing and the famous “pepsi challenge” which pitted pepsi against beverage powerhouse cocacola and converted countless testers into instant customers perhaps most significantly starting in japan he built pepsi into a favorite of local residents the world over — not just american expatriates eager for a taste of home weatherup is widely acknowledged as a primary driver behind pepsi’s extraordinary success but hear him describe his leadership style to the new grads and a strikingly unconventional business guru emerges from the pinstripes and polished wingtips some experts advise dusting off your resume every five to seven years but weatherup spent 0 years at pepsico as a new accounting graduate his goal was to run a major division of a huge company someday over the years his general goals stayed much the same while his specific goals evolved and indeed the day came when he did run a major division he began his career in  as pepsicola marketing director for the far east stationed in tokyo japan then he spent the next eight years in international operations in a variety of positions in  weatherup joined the pepsicola bottling group and was named president of the division in  he was appointed chief executive officer of pepsicola north america in 0 in  he was named president of pepsico inc and later that year appointed chairman and chief executive officer of pepsicola company in addition weatherup realized leadership is not the sole province of the top executive “everyone aspires to lead others in some aspect of their lives” he told the graduates one person is called to teach sunday school to kids he said while others might lead in a community or civic group each is a leader although often not identified as a decisionmaker at their place of employment grow by taking risks … and sometimes failing weatherup embraces “servant leadership” which he described as “seeing leadership as an extraordinary privilege given to you by those you lead” the chief mechanism of leadership is “making the right decision” but as he pointed out in his speech that leaves an enormous question how do you acquire the insight will and perseverance you need to make the right judgment “barring conflicting facts half of the room will always want to go left and half of the room will want to go right at the end of the day leadership is making that call” weatherup explained leaders function at their highest he said when they constantly expand their life experiences both on and off the job “it’s all about breadth of experiences” he said “which is something only acquired through risk” this is the heart of weatherup’s message taking risks develops leadership skills but it also carries the chance of failure weatherup left his first postcollege employer general foods for a marketing management position with pepsi way back in  that early leap from accounting to marketing marked one of his first major risks he told grads “i acquired breadth of experience by taking small and sometimes big risks going into the unknown” he continued “you will be uncomfortable you will understand that you just don’t know the answer and you need to find it” train to be a leader there are three steps to building leadership skills according to weatherup start by seeking out opportunities that widen the breadth of your experiences failure is a possibility — but so is success he said “living as the most complete human being you can be” is a goal that results not only in mastery of the skills and knowledge necessary for topnotch leadership he said it’s also a direct path towards a healthy balance between work family and play if you’re living as that most complete human being as a way of building leadership skills and boosting your career then there’s plenty of time and attention scheduled for family friends hobbies volunteer work and the like to keep on schedule he lives by a few rules for instance by noon on saturday if not earlier his briefcase is packed up and stashed in the closet until it’s time to leave for work monday morning before he retired when he was in meetings his staff was instructed to interrupt for only two people — his wife or the company’s chairman and he and his wife always reserved at least 0 days for a family vacation every year his second piece of advice on leadershipskill building is to embrace lateral or unexpected career moves the payoff will not be in big raise or fancier office now but could position you for even more satisfying experiences down the road a bit another aspect of success and leadership that weatherup could have mentioned is generosity inducted into the w p carey school’s hall of fame in  he continues to be involved with the university currently giving his time and insights as the chairman of the asu foundation board of directors and he has put resources behind his passion for developing leadership in managers through his sponsorship of the weatherupoverby chair in management angelo kinicki whose research and consulting interests include leadership currently holds the chair at the w p
