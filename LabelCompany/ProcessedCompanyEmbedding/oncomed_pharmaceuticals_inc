medicines a shared commitment to improving patient outcomes we are focused on discovering and developing novel therapeutics directed to fundamental biologic pathways thought to drive cancers growth resistance recurrence and metastases in order to improve the treatment of solid tumor cancers latest science oncomed researchers publish new findings on wnt drug combinatorial antitumor activity in multiple tumor types including breast pancreatic lung and ovarian cancer hyperactive wnt signaling is a key oncogenic signal in many types of cancer and recently has been associated with resistance to cancer immunotherapeutics oncomed scientists have published a new manuscript in science advances on june  titled “wnt antagonists exhibit unique combinatorial antitumor activity with taxanes by potentiating mitotic cell death” in this paper we describe a series of experiments in a large number of patient derived xenografts with two oncomed developed compounds vantictumab antifzd and ipafricept fzdfc these two biologics are the most advanced wnt pathway antagonists in clinical development we discovered that these agents exhibit much better combination activity with taxanes than with other classes of chemotherapeutic agents such as gemcitabine or platinum compounds this is a robust phenomenon and occurs in diverse tumor types including breast pancreatic lung and ovarian cancers furthermore we report that combination activity is enhanced by administration of the wnt antagonist prior to taxane treatment the combination of wnt blockade and taxane treatment leads to a dramatic histological phenotype  mitotic cell death in tumor cells our hypothesis is that the unique combination activity relies on the action of taxane chemotherapy and inhibition of betacatenin at the m phase of the cell cycle this discovery has informed our clinical testing strategy and the mechanism of synergy has implications in understanding the role of wntbetacatenin signaling in regulating the proliferation and differentiation of cancer cells productive research capabilities expertise in cancer biology platform drug discovery technologies and sophisticated antibody

oncomed pharmaceuticals is a clinicalstage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing novel therapeutics that address the fundamental biology driving cancers growth resistance recurrence and metastasis to date we have advanced nine novel anticancer product candidates into more than  inds initiated  clinical studies and have enrolled more than  subjects we continue to pursue the discovery of additional novel anticancer therapeutics all of our product candidates were discovered internally in our own research laboratories as our understanding of the biologic pathways driving tumor growth metastases and recurrence has increased new discoveries from our research team have identified novel immunooncology targets tumor cells have evolved ways of evading the bodys immune system in order to grow the therapeutic candidates in our pipeline act by blocking those evasive techniques making tumor cells more visible to immune system attack andor bolstering targeted immune cell activity we are also deploying our expertise in the engineering of antibodies to create new bispecifics that contain two potential drugs in one antibody and are designed to increase anticancer activity and in some cases mitigate known offtarget effects we believe each of our distinct therapeutic candidates has the potential to significantly impact cancer treatment and the clinical outcome of patients with cancer to support the advancement of our pipeline and our continued discovery efforts oncomed has assembled a proven management team with expertise in oncology research drug discovery clinical development translational medicine regulatory affairs and commercial development in addition we have established an extensive patent portfolio protecting our novel product candidates as well as our platform rd technologies we have formed strategic alliances with companies such as celgene corporation and bayer pharma ag since our founding in august  we have

discovering and developing novel therapeutics that address the fundamental biology driving cancers growth resistance recurrence and metastasis to date we have advanced nine novel anticancer product candidates into more than  inds initiated  clinical studies and have enrolled more than  subjects we continue to pursue the discovery of additional novel anticancer therapeutics all of our product candidates were discovered internally in our own research laboratories as our understanding of the biologic pathways driving tumor growth metastases and recurrence has increased new discoveries from our research team have identified novel immunooncology targets tumor cells have evolved ways of evading the bodys immune system in order to grow the therapeutic candidates in our pipeline act by blocking those evasive techniques making tumor cells more visible to immune system attack andor bolstering targeted immune cell activity we are also deploying our expertise in the engineering of antibodies to create new bispecifics that contain two potential drugs in one antibody and are designed to increase anticancer activity and in some cases mitigate known offtarget effects we believe each of our distinct therapeutic candidates has the potential to significantly impact cancer treatment and the clinical outcome of patients with cancer to support the advancement of our pipeline and our continued discovery efforts oncomed has assembled a proven management team with expertise in oncology research drug discovery clinical development translational medicine regulatory affairs and

patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments diabetes the patient perspective diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose sugar in the blood normally the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy with diabetes the body either does not make enough insulin type  diabetes or does not use it properly type  diabetes leading to high blood glucose levels uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications such as heart attack lowerlimb amputation vision impairment and blindness

medicines is a lifes work – the work of  researchers who never say never as well as the millions of patients who fight side by side with researchers in the battle for life against whatever odds they face together now is the time to put the accelerator to the floor the best is yet to come – like advancements in personalized medicine and immunotherapy – and its coming faster than we can imagine welcome to the future of medicine where disease is no match for tenacity no match for ingenuity where together we go boldly do not go gentle todays breakthroughs are becoming tomorrows medicines watch the video we cannot take progress for granted we cannot take progress for granted share tweet link email print we are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases but we must not take this progress for granted  to ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop lifesaving treatments and cures in order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients our country must     make medicines more affordable by rewarding value  today america’s biopharmaceutical companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment or agreements may lower copays if patients achieve better health outcomes while these partnerships will vary they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system yet outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements  government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines rather we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for americans     ensure patients get the best deal on medicines america’s biopharmaceutical companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers pbms those rebates are growing every year and now exceed  billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers but we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price even when their insurers get a rebate in fact patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine  that’s wrong health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive this could lower outofpocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year     make new breakthroughs accessible and promote competition we need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines it simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over  years and over one billion dollars on average  outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more to get medicines approved faster while ensuring safety we need to modernize the fda with new technologies and expertise to keep up with st century science modernizing the fda will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines which will bring medicines to patients faster and enhance competition in the market we also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the us food and drug administration fda  this will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection  at the same time we must avoid policies that deter risktaking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients learn more about our plan to build a sustainable sciencebased health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here related news

understanding biology to better treat cancer exemplary science creating innovative medicines a shared commitment to improving patient outcomes we are focused on discovering and developing novel therapeutics directed to fundamental biologic pathways thought to drive cancers growth resistance recurrence and metastases in order to improve the treatment of solid tumor cancers latest science oncomed researchers publish new findings on wnt drug combinatorial antitumor activity in multiple tumor types including breast pancreatic lung and ovarian cancer hyperactive wnt signaling is a key oncogenic signal in many types of cancer and recently has been associated with resistance to cancer immunotherapeutics oncomed scientists have published a new manuscript in science advances on june  titled “wnt antagonists exhibit unique combinatorial antitumor activity with taxanes by potentiating mitotic cell death” in this paper we describe a series of experiments in a large number of patient derived xenografts with two oncomed developed compounds vantictumab antifzd and ipafricept fzdfc these two biologics are the most advanced wnt pathway antagonists in clinical development we discovered that these agents exhibit much better combination activity with taxanes than with other classes of chemotherapeutic agents such as gemcitabine or platinum compounds this is a robust phenomenon and occurs in diverse tumor types including breast pancreatic lung and ovarian cancers furthermore we report that combination activity is enhanced by administration of the wnt antagonist prior to taxane treatment the combination of wnt blockade and taxane treatment leads to a dramatic histological phenotype  mitotic cell death in tumor cells our hypothesis is that the unique combination activity relies on the action of taxane chemotherapy and inhibition of betacatenin at the m phase of the cell cycle this discovery has informed our clinical testing strategy and the mechanism of synergy has implications in understanding the role of wntbetacatenin signaling in regulating the proliferation and differentiation of cancer cells productive research capabilities expertise in cancer biology
