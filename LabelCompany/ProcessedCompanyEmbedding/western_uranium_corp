nils gabriel sefström rediscovered the element in a new oxide he found while working with iron ores he named the new element vanadium after old norse vanadís vanadium has the atomic number  it is a hard silvery gray ductile and malleable transition metal the formation of an oxide layer stabilizes the metal against oxidation the element is found only in chemically combined form in nature the isolation of vanadium metal proved difficult henry enfield roscoe eventually produced the metal in  by reduction of vanadiumii chloride vcl with hydrogen in  pure vanadium was produced by reducing vanadium pentoxide with calcium usage the first large scale industrial use of vanadium in steels was found in the chassis of the ford model t inspired by french race cars vanadium steel allowed for reduced weight while simultaneously increasing tensile strength at the moment vanadium is used mainly as an alloy in a wide range of specialty steels and titanium alloys to provide greater strength toughness and wearresistance it is for this reason that vanadium consumption should rise in an infrastructure boom scenario vanadium has been used as a steel additive since the late s when “vanadium steel” was used to armour the hull of battleships making them impenetrable to explosive shells only a small amount of vanadium significantly increases the strength hardness and high temperature stability of steel its electron deficient structure lends itself well to the formation of more stable nitrides and carbides when added to iron and as such vanadium has been referred to as the “electric metal” vanadium highcarbon steel alloys contain  to  vanadium and highspeed tool steels hss have a vanadium content of  to  in recent times the incremental demand for vanadium has been driven by increased steel production primarily in china india and the developing world at the same time various economic and legislative factors are increasing the use of vanadium in the steel industry like stronger rebar to reduce catastrophic destruction in earthquake prone regions as well as providing the necessary strength demanded by cutting edge architectural design some estimates suggest the demand for vanadium might grow at  per annum from  to  based on the steel applications alone sources – primary and otherwise the element occurs naturally in about  different minerals and in fossil fuel deposits and is the th most common element in the earth’s crust the important thing to note is that beyond recycling from steel slag the sources of vanadium are either mineral deposits or rather uniquely as an oil byproduct vanadium occurs in deposits of phosphate rock titaniferous magnetite and uraniferous sandstone and siltstone in which it usually constitutes less than  of the host rock significant amounts are also present in bauxite and carboniferous materials such as coal crude oil oil shale and tar sands amongst the major deposits are the titaniferrous magnetites of china russia south africa western australia and new zealand as well as the oilrelated deposits of venezuela alberta canada the middle east and queensland australia in addition to ore and clay deposits in the usa the table above shows the state of resources according to vanitec a vanadium produceruser association we suspect it is somewhat outdated as several new sources such as madagascar have become apparent over recent years in particular the australian share should be lifted and brazil is worthy of being considered a potential player of consequence the usgs in its latest survey on the metal said that world resources of vanadium exceed  million tons dynamics the dynamics of the vanadium supply chain are interesting in some ways we might compare the metal’s supply chain to that of lead where the chief source is recycling the chart below from the consultants cpm shows that much of the current western supply is sourced primarily from steel scrap then mining followed by secondary sources which are also recycling in nature vanadium is produced in china and russia from steel smelter slag other countries produce it either from the flue dust of heavy oil or as a byproduct of uranium mining it is mainly used to produce specialty steel alloys such as high speed tool steels the most important industrial vanadium compound vanadium pentoxide is used as a catalyst for the production of sulfuric acid the metal is recovered as v contained in an intermediate slag which is formed between ironmaking and steelmaking in integrated steelworks eg panzhihua in china highveld in south africa and nzhny tagil in russia at these steel plants the vanadium contained in the iron ore is taken into solution in the iron during the ironmaking process the hot metal is then oxidised and a slag which contains between  and  v is formed and removed before the hot metal is passed on for final steelmaking the slag containing  v is then treated in a roastleach process the end product of which is vanadates or vanadium oxides the vanadium pentoxide prices have been soaring of late europe up  china up  yoy strategically speaking as the bulk of vanadium production is concentrated in china russia and south africa where supply disruptions have occurred one cannot be entirely sanguine about vanadium’s future accessibility those three countries account for around  of global supplies interestingly the most recent british geological survey risk list on criticality of supply for  had lifted vanadium to number five on the list whereas just a few years before it has ranked a lowly  out of  metals speaking of us access to vanadium the usgs commented “while domestic resources and secondary recovery are adequate to supply a large portion of domestic needs a substantial part of us demand is currently met by foreign material” the uravan mineral belt the uravan mineral belt outlined in the map below has a long history of exploration and mining for vanadium and uranium the deposits have been well studied by public and private entities deposits containing uranium vanadium and radium were first discovered in the roc creek area about  miles north of the sunday mine complex intensive mining of these ores did not begin in the plateau region until  when radium was the primary element of interest this ceased after the belgian congo pitchblende deposits were discovered in  plateau mining resumed in about  when vanadium became of interest and then since the early ’s when uranium became ascendant except for two minor periods of activity one in the ’s and the other in the mid’s the uravan mineral belt has been fairly quiet the relation between some uranium production and vanadium supplies is worth mentioning in the context of the uravan mineral belt and thus western uranium the production of uo from carnotite ores creates a vanadiumbearing waste solution that must be neutralized to have the heavy metals fixed before waste disposal an alternative treatment is a circuit which extracts vanadium and produces vo for example denison mines’ white mesa uranium processing mill near blanding utah processes feed from that company’s mine properties on the colorado plateau as well as uraniumvanadium ores purchased from independent miners for every  kg of uo yellowcake produced white mesa’s vanadium coproduct recovery circuit produced approximately  kg of vanadium in the form of vo the sunday mine the sunday mine complex covers  acres  ha it is located on public lands administered by the blm the sunday mine complex has significant drilling and production history mining and drilling occurred contemporaneously from the ’s through the mid ’s from the ’s to the present mining and drilling occurred only sporadically typically when uranium or vanadium prices were high the last mining interval was from  to  and based on the available records only in  did any drilling take place since mid the mines have had a number of owners and operators prior to wuc’s acquisition of the complex in april  the ownership was a miscellany of wellknown names matterhorn mining ’s’s climax uranium ’s union carbide corporation ucc ’s’s atlas minerals ’s energy fuels nuclear early ’s international uranium corp ’s’s denison mines  ’s and energy fuels ’s the ni report prepared by anthony adkins in july  stated that the sunday mine complex based on historical records appeared to have “very good to excellent potential” to host in excess of  pounds of uraniumvanadium resources with characteristics suitable for underground mining the table below shows the vanadium and uranium resource estimate for all the vanadium containing deposits of wuc uranium and vanadium occur frequently occur together in the uravan belt with ratios that range from  to  an energy fuels internal document from  shows that the uv ratio of the sunday mine complex is  maps prepared by denison mines show a uniform  ratio twenty randomly selected drill holes with vanadium values and shown on the ’s era maps were taken from over the expanse of the property only holes with intervals  ft and with uo values  were selected the results show uv ratios that vary from  to  with a weighted average of  this thus implies that if vanadium prices are sound then they alone can carry a vanadiumuranium mining and processing operation even if uranium remains the underperformer that it has been of late conclusion so unlike your average uranium company that finds itself beached like a whale during the current ebbtide in uranium prices western uranium is actually depending what prism one is looking at it through more of a vanadium company than a uranium company and probably needs a name change to reflect that new reality being a uranium bull anyway i suspect that this company will be firing on two cylinders within a couple of years rather than just one its ablation mining technology works irrespective for sandstonehosted  vanadium or uranium or both so now it needs to get its piñon ridge mill moving forward so that it can harvest the upsurge in vanadium if uranium had been the only string in its bow we would have rated that challenge as an uphill struggle but now with the tailwind of soaring vanadium prices combined with vanadium being a prime “infrastructure metal” in trumplandia and the prospect of “onshore” vanadium production in the us make the wuc

playing in this space say in a couple of years time reports have it that both these companies have world class resource in vanadium and the tivan process of tng ltd further do you feel that vanadium and the redox batteries will be disruptive to the whole energy storage debate november     pm reply tim halyk hi chris what about the titaniferous magnetite vanadium deposits in quebec canada the lac dore just ouside of chibougamau qc and the iront bell river at matagami these are historically regarded as some of the largest in the world although more exploration and development are still needed iront more so the current size of the lac dore deposit which is split between vanadiumcorp and blackrock is already  mt the deposit is projected to have north of bt’s maybe this is worthy of a mention additionally this deposit is a triple metal play iron titanium and vanadium with appropriate processing all  could be commoditized november     pm reply dr mike hirschberger hi chris good article on a metal not often discussedbut widely usedesp by the chinese export steel sector as you may know in addition to the reasons you cite for adding vanadium to steel chinese steel exporters have for many years added vanadium to their export steelsespecially the commodity end rebar mix to avoid the vat tax of  by adding vanadium the steel is defined as an alloyeven if it is a commodity steel like rebar thereby this no cost addition by passes the high end of the vat tax also by adding vanadium the cleaver bidder can demonstrate that they supercede specs by boosting tensile strength this is especially true when competing against the clueless american who routinely submit bid on rebar that just meet the low end of specs but the real hook and the one i used to win slightly over  of the rebar bid for the new panama super canal is the addition of boron which does add a good deal of seismic resistance to the rebar specs so chinese export steel from the big mill purposefully add these  specialty minerals to the astm specs targeted for latin markets the only world markets that still use the american specsmost use british or other higher performing standards at no additional cost to manufacturing or if the government accountants show up the incremental cost of adding the  minerals amount to rounding errors as far as reportable additional cost by adding value to commodity steel the chinese catch their american competitors flat footed unsurprising to most of that compete on international project bids the criticism that chinese export steel is like an ebay china is very unfounded dr mike hirschberger strategic minmetals ag miami office   november     pm reply christopher ecclestone thanks for that of course the chinese will be lucky to sell any steel valloy or not into the us when it becomes trumplandia china has its own reasons for upping its vanadium content in steel for its own use as recent earthquakes have shown the dangers of not using the highest grades of alloy steel in some of the worst seismic zones november     pm reply christopher ecclestone tim the problem with the deposits in canada you mention is the issue of credibility wuc’s deposits are sandstonehosted in already extant underground mines inherited from denison that they can apply their ablation mining technology to for a mere bagatelle in terms of capex these cdn projects have hundreds of millions in capex and are largely under the control of promoters who just want to spin their wheels the cdn projects could be producing but they would have to be in the hands of serious people and rightsized to gain credibility as potential contributors to the global vanadium supply chain it also raises the question as to whether in the logic of trumplandia the vanadium component in any infrastructure project is ussourced or whether canada is regarded as “foreign” november     pm reply christopher ecclestone shankar thanks for your contribution of some extra names to the mix on redox specifically i would say that they don’t disrupt lithium or such alternatives because they are on another larger scale all together their big benefit is going to be in making use of solar or wind in isolated locations that much more viable ironically i have been horrified by the number of miners who use the words “diesel generators” when they have plenty of fresh air and sunshine to support alternative energy where their mines are located just goes to show that miners are amongst the most luddite adopters of new technologies on the planet no wonder they fail to optimise profitability for shareholders november     pm reply dr mike hirschberger well the chinese steel export volumes are currently annualizing  million mt according to published statistics however their export drive has triggered “dumping” charges by the west and india retaliatory tariffs some  from the west are now a form of push back these punitive tariffs sponsored by the eu and us steel trade organizations are focused primarily on valued added steels like stainless and automotive regardless all this smack of pending trade wars likely not to go unnoticed by the new trump administration the point is that the additions of vanadium does make a high performance steel alloy which allows the chinese suppliers to compete using competitive weapons other than just lower pricewhich most in the west assume is their only weapon so should trade disputes ripen into full fledged international litigation the proceeding will likely be much more complicated than they appear on the surface winning a case based on unfair pricing may prove more difficult if the offending party is over performing november     pm reply tim halyk chris not sure what v projects you are referring too wuc has no connection to either of these projects in central quebec canada they are not sandstonehosted in already extant underground mines inherited from denison they are magnetite hosted at surface open at depth and currently are not nor have been “mines” ablation processing is not appropriate for these projects the websites are httpwwwvanadiumcorpcom and httpwwwblackrockmetalscom size of these is not the issue the right people is key vanadiumcorp has not promoted at all blackrock is another matter it will be interesting to see if trumps infrastracture desire “trumps” his protectionist position i don’t think that the us has the choice imported vanadium is the only option november     pm reply christopher ecclestone tim wuc doesn’t “do” canada the point i am making is that outside of gold and a few isolated shining examples most of the specialty metals projects in canada are pushed by promoters who have no intention of raising the hundreds of millions to build these pharaonic projects this is a great economic loss to canada but so be it if canada wants to be a vanadium player it will need to have execs that scale down the projects to affordable capexes rubber needs to hit the road rather than just more new releases hitting the wires november     am reply jack lifton christopher you are absolutely correct both in particular and in general in canadian mining circles bs stands for bay street  it should stand for bullshit as well small investors were repeatedly fleeced by promoters who had no idea how to produce or what needed to be done to process materials into a product for a supply chain that had a current demand for it jack november     pm reply jim young chris do you have any insights into the vanadium operations at largo resources thank you november     am reply leave
