rapidly is expanding its portfolio with  hotels opened worldwide in 0 and another 0 under construction approved for development or awaiting conversion as of january 0 choice coo and executive vice president patrick pacious spoke with btn lodging editor julie sickel about choices shift in attention toward corporate travelhow is choice reaching out to corporate clientswere really transitioning the company to more of a business travel company that corporate travel managers will look to book their clients if you look at where were headed in the upscale segment which is where the largest demand is were really focused on our cambria hotels  suites and ascend hotel collection brands which are most attractive to the business traveler in cambrias case in particular were opening hotels in key business traveler locations this past year we opened a property next to the walter e washington convention center in washington dc we opened one in white plains ny weve got two opening in new york city in the next several months and we just had the grand opening of our plano texas propertywhat aspects of those two brands are aimed at business travelersthey feature larger lobbies that are really focused on a more social atmosphere and that enable guests to conduct meetings the other piece is in the guest room itself its a larger room and it feels like an upgrade to consumers who come in and see the product it has separate living space separate workspace and separate sleeping space so if a business traveler wants to do work in the hotel room the environment is amenable to that weve paid attention to media hub technology in the cambria hotel rooms which gives guests the ability to bring any type of media to life in that spaceare those the only brands youre gearing toward corporate travelwere doing the same thing in our comfort brand with both comfort suites and comfort inn weve significantly rejuvenated that brand over the last couple of years we did about 0 renovations in 0 alone all that work got completed in the fall in time for peak business travel season and were starting to see great feedback a lot of it has to do with design elements such as recharging stations at the desktop and recharging stations by the bedside those are key things that our business travelers asked for and that were delivering onwhat business travel demographic are you going afterour comfort brand is aimed at the midscale to uppermidscale business traveler where those hotels are located is really designed to meet that demographic we have a lot of manufacturers representatives transportation industrytype corporate clients clients who have multiple distribution companies with 0 hotels across the united states were a company that can accommodate a nationwide business cambria and ascend are geared more toward that upscale meetingfrequency business traveler the individuals who dont travel enough to get to the elite levels of the rewards programs at other hotel companies weve designed both cambria itself and our rewards program to make it faster and easier to earn a free night to earn upgrades to earn rewards our goal is to make it so those rewards can be redeemed for services a business traveler would use at our properties such as dining serviceswhats the breakdown of corporate and leisure businesswere about twothirds leisure and onethird business in our domestic portfolio if you look at cambria and ascend our upscale segment that corporate piece is much higher in our international portfolio its almost reversed with about twothirds business and onethird leisurewhat about group versus transient businessof that onethird domestic business piece about onethird of that is group business and twothirds is transient we are seeing group come back in a significant way and were putting our cambria and ascend hotels in major group travel markets we expect that business to increase significantly weve changed our loyalty program to be more amenable to meeting planners and weve changed our website now to allow much larger groups to book on the website itselfwhat are you focused on in the year aheadwere really focused on attracting midweek business its a real opportunity for us to go after a significant segment thats rebounding were seeing the demand at the upscale level exceeding supply so our goal is to attract that business and drive it to our hotels we know when consumers come into a cambria suites and see it theyre really wowed by the product and so another focus for us is getting that initial trial from a business traveler more
