world energy  materials index is a free floatadjusted market capitalization weighted index that is designed to measure the equity market performance of developed markets in the energy and materials sector you cannot invest directly in an index consider these risks before investing international investing involves currency economic and political risks emergingmarket securities carry illiquidity and volatility risks investments in small andor midsize companies increase the risk of greater price fluctuations the energy and other natural resources industries may be affected by changes in crude oil prices and changes in governmental regulatory policies the fund concentrates on a limited group of industries and is nondiversified because the fund may invest in fewer issuers it is vulnerable to common economic forces and may result in greater losses and volatility growth stocks may be more susceptible to earnings disappointments and value stocks may fail to rebound the use of short selling may result in losses if the securities appreciate in value risks associated with derivatives include increased investment exposure which may be considered leverage and in the case of overthecounter instruments the potential inability to terminate or sell derivatives positions and the potential failure of the other party to the instrument to meet its obligations stock prices may fall or fail to rise over time for several reasons including general financial market conditions and factors related to a specific issuer or industry you can lose money by investing in the fund putnam global natural
