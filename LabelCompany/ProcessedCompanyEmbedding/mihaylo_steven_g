steven g mihaylo i believe all businesses have at least four constituencies customers shareholders employees and suppliers unless the needs and expectations of all constituents are met a business will not reach its full potential without happy satisfied customers a business cannot survive without shareholders receiving a fair return for the risks that they take with their capital a business will not have the resources necessary to grow and create jobs without happy fulfilled employees customers and shareholders will not have their expectations met and finally without suppliers that are part of the partnership the other three constituencies will not attain complete success crexendo business solutions steve mihaylo is chief executive officer of crexendo business solutions crexendo provides
