prophet by abby and sania by elizabeth harris on  november  tweetcomments  please log in to add your comment report abusetranscript of jonah the prophetjonah the prophetwhat is a propheta prophet is a person who can make direct contact with the lord and speak to him jonah is one of  minor prophets and there are four major prophets who are isaiah jeremiah ezekiel and daniel these four prophets made more contact with the lord with the other  making less contact with himwhat was life like at the time of jonahthere was an extremely large fight happening about different religions at the time of jonah jonah decided to flee from his country and travel to nineveh to preach against their people the exile in babylon had just finished and the jeus were returning from this warwhat were the roles and responsibilities of the people in the storyjonah jonah had the role of fleeing to nineveh and making the storm still by being thrown in the water so god would make the storm stopsailors the sailors were the ones who found who made the storm occur and made it stop by praying to god and listening to jonah by him telling the sailors to throw him in the oceangod god created the storm and told jonah to flee to nineveh and preach against their peoplejonah flees from the lordthe word of the lord came to jonah son of amittai  “go to the great city of nineveh and preach against it because its wickedness has come up before me” but jonah ran away from the lord and headed for tarshish he went down to joppa where he found a ship bound for that port after paying the fare he went aboard and sailed for tarshish to flee from the lord then the lord sent a great wind on the sea and such a violent storm arose that the ship threatened to break up  all the sailors were afraid and each cried out to his own god and they threw the cargo into the sea to lighten the shipbut jonah had gone below deck where he lay down and fell into a deep sleep  the captain went to him and said “how can you sleep get up and call on your god maybe he will take notice of us so that we will not perish” then the sailors said to each other “come let us cast lots to find out who is responsible for this calamity” they cast lots and the lot fell on jonah  so they asked him “tell us who is responsible for making all this trouble for us what kind of work do you do where do you come from what is your country from what people are you” he answered “i am a hebrew and i worship the lord the god of heaven who made the sea and the dry land” this terrified them and they asked “what have you done” they knew he was running away from the lord because he had already told them sowhat was the message of your prophetthe message of this story is to not ignore the lord and what he wants us to do it also tells us to stay calm in dangerous situations such as the large storm in our storyhow was the message received at the timethe messaged was received that jonah was a trustworthy prophet for staying in a whale for three days with no food or water more people listened to the lord after the storm was stilled by jonah listening to the lordwhat is the message for todaythe message for today is to have faith and calmness in different situations and listen to yourself if someone tells you to do something immature dont do itmodern day prophet  mother teresamother teresas messages all mean the same thing but just different words it is all about doing things with love peace compassion faithfulness hope courage and joy and one more valuable message everyone should know is everyone you meet is jesus in
