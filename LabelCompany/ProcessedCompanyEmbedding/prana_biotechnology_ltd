prana is a world leader in addressing the role of biological metals in human disease abundant scientific evidence suggests that many agerelated conditions result from pathological interactions between selected metals and target proteins prana biotechnology has observed that metalprotein attenuating compounds mpacs improve alzheimerslike changes in the brain by preventing a build up of betaamyloid deposits which destroy cognitive function prana biotechnology has developed a proprietary library of mpacs which target these interactions preventing target protein aggregation and consequent toxic gain of function our focus has been to build a pipeline of compounds targeting indications with unmet medical needs in neurodegeneration – from blockbuster indications such as alzheimers disease to specialist orphan central nervous system cns indications  so far the company has advanced several of these novel mpacbased therapies to clinical trials or preclinical toxicology testing the most advanced of these – pbt – is being advanced as a novel therapy for alzheimer’s and huntington’s disease phase  trials of pbt in huntington disease and alzheimer’s disease were reported in february and march respectively pbt is also being advanced as a treatment for parkinson’s disease and other movement disorders and in the past has received funding from the michael j fox foundation pbt is also being advanced as a treatment for brain cancer novel mpacs are under screening and assessment for therapeutic applications in neurodegenerative diseases asset pipeline   a short history of prana biotechnology the earliest beginnings of prana biotechnology began in the laboratory of professor rudolph tanzi at massachusetts general hospital in the s when he was investigating the molecular and genetic basis of neurological disease dr tanzi has investigated the genetic causes of alzheimers disease since  and codiscovered the three genes which cause earlyonset familial alzheimer’s disease in  dr tanzis laboratory discovered the crucial link between zinc and copper and the formation of betaamyloid findings that were published in the journal science dr tanzis research formed the scientific basis for founding prana biotechnology which was incorporated in melbourne australia in  pranas first and proofofconcept metalprotein attenuating compound or mpac was based on a compund named clioquinol or pbt originally marketed as an antiamoebic agent after investigating pbts mechanism of action prana scientists showed that it was capable of reducing plaque formation in ad mice  subsequent work in  demonstrated a significant reduction in cognitive decline in a pilot phase a study in alzheimers patients receiving pbt due to a nonrectifiable manufacturing impurity pbt was retired in  and immediately succeeded by an improved pbt version which shares a similar mechanism of action but has superior technical and therapeutic properties more than  mpacs have since been developed although pbt remains prana’s leading drug candidate and the subject of its most advanced clinical trials numerous papers from independent scientists show the potential for therapeutic applications of mpacs in neurodegenerative diseases notably parkinsons and huntingtons diseases and other amyloidbased diseases past and present supporters prana has developed its unique platform technology in association with internationally recognized scientists and academic institutions including the university of melbourne massachusetts general hospital boston ma the mental health research institute of victoria the companys research collaborators also extend to the buck institute for age research novato ca university of california san francisco ca university college london michael j fox
