insurance company of america nlica nationwide life and annuity company of america nlaca and subsidiaries including the affiliated distribution network nfs is incorporated in delaware and maintains its principal executive offices in columbus ohio   the company is a party to litigation and arbitration proceedings in the ordinary course of its business it is often not possible to determine the ultimate outcome of the pending investigations and legal proceedings or to provide reasonable ranges of potential losses with any degree of certainty some matters including certain of those referred to below are in very preliminary stages and the company does not have sufficient information to make an assessment of the plaintiffs’ claims for liability or damages in some of the cases seeking to be certified as class actions the court has not yet decided whether a class will be certified or in the event of certification the size of the class and class period in many of the cases the plaintiffs are seeking undefined amounts of damages or other relief including punitive damages and equitable remedies which are difficult to quantify and cannot be defined based on the information currently available the company does not believe based on information currently known by management that the outcomes of such pending investigations and legal proceedings are likely to have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position however given the large andor indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and inherent unpredictability of litigation it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations in a particular period   in recent years life insurance companies have been named as defendants in lawsuits including class action lawsuits relating to life insurance and annuity pricing and sales practices a number of these lawsuits

impact on its consolidated financial position it is not possible to predict what effect if any the outcome of this investigation may have on the company’s retirement plan operations with respect to promotional and marketing arrangements in general in the future   these proceedings are expected to continue in the future and could result in legal precedents and new industrywide legislation rules and regulations that could significantly affect the financial services industry including mutual fund retirement plan life insurance and annuity companies these proceedings also could affect the outcome of one or more of the company’s litigation matters there can be no assurance that any such litigation or regulatory actions will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s
