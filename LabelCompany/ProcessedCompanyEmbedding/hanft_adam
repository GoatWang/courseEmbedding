notifications to get the news sent straight to you edition us arabi australia brasil canada deutschland españa france greece india italia japan korea maghreb méxico québec south africa united kingdom united states close the blog   pm et  updated sep   the casey anthony brand wins by adam hanft crossposted from fastcompanycom yesterdays surprising verdict was simply put a supremely emotional consumer purchase decision though a potential death sentence was at stake the process by which jurors acted as purchasers followed wellestablished patterns of perception jurors listened drew conclusions and eliminated unpleasant realities that interrupted their existing belief structures in the same way that consumers hear product arguments  or political arguments  and toss out the inconvenient or painful to continue the metaphor the prosecution lost because they acted like product managers powerpoint logic in tow the product manager says buy our widget for all these rational reasons and the state argued buy our argument for all these rational reasons but the defense understood that the case rested on the strength and believability of the casey anthony brand  a brand that the media had been trashing for years before the trial began even though she never took the stand the case rested on whether or not the jury believed she was capable of the horrific murder of which she stood accused so while the state tried to connect the dots the defense knew that they had to overcome the viscerally toxic aspects of her behavior by creating an emotional scaffold for jurors to grab onto a neural framework for rebranding her for thinking of casey anthony in a way that would allow them to resist the prosecutions logical appeals the defense knew that the music mattered as much if not more than the words here are three branding strategies that the defense successfully leveraged • create positive associations that link to deeply seated emotional networks the defense showed a lot of footage of caylee to convince the jury that casey was a good mother it worked images are depth charges that function on an unconscious level those videos branded casey brilliantly connecting her with existing powerful imprints of mothering after all bad mothers dont care enough about their children to memorialize every detail of their lives that footage normalized her made her relatable the more this footage was shown  by either side  the better it was for casey and the harder it was for the jury to shut off the neural networks that linked her to the imprint of a loving mother and in turn the easier it was for the jury to accept the defenses arguments  and to dismiss the hardpartying image the prosecution sought to create its the casey anthony version of johnnie cochranes if it doesnt fit you must acquit if the defendants behavior doesnt fit what you see of them you must acquit behavioral psychologists call in the confirmation bias • its a bad time for authority figures take advantage of it even though the official syntax is the people versus casey anthony jurors can see it as the allpowerful government at war against an individual and if you read any of the polls youll see that americans are increasingly skeptical of what their government has to say to them and i believe that translates down to prosecutors  particularly arrogant ones who laugh and smirk during closing arguments because there is such a builtin mistrust of the government the slightest weakness or flaw in the prosecutions case  and there was no shortage of them  becomes magnified when jose baez in his summation said that the government was using checkbook prosecution he was tapping into the meme of big bad government the government lies and isnt to be trusted in its way  and casey anthony made up imaginary characters and lied in her way its a draw • its a good time for accepting the inexplicable terrorists hijack planes and blow up the world trade center the biggest and allegedly the smartest banks in america created the worst financial crisis since the great depression and nearly bankrupted themselves black swans  the highly improbable  are everywhere thats the casey anthony brand narrative that the defense sold the truth can coexist with a defiance of logic the absence of any forensic evidence linking casey anthony to the murder gave the jury something to hang their existential doubts on despite the densely patterned wallpaper of lies she told about one imaginary friend after the other the mother didnt kill the child the times in which we live created room for the jury to develop a level of comfort with what outside the courtroom appeared to be a totally absurd narrative there will be no shortage of theories proffered about this case but unlike the oj judgment where the arguments revolved around color lines the casey anthony decision is more complex beyond the prosecutions tactical mistakes  and the argument that they should have gone for a lesser charge is a good one  is the fact that there were two brands fighting for the sale on one side was the brand of motherhood thats a damn strong brand even when that motherhood waits a month to report her daughters disappearance and feels no compunction about pole dancing and getting a tattoo in this frightening period of uncertainty on the other side was the brand of power and authority a brand with unlimited resources a brand that is trusted less and less every day we know the outcome which leads to the question what kind of brand are you selling follow adam hanft on twitter

ago this week i’m talking to new york citybased brand guru adam hanft adam has consulted for everyone from microsoft to president obama and is a respected writer in his own right so i picked his brains about brand disruption tech and society listen to richard’s chat with adam hanft a former comedy writer copywriter adagency boss and now brand strategist through his company hanft projects adam has an interesting perspective on brands and how they fit in with popular culture he’s a fascinating guy full of wisdom and i had a great time talking to him recommended innovation isn’t just for startups top ten podcasts if you want to learn about… the best of the podcast we talked about • how brands are a reflection of how consumers are feeling • what donald trump’s rise means for brands • the craft beer wars in the us • why bigger isn’t necessarily better anymore • disruption in the fintech space • why there should be pressure on bigger established companies to innovate • and the coming together of startup and corporate culture adam hanft on… brands brands don’t function in a vacuum disconnected from the larger culture brands are very much a reflection of how consumers are feeling in general about their lives and about the institutions around them branding branding is often misinterpreted as this ornament or this veneer that goes on top of a product but in the purest and the right sense of branding it is really inseparable from the product … think about brand as a combination an elegant fusion of product and experience and value in terms of not just your value proposition but values with a capital v – ‘what is the mission of the company’ language language always changes fast technology accelerates it and i think we are going to see even more and more new language emerge we are going to see also more tribalism because people use shorthand to create bonds and to create intimacy in groups social media i think social media is a powerful way for big brands to break down walls and establish intimacy individuality technology allows people to be identified as individuals and companies and brands that don’t identify people as individuals are in trouble long term … individuality is very much a millennial value boomers also have that desire different generations express it or internalise it in different ways corporations and customers if you are big and powerful then you should be able to use your muscle your clout your resources to make my life better you should be able to give me better credit scoring to that point or better rates or better customer service better products more imaginative innovative products than a startup i think you need to focus your strength on making the lives better to consumers through your resources as opposed to just putting a marketing veneer on something gardening and startups i often use the analogy of gardening a big tree takes a long time to die but it will die eventually a small tree or plant can go quickly i think startups are like the small trees they have got to be positioned right quickly they need to get traction right away they need to establish roots and they need nurturing big companies have the luxury of a longerterm horizon people tell richard stuff episode  adam hanft brand strategist podcast play in new window  downloadsubscribe apple podcasts  android  rss subscribe  linkedin
