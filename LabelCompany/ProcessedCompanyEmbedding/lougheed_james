resumed his position as leader of the opposition in the senate until his death in 9 aged  lougheed was a strict conservative in many ways his relationship to the first nations people could be both patriarchal and supportive generally he held the virtually ubiquitous western view that first nations people were essentially unintelligent children who needed white control in order to survive this even though his own motherinlaw was from a first nation however when indian affairs officials refused to allow the six nations to participate in the first calgary stampede in 9 lougheed with rb

sir james alexander carpenter lawyer businessman and politician b  sept  in brampton upper canada son of john lougheed and mary ann alexander m  sept  isabella belle clarke hardisty in fort calgary calgary and they had four sons and two daughters d  nov 9 in ottawa james lougheed’s family was of protestant irish descent his father being born in upper canada and his mother in ireland when james was two or three they moved from peel county to toronto the young boy grew up in cabbagetown the poorer eastern section of the city the family were of modest means in james’s teenaged years they rented a small frame house at the junction of queen and river streets near the don river james attended the park street school according to his obituary in the calgary herald lougheed often attributed his success to the early influence of his mother a devout and active worker at berkeley street methodist church she sent him to two sunday schools little trinity anglican in the morning and berkeley street in the afternoon it was a strict upbringing berkeley street methodists his lifelong friend emerson coatsworth would later comment “did not play cards or dance we did not attend the theatre or the races” lougheed and coatsworth shared orange connections as well in  james’s first cousins jane and elizabeth lougheed would remember that while a stripling he had been a chaplain in the orange young britons – he “wore a white gown and carried a bible at parades” james’s father intended that his sons follow him into carpentry and the building trade which james did after leaving school in 9 the firm for which james worked also employed william pearce a surveyor and later a prominent calgarian after lougheed’s death in 9 pearce would recall his acquaintance with him in 9– “he was then a very young man in fact he was regarded as a boy but he was always very industrious and aggressive” although his father may have been pleased with his progress his mother was not she wanted him to consider options other than the building trades she encouraged him after he had left school to continue attending the two churches on sunday at little trinity he came to know samuel hume blake a distinguished layman and eminent lawyer after volunteering to become the church’s assistant librarian blake took a liking to the clever young man and once said to him “boy you have too good a head to be a carpenter why don’t you take up law” james relished the idea and went back to school he chose weston high school west of toronto upon his return to cabbagetown he and coatsworth prepared together for their matriculation exams for entrance to osgoode hall which they passed in  in  or  lougheed was articled to the local law firm of beaty hamilton and cassels and in may  he would be sworn in as a solicitor following his return to toronto james his younger brother samuel coatsworth and six others formed the awascal literary society at berkeley methodist church all that survives of this club is a financial account by treasurer coatsworth of an oyster supper held on  dec  before his death in 9 lougheed told a reporter that it was at the awascal society that he had received his “early training as a speaker” he may well have put this training to use in  when as a member of the young men’s conservative club he fought hard in the successful campaign to return sir john a macdonald to power it was not surprising given his orange background that he identified with the conservatives according to his cousins his political interests had always run deep and he had often spent his spare time attending the provincial parliament “where he liked to listen to the speeches” in january  lougheed now a practising lawyer decided to move with his brother sam to winnipeg a year later following the canadian pacific railway’s construction teams james moved farther west to medicine hat alta then just before the rails reached the hamlet of fort calgary in august  he and sam moved there lougheed’s marriage to belle hardisty the daughter of the late william lucas hardisty a hudson’s bay company chief factor in the mackenzie river district and his wife mary an englishspeaking mixedblood woman solidified james’s links with the west belle had received a good education at mathilda davis’s school in st andrews man and then at the wesleyan female college in hamilton ont james met her in fort calgary while she was visiting her uncle richard charles hardisty chief factor of the hbc’s upper saskatchewan district through this marriage lougheed acquired a close connection to both richard hardisty the richest man in the northwest territories and to donald alexander smith his wife’s uncle by marriage and soon to be one of the wealthiest men in canada james’s legal practice thrived the cpr soon became one of his most important clients in  he formed a partnership with peter mccarthy and two years later he became a dominion qc in 9 he would add to his legal business a brokerage firm lougheed and taylor limited as well beginning in the s he made good investments in calgary real estate building many rental properties in the downtown area his showpiece the lougheed building an office block that included a seat theatre the sherman grand was completed in 9 in 9–9 the lougheeds had erected a magnificent sandstone mansion beaulieu in southwest calgary the duke of connaught the governor general of canada would stay here with his family in 9 and the lougheeds held a huge garden party for the prince of wales in  and it was at beaulieu that belle lougheed calgary’s principal hostess raised their children she also took an active part in a good number of community organizations for example she was the first treasurer of the women’s hospital aid society 9 vicepresident for the alberta district of the national council of women of canada  first viceregent of the colonel macleod chapter of the imperial order daughters of the empire 9 first president of the women’s pioneer association of southern alberta 9 and first president of the calgary branch of the victorian order of nurses in many ways lougheed seemed far removed from his humble toronto origins he took no part in the orange lodge in alberta and never talked about his cabbagetown roots moreover contrary to his berkeley street methodist teachings he and his wife hosted dances in their mansion and developed a strong interest in the theatre as maynard j joiner the grand’s manager in the mid 9s said of james lougheed “whenever in the city one of his greatest delights was to be present at one of our performances” shortly after his arrival in alberta the former torontonian had become a strong champion for western interests charles edward dudley wood the editor of the fort macleod gazette wrote of him in late 9 “he is an alberta man first last and everytime” after richard hardisty a federal senator died in 9 lougheed was selected as his successor called to the senate on  dec 9 he became at  its youngest member in addition to his relationship to hardisty and smith he was a personal friend of interior minister edgar dewdney he had met sir john a macdonald in calgary in  had been consistently loyal to the prime minister amidst the volatile western politics of the s and was a prominent investor in the conservative calgary herald the reverend leonard gaetz a leading tory in the red deer district had spoken for many when he wrote in october 9 “mr lougheed is incomparably the best name we can offer he is a gentleman of culture ability  position with thorough knowledge of and faith in alberta a conservative of the conservatives a good address and will make i believe a first class representative” lougheed subsequently moved back and forth between calgary and ottawa to give him more time to look after his extensive political and business interests he would persuade richard bedford bennett a young new brunswick lawyer to join his law firm bennett arrived in january 9 and they would work together for over two decades until lougheed’s attempt to dissolve their partnership without bennett’s agreement caused a bitter quarrel and separation in 9 during the 9s lougheed emerged in the senate as a true representative of the west and an advocate of provincial status frequently he educated his colleagues concerning the nature of the region and its institutions about the impact there of past legislation and on the need to ensure that the west was fully comprehended in various statutes he spoke often enough to be noticed yet avoided challenging the senate’s seasoned gladiators he also used his considerable legal skills to improve legislation especially in the committee stage of detailed consideration gradually he broadened his perspective learning to speak from a national as well as a western perspective his sheer ability diplomacy and geniality won him respect in 9 he was elected by his colleagues to succeed sir mackenzie bowell as the conservative leader in the senate a position he would occupy until his death with respect to the autonomy bills introduced in the house of commons in february  to create the provinces of alberta and saskatchewan lougheed had been predictably partisan particularly concerning the education clauses better to forgo provincial status he remarked darkly in an interview in winnipeg on  february than to have the hands of the new provinces “tied for all time to come on this question of education” it was not a “sectional” or regional issue rather it was a constitutional one “a deliberate assault on provincial rights the fundamental basis of our political fabric” he also denounced the federal government’s gerrymander of seats in the new provinces intended to produce strong liberal majorities in the new provincial legislatures his objections naturally were ignored by the liberal government from 9 when the conservatives came to power to 9 lougheed was the government leader in the upper chamber and a member of cabinet for at least the first five of these years his diplomatic skills were tested to the full as he had to try to steer the legislation of the government of sir robert laird borden through the senate while the conservatives had a minority of seats there as long as sir wilfrid laurier’s liberals held the majority they could and did defeat numerous measures from about 9 lougheed was able to command a majority most of the time though it was not always reliable given the independentmindedness of some senators within cabinet he served as a minister without portfolio october 9–february 9 minister of soldiers’ civil reestablishment february 9–july 9 and then under arthur meighen minister of the interior july 9–december 9 a portfolio that included indian affairs and mines during most of this tenyear period he was the sole member of the upper chamber who could speak for the cabinet and as such he had to master the full range of government legislation – a task required of no minister in the commons lougheed was thoroughly conservative in his views beginning with the role of the senate “this is a revising body” he remarked in 9 its duty was to keep a rein on popular enthusiasms and “to check hasty legislation” in debates he favoured business and free enterprise “parliament exists not for the purpose of wrecking the interests of the producer” he said in 9 “but rather to protect them” he deplored excessive taxation and the “paternalism” of subsidies and protective tariffs in 9 he had objected to a bill to create the victoria day holiday on the ground of loss of business he contended that outsiders provoked much of the labour trouble in canada and in 9 tried to have the criminal code amended “to prevent alien agitators from coming into canada and organizing strikes” following the winnipeg general strike in  see mike sokolowiski he strongly supported the government’s antisedition legislation lougheed also shared common western conservative views about canada’s native peoples and immigrants canada in his opinion had by far the best record of any country of dealing with its indigenous peoples he firmly believed that they required strong paternal supervision and must not be allowed to impede progress while in opposition he had wanted the government to take power to sell indian lands especially when they were located close to settlements which he thought demoralized the natives after his own party came to power he strongly supported its 9 measure to initiate sales in 9 he fully supported a conservative bill to force compulsory enfranchisement or the elimination of indian status under the indian act two years later he strenuously opposed as “retrograde and reactionary” the decision of the new liberal government of william lyon mackenzie king to repeal compulsory enfranchisement lougheed had been uncharacteristically extreme – though fully representative of his fellow alberta conservatives – in denouncing the immigration policy of the laurier government “we will have the very excrescence of european immigration placed on our shores” he huffed miraculously however under the borden government immigrants became subjects of lougheed’s praise in 9 lougheed an admirer of the british empire had opposed laurier’s naval service bill it provided he thought inadequate help to britain in the emergency of the european naval race and he feared that establishing a separate canadian navy would lead to the severance of canada from the empire his proposed amendment to submit the question to the country was defeated by the liberal majority in 9 the borden government used closure to force its naval aid bill intended to give britain  million for construction through the commons lougheed negotiated an arrangement with senate liberal leader sir george william ross to amend the legislation to provide for an appropriation for a canadian navy in return for passage of the bill enraged by the government’s use of closure however laurier and most of the liberal senators were determined to defeat the measure nonetheless lougheed introduced it he outlined the government’s case in impressive detail in the longest speech of his career nearly three hours but the senate killed the bill by passing an amendment similar to lougheed’s in 9 – that the naval policy be put to the people upon the outbreak of war in 9 lougheed exhibited a restrained commitment to seeing the “dominions    march in step with the armies of the empire” but with his son clarence hardisty serving overseas his response to the war like that of many other canadians became personal and emotional by  he was convinced that germany meant to convert canada “into a transatlantic germany” thus the war was a struggle for national survival and the military service act of 9 was an “extraordinary” law necessary for “the preservation of the state” he rejected the idea of a referendum on conscription why should the government ask the opinion of pacifists slackers and socialists men who “proclaim their disloyalty from the house tops” when senator philippeauguste choquette requested that implementation of conscription be suspended until after the 9 election lougheed responded vehemently “i propose that any member of this house who preaches sedition as this honourable gentleman is doing will not be heard by this house” he observed during his introduction of the wartime elections bill in 9 that the emergency justified setting aside some venerated traditions the essential principle of the bill he said was “if a man objects to fight he should not be permitted to vote” clearly winning a war to preserve democracy justified for lougheed limiting the democratic rights of many canadians as the war proceeded lougheed assumed increasing responsibilities for the government in recognition of which he would be made kcmg on  june  in june–september 9 he was acting minister of militia and defence in the absence of samuel hughes he found the department in chaotic disarray and spent much time trying to get shell production properly coordinated between canada and great britain he also raised donations from the public for machine guns in response to complaints concerning the treatment of returned wounded soldiers the government in june 9 established the military hospitals commission on  july lougheed became its chair it supervised hospitals and other longterm care facilities retrained and helped find employment for those able to work coordinated the effort with the provinces and solicited public support in october borden also asked lougheed to chair the commission on natural resources which was expected to solve the problem of unemployment by suggesting methods for improving agriculture and the marketing of goods internally and abroad locating land for agricultural development and considering how returned soldiers might be employed and how more capital might be raised for both agriculture and manufacturing a plan for soldier settlement suggested by the commission in  had little appeal so the government devised quite a different scheme the following year in 9 the work of the military hospitals commission was divided into two departments the militia department took over most of the military hospitals while the new department of soldiers’ civil reestablishment assumed the remaining duties of the commission and planned for demobilization and the reabsorption of soldiers into society and the economy from june 9 to september 9 lougheed in addition to performing his duties as interior minister would serve as acting minister of soldiers’ civil reestablishment historians desmond morton and glenn wright though they recognize lougheed’s role in establishing the military hospitals commission and the new department contend that he was chronically indifferent to the affairs of the commission and to veterans’ problems generally in  lougheed played a prominent role in the senate’s consideration of two important postwar measures one external one domestic in presenting the treaty of versailles for ratification he noted that canada had made a significant advance in international status as a signatory and as a member of the league of nations he argued in favour of article  of the league’s covenant which bound members to support the territorial integrity of other member nations when under attack apparently he was unaware that borden and his canadian colleagues at paris fearful of involvement in future european wars had tried to eliminate or modify the article throughout the negotiations leading to the treaty and would continue to do so thereafter on the home front lougheed shepherded through the senate the contentious grand trunk railway acquisition bill designed to round out the government’s accumulation of bankrupt railways that would lead to the formation of the canadian national railways even senators opposed to the bill recognized his introductory speech as “a brilliant oration” the real work however was accomplished in committee where lougheed demonstrated mature diplomacy and leadership still since several conservative senators were passionately opposed to government ownership the bill carried only by the narrow margin of 9 to  in the fall of 9 while interior minister in the shortlived meighen administration lougheed was responsible for amending existing policy when he opened the crown forest reserves on the eastern slopes of the rocky mountains to petroleum exploration a change long desired by calgary oilmen but previously resisted by the interior department the new policy required that a leased area be divided into two equal parts one of which would generate revenue for the crown this policy further modified after the discovery of oil at leduc in 9 ultimately became the means by which vast sums were transferred to alberta’s treasury lougheed was instrumental as well in 9 in passing the legislation that killed the commission of conservation established in 9 see james white resentful of the powers it had exercised at arm’s length from government control he claimed that it had duplicated the work of at least six government departments and that its abolition would save some  annually shortly thereafter he supported a bill to establish “a national research institute” which would allow the government to centralize all its scientific and research work in ottawa and to place it under ministerial control see robert fulford ruttan this bill however failed to pass after the defeat of the meighen government by the liberals under king later in 9 lougheed continued to lead the conservatives in the senate the new government was just shy of a majority in the commons and the conservative majority in the senate had no intention of being cooperative among the measures rejected was the canadian national railways construction bill in 9 during a session marked by unusually aggressive partisanship as the parties tried to position themselves for the next election lougheed was seriously ill early in 9 but he seemed to be recovered when he returned to his duties in may in july anticipating an election call meighen summoned him back to ottawa again to assist with electoral organization a task along with patronage at which the calgary senator had always excelled the work continued into the fall when during the coldest october then on record for the nation’s capital lougheed contracted bronchitis which turned to pneumonia he succumbed on  november in the ottawa civic hospital and was buried in calgary on the th in the year of his death a village in central alberta was renamed lougheed in his honour a small peak west of banff was named after him as well in  but two years later the name was transferred to a larger more accessible peak on the edge of the rocky mountains near canmore earlier in  vilhjalmur stefansson had explored one of the queen elizabeth islands in what is now nunavut and designated it lougheed island sir james lougheed was a true victorian believer in hard work and the idea of progress thanks to the timing of his arrival in calgary his training as a carpenter and a lawyer and his marriage to a woman whose family had power and wealth in the northwest this ambitious and capable torontonian became the dominant business and political figure in calgary at the turn of the century he also served most competently on the national level as a cabinet minister and a party leader in the senate which in his day largely represented an aristocracy of business and the law in many respects lougheed was the exemplar of the ideals of the senate perhaps only raoul dandurand commanded equal regard not only had lougheed risen above his background he had also acquired and honed the industriousness the courtly manners and the political skills that enabled him to reach a position of leadership and respect among his peers and the wider public david j hall and donald b smith one of lougheed’s boyhood books thomas pelham dale’s a life’s motto illustrated by biographical examples london 9 is held by the lougheed house conservation society which looks after the lougheed mansion and gardens in calgary the motto from ecclesiastes is “whatsoever thy hand findeth to do do it with thy might for there is no work nor device nor knowledge nor wisdom in the grave whither thou goest” the book contains the handwritten inscription “presented to james a lougheed for punctuality and attention at trinity sunday school from his teacher october  9” lougheed must have valued this book highly since he kept it all his life and passed it on to his eldest son clarence a lawyer with lougheed and taylor the authors wish to thank professor david h breen of the university of british columbia for his comments on the issue of
