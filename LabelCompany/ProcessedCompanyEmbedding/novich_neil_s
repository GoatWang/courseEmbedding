of what linkedin members have to say about neili worked under neil novichs leadership for  years at ryerson i feel that neils greatest strength is that he gets out of the ivory tower this is a leadership trait that some of the greatest leaders in history have demonstrated for example abraham lincoln spent the majority of his time among his troops in order to gather the first hand knowledge needed to make informed accurate and timely decisions the typical union soldier enjoyed a bond with lincoln that few people would ever have with a us president myself and many others enjoyed such a bond with neil novich who sacrificed much of his personal time to get to know us personally and professionally i have the greatest admiration for neil he is one of the most intelligent people i have ever met and is a brilliant strategist neil was very successful executing strategies to drive operational excellence organic growth and improved customer satisfaction these initiatives were effectively and concisely communicated so that all employees would understand the goals and could identify their action to meet them the urgency to perform well was continuously reinforced and the organization continued to improve despite the immense challenges presented by conversion to sap and ongoing consolidations resulting from acquisitions most notably integris metals which doubled the companys size on a final note the training and personal development i received at ryerson has really taken me to the next level in my career i can never thank neil enough for all his support i’m certain that any company neil chooses to lead will be a great companysee moresee lesssign up to see who recommended neilgroupsbain  company global alumnidata science  machine learning newslettercxo
