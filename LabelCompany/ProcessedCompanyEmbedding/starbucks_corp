practices adherence to those standards informs our sourcing decisions and ensures we are working with suppliers who share our commitment to ethical sourcing our buyers work directly with a diverse set of suppliers who share our social and environmental values to negotiate contracts for the products we need in our operations or sell to our customers frequent factory assessments have been a key part of our strategy since we started the program in  we continue to work with more than  factories on programs to improve standards and in  we assessed  factories and found that  of them failed to meet our standards even though our approach is to work with suppliers to correct the issues there are times when we halt business due to the nature of the issues and until adequate resolution takes place we were able to implement improvement plans in all of the factories assessed and did not have to discontinued working with a single factory for standards issues we are continuing to collaborate with others in our industry to address ethical sourcing best practices in our shared supply bases starbucks is a member of the global social compliance program a businessdriven effort to promote the

longrunning dispute between starbucks and ethiopia starbucks agreed to support and promote ethiopian coffees an article in bbc news states that ethiopian ownership of popular coffee designations such

the world cocoa foundation ethos water ethos a brand of bottled water acquired by starbucks in  is sold at locations throughout north america ethos bottles feature prominent labeling stating helping children get clean water referring to the fact that us from each us bottle sold us per bottle in canada is used to fund clean water projects in underdeveloped areas although sales of ethos water have raised over us for clean water efforts the brand is not incorporated as a charity critics have argued that the claim on the label misleads consumers into thinking that ethos is primarily a charitable organization when it is actually a forprofit brand and the vast majority of the sale price  does not support cleanwater projects the founders of ethos have stated that the brand is intended to raise awareness of thirdworld clean water issues and provide socially responsible consumers with an opportunity to support the cause by choosing ethos over other brands starbucks has since redesigned the american version of the ethos water bottles stating the amount of money donated per bottle in the description food bank donations since  starbucks has been donating leftover pastries in the united

a loss and clustering several locations in a small geographical area ie saturating the market have been labeled anticompetitive by critics for example starbucks fueled its initial expansion into the uk market with a buyout of seattle coffee company but then used its capital and influence to obtain prime locations some of which operated at a financial loss critics claimed this was an unfair

iterations that were decorated with winter or christmasoriented imagery such as reindeer and ornaments but no overtly religious symbols the cup design was discussed extensively on social media with some citing the cup as another example of the war on christmas calling it cupgate and others expressed puzzlement over the outrage generated by a simple cup the red cups were discussed so much that a man named joshua feuerstien posted all over social media telling people to have the baristas write merry christmas on the cups as their name so that way baristas had to call off the drinks saying merry christmas this also started the trend merrychristmasstarbucks opening without planning permission starbucks has been accused by local authorities of opening several stores in the uk in retail premises without the planning permission for a change of use to a restaurant starbucks has argued that under current planning law there is no official classification of coffee shops starbucks therefore encounters the difficult scenario whereby local authorities interpret the guidance in different ways in some instances coffee shops operate under a permission some as mixed use aa and some as a in may  a branch of starbucks was completed on st jamess street in kemptown brighton england despite having been refused permission by the local planning authority brighton and hove city council who claimed there were too many coffee shops already present on the street starbucks appealed the decision by claiming it was a retail store selling bags of coffee mugs and sandwiches gaining a sixmonth extension but the council ordered starbucks to remove all tables and chairs from the premises to comply with planning regulations for a retail shop  residents signed a petition against the store but after a public inquiry in june  a government inspector gave permission for the store to remain a starbucks in hertford won its appeal in april  after being open for over a year without planning permission two stores in edinburgh one in manchester one in cardiff one in pinner and harrow were also opened without planning permission the pinner cafe opened in  won an appeal to stay open in  one in blackheath lewisham was also under investigation in  for breach of its licence operating as a restaurant when it only had a licence for four seats and was limited to take away options there was a considerable backlash from members of the local community who opposed any large chains opening in what is a conservation area to this date the starbucks is still operating as a takeaway outlet israel a store on piccadilly with its windows boarded up after being smashed by protesters a damaged front window of a starbucks coffee shop in toronto there have been calls for boycott of starbucks stores and products because it has been wrongly claimed that starbucks sends part of its profits to the israeli military but such allegations are based on a hoax letter attributed to the president chairman and ceo of starbucks howard schultz who is jewish and supports israels right to exist he is a recipient of several israeli awards including the israel th anniversary tribute award for playing a key role in promoting a close alliance between the united states and israel the hoax letter claiming that schultz had donated money to the israeli military was actually written by an australian weblogger andrew winkler who has admitted fabricating the document starbucks responded to these claims widely circulated on the internet stating that neither chairman howard schultz nor starbucks fund support the israeli army starbucks is a nonpolitical organization and does not support individual political causes the protests against starbucks derived from the winkler letter were not the first earlier protests occurred in june  in cairo dubai and beirut universities in response to schultzs criticism of yasser arafat starbucks has been a regular target of activists protesting against israels role in the gaza war over the claims organizations have urged a boycott of starbucks accusing starbucks of serving as an ally of israeli militarists starbucks was forced to close a store in beirut lebanon due to demonstrators shouting antiisrael slogans and causing customers to flee demonstrators hung several banners on the shops window and used white tape to paste a star of david over the greenandwhite starbucks sign they also distributed a letter saying schultz is one of the pillars of the american jewish lobby and the owner of the starbucks which they said donates money to the israeli military on january  two starbucks stores in london were the target of vandalism by propalestinian demonstrators who broke windows and reportedly ripped out fittings and equipment after clashes with riot police the way i see it quotes by artists writers scientists and others have appeared on starbucks cups since  in a campaign called the way i see it some of the quotes have caused controversy including one by writer armistead maupin and another by jonathan wells that linked darwinism to eugenics abortion and racism disclaimers were added to the cups noting that these views were not necessarily those of starbucks us military viral email a us marines sergeant emailed ten of his friends in august  having wrongly been told that starbucks had stopped supplying the military with coffee donations because the company did not support the iraq war the email became viral being sent to tens of millions of people starbucks and the originator sent out a correction but starbucks vp of global communications valerie oneil said in september  that the email was still being forwarded to her every few weeks gun controversy as gun laws in many us states have become more relaxed and more states have adopted open carry or concealed carry statutes some gun owners have begun carrying guns while performing everyday shopping or other tasks many stores and companies have responded by banning the carrying of guns on their premises as allowed by many states local laws starbucks has not instituted a policy banning guns in their stores in  the brady campaign proposed a boycott of starbucks due to their gun policy at that time starbucks released a statement saying we comply with local laws and statutes in all the communities we serve that means we abide by the laws that permit open carry in  us states where these laws dont exist openly carrying weapons in our stores is prohibited the political policy and legal debates around these issues belong in the legislatures and courts not in our stores in  the national gun victims action council published an open letter to starbucks asking them to revise their policy and also proposed a brew not bullets boycott of the chain until the policy is changed with valentines day selected as a particular day to boycott the chain in response gun rights advocates started a counter starbucks appreciation day buycott to support starbucks stance and suggested paying for products using twodollar bills as a sign of second amendment support on july   moms demand action for gun sense in america initiated a petition demanding a ban on guns in starbucks stores on september   founder and ceo howard schultz asked customers to no longer bring guns into its stores he made the comments in an open letter on the companys website schultz said he was not banning guns but making a request samesex marriage in january  a starbucks executive stated that the company supports the legalization of samesex marriage this resulted in a boycott by the national organization for marriage a political organization that opposes samesex marriage who received  signatures in favor of their boycott in response ceo howard schultz had this to say if you feel respectfully that you can get a higher return than the  percent you got last year its a free country you can sell your shares of starbucks and buy shares in another company thank you very much in addition  people also signed a petition thanking starbucks for its support as of june   samesex marriage in the united states is legal in all states following the supreme court ruling in obergefell v hodges european tax avoidance in october  starbucks faced criticism after a reuters investigation found that the company reportedly paid only £ million in corporation tax in the uk over  years despite generating over £ billion in sales—this included no tax payments on £ billion of sales in the three years prior to  it is alleged that starbucks was able to do this by charging high licensing fees to the uk branch of the business allowing them to declare a £ million loss in  the uk subsidiary pays patent fees to the us subsidiary purchases coffee beans from the netherlands subsidiary where corporation tax is lower than in the uk and uses the swiss subsidiary for other miscellaneous services a yougov survey suggested that starbucks brand image was substantially weakened by the controversy surrounding how much tax it pays in the uk several weeks after the allegations surfaced starbucks chief financial officer cfo appeared before the public accounts committee in november  and admitted that the dutch government granted a special tax rate to their european headquarters which the uk business pays royalties to dutch law permits companies to transfer royalties collected from other countries to tax havens without incurring taxes unlike in the rest of the eu the cfo denied that they chose the netherlands as their european headquarters to avoid tax explaining that the companys dutch coffee roasting plant was the reason for the decision until  the royalty rate was  of uk sales but after being challenged by uk tax authorities it was reduced to  the cfo told the committee this reflected costs such as designing new stores and products but admitted that there was no detailed analysis by which the rate is decided the coffee they serve in the uk is purchased from the swiss subsidiary which charges a  markup on the wholesale price and pays  corporation tax on profits coffee is not transported to switzerland but the  people who work in the subsidiary assess coffee quality regarding starbucks frequent reports of loss in the uk the cfo told the committee that starbucks are not at all pleased about their financial performance in the uk mps replied that it just doesnt ring true that the business made a loss pointing out that the head of the business had been promoted to a new post in the us and they consistently told shareholders that the business was profitable in ireland starbucks subsidiary ritea only paid € in tax between  and  and the subsidiary recorded losses in every year other than  ritea is owned by netherlandsbased starbucks coffee emea their french and german subsidiaries make large losses because they are heavily in debt to the dutch subsidiary which charges them higher interest rates than the group pays to borrow reuters calculated that without paying interest on the loans and royalty fees the french and german subsidiaries would have paid € million in tax the dutch subsidiary that royalties are paid to made a € profit in  from revenues of € million while the company that roasts coffee made a profit of € million in  and paid tax of € protesters who were unimpressed by the companys offer to pay £ million in tax over the next two years staged demonstrations in december  in affiliation with uk uncut in june  the european commission antitrust regulator launched an investigation of the companys tax practices in the netherlands as part of a wider probe of multinational companies tax arrangements in various european countries the investigation ended in october  with the ec ordering starbucks to pay up to € million in overdue taxes which the ec regards as illegal state support for corporations a pair of economists from the ku leuven noted that the commission did not forbid starbucks tax construction as such pretending that starbucks is a dutch company and effectively rewarding the dutch state for its lenient tax policy chinese pricing in october  china central television accused chinese starbucks of overpricing the report compared the price of a tall  fl oz  ml latte in beijing chicago london and mumbai it was found that beijing stores charged the most while mumbai stores charged the least it was also found that a tall latte cost  chinese yuan approx usd  to make but it sold at  yuan approx usd  racetogether marketing campaign on monday march   starbucks launched a marketing campaign to promote conversations about race between customers and employees this marketing campaign also called for baristas to draw the race together hashtag on customers cups  similar to how starbucks is

cups was always scheduled to end sunday supporting refugees on january   president donald trump signed an executive order to indefinitely suspend the entry of syrian refugees into the united states

letter to starbucks employees stating in part there are more than  million citizens of the world recognized as refugees by the united nations and we are developing plans to hire  of them over five years in the  countries around the world where starbucks does business and we will start this effort here in the us by making the initial focus of our hiring efforts on those individuals who have served with us troops as interpreters and support personnel in the various countries where our military has asked for such support as a result of schultzs letter supporters of president trumps

locations throughout north america ethos bottles feature prominent labeling stating helping children get clean water referring to the fact that us from each us bottle sold us per bottle in canada is used to fund clean water projects in underdeveloped areas although sales of ethos water have raised over us for clean water efforts the brand is not incorporated as a charity critics have argued that the claim on the label misleads consumers into thinking that ethos is primarily a charitable organization when it is actually a forprofit brand and the vast majority of the sale price  does not support cleanwater projects the founders of ethos have stated that the brand is intended to raise awareness of thirdworld clean water issues and provide socially responsible consumers with an opportunity to support the cause by choosing ethos over other brands starbucks has since redesigned the american version of the ethos water bottles stating the amount of money donated per bottle in

expand and maintain their dominant market position including buying out competitors leases intentionally operating at a loss and clustering several locations in a small geographical area ie saturating the market have been labeled anticompetitive by critics for example starbucks fueled its initial expansion into the uk market with a buyout of seattle coffee company but then used its capital and influence to obtain prime locations some of which operated at a financial loss critics claimed this was an unfair attempt to drive out small independent competitors who could not afford to pay inflated prices for premium real estate while relations with independent coffeehouse chains have been strained some owners have credited starbucks with educating customers on coffee labor disputes

main article christmas controversy § s in november  starbucks introduced solid red seasonal cups unlike previous seasonal iterations that were decorated with winter or christmasoriented imagery such as reindeer and ornaments but no overtly religious symbols the cup design was discussed extensively on social media with some citing the cup as another example of the war on christmas calling it cupgate and others expressed puzzlement over the outrage generated by a simple cup the red cups were discussed so much that a man named joshua feuerstien posted all over social media telling people to have the baristas write merry christmas on the cups as their name so that way baristas had to call off the drinks saying merry christmas this also started the trend merrychristmasstarbucks opening without planning permission starbucks has been accused by local authorities of opening several stores in the uk in retail premises without the planning permission for a change of use to a restaurant starbucks has argued that under current planning law there is no official classification of coffee shops starbucks therefore encounters the difficult scenario whereby local authorities interpret the guidance in different ways in some instances coffee shops operate under a permission some as mixed use aa and some as a in may  a branch of starbucks was completed on st jamess street in kemptown brighton england despite having been refused permission by the local planning authority brighton and hove city council who claimed there were too many coffee shops already present on the street starbucks appealed the decision by claiming it was a retail store selling bags of coffee mugs and sandwiches gaining a sixmonth extension but the council ordered starbucks to remove all tables and chairs from the premises to comply with planning regulations for a retail shop  residents signed a petition against the store but after a public inquiry in june  a government inspector gave permission for the store to remain a starbucks in hertford won its appeal in april  after being open for over a year without planning permission two stores in edinburgh one in manchester one in cardiff one in pinner and harrow were also opened without planning permission the pinner cafe opened in  won an appeal to stay open in  one in blackheath lewisham was also under investigation in  for breach of its licence operating as a restaurant when it only had a licence for four seats and was limited to take away options there was a considerable backlash from members of the local community who opposed any large chains opening in what is a conservation area to this date the starbucks is still operating as a takeaway outlet israel a store on piccadilly with its windows boarded up after being smashed by protesters a damaged front window of a starbucks coffee shop in toronto there have been calls for boycott of starbucks stores and products because it has been wrongly claimed that starbucks sends part of its profits to the israeli military but such allegations are based on a hoax letter attributed to the president chairman and ceo of starbucks howard schultz who is jewish and supports israels right to exist he is a recipient of several israeli awards including the israel th anniversary tribute award for playing a key role in promoting a close alliance between the united states and israel the hoax letter claiming that schultz had donated money to the israeli military was actually written by an australian weblogger andrew winkler who has admitted fabricating the document starbucks responded to these claims widely circulated on the internet stating that neither chairman howard schultz nor starbucks fund support the israeli army starbucks is a nonpolitical organization and does not support individual political causes the protests against starbucks derived from the winkler letter were not the first earlier protests occurred in june  in cairo dubai and beirut universities in response to schultzs criticism of yasser arafat starbucks has been a regular target of activists protesting against israels role in the gaza war over the claims organizations have urged a boycott of starbucks accusing starbucks of serving as an ally of israeli militarists starbucks was forced to close a store in beirut lebanon due to demonstrators shouting antiisrael slogans and causing customers to flee demonstrators hung several banners on the shops window and used white tape to paste a star of david over the greenandwhite starbucks sign they also distributed a letter saying schultz is one of the pillars of the american jewish lobby and the owner of the starbucks which they said donates money to the israeli military on january  two starbucks stores in london were the target of vandalism by propalestinian demonstrators who broke windows and reportedly ripped out fittings and equipment after clashes with riot police the way i see it quotes by artists writers scientists and others have appeared on starbucks cups since  in a campaign called the way i see it some of the quotes have caused controversy including one by writer armistead maupin and another by jonathan wells that linked darwinism to eugenics abortion and racism disclaimers were added to the cups noting that these views were not necessarily those of starbucks us military viral email a us marines sergeant emailed ten of his friends in august  having wrongly been told that starbucks had stopped supplying the military with coffee donations because the company did not support the iraq war the email became viral being sent to tens of millions of people starbucks and the originator sent out a correction but starbucks vp of global communications valerie oneil said in september  that the email was still being forwarded to her every few weeks gun controversy as gun laws in many us states have become more relaxed and more states have adopted open carry or concealed carry statutes some gun owners have begun carrying guns while performing everyday shopping or other tasks many stores and companies have responded by banning the carrying of guns on their premises as allowed by many states local laws starbucks has not instituted a policy banning guns in their stores in  the brady campaign proposed a boycott of starbucks due to their gun policy at that time starbucks released a statement saying we comply with local laws and statutes in all the communities we serve that means we abide by the laws that permit open carry in  us states where these laws dont exist openly carrying weapons in our stores is prohibited the political policy and legal debates around these issues belong in the legislatures and courts not in our stores in  the national gun victims action council published an open letter to starbucks asking them to revise their policy and also proposed a brew not bullets boycott of the chain until the policy is changed with valentines day selected as a particular day to boycott the chain in response gun rights advocates started a counter starbucks appreciation day buycott to support starbucks stance and suggested paying for products using twodollar bills as a sign of second amendment support on july   moms demand action for gun sense in america initiated a petition demanding a ban on guns in starbucks stores on september   founder and ceo howard schultz asked customers to no longer bring guns into its stores he made the comments in an open letter on the companys website schultz said he was not banning guns but making a request samesex marriage in january  a starbucks executive stated that the company supports the legalization of samesex marriage this resulted in a boycott by the national organization for marriage a political organization that opposes samesex marriage who received  signatures in favor of their boycott in response ceo howard schultz had this to say if you feel respectfully that you can get a higher return than the  percent you got last year its a free country you can sell your shares of starbucks and buy shares in another company thank you very much in addition  people also signed a petition thanking starbucks for its support as of june   samesex marriage in the united states is legal in all states following the supreme court ruling in obergefell v hodges european tax avoidance in october  starbucks faced criticism after a reuters investigation found that the company reportedly paid only £ million in corporation tax in the uk over  years despite generating over £ billion in sales—this included no tax payments on £ billion of sales in the three years prior to  it is alleged that starbucks was able to do this by charging high licensing fees to the uk branch of the business allowing them to declare a £ million loss in  the uk subsidiary pays patent fees to the us subsidiary purchases coffee beans from the netherlands subsidiary where corporation tax is lower than in the uk and uses the swiss subsidiary for other miscellaneous services a yougov survey suggested that starbucks brand image was substantially weakened by the controversy surrounding how much tax it pays in the uk several weeks after the allegations surfaced starbucks chief financial officer cfo appeared before the public accounts committee in november  and admitted that the dutch government granted a special tax rate to their european headquarters which the uk business pays royalties to dutch law permits companies to transfer royalties collected from other countries to tax havens without incurring taxes unlike in the rest of the eu the cfo denied that they chose the netherlands as their european headquarters to avoid tax explaining that the companys dutch coffee roasting plant was the reason for the decision until  the royalty rate was  of uk sales but after being challenged by uk tax authorities it was reduced to  the cfo told the committee this reflected costs such as designing new stores and products but admitted that there was no detailed analysis by which the rate is decided the coffee they serve in the uk is purchased from the swiss subsidiary which charges a  markup on the wholesale price and pays  corporation tax on profits coffee is not transported to switzerland but the  people who work in the subsidiary assess coffee quality regarding starbucks frequent reports of loss in the uk the cfo told the committee that starbucks are not at all pleased about their financial performance in the uk mps replied that it just doesnt ring true that the business made a loss pointing out that the head of the business had been promoted to a new post in the us and they consistently told shareholders that the business was profitable in ireland starbucks subsidiary ritea only paid € in tax between  and  and the subsidiary recorded losses in every year other than  ritea is owned by netherlandsbased starbucks coffee emea their french and german subsidiaries make large losses because they are heavily in debt to the dutch subsidiary which charges them higher interest rates than the group pays to borrow reuters calculated that without paying interest on the loans and royalty fees the french and german subsidiaries would have paid € million in tax the dutch subsidiary that royalties are paid to made a € profit in  from revenues of € million while the company that roasts coffee made a profit of € million in  and paid tax of € protesters who were unimpressed by the companys offer to pay £ million in tax over the next two years staged demonstrations in december  in affiliation with uk uncut in june  the european commission antitrust regulator launched an investigation of the companys tax practices in the netherlands as part of a wider probe of multinational companies tax arrangements in various european countries the investigation ended in october  with the ec ordering starbucks to pay up to € million in overdue taxes which the ec regards as illegal state support for corporations a pair of economists from the ku leuven noted that the commission did not forbid starbucks tax construction as such pretending that starbucks is a dutch company and effectively rewarding the dutch state for its lenient tax policy chinese pricing in october  china central television accused chinese starbucks of overpricing the report compared the price of a tall  fl oz  ml latte in beijing chicago london and mumbai it was found that beijing stores charged the most while mumbai stores charged the least it was also found that a tall latte cost  chinese yuan approx usd  to make but it sold at  yuan approx usd  racetogether marketing campaign on monday march   starbucks launched a marketing campaign to promote conversations about race between customers and employees this marketing campaign also called for baristas to draw the race together hashtag on customers cups  similar to how starbucks is already known for drawing customers names on each cup it was characterised as a fiasco by some media outlets to the extent that starbucks vice president of public relations deleted his twitter account on march  starbucks ceo advised his employees there is no longer a need to write racetogether on cups reuters reported that starbucks said the phase of the campaign that involved messages on drink cups was always scheduled to end sunday supporting refugees on january   president donald trump

recognized as refugees by the united nations and we are developing plans to hire  of them over five years in the  countries around the world where starbucks does business and we will start this effort here in the us by making the initial focus of our hiring efforts on those individuals who have served with us troops as interpreters and support personnel in the various countries where our military

used to fund clean water projects in underdeveloped areas although sales of ethos water have raised over us for clean water efforts the brand is not incorporated as a charity critics have argued that the claim on the label misleads consumers into thinking that ethos is primarily a charitable organization when it is actually a forprofit brand and the vast majority of the sale price  does not support cleanwater projects the founders of ethos have stated that the brand is intended to raise awareness of thirdworld clean water issues and provide socially responsible consumers with an opportunity to support the cause by choosing ethos over other brands starbucks has since redesigned the american version of the ethos water bottles stating the amount of money donated per bottle in

main article christmas controversy § s in november  starbucks introduced solid red seasonal cups unlike previous seasonal iterations that were decorated with winter or christmasoriented imagery such as reindeer and ornaments but no overtly religious symbols the cup design was discussed extensively on social media with some citing the cup as another example of the war on christmas calling it cupgate and others expressed puzzlement over the outrage generated by a simple cup the red cups were discussed so much that a man named joshua feuerstien posted all over social media telling people to have the baristas write merry christmas on the cups as their name so that way baristas had to call off the drinks saying merry christmas this also started the trend merrychristmasstarbucks opening without planning permission starbucks has been accused by local authorities of opening several stores in the uk in retail premises without the planning permission for a change of use to a restaurant starbucks has argued that under current planning law there is no official classification of coffee shops starbucks therefore encounters the difficult scenario whereby local authorities interpret the guidance in different ways in some instances coffee shops operate under a permission some as mixed use aa and some as a in may  a branch of starbucks was completed on st jamess street in kemptown brighton england despite having been refused permission by the local planning authority brighton and hove city council who claimed there were too many coffee shops already present on the street starbucks appealed the decision by claiming it was a retail store selling bags of coffee mugs and sandwiches gaining a sixmonth extension but the council ordered starbucks to remove all tables and chairs from the premises to comply with planning regulations for a retail shop  residents signed a petition against the store but after a public inquiry in june  a government inspector gave permission for the store to remain a starbucks in hertford won its appeal in april  after being open for over a year without planning permission two stores in edinburgh one in manchester one in cardiff one in

large chains opening in what is a conservation area to this date the starbucks is still operating as a takeaway outlet israel a store on piccadilly with its windows boarded up after being smashed by protesters a damaged front window of a starbucks coffee shop in toronto there have been calls for boycott of starbucks stores and products because it has been wrongly claimed that starbucks sends part of its profits to the israeli military but such allegations are based on a hoax letter attributed to the president chairman and ceo of starbucks howard schultz who is jewish and supports israels right to exist he is a recipient of several israeli awards including the israel th anniversary tribute award for playing a key role in promoting a close alliance between the united states and israel the hoax letter claiming that schultz had donated money to the israeli military was actually written by an australian weblogger andrew winkler who has admitted fabricating the document starbucks responded to these claims widely circulated on the internet stating that neither chairman howard schultz nor starbucks fund support the israeli army starbucks is a nonpolitical organization and does not support individual political causes the protests against starbucks derived from the winkler letter were not the first earlier protests occurred in june  in cairo dubai and beirut universities in response to schultzs criticism of yasser arafat starbucks has been a regular target of activists protesting against israels role in the gaza war over the claims organizations have urged a boycott of starbucks accusing starbucks of serving as an ally of israeli militarists starbucks was forced to close a store in beirut lebanon due to demonstrators shouting antiisrael slogans and causing customers to flee demonstrators hung several banners on the shops window and used white tape to paste a star of david over the greenandwhite starbucks sign they also distributed a letter saying schultz is one of the pillars of the american jewish lobby and the owner of the starbucks which they said donates money to the israeli military on january  two starbucks stores in london were the target of vandalism by propalestinian demonstrators who broke windows and reportedly ripped out fittings and equipment after clashes with riot police the way i see it quotes by artists writers scientists and others have appeared on starbucks cups since  in a campaign called the way i see it some of the quotes have caused controversy including one by writer armistead maupin and another by jonathan wells that linked darwinism to eugenics abortion and racism disclaimers were added to the cups noting that these views were not necessarily those of starbucks us military viral email a us marines sergeant emailed ten of his friends in august  having wrongly been told that starbucks had stopped supplying the military with coffee donations because the company did not support the iraq war the email became viral being sent to tens of millions of people starbucks and the originator sent out a correction but starbucks vp of global communications valerie oneil said in september  that the email was still being forwarded to her every few weeks gun controversy as gun laws in many us states have become more relaxed and more states have adopted open carry or concealed carry statutes some gun owners have begun carrying guns while performing everyday shopping or other tasks many stores and companies have responded by banning the carrying of guns on their premises as allowed by many states local laws starbucks has not instituted a policy banning guns in their stores in  the brady campaign proposed a boycott of starbucks due to their gun policy at that time starbucks released a statement saying we comply with local laws and statutes in all the communities we serve that means we abide by the laws that permit open carry in  us states where these laws dont exist openly carrying weapons in our stores is prohibited the political policy and legal debates around these issues belong in the legislatures and courts not in our stores in  the national gun victims action council published an open letter to starbucks asking them to revise their policy and also proposed a brew not bullets boycott of the chain until the policy is changed with valentines day selected as a particular day to boycott the chain in response gun rights advocates started a counter starbucks appreciation day buycott to support starbucks stance and suggested paying for products using twodollar bills as a sign of second amendment support on july   moms demand action for gun sense in america initiated a petition demanding a ban on guns in starbucks stores on september   founder and ceo howard schultz asked customers to no longer bring guns into its stores he made the comments in an open letter on the companys website schultz said he was not banning guns but making a request samesex marriage in january  a starbucks executive stated that the company supports the legalization of samesex marriage this resulted in a boycott by the national organization for marriage a political organization that opposes samesex marriage who received  signatures in favor of their boycott in response ceo howard schultz had this to say if you feel respectfully that you can get a higher return than the  percent you got last year its a free country you can sell your shares of starbucks and buy shares in another company thank you very much in addition  people also signed a petition thanking starbucks for its support as of june   samesex marriage in the united states is legal in all states following the supreme court ruling in obergefell v hodges european tax avoidance in october  starbucks faced criticism after a reuters investigation found that the company reportedly paid only £ million in corporation tax in the uk over  years despite generating over £ billion in sales—this included no tax payments on £ billion of sales in the three years prior to  it is alleged that starbucks was able to do this by charging high licensing fees to the uk branch of the business allowing them to declare a £ million loss in  the uk subsidiary pays patent fees to the us subsidiary purchases coffee beans from the netherlands subsidiary where corporation tax is lower than in the uk and uses the swiss subsidiary for other miscellaneous services a yougov survey suggested that starbucks brand image was substantially weakened by the controversy surrounding how much tax it pays in the uk several weeks after the allegations surfaced starbucks chief financial officer cfo appeared before the public accounts committee in november  and admitted that the dutch government granted a special tax rate to their european headquarters which the uk business pays royalties to dutch law permits companies to transfer royalties collected from other countries to tax havens without incurring taxes unlike in the rest of the eu the cfo denied that they chose the netherlands as their european headquarters to avoid tax explaining that the companys dutch coffee roasting plant was the reason for the decision until  the royalty rate was  of uk sales but after being challenged by uk tax authorities it was reduced to  the cfo told the committee this reflected costs such as designing new stores and products but admitted that there was no detailed analysis by which the rate is decided the coffee they serve in the uk is purchased from the swiss subsidiary which charges a  markup on the wholesale price and pays  corporation tax on profits coffee is not transported to switzerland but the  people who work in the subsidiary assess coffee quality regarding starbucks frequent reports of loss in the uk the cfo told the committee that starbucks are not at all pleased about their financial performance in the uk mps replied that it just doesnt ring true that the business made a loss pointing out that the head of the business had been promoted to a new post in the us and they consistently told shareholders that the business was profitable in ireland starbucks subsidiary ritea only paid € in tax between  and  and the subsidiary recorded losses in every year other than  ritea is owned by netherlandsbased starbucks coffee emea their french and german subsidiaries make large losses because they are heavily in debt to the dutch subsidiary which charges them higher interest rates than the group pays to borrow reuters calculated that without paying interest on the loans and royalty fees the french and german subsidiaries would have paid € million in tax the dutch subsidiary that royalties are paid to made a € profit in  from revenues of € million while the company that roasts coffee made a profit of € million in  and paid tax of € protesters who were unimpressed by the companys offer to pay £ million in tax over the next two years staged demonstrations in december  in affiliation with uk uncut in june  the european commission antitrust regulator launched an investigation of the companys tax practices in the netherlands as part of a wider probe of multinational companies tax arrangements in various european countries the investigation ended in october  with the ec ordering starbucks to pay up to € million in overdue taxes which the ec regards as illegal state support for corporations a pair of economists from the ku leuven noted that the commission did not forbid starbucks tax construction as such pretending that starbucks is a dutch company and effectively rewarding the dutch state for its lenient tax policy chinese pricing in october  china central television accused chinese starbucks of overpricing the report compared the price of a tall  fl oz  ml latte in beijing chicago london and mumbai it was found that beijing stores charged the most while mumbai stores charged the least it was also found that a tall latte cost  chinese yuan approx usd  to make but it sold at

support cleanwater projects the founders of ethos have stated that the brand is intended to raise awareness of thirdworld clean water issues and provide socially responsible consumers with an

as reindeer and ornaments but no overtly religious symbols the cup design was discussed extensively on social media with some citing the cup as another example of the war on christmas calling it cupgate and others expressed puzzlement over the outrage generated by a simple cup the red cups were discussed so much that a man named joshua feuerstien posted all over social media telling people to have the baristas write merry christmas on the cups as their name so that way baristas had to call off the drinks saying merry christmas this also started the trend merrychristmasstarbucks opening without planning permission starbucks has been accused by local authorities of opening several stores in the uk in retail premises without the planning permission for a change of use to a restaurant starbucks has argued that under current planning law there is no official classification of coffee shops starbucks therefore encounters the difficult scenario whereby local authorities interpret the guidance in different ways in some instances coffee shops operate under a permission some as mixed use aa and some as a in may  a branch of starbucks was completed on st jamess street in kemptown brighton england despite having been refused permission by the local planning authority brighton and hove city council who claimed there were too many coffee shops already present on the street

protesters a damaged front window of a starbucks coffee shop in toronto there have been calls for boycott of starbucks stores and products because it has been wrongly claimed that starbucks sends part of its profits to the israeli military but such allegations are based on a hoax letter attributed to the president chairman and ceo of starbucks howard schultz who is jewish and supports israels right to exist he is a recipient of several israeli awards including the israel th anniversary tribute award for playing a key role in promoting a close alliance between the united states and israel the hoax letter claiming that schultz had donated money to the israeli military was actually written by an australian weblogger andrew winkler who has admitted fabricating the document starbucks responded to these claims widely circulated on the internet stating that neither chairman howard schultz nor starbucks fund support the israeli army starbucks is a nonpolitical organization and does not support individual political causes the protests against starbucks derived from the winkler letter were not the first earlier protests occurred in june  in cairo dubai and beirut universities in response to schultzs criticism of yasser arafat starbucks has been a regular target of activists protesting against israels role in the gaza war over the claims organizations have urged a boycott of starbucks

of his friends in august  having wrongly been told that starbucks had stopped supplying the military with coffee donations because the company did not support the iraq war the email became viral being sent to tens of millions of people starbucks and the originator sent out a correction but starbucks vp of global communications valerie oneil said in september  that the email was still being forwarded to her every few weeks gun controversy as gun laws in many us states have become more relaxed and more states have adopted open carry or concealed carry statutes some gun owners have begun carrying guns while performing everyday shopping or other tasks many stores and companies have responded by banning the carrying of guns on their premises as allowed by many states local laws starbucks has not instituted a policy banning guns in their stores in  the brady campaign proposed a boycott of starbucks due to their gun policy at that time starbucks released a statement saying we comply with local laws and statutes in all the communities we serve that means we abide by the laws that permit open carry in  us states where these laws dont exist openly carrying weapons in our stores is prohibited the political policy and legal debates around these issues belong in the legislatures and courts not in our stores in  the national gun victims action council published an open letter to starbucks asking them to revise their policy and also proposed a brew not bullets boycott of the chain until the policy is changed with valentines day selected as a particular day to boycott the chain in response gun rights advocates started a counter starbucks appreciation day buycott to support starbucks stance and suggested paying for products using twodollar bills as a sign of second amendment support on july   moms demand action for gun sense in america initiated a petition demanding a ban on guns in starbucks stores on september   founder and ceo howard schultz asked customers

starbucks executive stated that the company supports the legalization of samesex marriage this resulted in a boycott by the national organization for marriage a political organization that opposes samesex marriage who received  signatures in favor of their boycott in response ceo howard schultz had this to say if you feel respectfully that you can get a higher return than the  percent you got last year its a free country you can sell your shares of starbucks and buy shares in another company thank you very much in addition  people also signed a petition thanking starbucks for its support

allegations surfaced starbucks chief financial officer cfo appeared before the public accounts committee in november  and admitted that the dutch government granted a special tax rate to their european headquarters which the uk business pays royalties to dutch law permits companies to transfer royalties collected from other countries to tax havens without incurring taxes unlike in the rest of the eu the cfo denied that they chose the netherlands as their european headquarters to avoid tax explaining that the companys dutch coffee roasting plant was the reason for the decision until  the royalty rate was  of uk sales but after being challenged by uk tax authorities it was reduced to  the cfo told the committee this reflected costs such as designing new stores and products but admitted that there was no detailed analysis by which the rate is decided the coffee they serve in the uk is purchased from the swiss subsidiary which charges a  markup on the wholesale price and pays  corporation tax on profits coffee is not transported to switzerland but the  people who work in the subsidiary assess coffee quality regarding starbucks frequent reports of loss in the uk the cfo told the committee that starbucks are not at all pleased about their financial performance in the uk mps replied that it just doesnt ring true that the business made a loss pointing out that the head of the business had been promoted to a new post in the us and they consistently told shareholders that the business was profitable in ireland starbucks subsidiary ritea only paid € in tax between  and  and the subsidiary recorded losses in every year other than  ritea is owned by netherlandsbased starbucks coffee emea their french and german subsidiaries make large losses because they are heavily in debt to the dutch subsidiary which charges them higher interest rates than the group pays to borrow reuters calculated that without paying interest on the loans and royalty fees the french and german subsidiaries would have paid € million in tax the dutch subsidiary that royalties are paid to made a € profit in  from revenues of € million while the company that roasts coffee made a profit of € million in  and paid tax of € protesters who were unimpressed by the companys offer to pay £ million in tax over the next two years staged demonstrations in december  in affiliation with uk uncut in

various european countries the investigation ended in october  with the ec ordering starbucks to pay up to € million in overdue taxes which the ec regards as illegal state support for corporations a

protesters a damaged front window of a starbucks coffee shop in toronto there have been calls for boycott of starbucks stores and products because it has been wrongly claimed that starbucks sends part

to exist he is a recipient of several israeli awards including the israel th anniversary tribute award for playing a key role in promoting a close alliance between the united states and israel the hoax letter claiming that schultz had donated money to the israeli military was actually written by an australian weblogger andrew winkler who has admitted fabricating the document starbucks responded to these claims widely circulated on the internet stating that neither chairman howard schultz nor starbucks fund support the israeli army starbucks is a nonpolitical organization and does not support individual political causes the protests against starbucks derived from the winkler letter were not the first earlier protests occurred in june  in cairo dubai and beirut universities in response to

starbucks has not instituted a policy banning guns in their stores in  the brady campaign proposed a boycott of starbucks due to their gun policy at that time starbucks released a statement saying we comply with local laws and statutes in all the communities we serve that means we abide by the laws that permit open carry in  us states where these laws dont exist openly carrying weapons in our

israel a store on piccadilly with its windows boarded up after being smashed by protesters a damaged front window of a starbucks coffee shop in toronto there have been calls for boycott of starbucks

chairman and ceo of starbucks howard schultz who is jewish and supports israels right to exist he is a recipient of several israeli awards including the israel th anniversary tribute award for playing a key role in promoting a close alliance between the united states and israel the hoax letter claiming that schultz had donated money to the israeli military was actually written by an australian weblogger andrew winkler who has admitted fabricating the document starbucks responded to these claims widely circulated on the internet stating that neither chairman howard schultz nor starbucks fund support the israeli army starbucks is a nonpolitical organization and does not support individual political causes the protests against starbucks derived from the winkler letter were not the first earlier protests occurred in june  in cairo dubai and beirut universities in response to schultzs criticism of yasser arafat starbucks has been a regular target of activists protesting against israels

not necessarily those of starbucks us military viral email a us marines sergeant emailed ten of his friends in august  having wrongly been told that starbucks had stopped supplying the military with coffee donations because the company did not support the iraq war the email became viral being sent to tens of millions of people starbucks and the originator sent out a correction but starbucks vp of global communications valerie oneil said in september  that the email was still being forwarded to her every few weeks gun controversy as gun laws in many us states have become more relaxed and more

banning the carrying of guns on their premises as allowed by many states local laws starbucks has not instituted a policy banning guns in their stores in  the brady campaign proposed a boycott of starbucks due to their gun policy at that time starbucks released a statement saying we comply with local laws and statutes in all the communities we serve that means we abide by the laws that permit open carry in  us states where these laws dont exist openly carrying weapons in our stores is prohibited the political policy and legal debates around these issues belong in the legislatures and
