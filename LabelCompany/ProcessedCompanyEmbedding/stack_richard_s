installation accessories home » products » medium voltage products » rstack rstack this a connector has the connecting plug molded into the elbow body eliminating the need for a separate piece our premolded composite is factory tested with a greatly reduced installation force and stack heightthe result an easier more reliable and cheaper option than traditionally stacked elbowsmore reliable — the rstack interface combines two units into one eliminating the need for a connecting plug this combination design reduces the risk of complications during assembly in the field such as cross threading and each product is individually tested prior to shipmenteasier to install — total assembly force is only  lbs as opposed to the  lb force required to install a standard connecting plug also the traditional spanner and torque wrenches are no longer needed for the installation all that’s required is a single installation tool included with each kitsmaller stack height — using the rstack reduces the stack height ” for every two elbows a  reduction its reduced height makes the rstack invaluable in small cabinets and manholesless expensive — molding one part instead of two elbow and connecting plug reduces the cost plus the rstack can be installed faster and is more reliable which saves even more time and money product ratings resources kv rating kv rating operating voltage kv kv

technologyapple application development bill atkinson development tool hypercard hypercard stacks snow crystals stack storyrwanderman leave a comment in the mid 0’s i was deeply into a development tool called hypercard and made hundreds of “stacks” little applications which i both sold and gave away for those who don’t remember it or never got into it hypercard developed by then apple fellow bill atkinson was a highly addictive development tool that had a cult following it was my first experience with application development and i got hooked i made so many hypercard stacks in fact that i lost track of many of them and when hypercard eventually died and stacks were difficult to keep running on modern hardware and operating systems i moved on recently i heard from someone named sandra who had one of my old stacks a collection of scanned black and white images of snow crystals that if memory serves visually morph from one to the next as the stack flips through its cards sandra wanted permission to put the stack online and of course i was glad to give it given that i’d forgotten that i’d ever made it for those who have the means or interest to run it here it is snow crystals another one of my stacks that got a bit more recognition was the bee like thislike loading the bee march  apple process storyafter dark animation apple berkeley systems hypercard screen saver stack story the beerwanderman leave a comment a long time ago there was this amazing multimedia development tool for the macintosh called hypercard i got deeply into hypercard in the nerdiest sense and built a lot of things with it most of the things i was building were reference tools for people with learning disabilities after talking with a good friend who developed animated software using a competing product hyperstudio i decided it was time i tackled something animated with hypercard the result was a small piece of seemingly useless software called the bee i built the bee over an intensive two week period in about 0 my wife thought i was nuts and couldn’t believe i was putting so much effort into this totally useless piece of software but as i got deeper and deeper into making it work the rest of the world fell away and it was just me and the bee and hypertalk the idea was this a bee would randomly fly around in a room with a person’s face in it if the bee landed on the person’s nose it would sting them and their eyes would roll around like little marbles if the bee hit any solid wall  times it would turn upside down and gently glide to the bottom dead if the bee flew through one of the four openings in each room the little window would animate so that it looked like the room was shifting to the side to display another room with another different person this room movement would go on forever with the bee buzzing and bumping into walls making a bump noise until the bee died or the user got tired of this stupid thing and held down a key to stop it to get the bee to fly randomly and keep all he rules going and hit the wall and make sound with the right timing to make it feel realistic was tough however i was up to the challenge and pulled numerous allnighters getting this thing working i scanned funny faces and put in numerous easter eggs certain people had “wormholes” through their ears and if the bee entered one of their ears it would disappear seemingly banging around inside their head then emerge either out of their other ear or if it was a special case the window would shift and the bee would come out another person’s ear in another room this of course delighted me and the more of it i figured out the more i wanted to do after a few close friends helped me debug the bee it was ready to give away however since all of the other software my wife and i had built was being sold successfully i might add as  shareware we thought we might as well call the bee shareware too and see if anyone was crazy enough to buy it 0 later my wife wasn’t laughing at me anymore the bee was getting around and people actually liked it or liked me enough to say that they liked it after a while my wife and i got very tired of filling software orders copying and labeling disks shrink wrapping jewel cases printing invoices mailing dozens of envelopes out etc remember this was preweb and even though much of our software was up on aol our biggest orders came in via the mail so eventually we stopped filling orders sent checks back etc and later when i had a web site i put all the software we built up on it for people to download for free a few years later i heard that berkeley systems makers of the infamous after dark screen saver program first for the mac then for windows had an annual screen saver contest on a whim i decided to enter the bee thinking it might be an interesting screen saver if scaled up and colorized it was no big deal to enter sent them a disk and cover letter and promptly forgot about it amazingly a few months later i found out that i’d won first place in the contest and that a bunch of mac hardware was on its way to me plus a check for 0 plus a trophy well the only thing i have left is the trophy and i must say it’s a beauty and i feel sorry for anyone who tries to break into our house ’cause this trophy is heavy from time to time my wife looks at the trophy then at me laughs and rolls her eyes she’s wondering when the next “bee” is gonna fly the team who started and sold berkeley systems joan blades and wes boyd later started moveonorg like thislike loading confusing words february  apple process storyapple confusing words dyslexia hypercard learning disability stackrwanderman leave a comment in 0 my wife anne came home from school and asked me if there was an easy way to collect the words that her students confused so that they might refer to their own lists on their own computers i put the question back to anne if you had such a list what kinds of information about the confused words should be included and how should the information look i asked her to come up with some examples the first few of which were effect and affect and there their and they’re we decided that we needed to show each set of confusables together so that an easy comparison could be made we also thought that the list would include more confusables than just homonyms words like aggravate and irritate and good and well each set of confusables would need – the two or more confused words – definitions of each of the confused words – multiple examples of usage in sentences of the confused words anne started collecting words writing definitions coming up with examples and stored her collection in a text file until i could come up with another way my job was to think about how the information could be most accessible to writers using conventional word processing software like ms word or appleworks clarisworks back then a few things to consider in looking at the history of this project – we were and still are macintosh users and the schools we were both working with were using macs as well – i had little experience with databases although filemaker and others were out at the time – i had a lot of experience with hypercard the first userfriendly multimedia development tool and even though its products only ran on the macintosh cross platform development wasn’t a concern since the audience we were building this for was mainly mac users who could run hypercard programs – there was no web at the time and the idea of putting information like this online and having people use an online tool was unheard of except in the mainframe computer world so i built a hypercard “stack” that included – a field to hold the confused words – a field to hold the definitions – a field to hold examples of usage in time anne and i finished the stack and sold it as shareware for many years it did well and thousands of people bought and hopefully used it hopefully is correct if our users were hopeful about becoming less confused here’s a screen shot of an entry many things have changed in the computer world since anne and i first started thinking about this – the macintosh has been marginalized in schools – the hypercard project died at apple – we have mixed feelings about making and buying shrinkwrapped reference software because it’s out of date almost immediately – the web has evolved into an important part of using a computer as a tool – we know how to build web sites so we put confusing words on the web where it existed for many years the code and site became out of date over time and we lost interest and so we took it down and let the domain go it was a great run and we learned a lot both in building the hypercard stack and in building the web site like

tap plugs connecting plugs and bushing extenders these components can be difficult to install and expensive additionally having fewer required line items simplifies procurement and onsite material handling the rstack arrester has a male deadbreak interface molded into the elbow itself as a result of this integral design the overall stack height of an rstack arrester installed on a deadbreak elbow is significantly shorter than other configurations on the market having fewer componentsinterfaces reduces the chance of improper installation—for example crossthreading or contamination
