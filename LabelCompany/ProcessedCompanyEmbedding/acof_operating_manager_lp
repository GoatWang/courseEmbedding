managers are under the common control of ares management llc  ii relief requested a    coinvestment transactions               mechanics of coinvestment transactions         the board believes that arccs investment adviser acm is able to leverage the current investment platform resources and existing relationships of ares management and its affiliated companies collectively  ares  to provide arcc with attractive investment opportunities due to the size of the ares platform and the sheer number of investment opportunities presented to it acm could never be certain that it has been offered the opportunity to review every potential coinvestment transaction merely considered by an affiliated fund however acm and each investment manager to a downstream managed fund acm and each investment manager each an  adviser  will be notified of all potential coinvestment transactions across the ares platform that have been formally presented in writing to the investment committees of an affiliated fund that fit within the objectives and strategies  of the arcc fund that the adviser manages         when an adviser is notified of a potential coinvestment transaction in the manner described above the adviser will independently analyze and evaluate the investment opportunity as to its appropriateness for the arcc fund in the case of arcc after acm considers arccs investment objective and strategies available funds market conditions regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors particular to arcc including applicable investment restrictions and the amount arcc can invest in such investment if it determines that the opportunity is appropriate for arcc and an affiliated fund has also confirmed its desire to participate acm will forward the opportunity to the board for consideration                   objectives and strategies  means solely for the purposes of this order i in the case of arcc arccs investment objectives and strategies as defined by the board including a required majority of the board from time to time using objective criteria and ii in the case of a downstream managed fund such downstream managed funds objectives and strategies as defined by such downstream managed funds investment adviser from time to time using objective criteria             for purposes of this application approval by the board will be effected by the unanimous approval of a coinvestment approval committee which will consist of a required majority as defined in section o a  required majority  of the directors eligible to vote on the coinvestment transaction under section o the  eligible directors  ie the coinvestment approval committee is a committee comprised solely of arccs independent directors representing i a majority of the independent directors of arcc and ii a majority of members of the board who have no financial interest in such coinvestment transaction          with respect to downstream managed funds their respective investment managers will independently analyze and evaluate each investment opportunity referred to them by an affiliated fund in connection with a coinvestment transaction between an affiliated fund on the one hand and a downstream managed fund on the other hand the constituent documents for each of the downstream managed funds require some form of independent approval of the transaction thus each downstream managed fund has a transaction committee or an advisory committee with at least one member who is not affiliated with any arcc fund or affiliated fund or who is an individual otherwise unaffiliated with the downstream managed fund or ares generally engaged by the downstream managed fund solely for the purpose of providing an independent role an  independent party  to approve or reject transactions with affiliated entities all coinvestment transactions between a downstream managed fund and an affiliated fund must be approved by the downstream managed funds independent party for example a coinvestment transaction between ivy hill i on the one hand and an affiliated fund on the other hand would require the approval of ivy hill is independent party ie the transaction committee of ivy hill is board of directors which includes the independent members of that board thus in such coinvestment transaction if the applicable adviser determines that the opportunity is appropriate for the downstream managed fund and an affiliated fund has confirmed its desire to also participate the investment manager will forward the opportunity to the downstream managed funds independent party for consideration         determinations regarding when an arcc fund or an affiliated fund will invest in a particular potential coinvestment transaction are made solely by the specific funds adviser or investment committee thereof and then submitted for approval by the board or an independent party as applicable in accordance with the conditions in this application while the members of the various investment committees for the affiliated funds and the arcc funds may overlap in part no investment committee of a fund makes investment decisions for another fund         all other subsequent activity ie exits from or additional investments in a portfolio company consisting of a debt or equity investment or warrants or the exercise of conversion privileges or other similar rights to acquire additional securities of the issuer any such additional investment a  followon investment  in respect of an investment acquired in a coinvestment transaction will be made in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this application in particular the board or independent party as applicable of each arcc fund that relies on the order will either preapprove that arcc funds use of pro rata dispositions and followon investments as a procedure in which case such disposition or followon investment does not need to be submitted to the arcc funds eligible directors or independent party as applicable or if the board or independent party as applicable does not so preapprove the use of pro rata dispositions and followon investments as a procedure then all dispositions and followon investments including prorata dispositions and followon investments will be submitted to the arcc funds eligible directors or independent party as applicable for approval the board or independent party as applicable of any arcc fund may at any time rescind suspend or qualify its approval of pro rata dispositions and followon investments with the result that all dispositions andor followon investments must be submitted to the eligible directors or independent party as applicable               reasons for coinvestment transactions         arcc the downstream managed funds ares csf ii ares csf iii and ares mezzanine partners lp are currently the only investment vehicles sponsored by ares management or acm that focus primarily on investments in illiquid first and second lien senior loans and mezzanine debt in us private companies acms services to arcc under the investment advisory agreement are not exclusive and accordingly it and its affiliates may consistent with its applicable fiduciary duties furnish similar services to other entities including entities with investment objectives similar to arccs investment objective          though the primary investment focus of the arcc funds is currently different from that of the affiliated funds other than ares csf ii and ares csf iii which primarily make secondary purchases of senior and mezzanine debt of middle market companies ares mezzanine partners lp which primarily makes investments in mezzanine debt and equity of middle market companies and ace which primarily originates loans to nonus companies there nonetheless may be investment opportunities appropriate for and that meet the investment objectives of both an arcc fund and one or more of the affiliated funds for example while the existing affiliated funds other than ares csf ii ares csf iii ares mezzanine partners lp and ace that acquire debt primarily acquire syndicated or liquid debt they may on occasion acquire illiquid debt in private companies the ability to coinvest with affiliated funds would give arcc more opportunities to provide capital to middle market companies which arcc believes currently have limited access to capital from traditional lending sources depending on prevailing market conditions it would also result in increased income to arcc a wider universe of investment opportunities and a greater ability to structure deal terms that are favorable to arcc all of these benefits would in turn enhance value for arccs shareholders         indeed arccs inability to coinvest with the existing affiliated funds has in the past and absent the issuance of the requested order will continue to in the future result in the loss of beneficial investment opportunities for arcc and in turn adversely affect arccs shareholders for example the amount of arccs available capital diversification requirements imposed by the internal revenue code of  as amended and other factors may preclude arcc from providing to a borrower the entire amount of financing being sought by such borrower while the investment opportunity may be one in which it is appropriate for one or more affiliated funds to participate in which case such affiliated funds could fill the gap in arccs financing capabilities absent the issuance of the requested order such participation would not be an option and arcc would as a result lose the investment opportunity         current credit market conditions have led to a decline in the availability of capital thereby creating more opportunities for arcc to make investments consistent with its investment objective and allowing arcc to focus on transactions where its competitive advantages are strongest the ability to commit larger amounts of financing to portfolio companies in a coinvestment transaction would give arcc greater flexibility to make larger financing commitments which would among other things increase income to arcc in addition increasing the opportunities available to arcc with a coinvestment structure would generate greater deal flow broaden the market relationships of arcc and allow arcc to be more selective in choosing its investments so that arcc can pursue the most attractive riskadjusted investments and optimize its portfolio enhanced selectivity and more favorable deal terms pricing and structure would also likely lead to closer relationships between portfolio companies and arcc all of these benefits would in turn enhance value for arccs shareholders         in addition to deal flow the ares investment platform assists acm in analyzing structuring and monitoring investments ares senior principals have worked together for over  years and have an average of over  years experience investing in senior loans high yield bonds mezzanine debt and private equity securities arcc has access to the ares staff of more than  investment professionals and to more than  administrative professionals who provide assistance in accounting legal compliance operations technology and investor relations the ability to coinvest with the affiliated funds on the terms and conditions outlined in this application would give arcc the opportunity to more effectively leverage these resources and greater flexibility to pursue attractive investments that would otherwise have been unavailable to arcc this will benefit arccs shareholders while ensuring that any such coinvestment transactions are consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the act and provide for participation by arcc not on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants         ares management and its controlled affiliates that manage the affiliated funds are exposed to a large number of investment opportunities that could potentially be appropriate for and attractive to  arcc applicants believe that if arcc were able to coinvest with the affiliated funds to the extent contemplated in this application arcc could access potentially accretive investment opportunities that would not otherwise be available to it in such cases acm would independently analyze the suitability of such potential investment visàvis arccs investment objective and the state of its investment portfolio at that time based on such analyses performed separately for each such investment proposal acm would determine which opportunities are consistent with arccs investment objective and present such opportunities for the consideration of the board in accordance with the terms of this application         in addition acm will present to the board on a quarterly basis a record of any investments in potential coinvestment transactions consummated by any affiliated funds during the preceding quarter that fell within arccs thencurrent objectives and strategies and were formally presented in writing to the investment committees of such affiliated funds that were not made available to arcc and an explanation of why the investment opportunities were not made available to arcc         arcc believes it is appropriate to have the board set the objectives and strategies related to asset class minimum return liquidity and size of investment as well as any control or management rights available to arcc in connection with this reporting requirement and in connection with the process of referring potential coinvestment transactions as discussed above investment vehicles that are not subject to any leverage restrictions like most of the affiliated funds can pursue a lower return than what arcc generally pursues given its leverage restrictions the affiliated funds may also pursue investments with more liquidity of a larger size or with less control over the portfolio company than arcc generally pursues given its investment objective and bdc status as discussed coinvestment is in the best interests of shareholders of arcc and defining specific parameters for these purposes ensures that the board will be able to focus only on those opportunities in which arcc may actually choose to invest instead of being overwhelmed by information relating to other opportunities that would not or could not otherwise be pursued by arcc such parameters may change over time as markets and arccs available capital change as well as in light of a variety of other factors and as a result arcc believes that for purposes of referrals and the reporting requirement the board should revisit such parameters from time to time depending on market conditions arccs available capital and a variety of other factors         the same rationale supporting arccs participation in coinvestment transactions also applies to participation by the downstream managed funds in coinvestment transactions although the downstream managed funds ordinarily will not have boards of directors in the traditional corporate sense or as contemplated under the act each downstream managed fund has an independent party that will perform the same type of analyses and make the same types of determinations regarding a prospective coinvestment transaction as the board would perform under the circumstances indicated above  b    joint followon transactions and joint exit transactions               mechanics as a result of the expansion of the business of ares and arcc there may be instances where an arcc fund and affiliated fund find themselves holding securities in the same portfolio company of the same or a different class but where the respective acquisitions of those securities did not occur at the same time or otherwise implicate the joint transaction proscriptions of section a in these scenarios no issue arose under section  when the original investments were made and it is possible that either or both funds may exit the investment or complete a followon investment also without implicating section a in which case relief of the type being sought in this application would not be required if however either the arcc fund or the affiliated fund wishes to exit the investment or make a followon investment in that portfolio company and section a is implicated those situations where section a was not implicated when the initial investments were made but where section a is implicated in connection with the exit from or additional acquisition of such investment are referred to as  joint exit transactions  and  joint followon transactions  respectively the procedures set forth in the conditions must be followed to ensure fairness               ensuring fairness in joint followon transactions and joint exit transactions         upon issuance of the requested order joint followon transactions and joint exit transactions may arise as described above in connection with joint followon transactions and joint exit transactions the protocols set forth in the conditions are designed to ensure the fairness of those transactions to the participating arcc funds         the conditions contribute to the fairness of joint followon transactions and joint exit transactions by eliminating the ability of the affiliated funds to participate in those transactions on a basis that is more advantageous than the participation of the arcc funds thus by requiring among other things that such transactions are completed at the same time except that the settlement date for an affiliated fund in a joint followon transaction may occur up to seven days after the settlement date for an arcc fund and viceversa for the same price and other terms or are approved by the board or the independent party of an arcc fund as applicable and as required by the conditions the opportunity for overreaching by the affiliated funds visàvis the arcc funds is eliminated               rationale for joint exit and joint followon transactions         as described above an arcc fund and an affiliated fund may find themselves holding investments in the same portfolio company of the same or a different class but where the respective acquisitions of those investments did not implicate the joint transaction proscriptions of section a and therefore the investments were not made through a coinvestment transaction as the coinvestment transaction model is not implicated in these situations a question arises as to how to ensure that an exit from or a followon investment in a portfolio company in this situation is made on terms that are fair and equitable and do not harm arccs shareholders or a downstream funds interest holders as applicable         a method for exiting and for completing followon investments in the described situation may be necessary because at times it will be in the best interests of the shareholders of arcc and the interest holders of the downstream managed funds to be able to exit from and complete followon investments in investments when an affiliated fund holds a different investment in the same issuer and the different investments were acquired under circumstances that did not implicate section a if the respective funds are not able to exit such investments or complete followon investments in respect of such investments then the respective funds may be forced to hold an investment when it is no longer viewed as potentially accretive in the case of exits or when more attractive investment opportunities are available in the case of followon investments          with respect to joint followon transactions applicants believe that the conditions set forth herein will provide appropriate protection to arccs shareholders the fact that the joint followon transaction would be effected at a time when the arcc fund and the affiliated fund already have respective positions in the portfolio company would seem to be ably addressed by the requirement that the board or the independent party of a downstream managed fund as applicable make certain findings regarding the fact that the proposed joint followon transaction is in the best interests of arccs shareholders or a downstream managed funds interest holders as applicable         with respect to joint exit transactions applicants see no basis to impose greater restrictions than those that would be imposed under the traditional coinvestment order templates there will be times when it will be in the best interests of arccs shareholders or a downstream managed funds interest holders for the arcc fund to divest of a position also held by an affiliated fund assuming as applicants do here that the arcc fund and the affiliated fund came to and have maintained their respective positions in the portfolio company separately ie section a has not been implicated in their circumstances prior to seeking the disposition in question the layering of additional conditions to a disposition would serve no shareholder protection or policy purpose stated differently the fact that the various conditions typically imposed on the acquisition side of a coinvestment program were not applicable to the disjointed acquisitions here should not impact or change the analysis those conditions have historically been imposed to ensure that investments made under circumstances which congress in section a identified as presumptively abusiveie where a bdc and an affiliate are acting jointly by investing in the same issuer in some concerted waywere the subject of a protocol designed to prevent the abuse through specific limitations and proactive board involvement as appropriate where as here no such presumptively abusive transaction has occurred as a predicate imposition of the conditions would seem to gratuitously impose a burden for a problem that does not exist as a result applicants believe that applying conditions to the exit or followon investment as applicable itself but not adding any other additional conditions appropriately protects the interests of arccs shareholders and the downstream managed funds interest holders c    applicable law               sections a and i of the act and rule d thereunder section a makes it unlawful for any person who is related to a bdc in a manner described in section b acting as principal knowingly to effect any transaction in which the bdc is a joint or a joint and several participant with that person in contravention of rules and regulations as the commission may prescribe for the purpose of limiting or preventing participation by the bdc on a basis less advantageous than that of the other participant although the commission has not adopted any rules expressly under section a section i provides that the rules under section d applicable to registered closedend investment companies eg rule d are in the interim deemed to apply to transactions subject to section a rule d as made applicable to bdcs by section i prohibits any person who is related to a bdc in a manner described in section b as modified by rule b from acting as principal from participating in or effecting any transaction in connection with any joint enterprise or other joint arrangement or profitsharing plan in which the bdc is a participant unless an application regarding the joint enterprise arrangement or profitsharing plan has been filed with the commission and has been granted by an order entered prior to the submission of the plan or any modification thereof to security holders for approval or prior to its adoption or modification if not so submitted         in passing upon applications under rule d the commission will consider whether the participation by the bdc in such joint transaction is consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the act and the extent to which such participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants                section b of the act and rule b thereunder         section b as modified by rule b specifies the persons to whom the prohibitions of section a apply these persons include the following  any director officer employee or member of an advisory board of a bdc or any person other than the bdc itself who is within the meaning of section ac an affiliated person of any such person or  any investment adviser or promoter of general partner in principal underwriter for or person directly or indirectly either controlling controlled by or under common control with a bdc except the bdc itself and any person who if it were not directly or indirectly controlled by the bdc would not be directly or indirectly under the control of a person who controls the bdc or any person who is within the meaning of section ac or d an affiliated person of such person         rule b under the act exempts certain persons otherwise related to a bdc in a manner described in section b of the act from being subject to the prohibitions of section a specifically this rule states that the provisions of section a shall not apply to any person a solely because that person is directly or indirectly controlled by a bdc or b solely because that person is directly or indirectly controlling controlled by or under common control with a person described in a of the rule or is an officer director partner copartner or employee of a person described in a of the rule         section a defines control as the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a company unless such power is solely the result of an official position with such company the statute also sets forth the interpretation that any person who owns beneficially either directly or through one or more controlled companies more than  percent of the voting securities of a company shall be presumed to control such company any person who does not so own more than  percent of the voting securities of a company shall be presumed not to control such company and a natural person shall be presumed not to be a controlled person         sections ac and d define an affiliated person of another person as c any person directly or indirectly controlling controlled by or under common control with such other person d any officer director partner copartner or employee of such other person d    need for relief         coinvestment transactions joint followon transactions and joint exit transactions would be prohibited by section a and rule d without a prior exemptive order of the commission to the extent that the affiliated funds fall within the category of persons described by section b as modified by rule b thereunder the arcc funds and each of the affiliated funds may be deemed to be affiliated persons within the meaning of section a by reason of common control because i ares management or controlled affiliates of ares management manage each of the affiliated funds ii ares management controls acm which manages arcc pursuant to the investment advisory agreement and iii currently certain of the downstream managed funds are managed by and pay advisory fees to ivy hill and now certain of the downstream managed funds are and in the future one or more of these funds may be serviced andor managed by arcc or certain of arccs controlled portfolio companies thus each of the affiliated funds could be deemed to be a person related to the arcc funds in a manner described by section b and therefore prohibited by section a and rule d from participating in coinvestment transactions joint followon transactions and joint exit transactions e    requested relief         accordingly applicants respectfully request an order of the commission subject to the terms set forth in the application pursuant to section i and rule dl to permit the arcc funds to participate in coinvestment transactions joint followon transactions and joint exit transactions with affiliated funds  f     precedents          the commission has granted coinvestment relief on numerous occasions in recent years  although allocation formulae approval procedures and presumptions may differ in detail as a result of circumstances and structures being different for each applicant applicants submit that the formulae and procedures set forth as conditions for the relief requested herein are consistent with the range of investor protection found in the cited orders we note in particular that the coinvestment protocol to be followed by the applicants here is substantially similar to the protocol followed by medley capital corporation and its affiliates for which an order was granted on march   the  medley order    to the extent the requested relief varies from the medley order the variations reflect the size and specific business structure of ares the arcc funds and the affiliated funds as well as the greater complexity of their organization in general indeed the medley platform includes two affiliated advisers of the bdcs adviser and four existing funds that are prohibited from completing joint transactions with the bdc whereas in the ares platform there are over  affiliated investment managers and over  existing affiliated funds                   medley capital corporation et al release no ic mar   order release no ic  feb   notice ngp capital
