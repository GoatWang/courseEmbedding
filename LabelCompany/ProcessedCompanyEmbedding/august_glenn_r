many of today’s aggressive drilling programs require well construction through sour formations to reach remote reservoirs this has exposed limitations of traditional steel chemistries used for bottom hole assembly bha components for many years the industry has used traditionalapi materials in environments with low concentrations of hydrogen sulfide hs and carbon dioxide co higher temperature and low stress conditions in the deeper portion of the well have allowed for these bha materials to operate adequately with few issues however the drive to drill inmore corrosive and sour environments has
