the dow jones industrial average and sp indices were up  the nasdaq composite is  higher since the beginning of the year reflecting its  technology allocation considerable media attention has been given to exchange traded funds the intended benefits for investors are diversification and lower costs however the expansion of products which compete effectively with mutual funds has made it anything but easy for investors to make sound choices in fact the wall street journal reported on june th that “the indexes have mutated from measures of the market into primitive investing algorithms with sometimes odd effects” known as multifactor exchange traded funds these securities reflect a combination of index tracking with other valuation and momentum measures especially at a time of record high stock market prices exchange traded funds may not be easily liquidated in a market downturn without having a destabilizing effect on market prices at penobscot we use exchange traded funds in response to specific investment priorities such as emerging markets for which diversification with individual securities may be difficult to achieve except on a large scale our experience and judgement is that a carefully structured portfolio of high quality dividend paying common stocks is preferable to a basket of securities which might include securities that are inconsistent with the goals and objectives of our clients we prefer knowing what securities we own to leaving that decision to others the federal reserve has raised interest rates three times since december there is consensus that we should expect additional increases in the foreseeable future despite the trend of rising interest rates the year us treasury yield has fallen to  from  last november investor sentiment reflecting stagnating economic growth and overstated concerns about inflation have driven up prices of fixed income securities for the time being consistent federal budget deficits are a worrisome longterm trend especially with the federal reserve policy to increase interest rates there will be continuing apprehension about a monetary policy advocating higher interest rates that may strengthen the dollar but could increase federal deficits with higher interest costs and adversely affect domestic economic growth a stronger dollar is a benefit to us consumers as imported goods are more favorably priced but a strong dollar also makes us exports less competitive china has tried with limited success to balance the devaluation of its currency to benefit its export economy without diminishing growth in domestic consumption the collapsing price of oil while of benefit to us consumers and businesses underlies larger global economic problems in oil producing countries complex global factors such as these along with rising interest rates worldwide random terrorist activity and partisan politics represent uncertainties for which unstable markets may be the natural outcome in the months ahead we would like to reemphasize our point of view that balanced and diversified portfolios of high quality dividendpaying securities are a sound investment strategy especially in uncertain times cash dividends provide current income additional investment capital and a meaningful component of total return dividend increases are the result of real earnings growth and companies with long records of consistent earnings and dividend growth earn higher valuations from investors over time tempered expectations for market appreciation during the remainder of  may be justified
