service we operate a vast network of collection vehicles including frontload automated sideload and rearload trucks that service customers from western new york to northern maine our fleet of over  vehicles consumes nearly  million gallons per year of diesel fuel which is expensive and produces emissions we therefore have a strong environmental and financial incentive to reduce our dependency on diesel by running a more efficient vehicle fleet our improvements over recent years have included the modernization of our fleet as well as using alternative fuels such as compressed natural gas cng and biodiesel in select markets across the company we continue to modernize our fleet by retiring older vehicles and replacing them with newer more efficient vehicles these improvements will increase our overall operating efficiency reduce our emissions and provide our operators with better tools to do their work we also run a portion of our fleet on compressed natural gas cng which has a lower carbon footprint emits less air pollution and runs more quietly than diesel today we are running  cngfueled trash and recycling vehicles from our hauling operations in burlington vt fort edward ny geneva ny and horseheads ny these fleets have enabled us to replace nearly  gallons of diesel fuel with cng in portland me our customers help fuel our trucks heres how it works several of our restaurant customers in portland set aside their used vegetable oil for recycling maine standard biofuels pays them for the oil which they collect and refine into biodiesel we then buy and blend the fuel into our tanks to replace a portion of our diesel usage our portland fleet runs on  biodiesel and saved about  gallons of regular diesel last year in addition to these measures we are conducting demonstration tests to evaluate the cutting edge new technologies of the future one such demonstration will be a hydraulic hybrid launch truck which is estimated to consume  less diesel than current  diesel technology another demonstration project will assess a fuel saving technology that manages engine power to optimize fuel efficiency and performance with fuel economy

a few customers in the rutland and killington region with a pickup truck he had bought with money saved from jobs he’d had as a kid in high school because the service was good the small enterprise grew and john casella joined his younger brother a year later to help run the business the brothers influenced not only by that unique spirit of new england frugality could also see the future – and in  built the companys first and the states first recycling facility in vermont it was an inspired vision one that anticipated the opportunities around resource renewal as well as viewing waste management as an integrated set of services – collection recycling transfer and disposal the belief in this approach and changes in public policy fueled a period of rapid growth as the company built an unparalleled waste and resource management infrastructure throughout the northeastern us in  the company undertook an initial public offering of its stock trading of casella stock began the day after one of the largest collapses in us stock market history and despite general investor jitters about the market as a whole the companys ipo became one of the most successful in industry history the company is now publicly traded on the nasdaq exchange under the symbol “cwst” since  the company has moved more aggressively to supplement traditional waste management services with its expertise in resource renewal and sustainability it has consistently led the industry in offering services and infrastructure that help communities and customers sustain – economically as well as environmentally – the planet’s limited resources today with a clear strategy to serve our customers with integrated services we continue to lead the solid waste industry with an innovative business

writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in milliseconds creator deletiontimestamp unix epoch time in milliseconds deletor subject mid predicate mid object midliteral languagecode csv
