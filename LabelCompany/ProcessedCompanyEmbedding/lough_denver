craighallum capital group operator greetings and welcome to the polarityte conference call at the future of skin regeneration conference operator instructions as a reminder this conference is being recorded i would now like to turn the conference over to your host dr ned swanson thank you you may begin ned swanson thank you operator and good afternoon everyone this presentation contains forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  and section e of the securities exchange act of  these statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of our management and are subject to risks and uncertainties actual results may differ materially from those set forth in contemplated by or underlying the forwardlooking statements based on factors described in this conference call and in our reports filed with the securities and exchange commission including our form k for the year ended october   and our most recent q we do not undertake to update or revise any forwardlooking statements except as maybe required by the company’s disclosure obligations and the filing that makes with the securities and exchange commission under federal securities laws with that i’ll turn the call over to dr denver lough polarityte’s chairman and ceo denver lough thank you ned and thank you to all of the shareholders supporters and those on this call for joining us today to discuss some very exciting material data and ultimate vision as it relates to polarityte and our regenerative medicine platform technology before i continue with items related to the press release from earlier today and a promise of our launch product skinte i would like to introduce other polarityte management members on the call with me who will all be commenting dr edward swanson our chief operating officer dr stephen milner our chief clinical officer and prior director of the johns hopkins burn center and john stetson our chief financial officer saying that the purpose of today’s call is to followup on today’s press release announcing some revolutionary data from our lead autologous homologous skinte construct for regenerative skin applications and burns wounds and scar treatment efforts in order to understand who polarityte is and what our products are really end up being about we must clarify who we are not while the field of regenerative medicine continues to evolve and advance with regard to a variety of complicated technologies we at polarityte believe that is not about a single stem cell a single gene a single growth factor a single drug or a single type of d printed polymeric scaffold none of that leads to true regeneration that’s just not how biology healing or regeneration works or has evolved to work furthermore the deployment or addition of any of those single entities or foreign materials to a living system knowingly and often unknowingly will impact and alter an almost infinite spectrum of biophysiologic pathways and interdependent systems ranging from the immune system to gene regulation to cellular metabolism and to even commensurate microorganisms that live on and within us the quantity is more numerous than our own cells i ask you to ask yourselves to name one regenerative medicine technology utilizing any of those characteristics that i listed that truly regenerates anything you see what dr milner dr swanson the other physicians who have joined polarityte including myself have realized while practicing a variety of forms of medicine is that regenerative medicine has made tremendous promises but not produced tangible products we could clinically utilize to treat patients in a fast affordable and simple manner that made it easy for medical providers to begin to practice a new novel pragmatic manner of regenerative medicine it was from this understanding that our regenerative medicine platform and our autologous homologous constructs have been developed with the same complex simplicity which our cells tissues and our bodies practice each and every day it’s not about outsmarting the millions of years of evolving biology but instead using all of those years of progressive fine turning in a congruent manner to heal and regenerate cells again ask yourself to imagine honestly how many assumptions need to be made to reliably believe that a single gene a single growth factor a single drug or scaffold can regenerate organized tissue here at polarityte we ask you to make one assumption your skin regenerates more skin saying that i hope i have given you all an idea who and what polarityte is and where we are going and who we are not the preclinical image based data released today is by no means even  of the data we have collected which will be released in due course via peer reviewed articles and other public forums these figures are meant to show and validate that our skinte technology is capable of regenerating functionallypolarized hierarchicallyorganized hairbearing skin in full thickness burns and wounds across a variety of species in this case swine the current standard preclinical model for human skin these images released detail burn and full excision of all layers of skin and subcutaneous tissues down to muscle  the common factors in burn and wound care in patients who suffer extensive and large deep wounds twentyfour hours following burn wound excision the autologous homologous skinte product was deployed on the muscle facial wound base so as to provide immediate autologous homologous wound coverage and then subsequently dressed and treated the same as typical skin grafts over a short period of time these specific time points will be included in our downstream publications the skinte construct underwent a form of full thickness regenerative healing which resulted in polarized organization of appropriate skin layers in interphases including epidermis dermis hypodermis epidermal dermal junctions hypodermal and dermal junctions as well as cutaneous appendages blood vessel formation and hair follicles which are indicated in the figures provided within our press release and on our website the regeneration of the hair follicle and associated follicular and bulge components is incredibly important here not just because of the hair shaft but because it is a key indicator of true skin regeneration in interfollicular neodermal propagation  something that has never been shown before to date these results as well as those to follow are a first for regenerative medicine and a validation of our polarityte patient tailored technology platform as it relates to skinte which we look forward to having on patients later this year at this time i would like to turn the call over to dr stephen milner polarityte’s chief clinical officer and prior professor of burn surgery and plastic and reconstructive surgery and also prior director of the johns hopkins burn center my mentor dr stephen milner stephen milner thank you denver and thank you to everyone who is able to participate in this call after practicing burn surgery and wound care and treating such patients in several different countries during the past  years something became abundantly clear these patients simply needed their own skin back to clarify despite the complex round the clock intensive care required to treat burn patients a burn surgeon is simply in a race to cover the patients with his or her own skin before complications set in the shorter the time it takes for them to be covered the better the patient outcome something which sounds so obvious has been truly elusive and we have learned time and time again that skin is one of the most complex and functional organs of the entire body as well as being the largest in  denver and i were responding to one of the largest civilian burn mass casualty situations which occurred in taiwan where  youths were injured it became apparent that the regenerative technologies that denver had developed years before possessed a threedimensional response to this plaguing problem today we find ourselves moving to the exciting developments presented from our preclinical study i am pleased to provide my view of the data in terms of what this means to a clinical burn surgeon and wound healing researcher based on a career focused entirely on trying to heal wounds in the safest softest and most complete manner to save patients and to avoid morbidity that said the available techniques havent changed since i began my career and the standard of care remains split thickness skin graft which despite achieving wound coverage often results in contracted and scarred wounds with little function over the long term the findings presented today reveal a technology that many burn surgeons have been waiting for for the past century full split thickness functional skin regeneration has always been the goal the swine model is known to be the most reliable model to predict human wound healing we have now shown that skin was completely regenerated from the living substrate that was placed within it skinte has allowed a repopulation of the full thickness wounds with scarless skin based on these results i am confident and comfortable in taking this product to the next level with human pilot studies and with that said if this translates to humans the way it has worked across all species to date as we expect it to i would be comfortable using this product on a regular basis thank you ned swanson and this is ned swanson chiming in again and thank you to dr milner and to dr denver lough for those comments and at this time would like to proceed to questionandanswer session questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question comes from elemer piros of cantor please proceed with your question elemer piros yes good afternoon gentlemen what i’d like to ask is that some of the sample slides that are available on your website from the swine study if you can describe the experiment in a little bit more detail in terms of how large are these wounds that are being treated and what is the ratio between the extra biopsy report that the healthy cells or area that you remove expand and then treat and also if you could help us understand how large this study was and how many animals have you tested or how many different wounds per animal denver lough absolutely thank you i appreciate those questions and some of the information will be released in peerreviewed articles that come out specifically related to the exact ratios and the time points that are available to such but if you consider the way that skin grafts work typically what ends up happening is people will take some of what they call the split thickness skin graft they will use a dermatome and a highvibrating razor blade that is run across areas of your body that are not burned it gets the very top layer of your skin the epidermis and the very top layer of your dermis it negates all of the important stem cell niche populations in support of cellular structures that remain in the lower dermal components that is why the donor site of a split thickness skin graft will regenerate those tissues and the split thickness skin graft will then be taken and meshed to cover and stretch across a wound bed those have been the limits with something like that and that is why split thickness skin grafts dont regenerate fullthickness skin and the donor site will reepithelialize because the cell is capable of regenerating that is left behind as it relates to the study itself that we are showing here we had conducted third degree full thickness burns in this swine model the size themselves are x square centimeters all the way down to muscular fascia following excision typical clinical treatment for a fullthickness burn so the images that you are looking at typically on the far left are the full excision of a third degree burn wound the skinte product is applied very similar to something like a paste and you can apply that following a return of the product to the patient within less than  hours moving that on to the wound itself it propagates over a short period of time very similar to the way skin grafts work and it permits the full thickness regeneration of hair follicles and all layers of the skin tissues epidermis dermis hypodermal components and the appendages that are necessary across the study itself there were over  wounds that were created on pigs themselves those again will be released in the peerreview journal but we are confident with the data now that we have now optimized and created the true skinte product both from the harvest standpoint the processing side of it and also the redeployment dressing and the wound care following what’s exciting about this is that we’re not asking people to necessarily shift from the way that they have dressed and treated wound beds but instead it is a change in technology that allows people to practice in a very similar manner but have a much better and more functional product that being said the exact numbers of the pigs and each one of the wounds will be included in these upcoming peer review articles the time points regarding the exact formation of the layers the hair follicles themselves and the complete healing of the wound will also be included in those articles elemer piros i mean the result seems spectacular how repeatable are those results just in a qualitative manner denver lough absolutely so that’s another  that’s a great question and one that’s very important to be completely honest with you kind of to go off of that question weve been asked by other groups what happens if it gets infected we didn’t know the answer to that until we had done these studies because we have been fortunate enough to not get infections but having done so many of these procedures now and deployed so much of the skinte product we learned that when one of our pigs actually did become infected the dressing had lifted up and fecal material gross fecal contamination of the wound had occurred we thought this may be the loss of the graft because from clinical experience it definitely happens the skin graft would melt and basically shear off we treated with topical betadine changed the dressing and used this as a data point and in fact it still regenerated the full thickness of skin like the other wound beds that had not become infected so with regards to reproducibility in the current comparison to clinical standards with split thickness and full thickness skin grafts it is essentially almost i mean i would consider it to be even better than a split thickness or a full thickness skin graft with regards to reproducibility because even when infected it still resulted in full thickness skin regeneration and i believe thats also because skin grafts themselves act as graphs or sheets which obviously if contamination gets underneath the graft it will delaminate this operates in a different manner and therefore allows the propagation of mpfu’s minimally polarized functional units a major component of the skinte substrate and product to essentially continue to propagate migrate proliferate and differentiate as it would in a natural wound setting even when in the presence of microbial contamination elemer piros okay i would just have maybe two followups please in the upcoming human trial what size of wounds would you start looking at do you have a protocol that you have designed already denver lough we do have a protocol and i wont give you the exact numbers but it is similar to what we are doing or what we have completed with swine elemer piros okay and lastly are there cosmetic applications beyond burn and wound care i mean that might come into play in the future denver lough absolutely thats another great question so with any form of reconstructive or regenerative forms of surgery or medicine aesthetics andor sort of the cosmetic appearance of your product and how it regenerates tissue is always of concern and what i mean by this is if you have a patient who had pancreatic cancer and had a component of that tumor reflected and they went to grocery store no one there knows that patient had it no one knows that they had a tumor resected out of their abdomen patients who have suffered from burns and wounds particularly in areas on their face hands and legs are plagued with that even today with skin grafting and so we have developed an entire division that is dedicated to the aesthetic and cosmetic component of the regenerative medicine platform itself the priority of this company is to provide patients and providers with the best full thickness regenerative technology thats out there  with the best price the best value that is easy for them to use and deploy and that they can get quickly but just below that is making sure that it aesthetically resembles the patients own tissues whether it be our skin product or our pipeline products bone muscle cartilage and other ones that are coming down the line so we will be developing products that may be considered solely a cosmetic or solely for aesthetic use but our priority will always focus on the regenerative medicine aspect in helping those patients that have severe tissue voids that will go more towards the reconstruction arena in medicine elemer piros very nice data thank you very much for taking my questions denver lough we appreciate it thank you operator our next question comes from robert obraitis of cambridge investment research please proceed with your question robert obraitis hey thanks guys for taking my question here i actually have a threeprong question its all related to the same topic what would you say the potential market looks like for the first product and then following on that kind of help us out a little bit with competitors that might be in this current space now and third would be your economics and cost of goods to get this out denver lough those are all absolutely great questions really appreciate it so with regards to the skinte product unto itself particularly this specific type of construct people would joke with us often that it regenerates hair so what is the hair restoration market like its roughly about a  billion if you start looking at just skin regeneration for burn itself it can be  and for wounds  will be roughly around  billion but when you begin to think about the skin regeneration market across all varieties of tissue voids acute surgical wounds postcancer reconstruction a variety of types and sorts of these post neoplastic head neck or extremity reconstruction efforts that have been performed the market gets up to close to  billion or  billion for elements of skinte that doesnt necessarily consider our other pipeline products like bone or cartilage which are actually larger markets which we can address at a later time but the skin products themselves have a relatively large and robust and also growing market with regards to the competitors themselves i will kind of turn it back on you the shareholders and the analysts name one other product that’s out there that is truly autologous homologous and there really isnt one there are groups that are out there like epicel  cultured epithelial autografts they’re a good company they’re a good product they also include mouse t fibroblasts they also just use the top layer of the skin they culture it for weeks before they can return it to burn patients theyre under a humanitarian device exemption where they can only treat a certain amount of patients annually those types of things set us apart its not to say that epicel isnt a good product its just that we are different and we develop full thickness skin with all of the layers including the hair follicles with regards to the economics behind the company itself ned would you like to address ned swanson i think when you start to look at the economics of skinte and the cost of goods we are able to do this quite cheaply and part of that is based upon our processing of the tissue at the manufacturing center when we start to begin to do this clinically the tissue itself has to be harvested from the patient which is going to be done in a very streamlined manner the physician is going to have a complete harvest box with all components in it to harvest for full thickness skin biopsy you can do this at the bedside in the er or in the or the tissue will come to the manufacturing facility it will be processed and turned around within one to two days back to the center as denver described previously and with all of those components said the way we process this avoids a lot of the costs seen with products like epicel that denver mentioned where we arent culturing this for three to four weeks we dont need enzymes to do this we dont need media to do this those are all the factors that make a lot of regenerative medicine products extremely extremely expensive in the thousands of dollars range to produce based on all of those components required so needless to say we can do this quite cheaply and quite efficiently for each one of these products produced and the market denver described is based on a lot of market research that we’ve done before we became involved in this we have done our own market analysis on all of these specific arenas we have done the most analysis in the burn market and the ability of us to deliver those products so cheaply allows us to essentially provide a much greater value with the product were delivering while at the same time potentially coming in at a lower cost which throughout all industries is a large leap in technology to be able to do that so i dont want to get into all of these specific numbers but theyre favorable on both ends for the way we create the skinte robert obraitis okay well thank you very much for elaborating on that thats actually very exciting to hear the cost of goods in the economics and obviously the potential market is just  its mindboggling to be quite candid with you and quick question here i believe the unfortunate circumstance youre talking about in taiwan was the western digital plant correct denver lough it was actually the formosa water park what ended up happening in that unfortunate event at least  people were burned it was a water park event where there was a band and concert that it was playing and they sprayed cornstarch into the air and unfortunately due to elements of pyrotechnics and a spark ignited an enormous fireball which burned people extensively including third degree burns and so a country like taiwan which has abundant medical resources which has the finances and the medical training to respond to something like this was overwhelmed and that by itself began to show us that even when you have these types of resources available as dr milner pointed out theres still one fundamental void or one fundamental issue that is staring you in the face and that is the lack of the patient’s own skin to get back people can give allograft category skin but its temporary you can give xenograft skin pig skin again temporary you can give these highpriced products or dressings again temporary all of it essentially temporary eventually you need to get some form of the patients own skin back on them i am not nearly as much of an expert as dr milner is with his years and years of clinical expertise for burns so i’ll turn it over to him if theres additional things hed like to add robert obraitis i apologize i  well the whole  while that event was tragic obviously it immediately and were headquartered right here in washington dc in northern virginia it immediately made me think of the interest from government organizations and military applications and i know i may be asking a very pinpointed question here but the government grants the strategic partnerships that could come from this type of technology and i will just ask it have you guys been approached or are there any discussions with anybody about taking this to a level again for government or military denver lough yes great question i cant go into specifics on that but yes we have been approached yes we have spoken with government agencies about grants and contracts saying that that is definitely a realm that we are very interested in continuing to work with and pursue a variety of integrative forms of technology i would also point you to one of our board of director members john mogford his involvement with darpa should also give some key understanding that our goal has always been to serve a civilian population but at the same exact time serve our military and our government so yes we are in discussions with groups regarding exactly what you have suggested robert obraitis all right well thank you guys very much ill let somebody else hop in the queue i actually have some additional questions if they are not answered ill pop back in but thank you very much denver lough alright thank you operator our next question comes from matt hewitt of craighallum capital group please proceed with your question matt hewitt good afternoon thank you for taking the questions denver lough thank you matt hewitt i was curious once youre ready for commercialization if you can kind of walk through the distribution model and how you foresee maybe initially will you be using independent distributors or are your plans to go direct right out of the gates and if so how do you envision that sales force ramp over the first few years postlaunch ned swanson yes this is ned swanson thank you for that question and its one that comes up frequently and weve designed a very strategic rollout of this product and the first thing that had been mentioned briefly by elemer piros from cantor was the pilot study in human burn patients which were hoping to initiate within this year and following that trial we will hopefully be entering the market within the firsthalf of next year and thats when the commercialization plan that youre discussing will come into play and were out of the gate going towards the burn market and within the united states there are  burn centers and they are typically run by the burn center directors and with all of our network coming from that world especially with dr milner we are planning to target some of the higher volume very wellrespected burn centers when we go to market and were going to do it in a staged and controlled fashion starting with the first and once we have the manufacturing handling the volume of the first center adding the second a month or two later depending on the ideal time and doing it in that fashion over the course of the first year in the market targeting anywhere from  to  burn centers in the first year and within that year planning our scale up of commercialization as we go into the second year where if everything is going smoothly as planned going a little bit more aggressively nationwide to all the burn centers and that is sort of a twoyear roll out plan and in terms of the sales force question that also comes up frequently we do have advantages in the burn market with our own networks already for using communication for the decision makers in this market which is a concentrated market and they are often connected to large wound centers and all of the other plastic and reconstructive surgeons that weve worked with for years who also treat a variety of the other wounds beyond burn to begin that initial ramp up in a slow stagemanner and then the nationwide roll out staggered behind those in the burn market going to market with our network as youve heard and we are not actively pursuing a massive sales force for the skinte market roll out with the burn and wound care markets matt hewitt okay great thank you ned swanson we will certainly have the strategic plan in place to do so matt hewitt okay and then i would assume after youve rolled out skinte and you start looking at some of the followon offerings bone and whatnot do you envision having separate sales forces of those or would you just utilize the same sales force and just broaden their reach into some of the other hospitals and whatnot ned swanson those are great questions and youre almost backing us into a corner where we have to give a little bit more away im going to answer with this there are a variety of good biotech companies that are out there right now i’ll give an example of one they have a peripheral nerve cadaveric graft system that allows peripheral nerves to propagate in order to be part of renovate aspects of extremities and such that product while it is good and they have brought in good revenue they have spent a tremendous amount on building up a sales force being physicians and having practiced with other physicians i can tell you that there is some limit to the knowledge base of the sales reps and their ability to really conduct sort of a peertopeer evaluation of whether or not the product should be used or not saying that polarityte has strategically oriented itself and dedicated a division to the development of something called realtime assistance and what i mean by that is if a burn surgeon wound surgeon or a physician it located in a certain area and already met with elements of the polarityte team and have questions about the products the immediate deploying  the immediate use of the product about wounds that the product may be used in about whether or not the product would even be right for the patient we have now begun to develop a system a realtime assisting app system that allows us to be in contact  hours a day with those individuals those providers so that if it is even  am in the morning and they have a question about whether or not for example the skinte product looks good or not or whether or not there is infection or whether or not the dressing needs to be changed that in itself would be directly communicated in a hipaacompliant realtime communication system where you could video conference facetoface with one of the polarityte physicians from either the company or the clinical advisory team  hours a day no matter what time it is who can provide you with peertopeer assistance and also allow you to perform elements of realtime analytics on the wound integrated within the system and also tracking of where your product or construct may be for a patient for example i harvested i send it to you guys at  pm last night where is it now with this particular app system you can see exactly where it is in the process when it will be arriving when it will be deployed the qc qa elements of it once you get it if you have questions about how to deploy it there will be educational material on how to do such if the provider is still confused they can click on a button and speak with someone like dr stephen milner at  am in the morning and be able to help the provider help that team out to use that product or answer questions about the progression or dressings or such it’s not that we necessarily disagree with hiring on a sales force per se but i think that physician’s and providers that are out there are really in need of having some sort of this peertopeer contact in this ability to really understand and not be alone when using our regenerative medicine product and so not only do we want to provide ultimately one of the best regenerative medicine with autologous homologous products that’s out there but we want to provide realtime assistance communication with qualified individuals who could help assess and address how to utilize our product for those specific types of patients the best that we possibly can matt hewitt that’s great and thank you very much and congratulations on your at least initial success denver lough thank you we really appreciated operator operator instructions if there are no further questions i’d like to turn the call back over to dr denver lough for closing comments denver lough thank you so much first and foremost i would like to thank the operator for hosting us and all of the shareholders that have gotten on also as well as the analysts and anyone else who is listening to the call we appreciate the opportunity to exchange all this exciting information and we welcome anyone who has more questions concerns or ideas to reach out and contact our line thank you so much for being on we look forward to doing this again thank you

with dr denver lough president and ceo of polarityteapril   by cade hildreth ceorecently i had the honor of interviewing dr denver lough chairman president ceo and cso of polarityte polarityte is an innovative company that has developed a platform to regenerate a variety of functionally polarized tissue substrates such as skin bone muscle cartilage blood vessels peripheral nerves and morein this exclusive interview we explore the origins of polarityte as a company we also explore the company’s novel technology fiveyear vision and future directions enjoyinterview with dr denver loughcade hildreth why the name polaritytedenver lough md phddr denver lough great question—it’s one we get often polarity in the biological sense describes the orientation and interface that cells and tissues have relative to each other which subsequently results in much of their intrinsic function essentially all living cells and tissues must exhibit some form of polarity to proliferate differentiate and develop hierarchical organized tissueswithout polarity a cell is basically lost and unable to remember how to function in a natural setting if one takes a look across naturally occurring forms of healing and regeneration it becomes apparent that it’s not a single cell that regenerates tissues—but rather polarized cells communicating with each other and the “te” is simply my goalcade hildreth your goal it doesn’t mean tissue engineeringdr denver lough no it doesn’t mean tissue engineering yes those two letters represent my ultimate goal for the company and the field of regenerative medicinecade hildreth you were on track for a very prestigious career as a plastic and reconstructive surgeon at johns hopkins—why did you leave to start this companydr denver lough the hopkins experience was great and i always look forward to working with everyone there again at some point the reason i left was multifactorial one and perhaps most importantly was that as a surgeon i began to see how the structure of the current medical system was quickly going to put me as well as other colleagues at “terminal velocity” very quicklywhat i mean is that a physician can only see one patient in a given time period or a surgeon can only throw one stitch every “x” seconds and at that point you only have  options either incrementally see more patients or throw more stitches in a shorter time period which often doesn’t result in improved patient care or change the paradigm by actively helping a multitude of patients during that same time periodcade hildreth what makes your company different than the other regenerative medicine and wound care companiesdr denver lough complex simplicitycade hildreth complex simplicity meaningdr denver lough meaning that if we go back and look at all of the greatest discoveries that really impacted humankind in science we see that the greatest discoveries were often the realization of reality i believe that much of the regenerative medicine and tissue engineering field has pursued exceedingly complex mechanisms and stories to manipulate or make a cell a growth factor or scaffold act like natural tissues… my question to is if we don’t really understand the exact interplay and mechanisms involved in natural regenerative wound healing then how can we expect to have a single cell single growth factordrug or single matrix based scaffold truly regenerate anythingpolarity’s approach is very different in that we approach regenerative medicine from the top down and using what we know works this approach from “known” has allowed us to apply our technology across a variety of tissue substrates to regenerate full forms of skin bone muscle cartilage solid organ tissues and peripheral nerve elements it would be naïve of us to honestly believe that the addition of singularity to a complex system would abruptly reorganize and redirect complex wounds and tissue voids toward nascent functionally organized tissues…that frankly just doesn’t workin addition to challenging the paradigm of regenerative medicine i believe that polarityte brings an entirely new type of team to the market and the field how many regenerative medicine companies have such a tremendous allstar team of integrated clinical and scientific advisors how many regenerative medicine companies really have a pragmatic platform technology that addresses all different tissue types it is this clinical “inthe trenches” type of experience that polarity prides itself on in developing truly revolutionary clinical constructs that actually worka biotech company can make an amazing “theoretical product” or one that looks great in the test tube but the second it hits a bloody surgical field or is challenged by the immune system its falls apart we at polarity have seen this over and over in medical practice and finally decided to do something about itwe knew we had something special with polarity after we kept meeting with a variety of different types of investors and kept getting offers in the end we decided to go with a route that allowed us to keep control of the company so that we could continue to pursue our vision passion and pragmatic innovative platformcade hildreth the company seems to be growing very quickly—what do you attribute that todr denver lough well with all startups there are a variety of factors affecting the trajectory of a company i honestly believe that across the spectrum of all the investors that we have spoken with they have really been excited about this new technology platform we have developed once they see our actual technical capabilities they realize there is something entirely new and novel here with polarity however after the tech gets their attention they begin to see our complete vision team and network for market penetration and growthcade hildreth what keeps you up at nighthonestly the rapid growth of the company and the other entities becoming involved with us it’s a good problem to have and we are always hungry for challengescade hildreth do you consider yourself to be the next disruptive technology in regenerative medicinedr denver lough the term “disruptive technology” seems to be an overly used buzz word describing technologies that people don’t understand but think it appears different to be honest there hasn’t really been much disruptive technology seen in translational biotechnology companies keep producing derivatives of the same old clunky technologies and products with just different names on them go ahead and ask physicians and providers what cutting edge biotech materials they use day to day or really ever…not many if any if all of these disruptive technologies we keep hearing about don’t really amount to true clinical application then are they really disruptivesaying that i don’t want the polarity technology platform to be defined as disruptive i want it to be constructive—constructive at changing the paradigm of regenerative medicine when patientsusersphysiciansproviders think of the polarity technology and its regenerative constructs i want them to reflect on how easy it was to work with our products and team as well as how cost efficient polarity has made regenerative medicine efforts i want the experience for everyone to be able to participate in the beginning of a new form of pragmatic tissue regenerationcade hildreth being just a few months old you have managed to build quite an impressive team at polarityte—how did you do itdr denver lough it is simple i look for people who are overqualified and underappreciated these types of people are essentially the race horse you see kicking in the gates and once shown a goal will explode out of the gates and run fullspeedcade hildreth how did you come up with the technologydr denver lough that’s a loaded question and being a public company with patented and proprietary materials i can’t go into too much detail but it basically came down to recognizing i couldn’t outsmart biology and that there are a ton of cues that regenerative wound healing will give you if you just look a little longer and a little deeper there are many brilliant minds out there that are going down the wrong path because someone years ago said that regenerative medicine pivoted around cells growth factors and scaffoldsmy questions are does that really make sense fundamentally and isn’t it time we expanded on those three isolated pillars now that we know about microinhibitory rna epigenetics metabolomics exosomes etc how do we account for all of these newly discovered cellular phenomena with such an out of date reductionist theorycade hildreth polarityte offers a platform technology for regenerative medicine—what does that meandr denver lough many regenerative medicine or biotech companies seem to hedge themselves on a single “disruptive” product in order to build a company initially this doesn’t create a problem for the because they can focus their entire efforts on perfecting that product however eventually another group comes around and either builds a better product or creates an entirely new technology that circumvents the need for that product this is a dangerous place to be because it is hard for a biotech company to reinvent itself from that now obsolete productwe at polarity have focused on truly developing a revolutionary new type of biotechnology and regenerative platform that is biologically sound and able to regenerate a variety of functionally polarized tissue substrates such as skin bone muscle cartilage blood vessels peripheral nerves and solid organ parenchyma this “platform” allows us to springboard off our fundamentally sound technology into a wide variety of customizable products that reach into a variety of fieldscade hildreth where do you see the company being in the next few yearsdr denver lough i believe that we have a superior technology a superior team and a superior network to get our technology readily deployable and to market quickly i also believe that the market is ready for a product and technology that works and is easy for medical providers and patients to choose i also believe that the world has not actually seen the real biotech boom yet and hope that polarity will be involved in it in some form cade hildreth how can people learn more about polarityte or get in

loughthank you ned and thank you all of the share holders supporters and those on this call for joining us today to discuss some very exciting material data and ultimate vision as it relates to polarityte and our regenerative medicine platform technology before i continue with items related to the press release from earlier today and a promise of our launch produce skinte i would like to introduce other polarityte management members on the call with me who will all be commenting dr edward swanson our chief operating officer dr stephen milner our chief clinical officer and prior director of johns hopkins burn center and john stetson our chief financial officersaying that the purpose of today’s call is to followup on today’s press release announcing some revolutionary data from our lead autologous homologous skinte construct for regenerative skin applications and burns wounds and scare treatment efforts in order to understand who polarityte is and what our products are really end up being about we must clarify who we are notwhile the field of regenerative medicine continues to evolve and advance with regard to a variety of complicated technologies we at polarityte believe that is not about a single stem cell a single gene a single growth factor a single drug or a single type of d printed polymeric scaffold none of that leads to true regeneration that’s just not how biology healing or regeneration works or has evolved to workfurthermore the deployment or addition of any of those single entities or foreign materials to a living system knowingly and often unknowingly will impact and alter and almost infinite spectrum of biophysiologic pathways and interdependent systems ranging from the immune system to gene regulation to cellular metabolism and to even commensurate microorganisms that live on and within us the quantity is more numerous than our own cellsi ask you to ask yourselves to name one regenerative medicine technology utilizing any of those characteristics that i listed that truly regenerates anything you see dr milner dr swanson the other physicians who have polarityte including myself have realized while practicing a variety of forms of medicine is that regenerative medicine has made tremendous promises but not reduced tangible products we could clinical utilize to treat patients in a fast affordable and simple manner that made it easy for medical providers to begin to practice a new novel to pragmatic manner of regenerative medicineit was from this understanding that our regenerative medicine platform and our autologous homologous constructs have been developed with a hope soon body to same complex simplicity with our cells tissues and our bodies practice each and every day it’s not about outsmarting the millions of years of evolving biology but instead using all of those years a progressive fine turning and it can grow at manner to heal and regenerate cellsagain ask yourself to imagine honesty how many assumptions need to be made to reliably believe that a single gene a single growth factor a single drug or scaffold to regenerate organized tissue here at polarityte we ask you to make one assumption your skin regenerate more skin saying that i hope i have given you all an idea who and what polarityte is and where we are going and who we are notthe preclinical image based data released today is by no means even  of the data we have collected which will be released in due course via peer reviewed articles and other public forums these figures are meant to show and validate that our skinte technology is capable of regenerating functionally polarized hierarchically organized care baring skin in full thickness burns and wounds across a variety of species in this case swine the current standard preclinical model for human skin these images released detail burn and full excision of all layers of skin in subcutaneous tissues down to muscle the common factors in burn and wound care in patients who suffer extensive and large deep wounds  hours following burn wound excision the autologous homologous skinte product was deployed on the muscle facial wound base so as to provide immediate autologous homologous wound coverage and then subsequently dressed and treated the same as typical skin graftsover a short period of time these specific time points will be included in our downstream publications the skinte construct underwent a form of full fitness regenerative healing which resulted in polarized organization of appropriate skin layers in interphases including epidermis dermis hypodermis epidermal dermal junctions hypodermal and dermal junctions as well as cutaneous appendages blood vessel formation and hair follicles which are indicated in the figures provided within our press release and on our websitethe regeneration of the hair follicle and associated follicular and nextel bulge components is incredibly important here not just because of the hair shaft but because it is a key indicator of true skin regeneration in interfollicular neodermal propagation something that has never been shown before to date these results as well as those to follow are a first for regenerative medicine and a validation of our polarityte patient tailored technology platform as it relates to skinte which we look forward to having on patients later this yearat this time i would like to turn the call over to dr stephen milner polarityte’s chief clinical officer and prior professor of burn surgery and plastic and reconstructive surgery and also prior director of the johns hopkins burn center my mentor dr stephen milnerstephen milnerthank you denver and thank you to everyone who is able to participate in this call after practicing burn surgery and wound care and treating such patients in several different countries during the past  years something became abundantly clear these patients simply needed their own skin back to clarify despite the complex round the clock intensive care required to treat burn patients a burn surgeon is simply in a race to cover the patients with his or her own skin before complications set inthe shorter the time it takes for them to be covered the better the patient outcome something which sounds so obvious has been truly elusive and we have learned time and time again the skin is one of the most complex and functional organs of the entire body as well as being the largest in  denver and i were responding to one of the largest civilian burn mass casualty situations which occurred in taiwan where  youths were injured it became apparent that the regenerative technologies which denver had developed years before possessed of a threedimensional response to this plaguing problem today we find ourselves moving to the exciting developments presented from our preclinical study i am pleased to provide my view of the data in terms of what this means to a clinical burn surgeon and wound healing researcher based on a career focused entirely on trying to heal wounds in the safest softest and most complete manner to save patients and to avoid morbiditythat said the available techniques havent changed since i began my career and the standard of care remains splits ph in the skin graft which despite achieving wound coverage often result in contracted and scarred wounds with little function over the long term the findings presented today reveal a technology that many burn surgeons have been waiting for for the past century full sick thickness functional skin regeneration has always been the goal the swine model is known to be the most reliable model to predict human wound healing we have now shown that skin was completely regenerated from the living substrate that was placed within it skinte

the beard eric d lough a a facebook twitter  more shares recommend reddit email  print article which way does your beard point tonight  in  alan ginsberg made reference to walt whitman’s beard in a supermarket in california almost sixty years later beards are still a part of popular culture and the beat generation is being revived through famous beard oil company founded by eric d lough now the man behind the beard explains why beards are here to stay and why they need a little tlc westword how did you as a beard aficionado break into the facialhair industryeric d lough well i’ve always been a beard man i’ve always taken care of my beard pretty well and i have used beard oils from other companies after being unsatisfied with beard oils i decided to start making my own i have a background in the alternativemedicine field and i know my oils really well i just started experimenting with my own and soon i was getting a lot of compliments on how it looked and felt after a while i decided i should just start making it and selling it to others what sets your company apart from the resti never wanted to be like all these other companies that sell beard products and other stuff i just wanted to make it personal i wanted to do everything myself from the marketing to the designing to the printing i have no team i do absolutely everything for the company i run famous beard oil company right out of my condo in an extra room that i turned into my office it’s filled with packing materials and bottles and oils how did you come up with the unique names of your oil scents related storieslocal whiskerinas will add hairraising fun to boulder facial hair club contest tomorrowa hairy situationreader hipsters have ruined the beardeverything i do with famous beard oil company is an offset of myself personally and i love the beat generation that’s why one of my oils is called urban kerouac blend and i have another called monk’s dream which is based off thelonious monk and my love of jazz savant fusion comes from me being a writer and published poet and overall i think i have an advantage of being able to describe my beard oils a little more personally for the beatnik beard eric d lough have people been receptive to famous beard oil company so farwell i’ve created eight beard oils that everybody seem to really love and even chuck nazty — aka charlie blackmon the colorado rockies outfielder — has shown his support for the oils he liked my company on twitter to show interest and now he’s using my oils what are the famous beard oil company’s next steps i plan on just sticking with the eight oils that people really enjoy and love using at least for a while i want to keep the company very beardoiloriented and not expand if anything in the future i might do a beard wash if i love what i can come up with and people can catch famous beard oil at a few different trade shows this summer i’ll be at man craftable in the baker district on june  and harry’s urban
