chro for kennametal inc was interviewed by lesley hoare from oracle regarding the hr strategies and processes in a large public company environment  argyle journal argyle journal linkedin facebook google plus twitter chro ‹ previous articlenext article ›× back to chro articlesjudy bacchus vp and chro for kennametal inc was interviewed by lesley hoare from oracle regarding the hr strategies and processes in a large public company environment lesley hoare  to get started will you tell us about your background including an overview of your human capital experience judy bacchus  human resource management is actually my second career following  years in retail as a merchandise buyer for a department store chain in western pennsylvania at an early age i had the opportunity to run a small pl which gave me a different lens to view the role of hr when i left retail i took the opportunity to consider what i would most like to do next in my career similar to what we suggest to our employees i participated in a workshop to consider assessments based on my interests leadership style and experience my strengths pointed to three areas politics sales or hr i took the hr route and have been in this area for about  years my career also started by running a pl in a business and once you’ve walked in those shoes it makes quite a difference please tell us a little more about your current role at kennametal my progression at kennametal has been one of those success stories that hr professionals like to share—talent management executed by design i was the planned successor for the role of chief human resources officer chro when my former boss resigned from the company after seven years he and i had about  months to prepare for my transition into the leadership role as chro we did some interesting things during that time such as working on executive compensation you don’t get exposure to that area unless you’re in the top job additionally i participated in a program sponsored by cornell that prepares candidates for the hr csuite i was able to learn from the experience of other people who were new to the leading role as i moved into that role as the planned successor the transition worked very well my transition time with my predecessor met my needs in terms of career path ensured i was well prepared to meet the needs of the organization and provided a smooth shift to the chro role will you tell us about your hr strategy and how you’re tying it into your organization’s objectives kennametal’s competitive advantage rests with our people and our proprietary technologies that advance industry on the people side technical knowhow is our specific advantage customers expect us to provide technical expertise to help keep their operations running productively in most cases this happens on the factory floor when working with our customers we bring highlyskilled technical talent and application engineers who take a holistic approach to optimize customers’ processes that may mean diagnosing aspects such as speed and feed rates in production to determine which materials and products are best suited for the conditions at hand or it may even require the design of a customized solution that can substantially improve their productivity that is what differentiates kennametal in industry in terms of strategy it’s really about the business needs which are based on what our customers are trying to accomplish we are able to offer our best when we have intimate knowledge of the customer’s operations allowing us to build programs around their technical requirements it’s not only about what we make it’s what we know whether we acquire or develop the knowhow of our technical talent is the big differentiator for us has that strategy evolved or changed since you came on board in your role yes it has all organizations try to do risk assessments our executive team set out to address aging demographics which is both a challenge and opportunity for kennametal on one hand the shortage of technical talent in our industry makes us more indispensable to our customers however we have our own aging demographics to manage we have three basic functions that are absolutely critical in terms of aging demographics sales manufacturing engineers and traditional rd engineers so we started to design programs to focus on knowledge management and workforce development in those three areas we are still early in the journey but we have the framework in place and are now working to execute that plan it takes a lot of time to transfer knowledge document appropriately train people and so on that’s an example of a strategy on which we have focused over the past  months engineering is one of those critical talents since there is so much exciting work going on in other industries does the demand exacerbate this particular challenge most students are no longer interested in things such as metallurgy or material sciences we are doing something unique to get ahead of this challenge currently in the united states there are some  open jobs in manufacturing that the industry is collectively unable to fill kennametal has started working with local high schools to engage interest at that level and help students gain an appreciation for rewarding opportunities and experiences they’ll find in our industry we began with a high school near our corporate headquarters because we felt like we could develop a partnership there we asked for the top  or so science and math students including those that scored well and those who had an interest in the areas we built a pipeline program called the young engineers we bring them in and from art to part they create something and actually market it they get handson lab experience working with our technicians designers and engineers while also learning about the business acumen that goes with these roles we’re planting a seed we realize they may not come to kennametal but we want them to be inspired to pursue sciences such as metallurgy engineering or manufacturing we started the program in western pennsylvania we’ve just completed our first pilot in ohio and we’re now looking at our additional opportunities to expand the program domestically we also would like to figure out how to develop something similar outside of the united states regarding high potentials and leaders for the future what programs do you have in place to identify and develop those high potentials similar to other companies we have a traditional performance management system including an individual talent development plan that’s the first place we would identify development needs we have a very robust succession planning process it includes levels from ceo down we go down to level five mainly because we see great opportunities to shape future skills in the middle part of our organization the succession planning and talent review process happens twice a year we work from level five up and talk about the talent needs we assess those that are performing at a high potential level and begin to think about their long term contribution to the company ie whether we see them crossing business areas being deep in one particular area or leading a large pl someday we try to figure out the gaps and fill in the precise steps of their career paths we have a very transparent action plan the executive team actually identifies these people and their gaps and we agree upon a plan to fill those gaps the plan may be an expat assignment or an mba program it could involve some crossfunctional assignments regardless it’s very transparent to the leaders who can most support the development of those people and that allows us to track it it doesn’t always work out perfectly but the system is in place there is a lot of energy behind it but it’s always a twoway street the individual has to want to do those things too what are some things you consider when identifying potential we look for leaders who can lead in a global environment that doesn’t necessarily mean they have lived elsewhere it means they listen and learn understand there are differences and start to apply their knowledge to relate to other people these are people who drive common processes and programs and develop twoway or more types of collaboration and communication skills additionally we’re always looking for strong pl leaders with gm capability we see a gap in the market for that as well so we look for people who understand how a business works and about the financial levers you pull to get value out of an organization those are the primary things we’re looking to identify finally i would be leaving out a core component if i didn’t mention that we look for learning agility in the high potentials you mentioned executive transparency what about transparency to the individuals themselves at a senior level we’re transparent with individuals because we want to give them every opportunity to succeed we have regular conversations with people we’re looking to develop and retain perhaps for clevel positions the area where we still have a debate is below that level how much do you tell an employee knowing that someone who demonstrates high potential in one role doesn’t necessarily convey the same potential if moved somewhere else in a new role an individual may take some time to get back on his or her feet and increase potential once again after mastering that particular role we do struggle with it and i believe transparency is important it also takes leadership courage to tell employees whether they are high potential or not and the reasons why you show employees the gaps and help them fill in those gaps it takes a lot of resolve what often separates leaders from managers is the ability to develop people including frank conversations about performance when i say succession planning what does that mean to your organization our organization has some very clear metrics included on every executive’s performance management review including our ceo as you can imagine those objectives are important to the board each one of us has a metric where we are expected to have one or two successors ready for our csuite roles within two years in that month range we need to have someone ready to take on the role if one of us should leave we’re also expected to have an emergency plan in place you may identify someone who has very strong technical skills and could hold it together but may not have an interest or capability to be the longterm leader with the criteria we have in place i believe we can comfortably say we have identified at least one successor but it’s tough to find two it creates competition which is sometimes good and other times is a challenge we are definitely measured by those two metrics we’re also looking at the next level down we like that level to have one or two successors ready as well but their criterion is a bit more open if  percent of their positions have successors we’re pretty happy with it it’s a huge challenge we know that if you measure it it tends to happen on the other hand you have to find the right talent we don’t put someone in that box just to satisfy the metrics there is a lot of conversation and assessment around whether the succession plan is valid how far down in the organization do you use a plan for a job succession versus a pool we require succession planning through level three which includes any direct report of the clevel executives below that level most of our businesses do succession planning for another level or two at the middle levels and even deeper it’s treated as a talent pool with groups of high potentials going through targeted talent programs being in  countries we struggle with the mobility of the pool and their willingness to move not just across a region but maybe from a center of excellence to something that’s more of a generalist role the issue of willingness sometimes makes it difficult for us to fulfill some of those plans is there a language challenge when looking for leaders in some of the global market roles yes we have that challenge in asia they are very anxious to learn and speak english so while there may be a language barrier the willingness to learn is there we’re in the process of bringing a couple of our european leaders to the united states to get them exposure with hopes they will go back and be able to lead a little bit differently than they are today there are still cultural barriers within europe and we struggle with that tell us more about how you develop cross skills and build a pool of international talent first let me speak to knowledge management and retention even though we’re very concerned about these functions the processes we put into place can be leveraged anywhere there are two main tactics on which we focus our knowledge management efforts one is an individual knowledge transfer where you have someone who’s very deep in a certain technology and it’s only necessary for a few more people to understand and know it in that case we put an individual knowledge transfer plan in place versus one for a broad technical base or retiring skill set secondly we have started building communities of practice which are similar to informal networks with a very specific process and a key knowledge holder leading it this leader tends to be someone who has been with the company for a long time and understands the way things work the leader must be willing to communicate through documentation storytelling videotaping and roundtable discussions in the last six months we have started in those specific areas it takes a lot of willingness and collaboration we have technology tools such as sharepoint to help us communicate with each other we’re trying to take leaders with the deep skill to teach another generation what we do it’s very driven by the products and technologies we have including advanced materials and highlyengineered metallurgical components it’s important to have the process in place so that an engineer doesn’t just document iso  and think it’s enough we need them to explain the “why” behind the steps tell the story and give some practical examples of applications those are some of the things we’re doing right now it’s very early in the journey so one of our main questions is about how to measure the effectiveness we’re still working to figure that out but we believe it will be evaluated by the comfort of the targeted learners with criticaltransferred knowledge dimensions as well as evaluations of the thoroughness of the knowledge transfer assessed by the knowledge holders additionally we have some good targeted rotation programs right now we have between  and  expat assignments we tend to keep those in areas that are a little bit higher in the organization for example just in the six years i’ve been at kennametal we’ve had five leaders from the finance organization go to europe and come back all taking on larger roles the effect is twofold since it also helped the european leadership team understand how to more effectively get things done at kennametal it helped them get over the hurdle of the operating system and the language and cultural barriers having someone at the table that has been there and lived it helps them work more effectively it has worked so well that we’re now going to try it in asia for the first time we’ve done the same thing with marketing those skills are very easily transferred across regions some other areas aren’t as easy for example it’s difficult for an hr person to go to europe and try to lead effectively with  countries an employee base speaking multiple languages and employment laws that are extremely different it’s a much bigger challenge does your organization do shortterm assignments and rotations as well as the expat route we’re looking to do more of that i believe we have to break this barrier that an expat assignment must be two or three years because it’s a huge expense and demand on the family that has to go with the transferred employee we’re looking at some alternative arrangements a function of companies with which i’ve worked where it’s been effective is in the it realm they bring people to and from india asia or europe for three months that’s not too disruptive and avoids many of the challenges around visas that you have with a direct expat assignment we are definitely looking at it at this point it’s happening a bit more organically than planned are there other unique advances your organization is making in the hr arena one segment that’s growing for us is related to returning military veterans it’s a good talent pipeline for us and we’re starting to put more attention toward how we can attract postmilitary professionals and integrate them into our organization while also providing support and outreach to their families that pipeline is increasingly important because we find that the military veteran skill set fits really well especially for technical supervisor or managerial jobs in our plants secondly we have a unique differentiator called the kennametal knowledge center it’s like a university where we train employees customers and our distributors we train about  people per year in this program focused on industrial and machining technologies it’s done in six languages that is another differentiator for us that is helping to build our pipeline while also supporting growth via the training we extend to customers and distributors bios judith
