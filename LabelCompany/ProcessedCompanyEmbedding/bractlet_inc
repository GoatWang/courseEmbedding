herewe believe energy efficiency should be easy with technology and data the opportunity to solve operational and efficiency problems in the built environment has never been greater were dedicated to unlocking the energy potential hiding in buildings saving energy resources and improving our world in the process in  when we looked at the available technology we saw a smattering of products that could solve small pieces of the problem but the solution was far from complete the industry was fraught with vague savings claims antiquated processes overpriced hardware and no means to make sense of data even when people could get their hands on it we saw a need for a comprehensive kind of technology and we knew it would take a comprehensive kind of company to build it thats why we founded
