delay an immediate transition to black majority rule rhodesias predominantly white government issued its own unilateral declaration of independence udi from the united kingdom on  november  the udi administration initially sought recognition as an autonomous realm within the commonwealth of nations but reconstituted itself as a republic in  following a brutal guerrilla war fought with two african nationalist organisations robert mugabes zanu and joshua nkomos zapu rhodesian premier ian smith conceded to biracial democracy in  however a provisional government subsequently headed by smith and his moderate colleague abel muzorewa failed in appeasing international critics or halting the bloodshed by december  muzorewa had replaced smith as prime minister and secured an agreement with the militant nationalists allowing rhodesia to briefly revert to colonial status pending elections under a universal franchise it finally achieved internationally recognised independence in april

british south africa companys administration of the rhodesias and retained by the selfgoverning colony of southern rhodesia after the end of company rule in  this naming dispute dated back to october  when northern rhodesia became independent from britain and concurrently changed its name to zambia the southern rhodesian colonial government in salisbury felt that in the absence of a northern rhodesia the continued use of southern was superfluous it passed legislation to become simply rhodesia but the british government refused to approve this on the grounds that the countrys name was defined by british legislation and so could not be altered by the colonial government salisbury went on using the shortened name in an official manner nevertheless while the british government continued referring to the country as southern rhodesia this situation continued throughout the udi period the shortened name was used by many people including the british government in the house of commons the british government maintained this stance regarding the june–december  successor state of zimbabwe rhodesia and when zimbabwe rhodesia returned to colonial status from december  to april

as an indigenous african territory but rather as a unique state which reflected its multiracial character this situation certainly made it very different from other lands which existed under colonial rule as many europeans had arrived to make permanent homes populating the towns as traders or settling to farm the most productive soils in  faced with the decision to join the union of south africa as a fifth province or accept nearly full internal autonomy the electorate cast its vote against south african integration in view of the outcome of the referendum the territory was annexed by the united kingdom on  september  shortly after annexation on  october  the first constitution for the new colony of southern rhodesia came into force under this constitution southern rhodesia was given the right to elect its own thirtymember legislature premier and cabinet—although the british crown retained a formal veto over measures affecting natives and dominated foreign policy the rhodesian authorities provided compensation when the government nationalised enterprises such as the countrys railroads consistently refused to radically alleviate unemployment and shied from filling civil service posts with partisan appointees by colonial standards public services were wellorganised and praised for their efficiency in  southern rhodesia merged with the two other british central african states to form the federation of rhodesia and nyasaland – a loose association that placed defence and economic direction under a central government but left many domestic affairs under the control of its constituent territories as it began to appear that decolonisation was inevitable and indigenous black populations were pressing heavily for change the federation was dissolved in  numbers of white

adopted a policy of no independence before majority rule dictating that colonies with a substantial population of european settlers would not receive independence except under conditions of majority rule rhodesian colonials initially balked at the suggestion some felt they had a right to absolute political control at least for the time being despite their relatively small numbers the authorities were also disturbed by the postindependence chaos which was plaguing other african nations at the time however once rhodesia had been introduced as a topic for discussion in international bodies extension of the status quo became a matter of concern to the world community and a serious embarrassment to the united kingdom after the federal breakup in  thenprime minister alec douglashome insisted that preconditions on independence talks hinge on what he termed the five principles – unimpeded progress to majority rule assurance against any future legislation decidedly detrimental to black interests improvement in the political status of local africans moves towards ending racial discrimination and agreement on a settlement which could be acceptable to the whole population harold wilson and his incoming labour government took an even harder line on demanding that these points be legitimately addressed before an independence agenda could be set by  growing dissatisfaction with the ongoing negotiations ousted salisburys incumbent winston field replacing him with ian smith deputy chairman of the conservative rhodesian front party smith the colonys first rhodesianborn leader soon came to personify resistance to liberals in british government and those agitating for change at home he ruled out acceptance for all five of the proposed principles as they stood implying instead that rhodesia was already legally entitled to independence—a claim which was overwhelmingly endorsed by registered voters in a referendum emboldened by the results of this referendum and the subsequent general election rhodesia now threatened to assume her own sovereignty without british consent harold wilson countered by warning that such an irregular procedure would be considered treasonous although he specifically rejected using armed force against the english kith and kin in africa wilsons refusal to consider a military option encouraged smith to proceed with his plans talks quickly broke down and final efforts in october to achieve a settlement floundered the rhodesian front remained unwilling to accept what were regarded as unacceptably drastic terms and the british would settle for nothing less – it was a formula doomed to failure ian smith signs the unilateral declaration of independence the mantle of the pioneers has fallen on our shoulders to sustain civilisation in a primitive country — ian smith  november  upon the announcement of udi on  november  following a brief but solemn consensus rhodesias leading statesmen issued their countrys unilateral declaration of independence udi this was immediately denounced as an act of rebellion against the crown in the united kingdom and wilson promised that the illegal action would be shortlived however few seemed to initially realise that rhodesia was no longer within the commonwealths direct sphere of influence and british rule was now a constitutional fiction salisbury remained virtually immune to credible metropolitan leverage on  october  the united nations general assembly had noted the repeated threats of the rhodesian authorities to declare unilaterally the independence of southern rhodesia in order to perpetuate minority rule and called upon wilson to use all means at his disposal including military force to prevent the rhodesian front from asserting independence after udi was proclaimed un officials branded ian smiths government as an illegal racist minority regime and called on member states to sever economic ties with rhodesia recommending sanctions on petroleum products and military hardware in december  these measures became mandatory extending to bar the purchase of rhodesian tobacco chrome copper asbestos sugar meat and hides britain having already adopted extensive sanctions of its own dispatched a royal navy squadron to monitor oil deliveries in the port of beira in mozambique from which a strategic pipeline ran to umtali in rhodesia the warships were to deter by force if necessary vessels reasonably believed to be carrying oil destined for southern rhodesia some nations such as switzerland and west germany which were not un members conducted business legally with rhodesia – the latter remained the smith governments largest trading partner in western europe until  when bonn joined the un japan continued to accept more rhodesian exports than any other nation and iran provided oil the portuguese government marketed rhodesian products as its own via false certificates of origin and disguised trade channels south africa openly refused to observe the un sanctions a  amendment passed in the united states permitted american firms to go on importing rhodesian chromium and nickel as normal despite the poor showing of sanctions rhodesia found it nearly impossible to obtain diplomatic recognition abroad in  the us government had made it clear that the udi would not be recognised under any circumstances even smiths ideological allies in pretoria although sympathetic failed to recognise the new country on an equal level initially the state retained its pledged loyalty to elizabeth ii of the united kingdom recognising her as queen of rhodesia when smith and deputy prime minister clifford dupont called on colonial governor sir humphrey gibbs to formally notify him of the udi gibbs condemned the udi as an act of treason after smith formally announced the udi on the radio gibbs sacked the entire cabinet on orders from whitehall however he was unable to enact any concrete actions to foster a return to legality government ministers simply ignored his notices pointing out that udi made his office obsolete even so gibbs continued to occupy his residence in salisbury until  when he vacated the premises and left rhodesia following the declaration of a republic he had effectively been superseded before then on  december  smith named dupont as officer administering the government an earlier attempt to have him named as governorgeneral of rhodesia was dismissed out of hand in september  the appellate division of the rhodesian high court ruled that ian smiths administration had become the de jure government of the country not merely the de facto one to support his decision chief justice sir hugh beadle used several statements made by hugo grotius who maintained that there was no way in which a nation could rightly claim to be governing a particular territory – if it was waging a war against that territory beadle argued that due to britains economic war against rhodesia she could not at the same point be described as governing rhodesia resulting court decisions held that the rebel government could lawfully do anything its predecessors could lawfully have done a salisbury commission chaired by prominent lawyer wr waley was appointed to study constitutional options open to the rhodesian authorities as of april  but reaching a further settlement with the british was ruled out early on waley although insistent that europeans must surrender any belief in permanent european domination also testified that majority rule was not desirable immediately talks aimed at easing the differences between rhodesia and the united kingdom were carried out aboard royal navy vessels once in december  and again in october  both efforts failed to achieve agreement although harold wilson added a sixth principle to the five he had previously enunciated it would be necessary to ensure that regardless of race there was no oppression of the majority by the minority or of any minority by the majority rhodesian resolve stiffened following a failure to reach a new settlement with more radical elements of the rhodesian front calling for a republican constitution during a twoproposition referendum held in  the proposal for severing all remaining ties to the british crown passed by a majority of  votes to  rhodesia declared itself a republic on  march  under the new constitution a president served as ceremonial head of state with the prime minister nominally reporting to him some in rhodesian government had hoped in vain that the declaration of a republic would finally prompt other nations to grant recognition impact of udiedit the years following rhodesias udi saw an unfolding series of economic military and political pressures placed on the country which eventually brought about majority rule a totality of these factors rather than any one the reason for introducing change in  a conference at the london school of economics which discussed rhodesias independence concluded that udi was sparked by an existing racial conflict complicated by cold war intrigues critics of udi sought to maintain that ian smith intended only to safeguard the privileges of an entrenched colonial elite at the expense of the impoverished african community according to this logic udi created a vacuum of oppression which was eventually filled by robert mugabes present dictatorship smith and his supporters continued to defend their actions however by claiming that the rhodesian majority was too inexperienced at the time to manage effectively a developed nation at large the european populations emerging attitude to udi was tense many white rhodesians had seen themselves as nothing less than fully fledged members of the british empire carrying on the same rugged values and frontier spirit of the early englishmen who had settled in  but such confidence was rudely shaken by whitehalls refusal to grant independence on their terms after  there were those who continued to claim that they were collectively upholders of principle and defenders of such values against the twin threats of communism manifested through the militant black nationalists and – ironically – the decadence of britain herself often repeated appeals to the christian heritage of their pioneer ancestors in defending the free world reflected these beliefs african parties displayed initial horror at smiths declaration with one zanu official stating for all those who cherish freedom and a meaningful life udi has set a collision course which cannot be altered  november  has marked the turning point of the struggle for freedom in that land from a constitutional and political one to primarily a military struggle it would however be several years before even the most radical nationalists chose to develop a coherent strategy revolving around armed resistance preferring instead to create opportunities for external intervention because rhodesian exports were generally competitive and had previously been entitled to preferential treatment on the british market the former colony did not recognise the need for escalating the pace of diversification before independence following the udi however rhodesia began to demonstrate that she had the potential to develop a greater degree of economic selfsufficiency after the rhodesian front began introducing incentives accorded to domestic production industrial output expanded dramatically a rigid system of countermeasures enacted to combat sanctions succeeded in blunting their impact for at least a decade over the next nine years rhodesian companies spiting the freezing of their assets and blocking of overseas accounts also perfected cunning techniques of sanctions evasion through both local and foreign subsidiaries which operated on a clandestine trade network from  until  there was virtually no further dialogue between rhodesia and the uk this altered immediately after the ascension of edward heath who reopened negotiations smith remained optimistic that heath would do his utmost to remedy anglorhodesian relations although disappointed that he continued to adhere publicly to the original five principles proposed by alec douglashome now foreign secretary in november  douglashome renewed contacts with salisbury and announced a proposed agreement which would be satisfactory to both sides – it recognised rhodesias  constitution as the legal frame of government while agreeing that gradual legislative representation was an acceptable formula for unhindered advance to majority rule nevertheless the new settlement if approved would also implement an immediate improvement in black political status offer a means to terminate racial discrimination and provide a solid guarantee against retrogressive constitutional amendments implementation of the proposed settlement hinged on popular acceptance but the rhodesian government consistently refused to submit it to a universal referendum a twenty fourmember commission headed by an eminent jurist lord pearce was therefore tasked with ascertaining public opinion on the subject in  the commission began interviewing interest groups and sampling opinions – although concern was expressed over the widespread apathy encountered according to every published finding whites were in favour of the settlement and rhodesians of mixed or asian background generally pleased while black reaction was resoundingly negative as many as thirty african chiefs and politicians voiced their opposition prompting britain to withdraw from the proposals on the grounds of the commissions report the bush waredit main article rhodesian bush war as early as  minority rule in southern rhodesia was already being challenged by a rising tide of political violence led by african nationalists such as joshua nkomo and ndabaningi sithole after their public campaigns were initially suppressed many believed that negotiation was completely incapable of meeting their aspirations petrol bombings by radicals became increasingly common with the zimbabwe review observing in  for the first time homemade petrol bombs were used by freedom fighters in salisbury against settler establishments it was officially noted that between january and september  alone  bombings were carried out in addition to  acts of attempted sabotage on communications in that same period nationalists were implicated in arson targeting  schools and  churches nkomos zimbabwe african peoples union zapu subsequently disclosed that it had formed a military wing zimbabwe peoples revolutionary army zipra and the decision to start bringing in arms and ammunition and to send young men away for sabotage training had already been made the rhodesian authorities responded by banning zapu and driving its supporters underground frustrated by their repeated failures nationalists also conducted a campaign of terror against black africans murdering those who had either identified with the colonial administration or had simply failed to demonstrate their allegiance to the cause to protect civilians emergency laws were imposed broadening the legal definition of unlawful gatherings and giving the police greater powers to crack down on agitators or subversives the death sentence was also introduced for terrorism involving explosives and arson a crisis of confidence soon resulted across zapu which was already suffering from poor morale compounded by tribal and ideological factionalism in  party dissidents rejected joshua nkomos authority and formed their own organisation the zimbabwe african national union zanu – which worked out its own strategy for impressing international opinion undermining white assurance and achieving a complete breakdown of order by august  zanu which had brutally intimidated neutrals and opponents alike was outlawed by authorities as well zanus agenda was inwardlooking leftist and panafricanist in nature ndabaningi sithole and avowed marxist robert mugabe its most prominent leaders demanded a one party zimbabwean state with majority rule and a public monopoly on land after being forced from rhodesia they continued to operate in exile creating occupation groups representing urban workers miners and peasant farmers zanu also attracted professionals students and feminists to its ranks while zapu theoretically continued to command the allegiance of most ndebele and shona activists sithole and mugabe drew their support from the mashonaland countryside after the udi zanu officials mapped an elaborate plan for the liberation of zimbabwe which called for attacks on white farmers destruction of cash crops disrupting electricity in urban areas and petrol bombings sithole and nkomo both insisted on the need for armed struggle but disagreed on the means to go about it for example zapu tended to follow soviet thinking placing an emphasis on sophisticated weaponry in the hopes of winning a conventional battle like the viet minh at dien bien phu zanu preferred to politicise populations in areas which they intended to seize neither force however had acquired basic knowledge of guerrilla warfare debate on political theory and insurgent tactics became the obsession of nationalists at this stage soldier interrogates rhodesian villagers about insurgent activity in late  this

nanjing military college crossed into rhodesia from zambia they were armed with sks carbines chinese hand grenades explosives and communist pamphlets having been issued vague instructions to sabotage important installations before killing white persons indiscriminately at least five guerrillas were simply arrested before getting very far another seven hoped to destroy a pylon carrying electricity to sinoia in the northwest their faulty demolitions were uncovered by the rhodesian security forces and the men easily tracked to a nearby ranch on  april where they were shot resisting capture this event is considered to have been the first engagement of what came to be known as the bush war in rhodesia and the second chimurenga or rebellion in shona by supporters of the guerrillas the campaign proper is generally considered to have started in  with the attack on altena farm despite the minor threat already represented by the nationalist movements in the s after unsuccessful appeals to britain and the united states for military assistance robert mugabe who was based in mozambique after that countrys independence from portugal in  led zanu to seek support from the peoples republic of china and countries of the soviet bloc joshua nkomo based in zambia and also supported by the soviet union led zapu zanu and zapu together formed the patriotic front broadly zanla recruited mainly from mashonaland and manicaland provinces whilst the zipra recruited from mashonaland west midlands and matabeleland provinces of zimbabwe after the collapse of portuguese rule in mozambique in – it was no longer viable for the smith regime to sustain white minority rule indefinitely by this time even south africas vorster had come to this view while vorster was unwilling to make concessions to his own countrys blacks he concluded that white minority rule was not sustainable in a country where blacks outnumbered whites  in  there were  rhodesians of european descent and more than six million africans international business groups involved in the country eg lonrho transferred their support from the rhodesian government to black nationalist parties business leaders and politicians feted nkomo on his visits to europe zanu also attracted business supporters who saw the course that future events were likely to take funding and arms support provided by supporters particularly from the soviet union and its allies in the latter s allowed both zipra and the zanla to acquire more sophisticated weaponry thereby increasing the military pressure that the guerrillas were able to place on rhodesia until  containing the guerrillas was little more than a police action even as late as august  when rhodesian government and black nationalist leaders met at victoria falls for negotiations brokered by south africa and zambia the talks never got beyond the procedural phase rhodesian representatives made it clear they were prepared to fight an all out war to prevent majority rule however the situation changed dramatically after the end of portuguese colonial rule in mozambique in  rhodesia now found itself almost entirely surrounded by hostile states and even south africa its only real ally pressed for a settlement having let slip one chance after another of reaching an accommodation with more moderate black leaders rhodesias whites seem to have made the tragic choice of facing

 at this point zanus alliance with frelimo the liberation front of mozambique and the porous border between mozambique and eastern rhodesia enabled largescale training and infiltration of zanuzanla

forced to relocate to protected villages pvs which were strictly controlled and guarded by the government against rebel atrocities the protected villages were compared by the guerrillas to concentration camps some contemporary accounts claim that this interference in the lives of local residents induced many of them who had previously been neutral to support the guerrillas the war

south africa which while sympathetic to the white minority government never accorded it diplomatic recognition the south african government placed limits on the fuel and munitions they supplied to the rhodesian military they also withdrew the personnel and equipment that they had previously provided to aid the war effort though covert military support continued in  the south african government and united states governments worked together to place pressure on smith to agree to a form of majority rule in response to the initiative of us secretary of state henry kissinger in  ian smith accepted the principle of black majority rule within two years the rhodesians now offered more concessions but those concessions focused on reaching an internal settlement with moderate black leaders were insufficient to end the war at the time some rhodesians said the still embittered history between the britishdominated rhodesia and the afrikanerdominated south africa partly led south african government to withdraw its aid to rhodesia ian smith said in his memoirs that even though many white south africans supported rhodesia south african prime minister john vorsters policy of détente with the black african states ended up with rhodesia being offered as the sacrificial lamb to buy more time for south africa other observers perceived south africas distancing itself from rhodesia as being an early move in the process that led to majority rule in south africa itself in  south africa saw settlement of the rhodesian question as vital on several fronts to cauterise the wound of the

pressure while the numbers of guerrillas in the country were steadily increasing the government abandoned its early strategy of trying to defend the borders in favour of trying to defend key economic areas and lines of communication with south africa while the rest of the countryside became a patchwork of nogo areas late sedit by the late s rhodesias frontline forces contained about  regular troops and police – backed up by relatively strong army and police reserves its mechanised contingent consisted of light armoured cars and improvised mineprotected armoured personnel carriers complemented by eight tanks polish built tld tanks delivered in the last year of the war the rhodesian air force operated an assortment of both canberra light bombers hawker hunter fighter bombers older de havilland vampire jets as well as a somewhat antiquated but still potent helicopter arm these forces including highly trained special operations units were capable of launching devastating raids on resistance movement camps outside the country as in operation dingo in  and other similar operations nevertheless guerrilla pressure inside the country itself was steadily increasing in the latter s by – the war had become a contest between the guerrilla warfare placing ever increasing pressure on the rhodesian regime and civil population and the rhodesian governments strategy of trying to hold off the militants until external recognition for a compromise political settlement with moderate black leaders could be secured by this time the need to cut a deal was apparent to most rhodesians but not to all ian smith had dismissed his intransigent defence minister p k van der byl as early as  pk had been a hardline opponent of any form of compromise with domestic opposition or the international community since before udi it is better to fight to the last man and the last cartridge and die with some honour because what is being presented to us here is a degree of humiliation

use of poisons against guerrillasedit main article rhodesia and weapons of mass destruction the programs primary purpose was to kill guerrillas whether they were recruits transiting to camps in mozambique or guerrillas operating inside rhodesia the cbw effort took on the guerrilla threat from three fronts first the effort aimed to eliminate guerrillas operating inside rhodesia through contaminated supplies either provided by contact men recovered from hidden caches or stolen from rural stores secondly the effort worked to contaminate water supplies along guerrilla infiltration routes into rhodesia forcing the guerrillas either to travel through arid regions to carry more water and less ammunition or travel through areas patrolled by the security forces finally the rhodesians sought to hit the guerrillas in their camps in mozambique by poisoning food beverages and medicines the chemicals most used in the rhodesian program were parathion an organophosphate insecticide and thallium a heavy metal commonly found in rodenticide the rhodesians selected for use also included vibrio cholerae causative agent of cholera and possibly bacillus anthracis causative agent of anthrax they also looked at using rickettsia prowazekii causative agent of epidemic typhus and salmonella typhi causative agent of typhoid fever and toxins—such as ricin and botulinum toxin biological agents namely vibrio cholerae causative agent of cholera had some impact on the fighting capability of zanla some former officers of the rhodesian security forces alleged that anthrax was covertly used by rhodesian psyops units during the late s but these statements are unfounded rhodesia never possessed the capability to produce anthrax spores on the scale needed for widespread dissemination use of anthracis ricin or botulinum toxin would have been confined to assassination attempts some moremerited allegations are that the south african governments topsecret chemical and biological weapons program a progenitor of project coast used rhodesia as a laboratory security situation erodes rapidlyedit the work of journalists such as lord richard cecil son of the marquess of

almost failed to reach conclusion due to disagreements on land reform but resulted in the lancaster house agreement udi ended and rhodesia temporarily reverted to the status of a british colony the colony of southern rhodesia the lancaster house agreement further provided for a ceasefire which was followed by an internationally supervised general election held on february  zanu led by robert mugabe won this election some allegedwho by terrorising its political opposition including supporters of zapu through former insurgents that had not confined themselves to the designated guerrilla assembly points as stipulated by the lancaster house agreement the observers and the newly installed governor lord soames were accused of looking the other way and mugabes victory was certified nevertheless few could doubt that mugabes support within his majority shona tribal group was extremely strong the rhodesian military seriously considered mounting a coup against a perceived stolen election operation quartz to prevent zanu from taking over the country the alleged coup was to include the assassination of mugabe and coordinated assaults on guerrilla assembly points throughout the country the plan was eventually scuttled as it was obvious that mugabe enjoyed widespread support from the black majority despite voter intimidation as well as the fact that the coup would gain no external support and a conflagration which would engulf the country was seen as inevitable republic of zimbabwe edit mugabe and the victorious black nationalists were rather less concerned by operation quartz than by the possibility that there might be a mass exodus of the white community of the kind that had caused chaos in mozambique five years earlier such an exodus had been prepared for by the south african government with the agreement of the british governor of rhodesia south african troops had entered the country to secure the road approaches to the beit bridge border crossing point refugee camps had been prepared in the transvaal on the day the election results became known most white families had prepared contingency plans for flight including the packing of cars and suitcases however after a meeting with robert mugabe and the central committee of zanu pf ian smith was reassured that whites could and should stay in the new zimbabwe mugabe promised that he would abide strictly by the terms of the lancaster house agreement and that changes in zimbabwe would be made gradually and by proper legal process in a cbs news interview mugabe claimed that rhodesian whites are still in control of the economy the majority being commercial farmers mugabe however would reverse his commitment to these agreements some years later the regime began confiscating white owned farm lands this is widely blamed for leading to the deterioration of the zimbabwean economy which plagues the country today on  april  the country became independent as the republic of zimbabwe

although southern rhodesia never gained full dominion status within the commonwealth of nations southern rhodesians ruled themselves from the attainment of responsible government in  its electoral register had property and education qualifications over the years various electoral arrangements made at a national and municipal level upheld these standards for example the franchise for the first southern rhodesian legislative council election in  contained the following requirement voters to be british subjects male  years of age and older able to write their address and occupation and then to fulfil the following financial requirements a ownership of a registered mining claim in southern rhodesia or b occupying immovable property worth £ or c receiving wages or salary of £ per annum in southern rhodesia six months continuous residence was also required for qualifications b and c following cecil rhodess dictum of equal rights for all civilised men there was no overt racial component to the franchise however the requirement excluded a majority of native blacks from the electorate up until the s southern rhodesia had a vibrant political life with right and left wing parties competing for power the rhodesian labour party held seats in the assembly and in municipal councils throughout the s and s from  to  the prime minister was garfield todd a liberal who did much to promote the development of the black community through investment in education housing and healthcare however the government forced todd from office because his proposed reforms were seen by many whites as too radical from  onwards white settler politics consolidated and ossified around resistance to majority rule setting the stage for udi the  constitution governed southern rhodesia and independent rhodesia up until  using the westminster parliamentary system modified by a system of separate voter rolls with differing property and education qualifications without regard to race whites ended up with the majority of assembly seats the  republican constitution established a bicameral parliament consisting of an indirectly elected senate and a directly elected house of assembly effectively reserving the majority of seats for whites the office of president had only ceremonial significance with the prime minister holding executive power the constitution of the shortlived zimbabwe rhodesia which saw a blackled government elected for the first time reserved  of the  parliamentary seats for whites the independence constitution agreed at lancaster house watered those provisions down and reserved  out of  seats for whites in the house of assembly and  out of  seats in the senate the constitution prohibited zimbabwe authorities from altering the constitution for seven years without unanimous consent and required a threequarters vote in parliament for a further three years the government amended the constitution in  to abolish the seats reserved for whites and replace the office of prime minister with an executive president in  the government abolished the senate military and policeedit main article rhodesian security forces rhodesian security forces

fighting units foreign relationsedit this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed february  learn how and when to remove this template message throughout the period of its unilateral declaration of independence  to  rhodesia pursued a foreign policy of attempting to secure recognition as an independent country and insisting that its political system would include gradual steps to majority rule ardently anticommunist rhodesia tried to present itself to the west as a frontline state against communist expansion in africa to little avail rhodesia received little international recognition during its existence recognition only occurred after elections in  and a transition to majority rule rhodesia wished to retain its economic prosperity and also feared communist elements in the rebel forces and thus felt their policy of a gradual progression to black majority rule was justified however the international community refused to accept this rationale believing that their policies were perpetuating racism this attitude was part of the larger decolonisation context during which western powers such as the united kingdom france and belgium hastened to grant independence to their colonies in africa britain and the udiedit rhodesia was originally a british colony although decolonisation in africa had begun after world war ii it began accelerating in the early s causing britain to negotiate independence rapidly with several of its colonies during this period it adopted a foreign policy called nibmar or no independence before majority african rule mandating democratic reforms that placed governance in the hands of the majority black africans the governing white minority of rhodesia led by ian smith opposed the policy and its implications on  november  rhodesias minority white government made a unilateral declaration of independence udi from the united kingdom as it became apparent that negotiations would not lead to independence under the white regime the united kingdom government immediately brought in legislation southern rhodesia act  which formally abolished all rhodesian government institutions this move made life difficult for rhodesian citizens who wished to travel internationally as passports issued by rhodesias udi administration were not recognised as valid in january  the british issued a statement accepting as valid any passport issued before the declaration of independence and allowing sixmonth united kingdom passports to be granted when they expired – provided that the bearer declared they did not intend to aid the udi rhodesian government until late  rhodesia still recognised queen elizabeth ii as head of state even though it opposed the british government itself for hindering its goals of independence the queen however refused to accept the title queen of rhodesia eventually the smith government abandoned attempts to remain loyal to the crown and in  a majority of the electorate voted in referendum to declare rhodesia a republic they hoped that this move would facilitate recognition as an independent state by the international community but the issues of white minority control remained and hindered this effort and like the udi before it the proclamation of a republic lacked international recognition sanctionsedit after the declaration of independence and indeed for the entire duration of its existence rhodesia did not receive official recognition from any state although it did maintain diplomatic relations with south africa which was then under apartheid south africa did not recognise rhodesia to preserve its fragile positions with other nations but frequently assisted the republic portugal maintained informal relations until the carnation revolution of  the day following the declaration of independence the united nations security council passed a resolution sres calling upon all states not to accord rhodesia recognition and to refrain from any assistance the security council also imposed selective mandatory economic sanctions which were later made comprehensive malawi israel south africa portugal and iran did not comply with economic sanctions against rhodesia the us despite voting in favor of the sanctions at the unsc violated them to buy chrome ore from rhodesia kenneth kaunda president of zambia also accused western oil companies of violating the sanctions and selling oil to rhodesia international perspectiveedit rhodesias unilateral declaration of independence from the united kingdom on  november  was promptly condemned by the international community the united nations security council resolution  of  november  called upon all states not to recognise this illegal racist minority regime in southern rhodesia rhodesia campaigned for international acceptance and invoked the doctrine of nonintervention in internal affairs as justification for rebuking external criticism of its internal policies however the emerging doctrine of selfdetermination in colonial situations meant that most nations regarded rhodesia as illegitimate zambia formerly northern rhodesia took a pragmatic approach towards rhodesia kenneth kaunda heavily dependent on access through rhodesia for his nations copper ore exports fuel and power imports unofficially worked with the rhodesian government rhodesia still allowed zambia to export and import its goods through its territory to mozambique ports despite the zambian governments official policy of hostility and nonrecognition of the postudi smith administration the united states like all other western nations refused to recognise rhodesia but unlike others allowed its consulategeneral to function as a communications conduit between the american government in washington dc and the rhodesian government in salisbury when rhodesia set up an information office in washington dc oas nations loudly protested the us government responded by saying the rhodesian mission and its staff had no official diplomatic status and violated no us laws portugal pursued a middle path with rhodesia while not officially recognising rhodesia under ian smith the government of antónio salazar did permit rhodesia to establish a representative mission in lisbon and permitted rhodesian exports and imports through their colony of mozambique the portuguese government in power at that time authoritarian and ardently anticommunist gave active behindthescenes support in rhodesias fight against the guerrilla groups south africa itself under international pressure as a white minority government pursued a policy of détente with the black african states at the time these states wanted south africa to pressure ian smith to accept a faster transition to majority rule in rhodesia in return for pledges of noninterference in south africas internal affairs prime minister john vorster believing majority rule in rhodesia would lead to international acceptance for south africa used a number of tactics to pressure smith the south african government held up shipments of fuel and ammunition and pulled out friendly south african forces from rhodesia the combined loss of mozambique and the loss of support from south africa dealt critical blows to the rhodesian government diplomatic relationsedit after the udi rhodesia maintained several overseas missions including pretoria and until  lisbon in portugal and lourenço marques now maputo in mozambique since  rhodesia had had an accredited diplomatic representative with south africa heading a rhodesian diplomatic mission or de facto embassy before south africa left the commonwealth that year the then southern rhodesia had exchanged high commissioners with the then union of south africa but following the change in status the republic now had a south african diplomatic mission in salisbury during  the government of rhodesia made moves to establish a mission in lisbon separate from the british embassy with its own accredited representative having previously been able to establish its own consulate in lourenço marques capital of portuguese mozambique this prompted protests from the british government which was determined that the representative harry reedman should be a nominal member of the british ambassadors staff for their part the portuguese authorities sought a compromise whereby they would accept reedman as an independent representative but deny him diplomatic status the rhodesian information office in washington remained open following udi but its director ken towsey and his staff were deprived of their diplomatic status previously there had been a minister for rhodesian affairs operating under the aegis of the british embassy in washington as well representatives in tokyo and bonn following the countrys independence as zimbabwe towsey became chargé daffaires at the new embassy the high commission in london known as rhodesia house continued to function until it was closed in  following the decision by white rhodesians in a referendum to make the country a republic along with the british residual mission in salisbury prior to its closure the mission flew the newly adopted flag of rhodesia considered illegal by the foreign office prompting calls by labour mp willie hamilton for its removal in australia the federal government in canberra sought to close the rhodesian information centre in sydney but it remained open operating under the jurisdiction of the state of new south wales in  the labor government of gough whitlam cut post and telephone links to the centre but this was ruled illegal by the high court an office was also established in paris but this was closed down by the french government in  similarly the united states recalled its consulgeneral from salisbury and reduced consular staff but did not move to close its consulate until the declaration of a republic in  south africa however retained its accredited diplomatic representative after udi which allowed it to continue to recognise british sovereignty as well as to deal with the de facto authority of the government of ian smith the south african diplomatic mission in salisbury became the only such mission remaining in the country after  when portugal downgraded its mission to consul level having recalled its consulgeneral in salisbury in may  after zimbabwes independence the new government closed its missions in pretoria and cape town only maintaining a trade mission in johannesburg while the south african diplomatic mission in salisbury was also closed resultsedit continuing civil war and a lack of international support eventually led the rhodesian government to submit to an agreement with the uk in  this led to internationally supervised elections won by zimbabwe african national union  patriotic front and robert mugabe establishing the internationally recognised zimbabwe legacyedit in the ten years after independence around  of the white population of zimbabwe emigrated most to south africa and to other mainly white english speaking countries where they formed expatriate communities politically within zimbabwe the consolidation of power by robert mugabe continued through the s following amendments to the countrys constitution in  parliamentary seats reserved for whites were abolished and an executive presidency was created held by mugabe many expatriates and some of the whites who stayed in zimbabwe became deeply nostalgic for rhodesia these individuals are known as rhodies native whites who are more accepting of the new order are known as zimbos while as rhodesia the country was once considered the breadbasket of africa today zimbabwe is a net importer of foodstuffs with the european union and united states providing emergency food relief as humanitarian aid on a regular basis the nation has suffered profound economic and social decline in the past twenty years recently the agriculture sector has started to do well since the availability of expertise and machines has improved supported mainly by china zimbabwe also suffered from a crippling inflation rate as the reserve bank of zimbabwe had a policy of printing money to satisfy government debts which introduces excessive currency into the economic system which led to the demise of the local currency this policy caused the inflation rate to soar from  in  considered extremely high by most economic standards to an astonishing  by  monetary aid by the international monetary fund has been suspended due to the zimbabwe governments defaulting on past loans inability to stabilise its own economy and its inability to stem corruption and advance human rights in  zimbabwe abandoned its currency relying instead on foreign currencies such as the south african rand the us dollar the botswana pula the euro and the british pound among others in  elections mugabe garnered  simba makoni  and morgan tsvangirai  of the votes cast for president forcing a runoff election called by the zimbabwe electoral commission zec in the months leading to the runoff instances of extreme violence between the two major parties zanu pf and mdc led tsvangirai to withdraw from the election in february  a powersharing accord was reached which resulted in the zimbabwe government of national unity of  the accord was essentially to create the position of prime minister for tsvangirai who served in that role from  to  mugabe retained the title of president rhodesian mediaedit the main newspapers were the rhodesia herald in salisbury and the chronicle in bulawayo following udi in  the staterun rhodesian broadcasting corporation rbc

unrecognised state in southern africa from  to  equivalent in territorial terms to modern zimbabwe with its capital in salisbury now harare rhodesia was considered a de facto successor state to the former british colony of southern rhodesia which had achieved responsible government in  during an effort to delay an immediate transition to black majority rule rhodesias predominantly white government issued its own unilateral declaration of independence udi from the united kingdom on  november  the udi administration initially sought recognition as an autonomous realm within the commonwealth of nations but reconstituted itself as a republic in  following a brutal guerrilla war fought with two african nationalist organisations robert mugabes zanu and joshua nkomos zapu rhodesian premier ian smith conceded to biracial democracy in  however a provisional government subsequently headed by smith and his moderate colleague abel muzorewa failed in appeasing international critics or halting the bloodshed by december  muzorewa had replaced smith as prime minister and secured an agreement with the militant nationalists allowing rhodesia to briefly revert to colonial status pending elections under a universal franchise it finally achieved internationally recognised independence in april  the nation was concurrently renamed the republic of zimbabwe a wholly

selfgoverning colony of southern rhodesia after the end of company rule in  this naming dispute dated back to october  when northern rhodesia became independent from britain and concurrently changed its name to zambia the southern rhodesian colonial government in salisbury felt that in the absence of a northern rhodesia the continued use of southern was superfluous it passed legislation to become simply rhodesia but the british government refused to approve this on the grounds that the countrys name was defined by british legislation and so could not be altered by the colonial government salisbury went on using the shortened name in an official manner nevertheless while the british government continued referring to the country as southern rhodesia this situation continued throughout the udi period the shortened name was used by many people including the british government in the house of commons the british government maintained this stance regarding the june–december  successor

backgroundedit until after world war ii the landlocked british possession of southern rhodesia was not developed as an indigenous african territory but rather as a unique state which reflected its multiracial character this situation certainly made it very different from other lands which existed under colonial rule as many europeans had arrived to make permanent homes populating the towns as traders or settling to farm the most productive soils in  faced with the decision to join the union of south africa as a fifth province or accept nearly full internal autonomy the electorate cast its vote against south african integration in view of the outcome of the referendum the territory was annexed by the united kingdom on  september  shortly after annexation on  october  the first constitution for the new colony of southern rhodesia came into force under this constitution southern rhodesia was given the right to elect its own thirtymember legislature premier and cabinet—although the british crown retained a formal veto over measures affecting natives and dominated foreign policy the rhodesian authorities provided compensation when the government nationalised enterprises such as the countrys railroads consistently refused to radically alleviate unemployment and shied from filling civil service posts with partisan appointees by colonial standards public services were wellorganised and praised for their efficiency in  southern rhodesia merged with the two other british central african states to form the federation of rhodesia and nyasaland – a loose association that placed defence and economic direction under a central government but left many domestic affairs under the control of its constituent territories as it began to appear that decolonisation was inevitable and indigenous black populations were pressing heavily for change the federation was dissolved in  numbers of white and black inhabitants before and during the central african federation year southern rhodesia northern rhodesia nyasaland total white black white black white black white black                                                                     unilateral declaration of independence edit although prepared to grant formal independence to southern rhodesia now rhodesia the british government had adopted a policy of no independence before majority rule dictating that colonies with a substantial population of european settlers would not receive independence except under conditions of majority rule rhodesian colonials initially balked at the suggestion some felt they had a right to absolute political control at least for the time being despite their relatively small numbers the authorities were also disturbed by the postindependence chaos which was plaguing other african nations at the time however once rhodesia had been introduced as a topic for discussion in international bodies extension of the status quo became a matter of concern to the world community and a serious embarrassment to the united kingdom after the federal breakup in  thenprime minister alec douglashome insisted that preconditions on independence talks hinge on what he termed the five principles – unimpeded progress to majority rule assurance against any future legislation decidedly detrimental to black interests improvement in the political status of local africans moves towards ending racial discrimination and agreement on a settlement which could be acceptable to the whole population harold wilson and his incoming labour government took an even harder line on demanding that these points be legitimately addressed before an independence agenda could be set by  growing dissatisfaction with the ongoing negotiations ousted salisburys incumbent winston field replacing him with ian smith deputy chairman of the conservative rhodesian front party smith the colonys first rhodesianborn leader soon came to personify resistance to liberals in british government and those agitating for change at home he ruled out acceptance for all five of the proposed principles as they stood implying instead that rhodesia was already legally entitled to independence—a claim which was overwhelmingly endorsed by registered voters in a referendum emboldened by the results of this referendum and the subsequent general election rhodesia now threatened to assume her own sovereignty without british consent harold wilson countered by warning that such an irregular procedure would be considered treasonous although he specifically rejected using armed force against the english kith and kin in africa wilsons refusal to consider a military option encouraged smith to proceed with his plans talks quickly broke down and final efforts in october to achieve a settlement floundered the rhodesian front remained unwilling to accept what were regarded as unacceptably drastic terms and the british would settle for nothing less – it was a formula doomed to failure ian smith signs the unilateral declaration of independence the mantle of the pioneers has fallen on our shoulders to sustain civilisation in a primitive country — ian smith  november  upon the announcement of udi on  november  following a brief but solemn consensus rhodesias leading statesmen issued their countrys unilateral declaration of independence udi this was immediately denounced as an act of rebellion against the crown in the united kingdom and wilson promised that the illegal action would be shortlived however few seemed to initially realise that rhodesia was no longer within the commonwealths direct sphere of influence and british rule was now a constitutional fiction salisbury remained virtually immune to credible metropolitan leverage on  october  the united nations general assembly had noted the repeated threats of the rhodesian authorities to declare unilaterally the independence of southern rhodesia in order to perpetuate minority rule and called upon wilson to use all means at his disposal including military force to prevent the rhodesian front from asserting independence after udi was proclaimed un officials branded ian smiths government as an illegal racist minority regime and called on member states to sever economic ties with rhodesia recommending sanctions on petroleum products and military hardware in december  these measures became mandatory extending to bar the purchase of rhodesian tobacco chrome copper asbestos sugar meat and hides britain having already adopted extensive sanctions of its own dispatched a royal navy squadron to monitor oil deliveries in the port of beira in mozambique from which a strategic pipeline ran to umtali in rhodesia the warships were to deter by force if necessary vessels reasonably believed to be carrying oil destined for southern rhodesia some nations such as switzerland and west germany which were not un members conducted business legally with rhodesia – the latter remained the smith governments largest trading partner in western europe until  when bonn joined the un japan continued to accept more rhodesian exports than any other nation and iran provided oil the portuguese government marketed rhodesian products as its own via false certificates of origin and disguised trade channels south africa openly refused to observe the un sanctions a  amendment passed in the united states permitted american firms to go on importing rhodesian chromium and nickel as normal despite the poor showing of sanctions rhodesia found it nearly impossible to obtain diplomatic recognition abroad in  the us government had made it clear that the udi would not be recognised under any circumstances even smiths ideological allies in pretoria although sympathetic failed to recognise the new country on an equal level initially the state retained its pledged loyalty to elizabeth ii of the united kingdom recognising her as queen of rhodesia when smith and deputy prime minister clifford dupont called on colonial governor sir humphrey gibbs to formally notify him of the udi gibbs condemned the udi as an act of treason after smith formally announced the udi on the radio gibbs sacked the entire cabinet on orders from whitehall however he was unable to enact any concrete actions to foster a return to legality government ministers simply ignored his notices pointing out that udi made his office obsolete even so gibbs continued to occupy his residence in salisbury until  when he vacated the premises and left rhodesia following the declaration of a republic he had effectively been superseded before then on  december  smith named dupont as officer administering the government an earlier attempt to have him named as governorgeneral of rhodesia was dismissed out of hand in september  the appellate division of the rhodesian high court ruled that ian smiths administration had become the de jure government of the country not merely the de facto one to support his decision chief justice sir hugh beadle used several statements made by hugo grotius who maintained that there was no way in which a nation could rightly claim to be governing a particular territory – if it was waging a war against that territory beadle argued that due to britains economic war against rhodesia she could not at the same point be described as governing rhodesia resulting court decisions held that the rebel government could lawfully do anything its predecessors could lawfully have done a salisbury commission chaired by prominent lawyer wr waley was appointed to study constitutional options open to the rhodesian authorities as of april  but reaching a further settlement with the british was ruled out early on waley although insistent that europeans must surrender any belief in permanent european domination also testified that majority rule was not desirable immediately talks aimed at easing the differences between rhodesia and the united kingdom were carried out aboard royal navy vessels once in december  and again in october  both efforts failed to achieve agreement although harold wilson added a sixth principle to the five he had previously enunciated it would be necessary to ensure that regardless of race there was no oppression of the majority by the minority or of any minority by the majority rhodesian resolve stiffened following a failure to reach a new settlement with more radical elements of the rhodesian front calling for a republican constitution during a twoproposition referendum held in  the proposal for severing all remaining ties to the british crown passed by a majority of  votes to  rhodesia declared itself a republic on  march  under the new constitution a president served as ceremonial head of state with the prime minister nominally reporting to him some in rhodesian government had hoped in vain that the declaration of a republic would finally prompt other nations to grant recognition impact of udiedit the years following rhodesias udi saw an unfolding series of economic military and political pressures placed on the country which eventually brought about majority rule a totality of these factors rather than any one the reason for introducing change in  a conference at the london school of economics which discussed rhodesias independence concluded that udi was sparked by an existing racial conflict complicated by cold war intrigues critics of udi sought to maintain that ian smith intended only to safeguard the privileges of an entrenched colonial elite at the expense of the impoverished african community according to this logic udi created a vacuum of oppression which was eventually filled by robert mugabes present dictatorship smith and his supporters continued to defend their actions however by claiming that the rhodesian majority was too inexperienced at the time to manage effectively a developed nation at large the european populations emerging attitude to udi was tense many white rhodesians had seen themselves as nothing less than fully fledged members of the british empire carrying on the same rugged values and frontier spirit of the early englishmen who had settled in  but such confidence was rudely shaken by whitehalls refusal to grant independence on their terms after  there were those who continued to claim that they were collectively upholders of principle and defenders of such values against the twin threats of communism manifested through the militant black nationalists and – ironically – the decadence of britain herself often repeated appeals to the christian heritage of their pioneer ancestors in defending the free world reflected these beliefs african parties displayed initial horror at smiths declaration with one zanu official stating for all those who cherish freedom and a meaningful life udi has set a collision course which cannot be altered  november  has marked the turning point of the struggle for freedom in that land from a constitutional and political one to primarily a military struggle it would however be several years before even the most radical nationalists chose to develop a coherent strategy revolving around armed resistance preferring instead to create opportunities for external intervention because rhodesian exports were generally competitive and had previously been entitled to preferential treatment on the british market the former colony did not recognise the need for escalating the pace of diversification before independence following the udi however rhodesia began to demonstrate that she had the potential to develop a greater degree of economic selfsufficiency after the rhodesian front began introducing incentives accorded to domestic production industrial output expanded dramatically a rigid system of countermeasures enacted to combat sanctions succeeded in blunting their impact for at least a decade over the next nine years rhodesian companies spiting the freezing of their assets and blocking of overseas accounts also perfected cunning techniques of sanctions evasion through both local and foreign subsidiaries which operated on a clandestine trade network from  until  there was virtually no further dialogue between rhodesia and the uk this altered immediately after the ascension of edward heath who reopened negotiations smith remained optimistic that heath would do his utmost to remedy anglorhodesian relations although disappointed that he continued to adhere publicly to the original five principles proposed by alec douglashome now foreign secretary in november  douglashome renewed contacts with salisbury and announced a proposed agreement which would be satisfactory to both sides – it recognised rhodesias  constitution as the legal frame of government while agreeing that gradual legislative representation was an acceptable formula for unhindered advance to majority rule nevertheless the new settlement if approved would also implement an immediate improvement in black political status offer a means to terminate racial discrimination and provide a solid guarantee against retrogressive constitutional amendments implementation of the proposed settlement hinged on popular acceptance but the rhodesian government consistently refused to submit it to a universal referendum a twenty fourmember commission headed by an eminent jurist lord pearce was therefore tasked with ascertaining public opinion on the subject in  the commission began interviewing interest groups and sampling opinions – although concern was expressed over the widespread apathy encountered according to every published finding whites were in favour of the settlement and rhodesians of mixed or asian background generally pleased while black reaction was resoundingly negative as many as thirty african chiefs and politicians voiced their opposition prompting britain to withdraw from the proposals on the grounds of the commissions report the bush waredit main article rhodesian bush war as early as  minority rule in southern rhodesia was already being challenged by a rising tide of political violence led by african nationalists such as joshua nkomo and ndabaningi sithole after their public campaigns were initially suppressed many believed that negotiation was completely incapable of meeting their aspirations petrol bombings by radicals became increasingly common with the zimbabwe review observing in  for the first time homemade petrol bombs were used by freedom fighters in salisbury against settler establishments it was officially noted that between january and september  alone  bombings were carried out in addition to  acts of attempted sabotage on communications in that same period nationalists were implicated in arson targeting  schools and  churches nkomos zimbabwe african peoples union zapu subsequently disclosed that it had formed a military wing zimbabwe peoples revolutionary army zipra and the decision to start bringing in arms and ammunition and to send young men away for sabotage training had already been made the rhodesian authorities responded by banning zapu and driving its supporters underground frustrated by their repeated failures nationalists also conducted a campaign of terror against black africans murdering those who had either identified with the colonial administration or had simply failed to demonstrate their allegiance to the cause to protect civilians emergency laws were imposed broadening the legal definition of unlawful gatherings and giving the police greater powers to crack down on agitators or subversives the death sentence was also introduced for terrorism involving explosives and arson a crisis of confidence soon resulted across zapu which was already suffering from poor morale compounded by tribal and ideological factionalism in  party dissidents rejected joshua nkomos authority and formed their own organisation the zimbabwe african national union zanu – which worked out its own strategy for impressing international opinion undermining white assurance and achieving a complete breakdown of order by august  zanu which had brutally intimidated neutrals and opponents alike was outlawed by authorities as well zanus agenda was inwardlooking leftist and panafricanist in nature ndabaningi sithole and avowed marxist robert mugabe its most prominent leaders demanded a one party zimbabwean state with majority rule and a public monopoly on land after being forced from rhodesia they continued to operate in exile creating occupation groups representing urban workers miners and peasant farmers zanu also attracted professionals students and feminists to its ranks while zapu theoretically continued to command the allegiance of most ndebele and shona activists sithole and mugabe drew their support from the mashonaland countryside after the udi zanu officials mapped an elaborate plan for the liberation of zimbabwe which called for attacks on white farmers destruction of cash crops disrupting electricity in urban areas and petrol bombings sithole and nkomo both insisted on the need for armed struggle but disagreed on the means to go about it for example zapu tended to follow soviet thinking placing an emphasis on sophisticated weaponry in the hopes of winning a conventional battle like the viet minh at dien bien phu zanu preferred to politicise populations in areas which they intended to seize neither force however had acquired basic knowledge of guerrilla warfare debate on political theory and insurgent tactics became the obsession of nationalists at this stage soldier interrogates rhodesian villagers about insurgent activity in late  this photograph became one of the most enduring images of the bush war in april  two zimbabwe african national liberation army zanla – the military wing of zanu units having received prior training at nanjing military college crossed into rhodesia from zambia they were armed with sks carbines chinese hand grenades explosives and communist pamphlets having been issued vague instructions to sabotage important installations before killing white persons indiscriminately at least five guerrillas were simply arrested before getting very far another seven hoped to destroy a pylon carrying electricity to sinoia in the northwest their faulty demolitions were uncovered by the rhodesian security forces and the men easily tracked to a nearby ranch on  april where they were shot resisting capture this event is considered to have been the first engagement of what came to be known as the bush war in rhodesia and the second chimurenga or rebellion in shona by supporters of the guerrillas the campaign proper is generally considered to have started in  with the attack on altena farm despite the minor threat already represented by the nationalist movements in the s after unsuccessful appeals to britain and the united states for military assistance robert mugabe who was based in mozambique after that countrys independence from portugal in  led zanu to seek support from the peoples republic of china and countries of the soviet bloc joshua nkomo based in zambia and also supported by the soviet union led zapu zanu and zapu together formed the patriotic front broadly zanla recruited mainly from mashonaland and manicaland provinces whilst the zipra recruited from mashonaland west midlands and matabeleland provinces of zimbabwe after the collapse of portuguese rule in mozambique in – it was no longer viable for the smith regime to sustain white minority rule indefinitely by this time even south africas vorster had come to this view while vorster was unwilling to make concessions to his own countrys blacks he concluded that white minority rule was not sustainable in a country where blacks outnumbered whites  in  there were  rhodesians of european descent and more than six million africans international business groups involved in the country eg lonrho transferred their support from the rhodesian government to black nationalist parties business leaders and politicians feted nkomo on his visits to europe zanu also attracted business supporters who saw the course that future events were likely to take funding and arms support provided by supporters particularly from the soviet union and its allies in the latter s allowed both zipra and the zanla to acquire more sophisticated weaponry thereby increasing the military pressure that the guerrillas were able to place on rhodesia until  containing the guerrillas was little more than a police action even as late as august  when rhodesian government and black nationalist leaders met at victoria falls for negotiations brokered by south africa and zambia the talks never got beyond the procedural phase rhodesian representatives made it clear they were prepared to fight an all out war to prevent majority rule however the situation changed dramatically after the end of portuguese colonial rule in mozambique in  rhodesia now found itself almost entirely surrounded by hostile states and even south africa its only real ally pressed for a settlement having let slip one chance after another of reaching an accommodation with more moderate black leaders rhodesias whites seem to have made the tragic choice of facing black nationalism over the barrel of a gun rather than the conference table the downhill road toward a race war in rhodesia is becoming increasingly slippery with blood — rand daily mail editorial may  at this point zanus alliance with frelimo the liberation front of mozambique and the porous border between mozambique and eastern rhodesia enabled largescale training and infiltration of zanuzanla fighters the governments of zambia and botswana were also emboldened sufficiently to allow resistance movement bases to be set up in their territories guerrillas began to launch operations deep inside rhodesia attacking roads railways economic targets and isolated security force positions in  rhodesian servicewoman takes aim with her browning hipower ×mm semiautomatic pistol from a  army recruitment poster the government adopted a strategic hamlets policy of the kind used in malaya and vietnam to restrict the influence of insurgents over the population of rural areas local people were forced to relocate to protected villages pvs which were strictly controlled and guarded by the government against rebel atrocities the protected villages were compared by the guerrillas to concentration camps some contemporary accounts claim that this interference in the lives of local residents induced many of them who had previously been neutral to support the guerrillas the war degenerated into rounds of increasing brutality from all three

government never accorded it diplomatic recognition the south african government placed limits on the fuel and munitions they supplied to the rhodesian military they also withdrew the personnel and equipment that they had previously provided to aid the war effort though covert military support continued in  the south african government and united states governments worked together to place pressure on smith to agree to a form of majority rule in response to the initiative of us secretary of state henry kissinger in  ian smith accepted the principle of black majority rule within two years the rhodesians now offered more concessions but those concessions focused on reaching an internal settlement with moderate black leaders were insufficient to end the war at the time some rhodesians said the still embittered history between the britishdominated rhodesia and the afrikanerdominated south africa partly led south african government to withdraw its aid to rhodesia ian smith said in his memoirs that even though many white south africans supported rhodesia south african prime minister john vorsters policy of détente with the black african states ended up with rhodesia being offered as the sacrificial lamb to buy more time for south africa other observers perceived south africas distancing itself from rhodesia as being an early move in the process that led to majority rule in south africa itself in  south africa saw settlement of the rhodesian question as vital on several fronts to cauterise the wound of the psychological blow … caused by her defeat in the angolan conflict to preempt possible cuban intervention in rhodesia and the possibility of south africa being sucked into another cold war regional conflict without the support and endorsement of the western powers — dr sue onslow south africa and udi in the latter s the militants had successfully put the economy of rhodesia under significant pressure while the numbers of guerrillas in the country were steadily increasing the government abandoned its early strategy of trying to defend the borders in favour of trying to defend key economic areas and lines of communication with south africa while the rest of the countryside became a patchwork of nogo areas late sedit by the late s rhodesias frontline forces contained about  regular troops and police – backed up by relatively strong army and police reserves its mechanised contingent consisted of light armoured cars and improvised mineprotected armoured personnel carriers complemented by eight tanks polish built tld tanks delivered in the last year of the war the rhodesian air force operated an assortment of both canberra light bombers hawker hunter fighter bombers older de havilland vampire jets as well as a somewhat antiquated but still potent helicopter arm these forces including highly trained special operations units were capable of launching devastating raids on resistance movement camps outside the country as in operation dingo in  and other similar operations nevertheless guerrilla pressure inside the country itself was steadily increasing in the latter s by – the war had become a contest between the guerrilla warfare placing ever increasing pressure on the rhodesian regime and civil population and the rhodesian governments strategy of trying to hold off the militants until external recognition for a compromise political settlement with moderate black leaders could be secured by this time the need to cut a deal was apparent to most rhodesians but not to all ian smith had dismissed his intransigent defence minister p k van der byl as early as  pk had been a hardline opponent of any form of compromise with domestic opposition or the international community since before udi it is better to fight to the last man and the last cartridge and die with some honour because what is being presented to us here is a degree of humiliation — p k van der byl in  commenting on a british peace plan van der byl eventually retired to his country estate outside cape town but there were elements in rhodesia mainly embittered former security force personnel who forcibly opposed majority rule up to and well beyond the establishment of majority rule new white immigrants continued to arrive in rhodesia right up to the eve of majority rule use of poisons against guerrillasedit main article rhodesia and weapons of mass destruction the programs primary purpose was to kill guerrillas whether they were recruits transiting to camps in mozambique or guerrillas operating inside rhodesia the cbw effort took on the guerrilla threat from three fronts first the effort aimed to eliminate guerrillas operating inside rhodesia through contaminated supplies either provided by contact men recovered from hidden caches or stolen from rural stores secondly the effort worked to contaminate water supplies along guerrilla infiltration routes into rhodesia forcing the guerrillas either to travel through arid regions to carry more water and less ammunition or travel through areas patrolled by the security forces finally the rhodesians sought to hit the guerrillas in their camps in mozambique by poisoning food beverages and medicines the chemicals most used in the rhodesian program were parathion an organophosphate insecticide and thallium a heavy metal commonly found in rodenticide the rhodesians selected for use also included vibrio cholerae causative agent of cholera and possibly bacillus anthracis causative agent of anthrax they also looked at using rickettsia prowazekii causative agent of epidemic typhus and salmonella typhi causative agent of typhoid fever and toxins—such as ricin and botulinum toxin biological agents namely vibrio cholerae causative agent of cholera had some impact on the fighting capability of zanla some former officers of the rhodesian security forces alleged that anthrax was covertly used by rhodesian psyops units during the late s but these statements are unfounded rhodesia never possessed the capability to produce anthrax spores on the scale needed for widespread dissemination use of anthracis ricin or botulinum toxin would have been confined to assassination attempts some moremerited allegations are that the south african governments topsecret chemical and biological weapons program a progenitor of project coast used rhodesia as a laboratory security situation erodes rapidlyedit the work of journalists such as lord richard cecil son of the marquess of salisbury stiffened the morale of rhodesians and their overseas supporters lord richard produced regular news reports such as the thames tv frontline rhodesia features these reports typically contrasted the incompetent insurgents with the superbly professional government troops a group

airliner hunyani air rhodesia flight rh in the kariba area by zipra fighters using a surfacetoair missile with the subsequent massacre of its survivors is widely considered to be the event that finally destroyed the rhodesians will to continue the war although militarily insignificant the loss of this aircraft and a second viscount the umniati in  demonstrated the reach of resistance

asset ground while carrying out raids into the nogo areas and into neighbouring countries while often extraordinarily successful in inflicting heavy guerrilla casualties such raids also on occasion failed to achieve their objectives in april  special forces carried out a raid on joshua nkomos residence in lusaka zambia with the stated intention of assassinating him nkomo and his family left

black soldiers though both the army and police reserves remained overwhelmingly white by  there were also  black commissioned officers in the regular army while there was never any suggestion of disloyalty among the soldiers from predominantly black units in particular within the selous scouts or the rhodesian african rifles – rar some argue that by the time of the  election many of the rar soldiers voted for robert mugabe as the result of an internal settlement signed on  march  between the rhodesian government and the moderate african nationalist parties which were not in exile and not involved in the war elections were held in april  the united african national council uanc party won a majority in this election and its leader abel muzorewa a united methodist church bishop became the countrys first black prime minister on  june  the countrys name was changed to zimbabwe rhodesia the internal settlement left control of the countrys police security forces civil service and judiciary in white hands for the moment it assured whites of about one third of the seats in parliament it was essentially a powersharing arrangement between whites and blacks which in the eyes of many particularly the insurgents did not amount to majority rule however the united states senate voted to end economic sanctions against zimbabwe rhodesia on  june while the  election was described by the rhodesian government as nonracial and democratic it did not include the main nationalist parties zanu and zapu in spite of offers from ian smith the latter parties declined to participate in an election in which their political position would be insecure and under a proposed constitution which they had played no part in drafting and which was perceived as retaining strong white minority privilege bishop muzorewas government did not receive international recognition the bush war continued unabated and sanctions were not lifted the international community refused to accept the validity of any agreement which did not incorporate the main nationalist parties the british government then led by the recently elected margaret thatcher issued invitations to all parties to attend a peace conference at lancaster house these negotiations took place in london in late  the threemonthlong conference almost failed to reach conclusion due to disagreements on land reform but resulted in the lancaster house agreement udi ended and rhodesia temporarily reverted to the status of a british colony the colony of southern rhodesia the lancaster house agreement further provided for a ceasefire which was followed by an internationally supervised general election held on february  zanu led by robert mugabe won this election some allegedwho by terrorising its political opposition including supporters of zapu through former insurgents that had not confined themselves to the designated guerrilla assembly points as stipulated by the lancaster house agreement the observers and the newly installed governor lord soames were accused of looking the other way and mugabes victory was certified nevertheless few could doubt that mugabes support within his majority shona tribal group was extremely strong the rhodesian military seriously considered mounting a coup against a perceived stolen election operation quartz to prevent zanu from taking over the country the alleged coup was to include the assassination of mugabe and coordinated assaults on guerrilla assembly points throughout the country the plan was eventually scuttled as it was obvious that mugabe enjoyed widespread support from the black majority despite voter intimidation as well as the fact that the coup would gain no external support and a conflagration which would engulf the country was seen as inevitable republic of zimbabwe edit mugabe and the victorious black nationalists were rather less concerned by operation quartz than by the possibility that there might be a mass exodus of the white community of the kind that had caused chaos in mozambique five years earlier such an exodus had been prepared for by the south african government with the agreement of the british governor of rhodesia south african troops had entered the country to secure the road approaches to the beit bridge border crossing point refugee camps had been prepared in the transvaal on the day the election results became known most white families had prepared contingency plans for flight including the packing of cars and suitcases however after a meeting with robert mugabe and the central committee of zanu pf ian smith was reassured that whites could and should stay in the new zimbabwe mugabe promised that he would abide strictly by the terms of the lancaster house agreement and that changes in zimbabwe would be made gradually and by proper legal process in a cbs news interview mugabe claimed that rhodesian whites are still in control of the economy the majority being commercial farmers mugabe however would reverse his commitment to these agreements some years later the regime began confiscating white owned farm lands this is widely blamed for leading to the deterioration of the zimbabwean economy which plagues the country today on  april  the country became independent as the republic of zimbabwe and its capital salisbury was renamed harare two years later politicsedit rhodesia this article is

of nations southern rhodesians ruled themselves from the attainment of responsible government in  its electoral register had property and education qualifications over the years various electoral arrangements made at a national and municipal level upheld these standards for example the franchise for the first southern rhodesian legislative council election in  contained the following requirement voters to be british subjects male  years of age and older able to write their address and occupation and then to fulfil the following financial requirements a ownership of a registered mining claim in southern rhodesia or b occupying immovable property worth £ or c receiving wages or salary of £ per annum in southern rhodesia six months continuous residence was also required for qualifications b and c following cecil rhodess dictum of equal rights for all civilised men there was no overt racial component to the franchise however the requirement excluded a majority of native blacks from the electorate up until the s southern rhodesia had a vibrant political life with right and left wing parties competing for power the rhodesian labour party held seats in the assembly and in municipal councils throughout the s and s from  to  the prime minister was garfield todd a liberal who did much to promote the development of the black community through investment in education housing and healthcare however the government forced todd from office because his proposed reforms were seen by many whites as too radical from  onwards white settler politics consolidated and ossified around resistance to majority rule setting the stage for udi the  constitution governed southern rhodesia and independent rhodesia up until  using the westminster parliamentary system modified by a system of separate voter rolls with differing property and education qualifications without regard to race whites ended up with the majority of assembly seats the  republican constitution established a bicameral parliament consisting of an indirectly elected senate and a directly elected house of assembly effectively reserving the majority of seats for whites the office of president had only ceremonial significance with the prime minister holding executive power the constitution of the shortlived zimbabwe rhodesia which saw a blackled government elected for the first time reserved  of the  parliamentary seats for whites the independence constitution agreed at lancaster house watered those provisions down and reserved  out of  seats for whites in the house of assembly and  out of  seats in the senate the constitution prohibited zimbabwe authorities from altering the constitution for seven years without unanimous consent and required a threequarters vote in parliament for a further three years the government amended the constitution in  to abolish the seats reserved for whites and replace the office of prime minister with an executive president in  the

throughout the period of its unilateral declaration of independence  to  rhodesia pursued a foreign policy of attempting to secure recognition as an independent country and insisting that its political system would include gradual steps to majority rule ardently anticommunist rhodesia tried to present itself to the west as a frontline state against communist expansion in africa to little avail rhodesia received little international recognition during its existence recognition only occurred after elections in  and a transition to majority rule rhodesia wished to retain its economic prosperity and also feared communist elements in the rebel forces and thus felt their policy of a gradual progression to black majority rule was justified however the international community refused to accept this rationale believing that their policies were perpetuating racism this attitude was part of the larger decolonisation context during which western powers such as the united kingdom france and belgium hastened to grant independence to their colonies in africa britain and the udiedit rhodesia was originally a british colony although decolonisation in africa had begun after world war ii it began accelerating in the early s causing britain to negotiate independence rapidly with several of its colonies during this period it adopted a foreign policy called nibmar or no independence before majority african rule mandating democratic reforms that placed governance in the hands of the majority black africans the governing white minority of rhodesia led by ian smith opposed the policy and its implications on  november  rhodesias minority white government made a unilateral declaration of independence udi from the united kingdom as it became apparent that negotiations would not lead to independence under the white regime the united kingdom government immediately brought in legislation southern rhodesia act  which formally abolished all rhodesian government institutions this move made life difficult for rhodesian citizens who wished to travel internationally as passports issued by rhodesias udi administration were not recognised as valid in january  the british issued a statement accepting as valid any passport issued before the declaration of independence and allowing sixmonth united kingdom passports to be granted when they expired – provided that the bearer declared they did not intend to aid the udi rhodesian government until late  rhodesia still recognised queen elizabeth ii as head of state even though it opposed the british government itself for hindering its goals of independence the queen however refused to accept the title queen of rhodesia eventually the smith government abandoned attempts to remain loyal to the crown and in  a majority of the electorate voted in referendum to declare rhodesia a republic they hoped that this move would facilitate recognition as an independent state by the international community but the issues of white minority control remained and hindered this effort and like the udi before it the proclamation of a republic lacked international recognition sanctionsedit after the declaration of independence and indeed for the entire duration of its existence rhodesia did not receive official recognition from any state although it did maintain diplomatic relations with south africa which was then under apartheid south africa did not recognise rhodesia to preserve its fragile positions with other nations but frequently assisted the republic portugal maintained informal relations until the carnation revolution of  the day following the declaration of independence the united nations security council passed a resolution sres calling upon all states not to accord rhodesia recognition and to refrain from any assistance the security council also imposed selective mandatory economic sanctions which were later made comprehensive malawi israel south africa portugal and iran did not comply with economic sanctions against rhodesia the us despite voting in favor of the sanctions at the unsc violated them to buy chrome ore from rhodesia kenneth kaunda president of zambia also accused western oil companies of violating the sanctions and selling oil to rhodesia international perspectiveedit rhodesias unilateral declaration of independence from the united kingdom on  november  was promptly condemned by the international community the united nations security council resolution  of  november  called upon all states not to recognise this illegal racist minority regime in southern rhodesia rhodesia campaigned for international acceptance and invoked the doctrine of nonintervention in internal affairs as justification for rebuking external criticism of its internal policies however the emerging doctrine of selfdetermination in colonial situations meant that most nations regarded rhodesia as illegitimate zambia formerly northern rhodesia took a pragmatic approach towards rhodesia kenneth kaunda heavily dependent on access through rhodesia for his nations copper ore exports fuel and power imports unofficially worked with the rhodesian government rhodesia still allowed zambia to export and import its goods through its territory to mozambique ports despite the zambian governments official policy of hostility and nonrecognition of the postudi smith administration the united states like all other western nations refused to recognise rhodesia but unlike others allowed its consulategeneral to function as a communications conduit between the american government in washington dc and the rhodesian government in salisbury when rhodesia set up an information office in washington dc oas nations loudly protested the us government responded by saying the rhodesian mission and its staff had no official diplomatic status and violated no us laws portugal pursued a middle path with rhodesia while not officially recognising rhodesia under ian smith the government of antónio salazar did permit rhodesia to establish a representative mission in lisbon and permitted rhodesian exports and imports through their colony of mozambique the portuguese government in power at that time authoritarian and ardently anticommunist gave active behindthescenes support in rhodesias fight against the guerrilla groups south africa itself under international pressure as a white minority government pursued a policy of détente with the black african states at the time these states wanted south africa to pressure ian smith to accept a faster transition to majority rule in rhodesia in return for pledges of noninterference in south africas internal affairs prime minister john vorster believing majority rule in rhodesia would lead to international acceptance for south africa used a number of tactics to pressure smith the south african government held up shipments of fuel and ammunition and pulled out friendly south african forces from rhodesia the combined loss of mozambique and the loss of support from south africa dealt critical blows to the rhodesian government diplomatic relationsedit after the udi rhodesia maintained several overseas missions including pretoria and until  lisbon in portugal and lourenço marques now maputo in mozambique since  rhodesia had had an accredited diplomatic representative with south africa heading a rhodesian diplomatic mission or de facto embassy before south africa left the commonwealth that year the then southern rhodesia had exchanged high commissioners with the then union of south africa but following the change in status the republic now had a south african diplomatic mission in salisbury during  the government of rhodesia made moves to establish a mission in lisbon separate from the british embassy with its own accredited representative having previously been able to establish its own consulate in lourenço marques capital of portuguese mozambique this prompted protests from the british government which was determined that the representative harry reedman should be a nominal member of the british ambassadors staff for their part the portuguese authorities sought a compromise whereby they would accept reedman as an independent representative but deny him diplomatic status the rhodesian information office in washington remained open following udi but its director ken towsey and his staff were deprived of their diplomatic status previously there had been a minister for rhodesian affairs operating under the aegis of the british embassy in washington as well representatives in tokyo and bonn following the countrys independence as zimbabwe towsey became chargé daffaires at the new embassy the high commission in london known as rhodesia house continued to function until it was closed in  following the decision by white rhodesians in a referendum to make the country a republic along with the british residual mission in salisbury prior to its closure the mission flew the newly adopted flag of rhodesia considered illegal by the foreign office prompting calls by labour mp willie hamilton for its removal in australia the federal government in canberra sought to close the rhodesian information centre in sydney but it remained open operating under the jurisdiction of the state of new south wales in  the labor government of gough whitlam cut post and telephone links to the centre but this was ruled illegal by the high court an office was also established in paris but this was closed down by the french government in  similarly the united states recalled its consulgeneral from salisbury and reduced consular staff but did not move to close its consulate until the declaration of a republic in  south africa however retained its accredited diplomatic representative after udi which allowed it to continue to recognise british sovereignty as well as to deal with the de facto authority of the government of ian smith the south african diplomatic mission in salisbury became the only such mission remaining in the country after  when portugal downgraded its mission to consul level having recalled its consulgeneral in salisbury in may  after zimbabwes independence the new government closed its missions in pretoria and cape town only maintaining a trade mission in johannesburg while the south african diplomatic mission in salisbury was also closed resultsedit continuing civil war and a lack of international support eventually led the rhodesian government to submit to an agreement with the uk in  this led to internationally supervised elections won by zimbabwe african national union  patriotic front and robert mugabe establishing the internationally recognised zimbabwe legacyedit in the ten years after independence around  of the white population of zimbabwe emigrated most to south africa and to other mainly white english speaking countries where they formed expatriate communities politically within zimbabwe the consolidation of power by robert mugabe continued through the s following amendments to the countrys constitution in  parliamentary seats reserved for whites were abolished and an executive presidency was created held by mugabe many expatriates and some of the whites who stayed in zimbabwe became deeply nostalgic for rhodesia these individuals are known as rhodies native whites who are more accepting of the new order are known as zimbos while as rhodesia the country was once considered the breadbasket of africa today zimbabwe is a net importer of foodstuffs with the european union and united states providing emergency food relief as humanitarian aid on a regular basis the nation has suffered profound economic and social decline in the past twenty years recently the agriculture sector has started to do well since the availability of expertise and machines has improved supported mainly by china zimbabwe also suffered from a crippling inflation rate as the reserve bank of zimbabwe had a policy of printing money to satisfy government debts which introduces excessive currency into the economic system which led to the demise of the local currency this policy caused the inflation rate to soar from  in  considered extremely high by most economic standards to an astonishing  by  monetary aid by the international monetary fund has been suspended due to the zimbabwe governments defaulting on past loans inability to stabilise its own economy and its inability to stem corruption and advance human rights in  zimbabwe abandoned its currency relying instead on foreign currencies such as the south african rand the us dollar the botswana pula the euro and the british pound among others in  elections mugabe garnered  simba makoni  and morgan tsvangirai  of the votes cast for president forcing a runoff election called by the zimbabwe electoral commission zec in the months leading to the runoff instances of extreme violence between the two major parties zanu pf and mdc led tsvangirai to withdraw from the election in february  a powersharing accord was reached which resulted in the zimbabwe government of national unity of  the accord was essentially to create the position of prime minister for tsvangirai who served in that role from  to  mugabe retained the title of president rhodesian mediaedit the main newspapers were the rhodesia herald in salisbury and the

rhodesia roʊˈdiːʒə commonly known from  onwards as the republic of rhodesia was an unrecognised state in southern africa from  to  equivalent in territorial terms to modern zimbabwe with its capital in salisbury now harare rhodesia was considered a de facto successor state to the former british colony of southern rhodesia which had achieved responsible government in  during an effort to delay an immediate transition to black majority rule rhodesias predominantly white government issued its own unilateral declaration of independence udi from the united kingdom on  november  the udi administration initially sought recognition as an autonomous realm within the commonwealth of nations but reconstituted itself as a republic in  following a brutal guerrilla war fought with two african nationalist organisations robert mugabes zanu and joshua nkomos zapu rhodesian premier ian smith conceded to biracial democracy in  however a provisional government subsequently headed by smith and his moderate colleague abel muzorewa failed in appeasing international critics or halting the bloodshed by december  muzorewa had replaced smith as prime minister and secured an agreement with the militant nationalists allowing rhodesia to briefly revert to colonial status pending elections under a universal franchise it finally achieved internationally recognised independence in april  the nation was concurrently renamed the republic of zimbabwe a wholly landlocked area rhodesia was bordered by south africa to the south bechuanaland later botswana to the southwest zambia to the

british south africa companys administration of the rhodesias and retained by the selfgoverning colony of southern rhodesia after the end of company rule in  this naming dispute dated back to october  when northern rhodesia became independent from britain and concurrently changed its name to zambia the southern rhodesian colonial government in salisbury felt that in the absence of a northern rhodesia the continued use of southern was superfluous it passed legislation to become simply rhodesia but the british government refused to approve this on the grounds that the countrys name was defined by british legislation and so could not be altered by the colonial government salisbury went on using the shortened name in an official manner nevertheless while the british government continued referring to the country as southern rhodesia this situation continued throughout the udi period the shortened name was used by many people including the british government in the house of commons the british government maintained this stance regarding the june–december  successor state of zimbabwe rhodesia and when zimbabwe rhodesia returned to colonial status from december  to april  it was as southern rhodesia southern rhodesia subsequently gained international recognition of its independence in april  when it became the republic of zimbabwe historyedit part of a series on the

gukurahundi – second congo war – zimbabwe portal v t e main article history of rhodesia backgroundedit until after world war ii the landlocked british possession of southern rhodesia was not developed as an indigenous african territory but rather as a unique state which reflected its multiracial character this situation certainly made it very different from other lands which existed under colonial rule as many europeans had arrived to make permanent homes populating the towns as traders or settling to farm the most productive soils in  faced with the decision to join the union of south africa as a fifth province or accept nearly full internal autonomy the electorate cast its vote against south african integration in view of the outcome of the referendum the territory was annexed by the united kingdom on  september  shortly after annexation on  october  the first constitution for the new colony of southern rhodesia came into force under this constitution southern rhodesia was given the right to elect its own thirtymember legislature premier and cabinet—although the british crown retained a formal veto over measures affecting natives and dominated foreign policy the rhodesian authorities provided compensation when the government nationalised enterprises such as the countrys railroads consistently refused to radically alleviate unemployment and shied from filling civil service posts with partisan appointees by colonial standards public services were wellorganised and praised for their efficiency in  southern rhodesia merged with the two other british central african states to form the federation of rhodesia and nyasaland – a loose association that placed defence and economic direction under a central government but left many domestic affairs under the control of its constituent territories as it began to appear that decolonisation was inevitable and indigenous black populations were pressing heavily for change the federation was dissolved in  numbers of white and black inhabitants before and during the central african federation year southern rhodesia northern rhodesia nyasaland total white black white black white black white black                                                                     unilateral declaration of independence edit although prepared to grant formal independence to southern rhodesia now rhodesia the british government had adopted a policy of no independence before majority rule dictating that colonies with a substantial population of european settlers would not receive independence except under conditions of majority rule rhodesian colonials initially balked at the suggestion some felt they had a right to absolute political control at least for the time being despite their relatively small numbers the authorities were also disturbed by the postindependence chaos which was plaguing other african nations at the time however once rhodesia had been introduced as a topic for discussion in international bodies extension of the status quo became a matter of concern to the world community and a serious embarrassment to the united kingdom after the federal breakup in  thenprime minister alec douglashome insisted that preconditions on independence talks hinge on what he termed the five principles – unimpeded progress to majority rule assurance against any future legislation decidedly detrimental to black interests improvement in the political status of local africans moves towards ending racial discrimination and agreement on a settlement which could be acceptable to the whole population harold wilson and his incoming labour government took an even harder line on demanding that these points be legitimately addressed before an independence agenda could be set by  growing dissatisfaction with the ongoing negotiations ousted salisburys incumbent winston field replacing him with ian smith deputy chairman of the conservative rhodesian front party smith the colonys first rhodesianborn leader soon came to personify resistance to liberals in british government and those agitating for change at home he ruled out acceptance for all five of the proposed principles as they stood implying instead that rhodesia was already legally entitled to independence—a claim which was overwhelmingly endorsed by registered voters in a referendum emboldened by the results of this referendum and the subsequent general election rhodesia now threatened to assume her own sovereignty without british consent harold wilson countered by warning that such an irregular procedure would be considered treasonous although he specifically rejected using armed force against the english kith and kin in africa wilsons refusal to consider a military option encouraged smith to proceed with his plans talks quickly broke down and final efforts in october to achieve a settlement floundered the rhodesian front remained unwilling to accept what were regarded as unacceptably drastic terms and the british would settle for nothing less – it was a formula doomed to failure ian smith signs the unilateral declaration of independence the mantle of the pioneers has fallen on our shoulders to sustain civilisation in a primitive country — ian smith  november  upon the announcement of udi on  november  following a brief but solemn consensus rhodesias leading statesmen issued their countrys unilateral declaration of independence udi this was immediately denounced as an act of rebellion against the crown in the united kingdom and wilson promised that the illegal action would be shortlived however few seemed to initially realise that rhodesia was no longer within the commonwealths direct sphere of influence and british rule was now a constitutional fiction salisbury remained virtually immune to credible metropolitan leverage on  october  the united nations general assembly had noted the repeated threats of the rhodesian authorities to declare unilaterally the independence of southern rhodesia in order to perpetuate minority rule and called upon wilson to use all means at his disposal including military force to prevent the rhodesian front from asserting independence after udi was proclaimed un officials branded ian smiths government as an illegal racist minority regime and called on member states to sever economic ties with rhodesia recommending sanctions on petroleum products and military hardware in december  these measures became mandatory extending to bar the purchase of rhodesian tobacco chrome copper asbestos sugar meat and hides britain having already adopted extensive sanctions of its own dispatched a royal navy squadron to monitor oil deliveries in the port of beira in mozambique from which a strategic pipeline ran to umtali in rhodesia the warships were to deter by force if necessary vessels reasonably believed to be carrying oil destined for southern rhodesia some nations such as switzerland and west germany which were not un members conducted business legally with rhodesia – the latter remained the smith governments largest trading partner in western europe until  when bonn joined the un japan continued to accept more rhodesian exports than any other nation and iran provided oil the portuguese government marketed rhodesian products as its own via false certificates of origin and disguised trade channels south africa openly refused to observe the un sanctions a  amendment passed in the united states permitted american firms to go on importing rhodesian chromium and nickel as normal despite the poor showing of sanctions rhodesia found it nearly impossible to obtain diplomatic recognition abroad in  the us government had made it clear that the udi would not be recognised under any circumstances even smiths ideological allies in pretoria although sympathetic failed to recognise the new country on an equal level initially the state retained its pledged loyalty to elizabeth ii of the united kingdom recognising her as queen of rhodesia when smith and deputy prime minister clifford dupont called on colonial governor sir humphrey gibbs to formally notify him of the udi gibbs condemned the udi as an act of treason after smith formally announced the udi on the radio gibbs sacked the entire cabinet on orders from whitehall however he was unable to enact any concrete actions to foster a return to legality government ministers simply ignored his notices pointing out that udi made his office obsolete even so gibbs continued to occupy his residence in salisbury until  when he vacated the premises and left rhodesia following the declaration of a republic he had effectively been superseded before then on  december  smith named dupont as officer administering the government an earlier attempt to have him named as governorgeneral of rhodesia was dismissed out of hand in september  the appellate division of the rhodesian high court ruled that ian smiths administration had become the de jure government of the country not merely the de facto one to support his decision chief justice sir hugh beadle used several statements made by hugo grotius who maintained that there was no way in which a nation could rightly claim to be governing a particular territory – if it was waging a war against that territory beadle argued that due to britains economic war against rhodesia she could not at the same point be described as governing rhodesia resulting court decisions held that the rebel government could lawfully do anything its predecessors could lawfully have done a salisbury commission chaired by prominent lawyer wr waley was appointed to study constitutional options open to the rhodesian authorities as of april  but reaching a further settlement with the british was ruled out early on waley although insistent that europeans must surrender any belief in permanent european domination also testified that majority rule was not desirable immediately talks aimed at easing the differences between rhodesia and the united kingdom were carried out aboard royal navy vessels once in december  and again in october  both efforts failed to achieve agreement although harold wilson added a sixth principle to the five he had previously enunciated it would be necessary to ensure that regardless of race there was no oppression of the majority by the minority or of any minority by the majority rhodesian resolve stiffened following a failure to reach a new settlement with more radical elements of the rhodesian front calling for a republican constitution during a twoproposition referendum held in  the proposal for severing all remaining ties to the british crown passed by a majority of  votes to  rhodesia declared itself a republic on  march  under the new constitution a president

nations to grant recognition impact of udiedit the years following rhodesias udi saw an unfolding series of economic military and political pressures placed on the country which eventually brought about majority rule a totality of these factors rather than any one the reason for introducing change in  a conference at the london school of economics which discussed rhodesias independence concluded that udi was sparked by an existing racial conflict complicated by cold war intrigues critics of udi sought to maintain that ian smith intended only to safeguard the privileges of an entrenched colonial elite at the expense of the impoverished african community according to this logic udi created a vacuum of oppression which was eventually filled by robert mugabes present dictatorship smith and his supporters continued to defend their actions however by claiming that the rhodesian majority was too inexperienced at the time to manage effectively a developed nation at large the european populations emerging attitude to udi was tense many white rhodesians had seen themselves as nothing less than fully fledged members of the british empire carrying on the same rugged values and frontier spirit of the early englishmen who had settled in  but such confidence was rudely shaken by whitehalls refusal to grant independence on their terms after  there were those who continued to claim that they were collectively upholders of principle and defenders of such values against the twin threats of communism manifested through the militant black nationalists and – ironically – the decadence of britain herself often repeated appeals to the christian heritage of their pioneer ancestors in defending the free world reflected these beliefs african parties displayed initial horror at smiths declaration with one zanu official stating for all those who cherish freedom and a meaningful life udi has set a collision course which cannot be altered  november  has marked the turning point of the struggle for freedom in that land from a constitutional and political one to primarily a military struggle it would however be several years before even the most radical nationalists chose to develop a coherent strategy revolving around armed resistance preferring instead to create opportunities for external intervention because rhodesian exports were generally competitive and had previously been entitled to preferential treatment on the british market the former colony did not recognise the need for escalating the pace of diversification before independence following the udi however rhodesia began to demonstrate that she had the potential to develop a greater degree of economic selfsufficiency after the rhodesian front began introducing incentives accorded to domestic production industrial output expanded dramatically a rigid system of countermeasures enacted to combat sanctions succeeded in blunting their impact for at least a decade over the next nine years rhodesian companies spiting the freezing of their assets and blocking of overseas accounts also perfected cunning techniques of sanctions evasion through both local and foreign subsidiaries which operated on a clandestine trade network from  until  there was virtually no further dialogue between rhodesia and the uk this altered immediately after the ascension of edward heath who reopened negotiations smith remained optimistic that heath would do his utmost to remedy anglorhodesian relations although disappointed that he continued to adhere publicly to the original five principles proposed by alec douglashome now foreign secretary in november  douglashome renewed contacts with salisbury and announced a proposed agreement which would be satisfactory to both sides – it recognised rhodesias  constitution as the legal frame of government while agreeing that gradual legislative representation was an acceptable formula for unhindered advance to majority rule nevertheless the new settlement if approved would also implement an immediate improvement in black political status offer a means to terminate racial discrimination and provide a solid guarantee against retrogressive constitutional amendments implementation of the proposed settlement hinged on popular acceptance but the rhodesian government consistently refused to submit it to a universal referendum a twenty fourmember commission headed by an eminent jurist lord pearce was therefore tasked with ascertaining public opinion on the subject in  the commission began interviewing interest groups and sampling opinions – although concern was expressed over the widespread apathy encountered according to every published finding whites were in favour of the settlement and rhodesians of mixed or asian background generally pleased while black reaction was resoundingly negative as many as thirty african chiefs and politicians voiced their opposition prompting britain to withdraw from

fighters in salisbury against settler establishments it was officially noted that between january and september  alone  bombings were carried out in addition to  acts of attempted sabotage on

military wing zimbabwe peoples revolutionary army zipra and the decision to start bringing in arms and ammunition and to send young men away for sabotage training had already been made the rhodesian authorities responded by banning zapu and driving its supporters underground frustrated by their repeated failures nationalists also conducted a campaign of terror against black africans murdering those who had either identified with the colonial administration or had simply failed to demonstrate their allegiance to the cause to protect civilians emergency laws were imposed broadening the legal definition of unlawful gatherings and giving the police greater powers to crack down on agitators or subversives the death sentence was also introduced for terrorism involving explosives and arson a crisis of confidence soon resulted across zapu which was already suffering from poor morale compounded by tribal and ideological factionalism in  party dissidents rejected joshua nkomos authority and formed their own organisation the zimbabwe african national union zanu – which worked out its own strategy for impressing international opinion undermining white assurance and achieving a complete breakdown of order by august  zanu which had brutally intimidated neutrals and opponents alike was outlawed by authorities as well zanus agenda was inwardlooking leftist and panafricanist in nature ndabaningi sithole and avowed marxist robert mugabe its most prominent leaders demanded a one party zimbabwean state with majority rule and a public monopoly on land after being forced from rhodesia they continued to operate in exile creating occupation groups representing urban workers miners and peasant farmers zanu also attracted professionals students and feminists to its ranks while zapu theoretically continued to command the allegiance of most ndebele and shona activists sithole and mugabe drew their support from the mashonaland countryside after the udi zanu officials mapped an elaborate plan for the liberation of zimbabwe which called for attacks on white farmers destruction of cash crops disrupting electricity in urban areas and petrol bombings sithole and nkomo both insisted on the need for armed struggle but disagreed on the means to go about it for example zapu tended to follow soviet thinking placing an emphasis on sophisticated weaponry in the hopes of winning a conventional battle like the viet minh at dien bien phu zanu preferred to politicise populations in areas which they intended to seize neither force however had acquired basic knowledge of

nkomo on his visits to europe zanu also attracted business supporters who saw the course that future events were likely to take funding and arms support provided by supporters particularly from the soviet union and its allies in the latter s allowed both zipra and the zanla to acquire more sophisticated weaponry thereby increasing the military pressure that the guerrillas were able to place on rhodesia until  containing the guerrillas was little more than a police action even as late as august  when rhodesian government and black nationalist leaders met at victoria falls for negotiations brokered by south africa and zambia the talks never got beyond the procedural phase rhodesian representatives made it clear they were prepared to fight an all out war to prevent majority rule however the situation changed dramatically after the end of portuguese colonial rule in mozambique in  rhodesia now found itself almost entirely surrounded by hostile states and even south africa its only

government to withdraw its aid to rhodesia ian smith said in his memoirs that even though many white south africans supported rhodesia south african prime minister john vorsters policy of détente with the black african states ended up with rhodesia being offered as the sacrificial lamb to buy more time for south africa other observers perceived south africas distancing itself from rhodesia as being

mozambique or guerrillas operating inside rhodesia the cbw effort took on the guerrilla threat from three fronts first the effort aimed to eliminate guerrillas operating inside rhodesia through contaminated supplies either provided by contact men recovered from hidden caches or stolen from rural stores secondly the effort worked to contaminate water supplies along guerrilla infiltration routes into rhodesia forcing the guerrillas either to travel through arid regions to carry more water and less ammunition or travel through areas patrolled by the security forces finally the rhodesians sought to hit the guerrillas in their camps in mozambique by poisoning food beverages and medicines the chemicals most used in the rhodesian program were parathion an organophosphate insecticide and thallium a heavy metal commonly found in rodenticide the rhodesians selected for use also included vibrio cholerae causative agent of cholera and possibly bacillus anthracis causative agent of anthrax they also looked at using rickettsia prowazekii causative agent of epidemic typhus and salmonella typhi causative agent of typhoid fever and toxins—such as ricin and botulinum toxin biological agents namely vibrio cholerae causative agent of cholera had some impact on the fighting capability of zanla some former officers of the rhodesian security forces alleged that anthrax was covertly used by rhodesian psyops units during the late s but these statements are unfounded rhodesia never possessed the capability to produce anthrax spores on the scale needed for widespread dissemination use of anthracis ricin or botulinum toxin would have been confined to assassination attempts some moremerited allegations are that the south african governments topsecret chemical and

settlement left control of the countrys police security forces civil service and judiciary in white hands for the moment it assured whites of about one third of the seats in parliament it was essentially a powersharing arrangement between whites and blacks which in the eyes of many particularly the insurgents did not amount to majority rule however the united states senate voted to end economic sanctions against zimbabwe rhodesia on  june while the  election was described by the rhodesian government as nonracial and democratic it did not include the main nationalist parties zanu and zapu in spite of offers from ian smith the latter parties declined to participate in an election in which their political position would be insecure and under a proposed constitution which they had played no part in drafting and which was perceived as retaining strong white minority privilege bishop muzorewas government did not receive international recognition the bush war continued unabated and sanctions were not lifted the international community refused to accept the validity of any agreement which did not incorporate the main nationalist parties the british government then led by the recently elected margaret thatcher issued invitations to all parties to attend a peace conference at lancaster house these negotiations took place in london in late  the threemonthlong conference almost failed to reach conclusion due to disagreements on land reform but resulted in the lancaster house agreement udi ended and rhodesia temporarily reverted to the status of a british colony the colony of southern rhodesia the lancaster house agreement further provided for a ceasefire which was followed by an internationally supervised general election held on february  zanu led by robert mugabe won this election some allegedwho by terrorising its political opposition including supporters of zapu through former insurgents that had not confined themselves to the designated guerrilla assembly points as stipulated by the lancaster house agreement the observers and the newly installed governor lord soames were accused of looking the other way and mugabes victory was certified nevertheless few could doubt that mugabes support within his majority shona tribal group was extremely strong the rhodesian military seriously considered mounting a coup against a perceived stolen election operation quartz to prevent zanu from taking over the country the alleged coup was to include the assassination of mugabe and coordinated assaults on guerrilla assembly points throughout the country the plan was eventually scuttled as it was obvious that mugabe enjoyed widespread support from the black majority despite voter intimidation as well as the fact that the coup would gain no external support and a conflagration which would engulf the country was seen as inevitable republic of zimbabwe edit mugabe and the victorious black nationalists were rather less concerned by operation quartz than by the possibility that there might be a mass exodus of the white community of the kind that had caused chaos in mozambique five years earlier such an exodus had been prepared for by the south african government with the agreement of the british governor of rhodesia south african troops had entered the country to secure the road approaches to the beit bridge border crossing point refugee camps had been prepared in the transvaal on the day the election results became known most white families had prepared contingency plans for flight including the packing of cars and suitcases however after a meeting with robert mugabe and the central committee of zanu pf ian smith was reassured that whites could and should stay in the new zimbabwe mugabe promised that he would abide strictly by the terms of the lancaster house agreement and that changes in zimbabwe would be made gradually and by proper legal process in a cbs news interview mugabe claimed that rhodesian whites are still in control of the economy the majority being commercial farmers mugabe however would reverse his commitment to these agreements some years later the regime began confiscating white

to fulfil the following financial requirements a ownership of a registered mining claim in southern rhodesia or b occupying immovable property worth £ or c receiving wages or salary of £ per annum in southern rhodesia six months continuous residence was also required for qualifications b and c following cecil rhodess dictum of equal rights for all civilised men there was no overt racial component to the franchise however the requirement excluded a majority of native blacks from the electorate up until the s southern rhodesia had a vibrant political life with right and left wing parties competing for power the rhodesian labour party held seats in the assembly and in municipal councils throughout the s and s from  to  the prime minister was garfield todd a liberal who did much to promote the development of the black community through investment in education housing and healthcare however the government forced todd from office because his proposed reforms were seen by many whites as too radical from  onwards white settler politics consolidated and ossified around resistance to majority rule setting the stage for udi the  constitution governed southern rhodesia and independent rhodesia up until  using the westminster parliamentary system modified by a system of separate voter rolls with differing property and education qualifications without regard to race whites ended up with the majority of assembly seats the  republican constitution established a bicameral parliament consisting of an indirectly elected senate and a directly elected house of assembly

challenged and removed february  learn how and when to remove this template message throughout the period of its unilateral declaration of independence  to  rhodesia pursued a foreign policy of attempting to secure recognition as an independent country and insisting that its political system would include gradual steps to majority rule ardently anticommunist rhodesia tried to present itself to the west as a frontline state against communist expansion in africa to little avail rhodesia received little international recognition during its existence recognition only occurred after elections in  and a transition to majority rule rhodesia wished to retain its economic prosperity and also feared communist elements in the rebel forces and thus felt their policy of a gradual progression to black majority rule was justified however the international community refused to accept this rationale believing that their policies were perpetuating racism this attitude was part of the larger decolonisation context during which western powers such as the united kingdom france and belgium hastened to grant independence to their colonies in africa britain and the udiedit rhodesia was originally a british colony although decolonisation in africa had begun after world war ii it began accelerating in the early s causing britain to negotiate independence rapidly with several of its colonies during this period it adopted a foreign policy called nibmar or no independence before majority african rule mandating democratic reforms that placed governance in the hands of the majority black africans the governing white minority of rhodesia led by ian smith opposed the policy and its implications on  november  rhodesias minority white government made a unilateral declaration of independence udi from the united kingdom as it became apparent that negotiations would not lead to independence under the white regime the united kingdom government immediately brought in legislation southern rhodesia act  which formally abolished all rhodesian government institutions this move made life difficult for rhodesian citizens who wished to travel internationally as passports issued by rhodesias udi administration were not recognised as valid in january  the british issued a statement accepting as valid any passport issued before the declaration of independence and allowing sixmonth united kingdom passports to be granted when they expired – provided that the bearer declared they did not intend to aid the udi rhodesian government until late  rhodesia still recognised queen elizabeth ii as head of state even though it opposed the british government itself for hindering its goals of independence the queen however refused to accept the title queen of rhodesia eventually the smith government abandoned attempts to remain loyal to the crown and in  a majority of the electorate voted in referendum to declare rhodesia a republic they hoped that this move would facilitate recognition as an independent state by the international community but the issues of white minority control remained and hindered this effort and like the udi before it the proclamation of a republic lacked international recognition sanctionsedit after the declaration of independence and indeed for the entire duration of its existence rhodesia did not receive official recognition from any state although it did maintain diplomatic relations with south africa which was then under apartheid south africa did not recognise rhodesia to preserve its fragile positions with other nations but frequently assisted the republic portugal maintained informal relations until the carnation revolution of  the day following the declaration of independence the united nations security council passed a resolution sres calling upon all states not to accord rhodesia recognition and to refrain from any assistance the security council also imposed selective mandatory economic sanctions which were later made comprehensive malawi israel south africa portugal and iran did not comply with economic sanctions against rhodesia the us despite voting in favor of the sanctions at the unsc violated them to buy chrome ore from rhodesia kenneth kaunda president of zambia also accused western oil companies of violating the sanctions and selling oil to rhodesia international perspectiveedit rhodesias unilateral declaration of independence from the united kingdom on  november  was promptly condemned by the international community the united nations security council resolution  of  november  called upon all states not to recognise this illegal racist minority regime in southern rhodesia rhodesia campaigned for international acceptance and invoked the doctrine of nonintervention in internal affairs as justification for rebuking external criticism of its internal policies however the emerging doctrine of selfdetermination in colonial situations meant that most nations regarded rhodesia as illegitimate zambia formerly northern rhodesia took a pragmatic approach towards rhodesia kenneth kaunda heavily dependent on access through rhodesia for his nations copper ore exports fuel and power imports unofficially worked with the rhodesian government rhodesia still allowed zambia to export and import its goods through its territory to mozambique ports despite the zambian governments official policy of hostility and nonrecognition of the postudi smith administration the united states like all other western nations refused to recognise rhodesia but unlike others allowed its consulategeneral to function as a communications conduit between the american government in washington dc and the rhodesian government in salisbury when rhodesia set up an information office in washington dc oas nations loudly protested the us government responded by saying the rhodesian mission and its staff had no official diplomatic status and violated no us laws portugal pursued a middle path with rhodesia while not officially recognising rhodesia under ian smith the government of antónio salazar did permit rhodesia to establish a representative mission in lisbon and permitted rhodesian exports and imports through their colony of mozambique the portuguese government in power at that time authoritarian and ardently anticommunist gave active behindthescenes support in rhodesias fight against the guerrilla groups south africa itself under international pressure as a white minority government pursued a policy of détente with the black african states at the time these states wanted south africa to pressure ian smith to accept a faster transition to majority rule in rhodesia in return for pledges of noninterference in south africas internal affairs prime minister john vorster believing majority rule in rhodesia would lead to international acceptance for south africa used a number of tactics to pressure smith the south african government held up shipments of fuel and ammunition and pulled out friendly south african forces from rhodesia the combined loss of mozambique and the loss of support from south africa dealt critical blows to the rhodesian government diplomatic relationsedit after the udi rhodesia maintained several overseas missions including pretoria and until  lisbon in portugal and lourenço marques now maputo in mozambique since  rhodesia had had an accredited diplomatic representative with south africa heading a rhodesian diplomatic mission or de facto embassy before south africa left the commonwealth that year the then southern rhodesia had exchanged high commissioners with the then union of south africa but following the change in status the republic now had a south african diplomatic mission in salisbury during  the government of rhodesia made moves to establish a mission in lisbon separate from the british embassy with its own accredited representative having previously been able to establish its own consulate in lourenço marques capital of portuguese mozambique this prompted protests from the british government which was determined that the representative harry reedman should be a nominal member of the british ambassadors staff for their part the portuguese authorities sought a compromise whereby they would accept reedman as an independent representative but deny him diplomatic status the rhodesian information office in washington remained open following udi but its director ken towsey and his staff were deprived of their diplomatic status previously there had been a minister for rhodesian affairs operating under the aegis of the british embassy in washington as well representatives in tokyo and bonn following the countrys independence as zimbabwe towsey became chargé daffaires at the new embassy the high commission in london known as rhodesia house continued to function until it was closed in  following the decision by white rhodesians in a referendum to make the country a republic along with the british residual mission in salisbury prior to its closure the mission flew the newly adopted flag of rhodesia considered illegal by the foreign office prompting calls by labour mp willie hamilton for its removal in australia the federal government in canberra sought to close the rhodesian information centre in sydney but it remained open operating under the jurisdiction of the state of new south wales in  the labor government of gough whitlam cut post and telephone links to the centre but this was ruled illegal by the high court an office was also established in paris but this was closed down by the french government in  similarly the united states recalled its consulgeneral from salisbury and reduced consular staff but did not move to close its consulate until the declaration of a republic in  south africa however retained its accredited diplomatic representative after udi which allowed it to continue to recognise british sovereignty as well as to deal with the de facto authority of the government of ian smith the south african diplomatic mission in salisbury became the only such mission remaining in the country after  when portugal downgraded its mission to consul level having recalled its consulgeneral in salisbury in may  after zimbabwes independence the new government closed its missions in pretoria and cape town only maintaining a trade mission in johannesburg while the south african diplomatic mission in salisbury was also closed resultsedit continuing civil war and a lack of international support eventually led the rhodesian government to submit to an agreement with the uk in  this led to internationally supervised elections won by zimbabwe african national union  patriotic front and robert mugabe establishing the internationally recognised zimbabwe legacyedit in the ten years after independence around  of the white population of zimbabwe emigrated most to south africa and to other mainly white english speaking countries where they formed expatriate communities politically within zimbabwe the consolidation of power by robert mugabe continued through the s following amendments to the countrys constitution in  parliamentary seats reserved for whites were abolished and an executive presidency was created held by mugabe many expatriates and some of the whites who stayed in zimbabwe became deeply nostalgic for rhodesia these individuals are known as rhodies native whites who are more accepting of the new order are known as zimbos while as rhodesia the country was once considered the breadbasket of africa today zimbabwe is a net importer of foodstuffs with the european union and united states providing emergency food relief as humanitarian aid on a regular basis the nation has suffered profound economic and social decline in the past twenty years recently the agriculture sector has started to do well since the availability of expertise and machines has improved supported mainly by china zimbabwe also suffered from a crippling inflation rate as the reserve bank of zimbabwe had a policy of printing money to satisfy government debts which introduces excessive currency into the economic system which led to the demise of the local currency this policy caused the inflation rate to soar from  in  considered extremely high by most economic standards to an astonishing  by  monetary aid by the international monetary fund has been suspended due to the zimbabwe governments defaulting on past loans inability to stabilise its own economy and its inability to stem corruption and advance human rights in  zimbabwe abandoned its currency relying instead on foreign currencies such as the south african rand the us dollar the botswana pula the euro and the british pound among others in  elections mugabe garnered  simba makoni  and morgan tsvangirai  of the votes cast for president forcing a runoff election called by the zimbabwe electoral commission zec in the months leading to the runoff instances of extreme violence between the two major parties zanu pf and mdc led tsvangirai to withdraw from the election in february  a powersharing accord was reached which resulted in the zimbabwe government of national unity of  the accord was essentially to create the position of prime minister for tsvangirai who served in that role from  to  mugabe retained the

unrecognised state in southern africa from  to  equivalent in territorial terms to modern zimbabwe with its capital in salisbury now harare rhodesia was considered a de facto successor state to the former british colony of southern rhodesia which had achieved responsible government in  during an effort to delay an immediate transition to black majority rule rhodesias predominantly white government issued its own unilateral declaration of independence udi from the united kingdom on  november  the udi administration initially sought recognition as an autonomous realm within the commonwealth of nations but reconstituted itself as a republic in  following a brutal guerrilla war fought with two african nationalist organisations robert mugabes zanu and joshua nkomos zapu rhodesian premier ian smith conceded to biracial democracy in  however a provisional government subsequently headed by smith and his moderate colleague abel muzorewa failed in appeasing international critics or halting the bloodshed by december  muzorewa had replaced smith as prime minister and secured an agreement with the militant nationalists allowing rhodesia to briefly revert to colonial status pending elections under a universal franchise it finally achieved internationally recognised independence in april  the nation was concurrently renamed the republic of zimbabwe a wholly landlocked area rhodesia was bordered by south africa to the south bechuanaland later botswana to the southwest zambia to the northwest and mozambique a portuguese province until  to the east the

selfgoverning colony of southern rhodesia after the end of company rule in  this naming dispute dated back to october  when northern rhodesia became independent from britain and concurrently changed its name to zambia the southern rhodesian colonial government in salisbury felt that in the absence of a northern rhodesia the continued use of southern was superfluous it passed legislation to become simply rhodesia but the british government refused to approve this on the grounds that the countrys name was defined by british legislation and so could not be altered by the colonial government salisbury went on using the shortened name in an official manner nevertheless while the british government continued referring to the country as southern rhodesia this situation continued throughout the udi period the shortened name was used by many people including the british government in the house of commons the british government maintained this stance regarding the june–december  successor state of zimbabwe rhodesia and when zimbabwe rhodesia returned to colonial status from december  to april  it was as southern rhodesia southern rhodesia subsequently gained international recognition

backgroundedit until after world war ii the landlocked british possession of southern rhodesia was not developed as an indigenous african territory but rather as a unique state which reflected its multiracial character this situation certainly made it very different from other lands which existed under colonial rule as many europeans had arrived to make permanent homes populating the towns as traders or settling to farm the most productive soils in  faced with the decision to join the union of south africa as a fifth province or accept nearly full internal autonomy the electorate cast its vote against south african integration in view of the outcome of the referendum the territory was annexed by the united kingdom on  september  shortly after annexation on  october  the first constitution for the new colony of southern rhodesia came into force under this constitution southern rhodesia was given the right to elect its own thirtymember legislature premier and cabinet—although the british crown retained a formal veto over measures affecting natives and dominated foreign policy the rhodesian authorities provided compensation when the government nationalised enterprises such as the countrys railroads consistently refused to radically alleviate unemployment and shied from filling civil service posts with partisan appointees by colonial standards public services were wellorganised and praised for their efficiency in  southern rhodesia merged with the two other british central african states to form the federation of rhodesia and nyasaland – a loose association that placed defence and economic direction under a central government but left many domestic affairs under the control of its constituent territories as it began to appear that decolonisation was inevitable and indigenous black populations were pressing heavily for change the federation was dissolved in  numbers of white and black inhabitants before and during the central african federation year southern rhodesia northern rhodesia nyasaland total white black white black white black white black                                                                     unilateral declaration of independence edit although prepared to grant formal independence to southern rhodesia now rhodesia the british government had adopted a policy of no independence before majority rule dictating that colonies with a substantial population of european settlers would not receive independence except under conditions of majority rule rhodesian colonials initially balked at the suggestion some felt they had a right to absolute political control at least for the time being despite their relatively small numbers the authorities were also disturbed by the postindependence chaos which was plaguing other african nations at the time however once rhodesia had been introduced as a topic for discussion in international bodies extension of the status quo became a matter of concern to the world community and a serious embarrassment to the united kingdom after the federal breakup in  thenprime minister alec douglashome insisted that preconditions on independence talks hinge on what he termed the five principles – unimpeded progress to majority rule assurance against any future legislation decidedly detrimental to black interests improvement in the political status of local africans moves towards ending racial discrimination and agreement on a settlement which could be acceptable to the whole population harold wilson and his incoming labour government took an even harder line on demanding that these points be legitimately addressed before an independence agenda could be set by  growing dissatisfaction with the ongoing negotiations ousted salisburys incumbent winston field replacing him with ian smith deputy chairman of the conservative rhodesian front party smith the colonys first rhodesianborn leader soon came to personify resistance to liberals in british government and those agitating for change at home he ruled out acceptance for all five of the proposed principles as they stood implying instead that rhodesia was already legally entitled to independence—a claim which was overwhelmingly endorsed by registered voters in a referendum emboldened by the results of this referendum and the subsequent general election rhodesia now threatened to assume her own sovereignty without british consent harold wilson countered by warning that such an irregular procedure would be considered treasonous although he specifically rejected using armed force against the english kith and kin in africa wilsons refusal to consider a military option encouraged smith to proceed with his plans talks quickly broke down and final efforts in october to achieve a settlement floundered the rhodesian front remained unwilling to accept what were regarded as unacceptably drastic terms and the british would settle for nothing less – it was a formula doomed to failure ian smith signs the unilateral declaration of independence the mantle of the pioneers has fallen on our shoulders to sustain civilisation in a primitive country — ian smith  november  upon the announcement of udi on  november  following a brief but solemn consensus rhodesias leading statesmen issued their countrys unilateral declaration of independence udi this was immediately denounced as an act of rebellion against the crown in the united kingdom and wilson promised that the illegal action would be shortlived however few seemed to initially realise that rhodesia was no longer within the commonwealths direct sphere of influence and british rule was now a constitutional fiction salisbury remained virtually immune to credible metropolitan leverage on  october  the united nations general assembly had noted the repeated threats of the rhodesian authorities to declare unilaterally the independence of southern rhodesia in order to perpetuate minority rule and called upon wilson to use all means at his disposal including military force to prevent the rhodesian front from asserting independence after udi was proclaimed un officials branded ian smiths government as an illegal racist minority regime and called on member states to sever economic ties with rhodesia recommending sanctions on petroleum products and military hardware in december  these measures became mandatory extending to bar the purchase of rhodesian tobacco chrome copper asbestos sugar meat and hides britain having already adopted extensive sanctions of its own dispatched a royal navy squadron to monitor oil deliveries in the port of beira in mozambique from which a strategic pipeline ran to umtali in rhodesia the warships were to deter by force if necessary vessels reasonably believed to be carrying oil destined for southern rhodesia some nations such as switzerland and west germany which were not un members conducted business legally with rhodesia – the latter remained the smith governments largest trading partner in western europe until  when bonn joined the un japan continued to accept more rhodesian exports than any other nation and iran provided oil the portuguese government marketed rhodesian products as its own via false certificates of origin and disguised trade channels south africa openly refused to observe the un sanctions a  amendment passed in the united states permitted american firms to go on importing rhodesian chromium and nickel as normal despite the poor showing of sanctions rhodesia found it nearly impossible to obtain diplomatic recognition abroad in  the us government had made it clear that the udi would not be recognised under any circumstances even smiths ideological allies in pretoria although sympathetic failed to recognise the new country on an equal level initially the state retained its pledged loyalty to elizabeth ii of the united kingdom recognising her as queen of rhodesia when smith and deputy prime minister clifford dupont called on colonial governor sir humphrey gibbs to formally notify him of the udi gibbs condemned the udi as an act of treason after smith formally announced the udi on the radio gibbs sacked the entire cabinet on orders from whitehall however he was unable to enact any concrete actions to foster a return to legality government ministers simply ignored his notices pointing out that udi made his office obsolete even so gibbs continued to occupy his residence in salisbury until  when he vacated the premises and left rhodesia following the declaration of a republic he had effectively been superseded before then on  december  smith named dupont as officer administering the government an earlier attempt to have him named as governorgeneral of rhodesia was dismissed out of hand in september  the appellate division of the rhodesian high court ruled that ian smiths administration had become the de jure government of the country not merely the de facto one to support his decision chief justice sir hugh beadle used several statements made by hugo grotius who maintained that there was no way in which a nation could rightly claim to be governing a particular territory – if it was waging a war against that territory beadle argued that due to britains economic war against rhodesia she could not at the same point be described as governing rhodesia resulting court decisions held that the rebel government could lawfully do anything its predecessors could lawfully have done a salisbury commission chaired by prominent lawyer wr waley was appointed to study constitutional options open to the rhodesian authorities as of april  but reaching a further settlement with the british was ruled out early on waley although insistent that europeans must surrender any belief in permanent european domination also testified that majority rule was not desirable immediately talks aimed at easing the differences between rhodesia and the united kingdom were carried out aboard royal navy vessels once in december  and again in october  both efforts failed to achieve agreement although harold wilson added a sixth principle to the five he had previously enunciated it would be necessary to ensure that regardless of race there was no oppression of the majority by the minority or of any minority by the majority rhodesian resolve stiffened following a failure to reach a new settlement with more radical elements of the rhodesian front calling for a republican constitution during a twoproposition referendum held in  the proposal for severing all remaining ties to the british crown passed by a majority of  votes to  rhodesia declared itself a republic on  march  under the new constitution a president served as ceremonial head of state with the prime minister nominally reporting to him some in rhodesian government had hoped in vain that the declaration of a republic would finally prompt other nations to grant recognition impact of udiedit the years following rhodesias udi saw an unfolding series of economic military and political pressures placed on the country which eventually brought about majority rule a totality of these factors rather than any one the reason for introducing change in  a conference at the london school of economics which discussed rhodesias independence concluded that udi was sparked by an existing racial conflict complicated by cold war intrigues critics of udi sought to maintain that ian smith intended only to safeguard the privileges of an entrenched colonial elite at the expense of the impoverished african community according to this logic udi created a vacuum of oppression which was eventually filled by robert mugabes present dictatorship smith and his supporters continued to defend their actions however by claiming that the rhodesian majority was too inexperienced at the time to manage effectively a developed nation at large the european populations emerging attitude to udi was tense many white rhodesians had seen themselves as nothing less than fully fledged members of the british empire carrying on the same rugged values and frontier spirit of the early englishmen who had settled in  but such confidence was rudely shaken by whitehalls refusal to grant independence on their terms after  there were those who continued to claim that they were collectively upholders of principle and defenders of such values against the twin threats of communism manifested through the militant black nationalists and – ironically – the decadence of britain herself often repeated appeals to the christian heritage of their pioneer ancestors in defending the free world reflected these beliefs african parties displayed initial horror at smiths declaration with one zanu official stating for all those who cherish freedom and a meaningful life udi has set a collision course which cannot be altered  november  has marked the turning point of the struggle for freedom in that land from a constitutional and political one to primarily a military struggle it would however be several years before even the most radical nationalists chose to develop a coherent strategy revolving around armed resistance preferring instead to create opportunities for external intervention because rhodesian exports were generally competitive and had previously been entitled to preferential treatment on the british market the former colony did not recognise the need for escalating the pace of diversification before independence following the udi however rhodesia began to demonstrate that she had the potential to develop a greater degree of economic selfsufficiency after the rhodesian front began introducing incentives accorded to domestic production industrial output expanded dramatically a rigid system of countermeasures enacted to combat sanctions succeeded in blunting their impact for at least a decade over the next nine years rhodesian companies spiting the freezing of their assets and blocking of overseas accounts also perfected cunning techniques of sanctions evasion through both local and foreign subsidiaries which operated on a clandestine trade network from  until  there was virtually no further dialogue between rhodesia and the uk this altered immediately after the ascension of edward heath who reopened negotiations smith remained optimistic that heath would do his utmost to remedy anglorhodesian relations although disappointed that he continued to adhere publicly to the original five principles proposed by alec douglashome now foreign secretary in november  douglashome renewed contacts with salisbury and announced a proposed agreement which would be satisfactory to both sides – it recognised rhodesias  constitution as the legal frame of government while agreeing that gradual legislative representation was an acceptable formula for unhindered advance to majority rule nevertheless the new settlement if approved would also implement an immediate improvement in black political status offer a means to terminate racial discrimination and provide a solid guarantee against retrogressive constitutional amendments implementation of the proposed settlement hinged on popular acceptance but the rhodesian government consistently refused to submit it to a universal referendum a twenty fourmember commission headed by an eminent jurist lord pearce was therefore tasked with ascertaining public opinion on the subject in  the commission began interviewing interest groups and sampling opinions – although concern was expressed over the widespread apathy encountered according to every published finding whites were in favour of the settlement and rhodesians of mixed or asian background generally pleased while black reaction was resoundingly negative as many as thirty african chiefs and politicians voiced their opposition prompting britain to withdraw from the proposals on the grounds of the commissions report the bush waredit main article rhodesian bush war as early as  minority rule in southern rhodesia was already being challenged by a rising tide of political violence led by african nationalists such as joshua

became increasingly common with the zimbabwe review observing in  for the first time homemade petrol bombs were used by freedom fighters in salisbury against settler establishments it was officially noted that between january and september  alone  bombings were carried out in addition to  acts of attempted sabotage on communications in that same period nationalists were implicated in arson targeting  schools and  churches nkomos zimbabwe african peoples union zapu subsequently disclosed that it had formed a military wing zimbabwe peoples revolutionary army zipra and the decision to start bringing in arms and ammunition and to send young men away for sabotage training had already been made the rhodesian authorities responded by banning zapu and driving its supporters underground frustrated by their repeated failures nationalists also conducted a campaign of terror against black africans murdering those who had either identified with the colonial administration or had simply failed to demonstrate their allegiance to the cause to protect civilians emergency laws were imposed broadening the legal definition of unlawful gatherings and giving the police greater powers to crack down on agitators or subversives the death sentence was also introduced for terrorism involving explosives and arson a crisis of confidence soon resulted across zapu which was already suffering from poor morale compounded by tribal and ideological factionalism in  party dissidents rejected joshua nkomos authority and formed their own organisation the zimbabwe african national union zanu – which worked out its own strategy for impressing international opinion undermining white assurance and achieving a complete breakdown of order by august  zanu which had brutally intimidated neutrals and opponents alike was outlawed by authorities as well zanus agenda was inwardlooking leftist and panafricanist in nature ndabaningi sithole and avowed marxist robert mugabe its most prominent leaders demanded a one party zimbabwean state with majority rule and a public monopoly on land after being forced from rhodesia they continued to operate in exile creating occupation groups representing urban workers miners and peasant farmers zanu also attracted professionals students and feminists to its ranks while zapu theoretically continued to command the allegiance of most ndebele and shona activists sithole and mugabe drew their support from the mashonaland countryside after the udi zanu officials mapped an elaborate plan for the liberation of zimbabwe which called for attacks on white farmers destruction of cash crops disrupting electricity in urban areas and petrol bombings sithole and nkomo both insisted on the need for armed struggle but disagreed on the means to go about it for example zapu tended to follow soviet thinking placing an emphasis on sophisticated weaponry in the hopes of winning a conventional battle like the viet minh at dien bien phu zanu

who saw the course that future events were likely to take funding and arms support provided by supporters particularly from the soviet union and its allies in the latter s allowed both zipra and the zanla to acquire more sophisticated weaponry thereby increasing the military pressure that the guerrillas were able to place on rhodesia until  containing the guerrillas was little more than a police action even as late as august  when rhodesian government and black nationalist leaders met at victoria falls for negotiations brokered by south africa and zambia the talks never got beyond the procedural phase rhodesian representatives made it clear they were prepared to fight an all out war to prevent majority rule however the situation changed dramatically after the end of portuguese colonial rule in mozambique in  rhodesia now found itself almost entirely surrounded by hostile states and even south africa its only real ally pressed for a settlement having let slip one chance

pressure on smith to agree to a form of majority rule in response to the initiative of us secretary of state henry kissinger in  ian smith accepted the principle of black majority rule within two years the rhodesians now offered more concessions but those concessions focused on reaching an internal settlement with moderate black leaders were insufficient to end the war at the time some rhodesians said the still embittered history between the britishdominated rhodesia and the afrikanerdominated south africa partly led south african government to withdraw its aid to rhodesia ian smith said in his memoirs that even though many white south africans supported rhodesia south african prime minister john vorsters policy of détente with the black african states ended up with rhodesia being offered as the sacrificial lamb to buy more time for south africa other observers perceived south africas distancing itself from rhodesia as being an early move in the process that led to

weapons of mass destruction the programs primary purpose was to kill guerrillas whether they were recruits transiting to camps in mozambique or guerrillas operating inside rhodesia the cbw effort took on the guerrilla threat from three fronts first the effort aimed to eliminate guerrillas operating inside rhodesia through contaminated supplies either provided by contact men recovered from hidden caches or stolen from rural stores secondly the effort worked to contaminate water supplies along guerrilla infiltration routes into rhodesia forcing the guerrillas either to travel through arid regions to carry more water and less ammunition or travel through areas patrolled by the security forces finally the rhodesians sought to hit the guerrillas in their camps in mozambique by poisoning food beverages and medicines the chemicals most used in the rhodesian program were parathion an organophosphate insecticide and thallium a heavy metal commonly found in rodenticide the rhodesians selected for use also included vibrio cholerae causative agent of cholera and possibly bacillus anthracis causative agent of anthrax they also looked at using rickettsia prowazekii causative agent of epidemic typhus and salmonella typhi causative agent of typhoid fever and toxins—such as ricin and botulinum toxin biological agents namely vibrio cholerae causative agent of cholera had some impact on the fighting capability of zanla some former officers of the rhodesian security forces alleged that anthrax was covertly used by rhodesian psyops units during the late s but these statements are unfounded rhodesia never possessed the capability to produce anthrax spores on the scale needed for widespread dissemination use of anthracis ricin or botulinum toxin would have been confined to

judiciary in white hands for the moment it assured whites of about one third of the seats in parliament it was essentially a powersharing arrangement between whites and blacks which in the eyes of many particularly the insurgents did not amount to majority rule however the united states senate voted to end economic sanctions against zimbabwe rhodesia on  june while the  election was described by the rhodesian government as nonracial and democratic it did not include the main nationalist parties zanu and zapu in spite of offers from ian smith the latter parties declined to participate in an election in which their political position would be insecure and under a proposed constitution which they had played no part in drafting and which was perceived as retaining strong white minority privilege bishop muzorewas government did not receive international recognition the bush war continued unabated and sanctions were not lifted the international community refused to accept the validity of any agreement which did not incorporate the main nationalist parties the british government then led by the recently elected margaret thatcher issued invitations to all parties to attend a peace conference at lancaster house these negotiations took place in london in late  the threemonthlong conference almost failed to reach conclusion due to disagreements on land reform but resulted in the

supporters of zapu through former insurgents that had not confined themselves to the designated guerrilla assembly points as stipulated by the lancaster house agreement the observers and the newly installed governor lord soames were accused of looking the other way and mugabes victory was certified nevertheless few could doubt that mugabes support within his majority shona tribal group was extremely strong the rhodesian military seriously considered mounting a coup against a perceived stolen election operation quartz to prevent zanu from taking over the country the alleged coup was to include the assassination of mugabe and coordinated assaults on guerrilla assembly points throughout the country the plan was eventually scuttled as it was obvious that mugabe enjoyed widespread support from the black majority despite voter intimidation as well as the fact that the coup would gain no external support and a conflagration which would engulf the country was seen as inevitable republic of zimbabwe edit mugabe and the victorious black nationalists were rather less concerned by operation quartz than by the possibility that there might be a mass exodus of the white community

african troops had entered the country to secure the road approaches to the beit bridge border crossing point refugee camps had been prepared in the transvaal on the day the election results became known most white families had prepared contingency plans for flight including the packing of cars and suitcases however after a meeting with robert mugabe and the central committee of zanu pf ian smith was reassured that whites could and should stay in the new zimbabwe mugabe promised that he would abide strictly by the terms of the lancaster house agreement and that changes in zimbabwe would be made gradually and by proper legal process in a cbs news interview mugabe claimed that rhodesian whites are still in control of the economy the majority being commercial farmers mugabe however would reverse his commitment to these agreements some years later the regime began confiscating white owned farm lands this is widely blamed for leading to the deterioration of the zimbabwean economy

qualifications b and c following cecil rhodess dictum of equal rights for all civilised men there was no overt racial component to the franchise however the requirement excluded a majority of native blacks from the electorate up until the s southern rhodesia had a vibrant political life with right and left wing parties competing for power the rhodesian labour party held seats in the assembly and in municipal councils throughout the s and s from  to  the prime minister was garfield todd a liberal who did much to promote the development of the black community through investment in education housing and healthcare however the government forced todd from office because his proposed reforms were seen by many whites as too radical from  onwards white settler politics consolidated and ossified around resistance to majority rule setting the stage for udi the  constitution governed southern rhodesia and independent rhodesia up until  using the westminster parliamentary system modified by a system of separate voter rolls with differing property and education qualifications without regard to race whites ended up with the majority of assembly seats the  republican constitution established a bicameral parliament consisting of an indirectly elected senate and a directly elected house of assembly effectively reserving the majority of seats for whites the office of

throughout the period of its unilateral declaration of independence  to  rhodesia pursued a foreign policy of attempting to secure recognition as an independent country and insisting that its political system would include gradual steps to majority rule ardently anticommunist rhodesia tried to present itself to the west as a frontline state against communist expansion in africa to little avail rhodesia received little international recognition during its existence recognition only occurred after elections in  and a transition to majority rule rhodesia wished to retain its economic prosperity and also feared communist elements in the rebel forces and thus felt their policy of a gradual progression to black majority rule was justified however the international community refused to accept this rationale believing that their policies were perpetuating racism this attitude was part of the larger decolonisation context during which western powers such as the united kingdom france and belgium hastened to grant independence to their colonies in africa britain and the udiedit rhodesia was originally a british colony although decolonisation in africa had begun after world war ii it began accelerating in the early s causing britain to negotiate independence rapidly with several of its colonies during this period it adopted a foreign policy called nibmar or no independence before majority african rule mandating democratic reforms that placed governance in the hands of the majority black africans the governing white minority of rhodesia led by ian smith opposed the policy and its implications on  november  rhodesias minority white government made a unilateral declaration of independence udi from the united kingdom as it became apparent that negotiations would not lead to independence under the white regime the united kingdom government immediately brought in legislation southern rhodesia act  which formally abolished all rhodesian government institutions this move made life difficult for rhodesian citizens who wished to travel internationally as passports issued by rhodesias udi administration were not recognised as valid in january  the british issued a statement accepting as valid any passport issued before the declaration of independence and allowing sixmonth united kingdom passports to be granted when they expired – provided that the bearer declared they did not intend to aid the udi rhodesian government until late  rhodesia still recognised queen elizabeth ii as head of state even though it opposed the british government itself for hindering its goals of independence the queen however refused to accept the title queen of rhodesia eventually the smith government abandoned attempts to remain loyal to the crown and in  a majority of the electorate voted in referendum to declare rhodesia a republic they hoped that this move would facilitate recognition as an independent state by the international community but the issues of white minority control remained and hindered this effort and like the udi before it the proclamation of a republic lacked international recognition sanctionsedit after the declaration of independence and indeed for the entire duration of its existence rhodesia did not receive official recognition from any state although it did maintain diplomatic relations with south africa which was then under apartheid south africa did not recognise rhodesia to preserve its fragile positions with other nations but frequently assisted the republic portugal maintained informal relations until the carnation revolution of  the day following the declaration of independence the united nations security council passed a resolution sres calling upon all states not to accord rhodesia recognition and to refrain from any assistance the security council also imposed selective mandatory economic sanctions which were later made comprehensive malawi israel south africa portugal

zambia also accused western oil companies of violating the sanctions and selling oil to rhodesia international perspectiveedit rhodesias unilateral declaration of independence from the united kingdom on  november  was promptly condemned by the international community the united nations security council resolution  of  november  called upon all states not to recognise this illegal racist minority regime in southern rhodesia rhodesia campaigned for international acceptance and invoked the doctrine of nonintervention in internal affairs as justification for rebuking external criticism of its internal policies however the emerging doctrine of selfdetermination in colonial situations meant that most nations regarded rhodesia as illegitimate zambia formerly northern rhodesia took a pragmatic approach towards rhodesia kenneth kaunda heavily dependent on access through rhodesia for his nations copper ore exports fuel and power imports unofficially worked with the rhodesian government rhodesia still allowed zambia to export and import its goods through its territory to mozambique ports despite the zambian governments official policy of hostility and nonrecognition of the postudi smith administration the united states like all other western nations refused to recognise rhodesia but unlike others allowed its consulategeneral to function as a communications conduit between the american government in washington dc and the rhodesian government in salisbury when rhodesia set up an information office in washington dc oas nations loudly protested the us government responded by saying the rhodesian mission and its staff had no official diplomatic status and violated no us laws portugal pursued a middle path with rhodesia while not officially recognising rhodesia under ian smith the government of antónio salazar did permit rhodesia to establish a representative mission in lisbon and permitted rhodesian exports and imports through their colony of mozambique the portuguese government in power at that time authoritarian and ardently anticommunist gave active behindthescenes support in rhodesias fight against the guerrilla groups south africa itself under international pressure as a white minority government pursued a policy of détente with the black african states at the time these states wanted south africa to pressure ian smith to accept a faster transition to majority rule in rhodesia in return for pledges of noninterference in south africas internal affairs prime minister john vorster believing majority rule in rhodesia would lead to international acceptance for south africa used a number of tactics to pressure smith the south african government held up shipments of fuel and ammunition and pulled out friendly south african forces from rhodesia the combined loss of mozambique and the loss of support from south africa dealt critical blows to the rhodesian government diplomatic relationsedit after the udi rhodesia maintained several overseas missions including pretoria and until  lisbon in portugal and lourenço marques now maputo in mozambique since  rhodesia had had an accredited diplomatic representative with south africa heading a rhodesian diplomatic mission or de facto embassy before south africa left the commonwealth that year the then southern rhodesia had exchanged high commissioners with the then union of south africa but following the change in status the republic now had a south african diplomatic mission in salisbury during  the government of rhodesia made moves to establish a mission in lisbon separate from the british embassy with its own accredited representative having previously been able to establish its own consulate in lourenço marques capital of portuguese mozambique this prompted protests from the british government which was determined that the representative harry reedman should be a nominal member of the british ambassadors staff for their part the portuguese authorities sought a compromise whereby they would accept reedman as an independent representative but deny him diplomatic status the rhodesian information office in washington remained open following udi but its director ken towsey and his staff were deprived of their diplomatic status previously there had been a minister for rhodesian affairs operating under the aegis of the british embassy in washington as well representatives in tokyo and bonn following the countrys independence as zimbabwe towsey became chargé daffaires at the new embassy the high commission in london known as rhodesia house continued to function until it was closed in  following the decision by white rhodesians in a referendum to make the country a republic along with the british residual mission in salisbury prior to its closure the mission flew the newly adopted flag of rhodesia considered illegal by the foreign office prompting calls by labour mp willie hamilton for its removal in australia the federal government in canberra sought to close the rhodesian information centre in sydney but it remained open operating under the jurisdiction of the state of new south wales in  the labor government of gough whitlam cut post and telephone links to the centre but this was ruled illegal by the high court an office was also established in paris but this was closed down by the french government in  similarly the united states recalled its consulgeneral from salisbury and reduced consular staff but did not move to close its consulate until the declaration of a republic in  south africa however retained its accredited diplomatic representative after udi which allowed it to continue to recognise british sovereignty as well as to deal with the de facto authority of the government of ian smith the south african diplomatic mission in salisbury became the only such mission remaining in the country after  when portugal downgraded its mission to consul level having recalled its consulgeneral in salisbury in may  after zimbabwes independence the new government closed its missions in pretoria and cape town only maintaining a trade mission in johannesburg while the south african diplomatic mission in salisbury was also closed resultsedit continuing civil war and a lack of international support eventually led the rhodesian government to submit to an agreement with the uk in  this led to internationally supervised elections won by zimbabwe african national union  patriotic front and robert mugabe establishing the internationally recognised zimbabwe legacyedit in the ten years after independence around  of the white population of zimbabwe emigrated most to south africa and to other mainly white english speaking countries where they formed expatriate communities politically within zimbabwe the consolidation of power by robert mugabe continued through the s following amendments to the countrys constitution in  parliamentary seats reserved for whites were abolished and an executive presidency was created held by mugabe many expatriates and some of the whites who stayed in zimbabwe became deeply nostalgic for rhodesia these individuals are known as rhodies native whites who are more accepting of the new order are known as zimbos while as rhodesia the country was once considered the breadbasket of africa today zimbabwe is a net importer of foodstuffs with the european union and united states providing emergency food relief as humanitarian aid on a regular basis the nation has suffered profound economic and social decline in the past twenty years recently the agriculture sector has started to do well since the availability of expertise and machines has improved supported mainly by china zimbabwe also suffered from a crippling inflation rate as the reserve bank of zimbabwe had a policy of printing money to satisfy government debts which introduces excessive currency into the economic system which led to the demise of the local currency this policy caused the inflation rate to soar from  in  considered extremely high by most economic standards to an astonishing  by  monetary aid by the international monetary fund has been suspended due to the zimbabwe governments defaulting on past loans inability to stabilise its own economy and its inability to stem corruption and advance human rights in  zimbabwe abandoned its currency relying instead on foreign currencies such as the south african rand the us dollar the botswana pula the euro and the british pound among others in  elections mugabe garnered  simba makoni  and morgan tsvangirai  of the votes cast for president forcing a runoff election called by the zimbabwe electoral commission zec in the months leading to the runoff instances of extreme violence between the two major parties zanu pf and mdc led tsvangirai to withdraw from the election in february  a powersharing accord was reached which resulted in the zimbabwe government of national unity of  the accord was essentially to create the position of prime minister for tsvangirai who served in that role from  to  mugabe retained the title of president rhodesian mediaedit the main newspapers were the rhodesia herald in salisbury and the

unrecognised state in southern africa from  to  equivalent in territorial terms to modern zimbabwe with its capital in salisbury now harare rhodesia was considered a de facto successor state to the former british colony of southern rhodesia which had achieved responsible government in  during an effort to delay an immediate transition to black majority rule rhodesias predominantly white government issued its own unilateral declaration of independence udi from the united kingdom on  november  the udi administration initially sought recognition as an autonomous realm within the commonwealth of nations but reconstituted itself as a republic in  following a brutal guerrilla war fought with two african nationalist organisations robert mugabes zanu and joshua nkomos zapu rhodesian premier ian smith conceded to biracial democracy in  however a provisional government subsequently headed by smith and his moderate colleague abel muzorewa failed in appeasing international critics or halting the bloodshed by december  muzorewa had replaced smith as prime minister and secured an agreement with the militant nationalists allowing rhodesia to briefly revert to colonial status pending elections under a universal franchise it finally achieved internationally recognised independence in april  the nation was concurrently renamed the republic of zimbabwe a wholly landlocked area rhodesia was bordered by south africa to the south bechuanaland later botswana to the southwest zambia to the northwest and mozambique a portuguese province until  to the east the

which considered the territorys legal name to be southern rhodesia the name given to the country in  during the british south africa companys administration of the rhodesias and retained by the selfgoverning colony of southern rhodesia after the end of company rule in  this naming dispute dated back to october  when northern rhodesia became independent from britain and concurrently changed its name to zambia the southern rhodesian colonial government in salisbury felt that in the absence of a northern rhodesia the continued use of southern was superfluous it passed legislation to become simply rhodesia but the british government refused to approve this on the grounds that the countrys name was defined by british legislation and so could not be altered by the colonial government salisbury went on using the shortened name in an official manner nevertheless while the british government continued referring to the country as southern rhodesia this situation continued throughout the udi period the shortened name was used by many people including the british government in the house of commons the british government maintained this stance regarding the june–december  successor state of zimbabwe rhodesia and when zimbabwe rhodesia returned to colonial status from december  to april  it was as southern rhodesia southern rhodesia subsequently gained international recognition

backgroundedit until after world war ii the landlocked british possession of southern rhodesia was not developed as an indigenous african territory but rather as a unique state which reflected its multiracial character this situation certainly made it very different from other lands which existed under colonial rule as many europeans had arrived to make permanent homes populating the towns as traders or settling to farm the most productive soils in  faced with the decision to join the union of south africa as a fifth province or accept nearly full internal autonomy the electorate cast its vote against south african integration in view of the outcome of the referendum the territory was annexed by the united kingdom on  september  shortly after annexation on  october  the first constitution for the new colony of southern rhodesia came into force under this constitution southern rhodesia was given the right to elect its own thirtymember legislature premier and cabinet—although the british crown retained a formal veto over measures affecting natives and dominated foreign policy the rhodesian authorities provided compensation when the government nationalised enterprises such as the countrys railroads consistently refused to radically alleviate unemployment and shied from filling civil service posts with partisan appointees by colonial standards public services were wellorganised and praised for their efficiency in  southern rhodesia merged with the two other british central african states to form the federation of rhodesia and nyasaland – a loose

unilateral declaration of independence edit although prepared to grant formal independence to southern rhodesia now rhodesia the british government had adopted a policy of no independence before majority rule dictating that colonies with a substantial population of european settlers would not receive independence except under conditions of majority rule rhodesian colonials initially balked at the suggestion some felt they had a right to absolute political control at least for the time being despite their relatively small numbers the authorities were also disturbed by the postindependence chaos which was plaguing other african nations at the time however once rhodesia had been introduced as a topic for discussion in international bodies extension of the status quo became a matter of concern to the world community and a serious embarrassment to the united kingdom after the federal breakup in  thenprime minister alec douglashome insisted that preconditions on independence talks hinge on what he termed the five principles – unimpeded progress to majority rule assurance against any future legislation decidedly detrimental to black interests improvement in the political status of local africans moves towards ending racial discrimination and agreement on a settlement which could be acceptable to the whole population harold wilson and his incoming labour government took an even harder line on demanding that these points be legitimately addressed before an independence agenda could be set by  growing dissatisfaction with the ongoing negotiations ousted salisburys incumbent winston field replacing him with ian smith deputy chairman of the conservative rhodesian front party smith the colonys first rhodesianborn leader soon came to personify resistance to liberals in british government and those agitating for change at home he ruled out acceptance for all five of the proposed principles as they stood implying instead that rhodesia was already legally entitled to independence—a claim which was overwhelmingly endorsed by registered voters in a referendum emboldened by the results of this referendum and the subsequent general election rhodesia now threatened to assume her own sovereignty without british consent harold wilson countered by warning that such an irregular procedure would be considered treasonous although he specifically rejected using armed force against the english kith and kin in africa wilsons refusal to consider a military option encouraged smith to proceed with his plans talks quickly broke down and final efforts in october to achieve a settlement floundered the rhodesian front remained unwilling to accept what were regarded as unacceptably drastic terms and the british would settle for nothing less – it was a formula doomed to failure ian smith signs the unilateral declaration of independence the mantle of the pioneers has fallen on our shoulders to sustain civilisation in a primitive country — ian smith  november  upon the announcement of udi on  november  following a brief but solemn consensus rhodesias leading statesmen issued their countrys unilateral declaration of independence udi this was immediately denounced as an act of rebellion against the crown in the united kingdom and wilson promised that the illegal action would be shortlived however few seemed to initially realise that rhodesia was no longer within the commonwealths direct sphere of influence and british rule was now a constitutional fiction salisbury remained virtually immune to credible metropolitan leverage on  october  the united nations general assembly had noted the repeated threats of the rhodesian authorities to declare unilaterally the independence of southern rhodesia in order to perpetuate minority rule and called upon wilson to use all means at his disposal including military force to prevent the rhodesian front from asserting independence after udi was proclaimed un officials branded ian smiths government as an illegal racist minority regime and called on member states to sever economic ties with rhodesia recommending sanctions on petroleum products and military hardware in december  these measures became mandatory extending to bar the purchase of rhodesian tobacco chrome copper asbestos sugar meat and hides britain having already adopted extensive sanctions of its own dispatched a royal navy squadron to monitor oil deliveries in the port of beira in mozambique from which a strategic pipeline ran to umtali in rhodesia the warships were to deter by force if necessary vessels reasonably believed to be carrying oil destined for southern rhodesia some nations such as switzerland and west germany which were not un members conducted business legally with rhodesia – the latter remained the smith governments largest trading partner in western europe until  when bonn joined the un japan continued to accept more rhodesian exports than any other nation and iran provided oil the portuguese government marketed rhodesian products as its own via false certificates of origin and disguised trade channels south africa openly refused to observe the un sanctions a  amendment passed in the united states permitted american firms to go on importing rhodesian chromium and nickel as normal despite the poor showing of sanctions rhodesia found it nearly impossible to obtain diplomatic recognition abroad in  the us government had made it clear that the udi would not be recognised under any circumstances even smiths ideological allies in pretoria although sympathetic failed to recognise the new country on an equal level initially the state retained its pledged loyalty to elizabeth ii of the united kingdom recognising her as queen of rhodesia when smith and deputy prime minister clifford dupont called on colonial governor sir humphrey gibbs to formally notify him of the udi gibbs condemned the udi as an act of treason after smith formally announced the udi on the radio gibbs sacked the entire cabinet on orders from whitehall however he was unable to enact any concrete actions to foster a return to legality government ministers simply ignored his notices pointing out that udi made his office obsolete even so gibbs continued to occupy his residence in salisbury until  when he vacated the premises and left rhodesia following the declaration of a republic he had effectively been superseded before then on  december  smith named dupont as officer administering the government an earlier attempt to have him named as governorgeneral of rhodesia was dismissed out of hand in september  the appellate division of the rhodesian high court ruled that ian smiths administration had become the de jure government of the country not merely the de facto one to support his decision chief justice sir hugh beadle used several statements made by hugo grotius who maintained that there was no way in which a nation could rightly claim to be governing a particular territory – if it was waging a war against that territory beadle argued that due to britains economic war against rhodesia she could not at the same point be described as governing rhodesia resulting court decisions held that the rebel government could lawfully do anything its predecessors could lawfully have done a salisbury commission chaired by prominent lawyer wr waley was appointed to study constitutional options open to the rhodesian authorities as of april  but reaching a further settlement with the british was ruled out early on waley although insistent that europeans must surrender any belief in permanent european domination also testified that majority rule was not desirable immediately talks aimed at easing the differences between rhodesia and the united kingdom were carried out aboard royal navy vessels once in december  and again in october  both efforts failed to achieve agreement although harold wilson added a sixth principle to the five he had previously enunciated it would be necessary to ensure that regardless of race there was no oppression of the majority by the minority or of any minority by the majority rhodesian resolve stiffened following a failure to reach a new settlement with more radical elements of the rhodesian front calling for a republican constitution during a twoproposition referendum held in  the proposal for severing all remaining ties to the british crown passed by a majority of  votes to  rhodesia declared itself a republic on  march  under the new constitution a president served as ceremonial head of state with the prime minister nominally reporting to him some in rhodesian government had hoped in vain that the declaration of a republic would finally prompt other nations to grant recognition impact of udiedit the years following rhodesias udi saw an unfolding series of economic military and political pressures placed on the country which eventually brought about majority rule a totality of these factors rather than any one the reason for introducing change in  a conference at the london school of economics which discussed rhodesias independence concluded that udi was sparked by an existing racial conflict complicated by cold war intrigues critics of udi sought to maintain that ian smith intended only to safeguard the privileges of an entrenched colonial elite at the expense of the impoverished african community according to this logic udi created a vacuum of oppression which was eventually filled by robert mugabes present dictatorship smith and his supporters continued to defend their actions however by claiming that the rhodesian majority was too inexperienced at the time to manage effectively a developed nation at large the european populations emerging attitude to udi was tense many white rhodesians had seen themselves as nothing less than fully fledged members of the british empire carrying on the same rugged values and frontier spirit of the early englishmen who had settled in  but such confidence was rudely shaken by whitehalls refusal to grant independence on their terms after  there were those who continued to claim that they were collectively upholders of principle and defenders of such values against the twin threats of communism manifested through the militant black nationalists and – ironically – the decadence of britain herself often repeated appeals to the christian heritage of their pioneer ancestors in defending the free world reflected these beliefs african parties displayed initial horror at smiths declaration with one zanu official stating for all those who cherish freedom and a meaningful life udi has set a collision course which cannot be altered  november  has marked the turning point of the struggle for freedom in that land from a constitutional and political one to primarily a military struggle it would however be several years before even the most radical nationalists chose to develop a coherent strategy revolving around armed resistance preferring instead to create opportunities for external intervention because rhodesian exports were generally competitive and had previously been entitled to preferential treatment on the british market the former colony did not recognise the need for escalating the pace of diversification before independence following the udi however rhodesia began to demonstrate that she had the potential to develop a greater degree of economic selfsufficiency after the rhodesian front began introducing incentives accorded to domestic production industrial output expanded dramatically a rigid system of countermeasures enacted to combat sanctions succeeded in blunting their impact for at least a decade over the next nine years rhodesian companies spiting the freezing of their assets and blocking of overseas accounts also perfected cunning techniques of sanctions evasion through both local and foreign subsidiaries which operated on a clandestine trade network from  until  there was virtually no further dialogue between rhodesia and the uk this altered immediately after the ascension of edward heath who reopened negotiations smith remained optimistic that heath would do his utmost to remedy anglorhodesian relations although disappointed that he continued to adhere publicly to the original five principles proposed by alec douglashome now foreign secretary in november  douglashome renewed contacts with salisbury and announced a proposed agreement which would be satisfactory to both sides – it recognised rhodesias  constitution as the legal frame of government while agreeing that gradual legislative representation was an acceptable formula for unhindered advance to majority rule nevertheless the new settlement if approved would also implement an immediate improvement in black political status offer a means to terminate racial discrimination and provide a solid guarantee against retrogressive constitutional amendments implementation of the proposed settlement hinged on popular acceptance but the rhodesian government consistently refused to submit it to a universal referendum a twenty fourmember commission headed by an eminent jurist lord pearce was therefore tasked with ascertaining public opinion on the subject in  the commission began interviewing interest groups and sampling opinions – although concern was expressed over the widespread apathy encountered according to every published finding whites were in favour of the settlement and rhodesians of mixed or asian background generally pleased while black reaction was resoundingly negative as many as thirty african chiefs and politicians voiced their opposition prompting britain to withdraw from the proposals on the grounds of the commissions report the bush waredit main article rhodesian bush war as early as  minority rule in southern rhodesia was already being challenged by a rising tide of political violence led by african nationalists such as joshua nkomo and ndabaningi sithole after their public campaigns were initially suppressed many believed that negotiation was completely incapable of meeting their aspirations petrol bombings by radicals became increasingly common with the zimbabwe review observing in  for the first time homemade petrol bombs were used by freedom fighters in salisbury against settler establishments it was officially noted that between january and september  alone  bombings were carried out in addition to  acts of attempted sabotage on communications in that same period nationalists were implicated in arson targeting  schools and  churches nkomos zimbabwe african peoples union zapu subsequently disclosed that it had formed a military wing zimbabwe peoples revolutionary army zipra and the decision to start bringing in arms and ammunition and to send young men away for sabotage training had already been made the rhodesian authorities responded by banning zapu and driving its supporters underground frustrated by their repeated failures nationalists also conducted a campaign of terror against black africans murdering those who had either identified with the colonial administration or had simply failed to demonstrate their allegiance to the cause to protect civilians emergency laws were imposed broadening the legal definition of unlawful gatherings and giving the police greater powers to crack down on agitators or subversives the death sentence was also introduced for terrorism involving explosives and arson a crisis of confidence soon resulted across zapu which was already suffering from poor morale compounded by tribal and ideological factionalism in  party dissidents rejected joshua nkomos authority and formed their own organisation the zimbabwe african national union zanu – which worked out its own strategy for impressing international opinion undermining white assurance and achieving a complete breakdown of order by august  zanu which had brutally intimidated neutrals and opponents alike was outlawed by authorities as well zanus agenda was inwardlooking leftist and panafricanist in nature ndabaningi sithole and avowed marxist robert mugabe its most prominent leaders demanded a one party zimbabwean state with majority rule and a public monopoly on land after being forced from rhodesia they continued to operate in exile creating occupation groups representing urban workers miners and peasant farmers zanu also attracted professionals students and feminists to its ranks while zapu theoretically continued to command the allegiance of most ndebele and shona activists sithole and mugabe drew their support from the mashonaland countryside after the udi zanu officials mapped an elaborate plan for the liberation of zimbabwe which called for attacks on white farmers destruction of cash crops disrupting electricity in urban areas and petrol bombings sithole and nkomo both insisted on the need for armed struggle but disagreed on the means to go about it for example zapu tended to follow soviet thinking placing an emphasis on sophisticated weaponry in the hopes of winning a conventional battle like the viet minh at dien bien phu zanu

lonrho transferred their support from the rhodesian government to black nationalist parties business leaders and politicians feted nkomo on his visits to europe zanu also attracted business supporters who saw the course that future events were likely to take funding and arms support provided by supporters particularly from the soviet union and its allies in the latter s allowed both zipra and the zanla to acquire more sophisticated weaponry thereby increasing the military pressure that the guerrillas were able to place on rhodesia until  containing the guerrillas was little more than a police action even as late as august  when rhodesian government and black nationalist leaders met at victoria falls for negotiations brokered by south africa and zambia the talks never got beyond the procedural phase rhodesian representatives made it clear they were prepared to fight an all out war to prevent majority rule however the situation changed dramatically after the end of portuguese colonial rule in mozambique in  rhodesia now found itself almost entirely surrounded by hostile states and even south africa its only real ally pressed for a settlement having let slip one chance

pressure on smith to agree to a form of majority rule in response to the initiative of us secretary of state henry kissinger in  ian smith accepted the principle of black majority rule within two years the rhodesians now offered more concessions but those concessions focused on reaching an internal settlement with moderate black leaders were insufficient to end the war at the time some rhodesians said the still embittered history between the britishdominated rhodesia and the afrikanerdominated south africa partly led south african government to withdraw its aid to rhodesia ian smith said in his memoirs that even though many white south africans supported rhodesia south african prime minister john vorsters policy of détente with the black african states ended up with rhodesia being offered as the sacrificial lamb to buy more time for south africa other observers perceived south africas distancing itself from rhodesia as being an early move in the process that led to majority rule in south africa itself in  south africa saw settlement of the rhodesian question as vital on several fronts to cauterise the wound of the psychological blow … caused by her defeat in the

weapons of mass destruction the programs primary purpose was to kill guerrillas whether they were recruits transiting to camps in mozambique or guerrillas operating inside rhodesia the cbw effort took on the guerrilla threat from three fronts first the effort aimed to eliminate guerrillas operating inside rhodesia through contaminated supplies either provided by contact men recovered from hidden caches or stolen from rural stores secondly the effort worked to contaminate water supplies along guerrilla infiltration routes into rhodesia forcing the guerrillas either to travel through arid regions to carry more water and less ammunition or travel through areas patrolled by the security forces finally the rhodesians sought to hit the guerrillas in their camps in mozambique by poisoning food beverages and medicines the chemicals most used in the rhodesian program were parathion an organophosphate insecticide and thallium a heavy metal commonly found in rodenticide the rhodesians selected for use also included vibrio cholerae causative agent of cholera and possibly bacillus anthracis causative agent of anthrax they also looked at using rickettsia prowazekii causative agent of epidemic typhus and salmonella typhi causative agent of typhoid fever and toxins—such as ricin and botulinum toxin biological agents namely vibrio cholerae causative agent of cholera had some impact on the fighting capability of zanla some former officers of the rhodesian security forces alleged that anthrax was covertly used by rhodesian psyops units during the late s but these statements are unfounded rhodesia never possessed the capability to produce anthrax spores on the scale needed for widespread dissemination use of anthracis ricin or botulinum toxin would have been confined to

judiciary in white hands for the moment it assured whites of about one third of the seats in parliament it was essentially a powersharing arrangement between whites and blacks which in the eyes of

by the rhodesian government as nonracial and democratic it did not include the main nationalist parties zanu and zapu in spite of offers from ian smith the latter parties declined to participate in an election in which their political position would be insecure and under a proposed constitution which they had played no part in drafting and which was perceived as retaining strong white minority privilege bishop muzorewas government did not receive international recognition the bush war continued unabated and sanctions were not lifted the international community refused to accept the validity

supporters of zapu through former insurgents that had not confined themselves to the designated guerrilla assembly points as stipulated by the lancaster house agreement the observers and the newly installed governor lord soames were accused of looking the other way and mugabes victory was certified nevertheless few could doubt that mugabes support within his majority shona tribal group was extremely strong the rhodesian military seriously considered mounting a coup against a perceived stolen election operation quartz to prevent zanu from taking over the country the alleged coup was to include the assassination of mugabe and coordinated assaults on guerrilla assembly points throughout the country the plan was eventually scuttled as it was obvious that mugabe enjoyed widespread support from the black majority despite voter intimidation as well as the fact that the coup would gain no external support and a conflagration which would engulf the country was seen as inevitable republic of zimbabwe edit mugabe and the victorious black nationalists were rather less concerned by operation quartz than by the possibility that there might be a mass exodus of the white community

african troops had entered the country to secure the road approaches to the beit bridge border crossing point refugee camps had been prepared in the transvaal on the day the election results became known most white families had prepared contingency plans for flight including the packing of cars and suitcases however after a meeting with robert mugabe and the central committee of zanu pf ian smith was reassured that whites could and should stay in the new zimbabwe mugabe promised that he would abide strictly by the terms of the lancaster house agreement and that changes in zimbabwe would be made gradually and by proper legal process in a cbs news interview mugabe claimed that rhodesian whites are still in control of the economy the majority being commercial farmers mugabe however would reverse his commitment to these agreements some years later the regime began confiscating white owned farm lands this is widely blamed for leading to the deterioration of the zimbabwean economy

to accept this rationale believing that their policies were perpetuating racism this attitude was part of the larger decolonisation context during which western powers such as the united kingdom france and belgium hastened to grant independence to their colonies in africa britain and the udiedit rhodesia was originally a british colony although decolonisation in africa had begun after world war ii it began accelerating in the early s causing britain to negotiate independence rapidly with several of its colonies during this period it adopted a foreign policy called nibmar or no independence before majority african rule mandating democratic reforms that placed governance in the hands of the majority black africans the governing white minority of rhodesia led by ian smith opposed the policy and its implications on  november  rhodesias minority white government made a unilateral declaration of independence udi from the united kingdom as it became apparent that negotiations would not lead to independence under the white regime the united kingdom government immediately brought in legislation southern rhodesia act  which formally abolished all rhodesian government institutions this move made life difficult for rhodesian citizens who wished to travel internationally as passports issued by rhodesias udi administration were not recognised as valid in january  the british issued a statement accepting as valid any passport issued before the declaration of independence and allowing sixmonth united kingdom passports to be granted when they expired – provided that the bearer declared they did not intend to aid the udi rhodesian government until late  rhodesia still recognised queen elizabeth ii as head of state even though it opposed the british government itself for hindering its goals of independence the queen however refused to accept the title queen of rhodesia eventually the smith government abandoned attempts to remain loyal to the crown and in  a majority of the electorate voted in referendum to declare rhodesia a republic they hoped that this move would facilitate recognition as an independent state by the international community but the issues of white minority control remained and hindered this effort and like the udi before it the proclamation of a republic lacked international recognition sanctionsedit after the declaration of independence and indeed for the entire duration of its existence rhodesia did not receive official recognition from any state although it did maintain diplomatic relations with south africa which was then under apartheid south africa did not recognise rhodesia to preserve its fragile positions with other nations but frequently assisted the republic portugal maintained informal relations until the carnation revolution of  the day following the declaration of independence the united nations security council passed a resolution sres calling upon all states not to accord rhodesia recognition and to refrain from any assistance the security council also imposed selective mandatory economic sanctions which were later made comprehensive malawi israel south africa portugal and iran did not comply with economic sanctions against rhodesia the us despite voting in favor of the sanctions at the unsc violated them to buy chrome ore from rhodesia kenneth kaunda president of zambia also accused western oil companies of violating the sanctions and selling oil to rhodesia international perspectiveedit rhodesias unilateral declaration of independence from the united kingdom on  november  was promptly condemned by the international community the united nations security council resolution  of  november  called upon all states not to recognise this illegal racist minority regime in southern rhodesia rhodesia campaigned for international acceptance and invoked the doctrine of nonintervention in internal affairs as justification for rebuking external criticism of its internal policies however the emerging doctrine of selfdetermination in colonial situations meant that most nations regarded rhodesia as illegitimate zambia formerly northern rhodesia took a pragmatic approach towards rhodesia kenneth kaunda heavily dependent on access through rhodesia for his nations copper ore exports fuel and power imports unofficially worked with the rhodesian government rhodesia still allowed zambia to export and import its goods through its territory to mozambique ports despite the zambian governments official policy of hostility and nonrecognition of the postudi smith administration the united states like all other western nations refused to recognise rhodesia but unlike others allowed its consulategeneral to function as a communications conduit between the american government in washington dc and the rhodesian government in salisbury when rhodesia set up an information office in washington dc oas nations loudly protested the us government responded by saying the rhodesian mission and its staff had no official diplomatic status and violated no us laws portugal pursued a middle path with rhodesia while not officially recognising rhodesia under ian smith the government of antónio salazar did permit rhodesia to establish a representative mission in lisbon and permitted rhodesian exports and imports through their colony of mozambique the portuguese government in power at that time authoritarian and ardently anticommunist gave active behindthescenes support in rhodesias fight against the guerrilla groups south africa itself under international pressure as a white minority government pursued a policy of détente with the black african states at the time these states wanted south africa to pressure ian smith to accept a faster transition to majority rule in rhodesia in return for pledges of noninterference in south africas internal affairs prime minister john vorster believing majority rule in rhodesia would lead to international acceptance for south africa used a number of tactics to pressure smith the south african government held up shipments of fuel and ammunition and pulled out friendly south african forces from rhodesia the combined loss of mozambique and the loss of support from south africa dealt critical blows to the rhodesian government diplomatic relationsedit after the udi rhodesia maintained several overseas missions including pretoria and until  lisbon in portugal and lourenço marques now maputo in mozambique since  rhodesia had had an accredited diplomatic representative with south africa heading a rhodesian diplomatic mission or de facto embassy before south africa left the commonwealth that year the then southern rhodesia had exchanged high commissioners with the then union of south africa but following the change in status the republic now had a south african diplomatic mission in salisbury during  the government of rhodesia made moves to establish a mission in lisbon separate from the british embassy with its own accredited representative having previously been able to establish its own consulate in lourenço marques capital of portuguese mozambique this prompted protests from the british government which was determined that the representative harry reedman should be a nominal member of the british ambassadors staff for their part the portuguese authorities sought a compromise whereby they would accept reedman as an independent representative but deny him diplomatic status the rhodesian information office in washington remained open following udi but its director ken towsey and his staff were deprived of their diplomatic status previously there had been a minister for rhodesian affairs operating under the aegis of the british embassy in washington as well representatives in tokyo and bonn following the countrys independence as zimbabwe towsey became chargé daffaires at the new embassy the high commission in london known as rhodesia house continued to function until it was closed in  following the decision by white rhodesians in a referendum to make the country a republic along with the british residual mission in salisbury prior to its closure the mission flew the newly adopted flag of rhodesia considered illegal by the foreign office prompting calls by labour mp willie hamilton for its removal in australia the federal government in canberra sought to close the rhodesian information centre in sydney but it remained open operating under the jurisdiction of the state of new south wales in  the labor government of gough whitlam cut post and telephone links to the centre but this was ruled illegal by the high court an office was also established in paris but this was closed down by the french government in  similarly the united states recalled its consulgeneral from salisbury and reduced consular staff but did not move to close its consulate until the declaration of a republic in  south africa however retained its accredited diplomatic representative after udi which allowed it to continue to recognise british sovereignty as well as to deal with the de facto authority of the government of ian smith the south african diplomatic mission in salisbury became the only such mission remaining in the country after  when portugal downgraded its mission to consul level having recalled its consulgeneral in salisbury in may  after zimbabwes independence the new government closed its missions in pretoria and cape town only maintaining a trade mission in johannesburg while the south african diplomatic mission in salisbury was also closed resultsedit continuing civil war and a lack of international support eventually led the rhodesian government to submit to an agreement with the uk in  this led to internationally supervised elections won by zimbabwe african national union  patriotic front and robert mugabe establishing the internationally recognised zimbabwe legacyedit in the ten years after independence around  of the white population of zimbabwe emigrated most to south africa and to other mainly white english speaking countries where they formed expatriate communities politically within zimbabwe the consolidation of power by robert mugabe continued through the s following amendments to the countrys constitution in  parliamentary seats reserved for whites were abolished and an executive presidency was created held by mugabe many expatriates and some of the whites who stayed in zimbabwe became deeply nostalgic for rhodesia these individuals are known as rhodies native whites who are more accepting of the new order are known as zimbos while as rhodesia the country was once considered the breadbasket of africa today zimbabwe is a net importer of foodstuffs with the european union and united states providing emergency food relief as humanitarian aid on a regular basis the nation has suffered profound economic and social decline in the past twenty years recently the agriculture sector has started to do well since the availability of expertise and machines has improved supported mainly by china zimbabwe also suffered from a crippling inflation rate as the reserve bank of zimbabwe had a policy of printing money to satisfy government debts which introduces excessive currency into the economic system which led to the demise of the local currency this policy caused the inflation rate to soar from  in  considered extremely high by most economic standards to an astonishing  by  monetary aid by the international monetary fund has been suspended due to the zimbabwe governments defaulting on past loans inability to stabilise its own economy and its inability to stem corruption and advance human rights in  zimbabwe abandoned its currency relying instead on foreign currencies such as the south african rand the us dollar the botswana pula the euro and the british pound among others in  elections mugabe garnered  simba makoni  and morgan tsvangirai  of the votes cast for president forcing a runoff election called by the zimbabwe electoral commission zec in the months leading to the runoff instances of extreme violence between the two major parties zanu pf and mdc led tsvangirai to withdraw from the election in february  a powersharing accord was reached which resulted in the zimbabwe government of national unity of  the accord was essentially to create the position of prime minister for tsvangirai who served in that role from  to  mugabe retained the title of president rhodesian mediaedit the main newspapers were the rhodesia herald in salisbury and the

government issued its own unilateral declaration of independence udi from the united kingdom on  november  the udi administration initially sought recognition as an autonomous realm within the commonwealth of nations but reconstituted itself as a republic in  following a brutal guerrilla war fought with two african nationalist organisations robert mugabes zanu and joshua nkomos zapu rhodesian premier ian smith conceded to biracial democracy in  however a provisional government subsequently headed by smith and his moderate colleague abel muzorewa failed in appeasing international critics or halting the bloodshed by december  muzorewa had replaced smith as prime minister and secured an agreement with the militant nationalists allowing rhodesia to briefly revert to colonial status pending elections under a universal franchise it finally achieved internationally recognised independence in april  the nation was concurrently renamed the republic of zimbabwe a wholly

its name to zambia the southern rhodesian colonial government in salisbury felt that in the absence of a northern rhodesia the continued use of southern was superfluous it passed legislation to become simply rhodesia but the british government refused to approve this on the grounds that the countrys name was defined by british legislation and so could not be altered by the colonial government salisbury went on using the shortened name in an official manner nevertheless while the british government continued referring to the country as southern rhodesia this situation continued throughout the udi period the shortened name was used by many people including the british government in the house of commons the british government maintained this stance regarding the june–december  successor state of zimbabwe rhodesia and when zimbabwe rhodesia returned to colonial status from december  to april  it was as southern rhodesia southern rhodesia subsequently gained international recognition

backgroundedit until after world war ii the landlocked british possession of southern rhodesia was not developed as an indigenous african territory but rather as a unique state which reflected its multiracial character this situation certainly made it very different from other lands which existed under colonial rule as many europeans had arrived to make permanent homes populating the towns as traders or settling to farm the most productive soils in  faced with the decision to join the union of south africa as a fifth province or accept nearly full internal autonomy the electorate cast its vote against south african integration in view of the outcome of the referendum the territory was annexed by the united kingdom on  september  shortly after annexation on  october  the first constitution for the new colony of southern rhodesia came into force under this constitution southern rhodesia was given the right to elect its own thirtymember legislature premier and cabinet—although the british crown retained a formal veto over measures affecting natives and dominated foreign policy the rhodesian authorities provided compensation when the government nationalised enterprises such as the countrys railroads consistently refused to radically alleviate unemployment and shied from filling civil service posts with partisan appointees by colonial standards public services were wellorganised and praised for their efficiency in  southern rhodesia merged with the two other british central african states to form the federation of rhodesia and nyasaland – a loose association that placed defence and economic direction under a central government but left many domestic affairs under the control of its constituent territories as it began to appear that

unilateral declaration of independence edit although prepared to grant formal independence to southern rhodesia now rhodesia the british government had adopted a policy of no independence before majority rule dictating that colonies with a substantial population of european settlers would not receive independence except under conditions of majority rule rhodesian colonials initially balked at the suggestion some felt they had a right to absolute political control at least for the time being despite their relatively small numbers the authorities were also disturbed by the postindependence chaos which was plaguing other african nations at the time however once rhodesia had been introduced as a topic for discussion in international bodies extension of the status quo became a matter of concern to the world community and a serious embarrassment to the united kingdom after the federal breakup in  thenprime minister alec douglashome insisted that preconditions on independence talks hinge on what he termed the five principles – unimpeded progress to majority rule assurance against any future legislation decidedly detrimental to black interests improvement in the political status of local africans moves towards ending racial discrimination and agreement on a settlement which could be acceptable to the whole population harold wilson and his incoming labour government took an even harder line on demanding that these points be legitimately addressed before an independence agenda could be set by  growing dissatisfaction with the ongoing negotiations ousted salisburys incumbent winston field replacing him with ian smith deputy chairman of the conservative rhodesian front party smith the colonys first rhodesianborn leader soon came to personify resistance to liberals in british government and those agitating for change at home he ruled out acceptance for all five of the proposed principles as they stood implying instead that rhodesia was already legally entitled to independence—a claim which was overwhelmingly endorsed by registered voters in a referendum emboldened by the results of this referendum and the subsequent general election rhodesia now threatened to assume her own sovereignty without british consent harold wilson countered by warning that such an irregular procedure would be considered treasonous although he specifically rejected using armed force against the english kith and kin in africa wilsons refusal to consider a military option encouraged smith to proceed with his plans talks quickly broke down and final efforts in october to achieve a settlement floundered the rhodesian front remained unwilling to accept what were regarded as unacceptably drastic terms and the british would settle for nothing less – it was a formula doomed to failure ian smith signs the unilateral declaration of independence the mantle of the pioneers has fallen on our shoulders to sustain civilisation in a primitive country — ian smith  november  upon the announcement of udi on  november  following a brief but solemn consensus rhodesias leading statesmen issued their countrys unilateral declaration of independence udi this was immediately denounced as an act of rebellion against the crown in the united kingdom and wilson promised that the illegal action would be shortlived however few seemed to initially realise that rhodesia was no longer within the commonwealths direct sphere of influence and british rule was now a constitutional fiction salisbury remained virtually immune to credible metropolitan leverage on  october  the united nations general assembly had noted the repeated threats of the rhodesian authorities to declare unilaterally the independence of southern rhodesia in order to perpetuate minority rule and called upon wilson to use all means at his disposal including military force to prevent the rhodesian front from asserting independence after udi was proclaimed un officials branded ian smiths government as an illegal racist minority regime and called on member states to sever economic ties with rhodesia recommending sanctions on petroleum products and military hardware in december  these measures became mandatory extending to bar the purchase of rhodesian tobacco chrome copper asbestos sugar meat and hides britain having already adopted extensive sanctions of its own dispatched a royal navy squadron to monitor oil deliveries in the port of beira in mozambique from which a strategic pipeline ran to umtali in rhodesia the warships were to deter by force if necessary vessels reasonably believed to be carrying oil destined for southern rhodesia some nations such as switzerland and west germany which were not un members conducted business legally with rhodesia – the latter remained the smith governments largest trading partner in western europe until  when bonn joined the un japan continued to accept more rhodesian exports than any other nation and iran provided oil the portuguese government marketed rhodesian products as its own via false certificates of origin and disguised trade channels south africa openly refused to observe the un sanctions a  amendment passed in the united states permitted american firms to go on importing rhodesian chromium and nickel as normal despite the poor showing of sanctions rhodesia found it nearly impossible to obtain diplomatic recognition abroad in  the us government had made it clear that the udi would not be recognised under any circumstances even smiths ideological allies in pretoria although sympathetic failed to recognise the new country on an equal level initially the state retained its pledged loyalty to elizabeth ii of the united kingdom recognising her as queen of rhodesia when smith and deputy prime minister clifford dupont called on colonial governor sir humphrey gibbs to formally notify him of the udi gibbs condemned the udi as an act of treason after smith formally announced the udi on the radio gibbs sacked the entire cabinet on orders from whitehall however he was unable to enact any concrete actions to foster a return to legality government ministers simply ignored his notices pointing out that udi made his office obsolete even so gibbs continued to occupy his residence in salisbury until  when he vacated the premises and left rhodesia following the declaration of a republic he had effectively been superseded before then on  december  smith named dupont as officer administering the government an earlier attempt to have him named as governorgeneral of rhodesia was dismissed out of hand in september  the appellate division of the rhodesian high court ruled that ian smiths administration had become the de jure government of the country not merely the de facto one to support his decision chief justice sir hugh beadle used several statements made by hugo grotius who maintained that there was no way in which a nation could rightly claim to be governing a particular territory – if it was waging a war against that territory beadle argued that due to britains economic war against rhodesia she could not at the same point be described as governing rhodesia resulting court decisions held that the rebel government could lawfully do anything its predecessors could lawfully have done a salisbury commission chaired by prominent lawyer wr waley was appointed to study constitutional options open to the rhodesian authorities as of april  but reaching a further settlement with the british was ruled out early on waley although insistent that europeans must surrender any belief in permanent european domination also testified that majority rule was not desirable immediately talks aimed at easing the differences between rhodesia and the united kingdom were carried out aboard royal navy vessels once in december  and again in october  both efforts failed to achieve agreement although harold wilson added a sixth principle to the five he had previously enunciated it would be necessary to ensure that regardless of race there was no oppression of the majority by the minority or of any minority by the majority rhodesian resolve stiffened following a failure to reach a new settlement with more radical elements of the rhodesian front calling for a republican constitution during a twoproposition referendum held in  the proposal for severing all remaining ties to the british crown passed by a majority of  votes to  rhodesia declared itself a republic on  march  under the new constitution a president served as ceremonial head of state with the prime minister nominally reporting to him some in rhodesian government had hoped in vain that the declaration of a republic would finally prompt other nations to grant recognition impact of udiedit the years following rhodesias udi saw an unfolding series of economic military and political pressures placed on the country which eventually brought about majority rule a totality of these factors rather than any one the reason for introducing change in  a conference at the london school of economics which discussed rhodesias independence concluded that udi was sparked by an existing racial conflict complicated by cold war intrigues critics of udi sought to maintain that ian smith intended only to safeguard the privileges of an entrenched colonial elite at the expense of the impoverished african community according to this logic udi created a vacuum of oppression which was eventually filled by robert mugabes present dictatorship smith and his supporters continued to defend their actions however by claiming that the rhodesian majority was too inexperienced at the time to manage effectively a developed nation at large the european populations emerging attitude to udi was tense many white rhodesians had seen themselves as nothing less than fully fledged members of the british empire carrying on the same rugged values and frontier spirit of the early englishmen who had settled in  but such confidence was rudely shaken by whitehalls refusal to grant independence on their terms after  there were those who continued to claim that they were collectively upholders of principle and defenders of such values against the twin threats of communism manifested through the militant black nationalists and – ironically – the decadence of britain herself often repeated appeals to the christian heritage of their pioneer ancestors in defending the free world reflected these beliefs african parties displayed initial horror at smiths declaration with one zanu official stating for all those who cherish freedom and a meaningful life udi has set a collision course which cannot be altered  november  has marked the turning point of the struggle for freedom in that land from a constitutional and political one to primarily a military struggle it would however be several years before even the most radical nationalists chose to develop a coherent strategy revolving around armed resistance preferring instead to create opportunities for external intervention because rhodesian exports were generally competitive and had previously been entitled to preferential treatment on the british market the former colony did not recognise the need for escalating the pace of diversification before independence following the udi however rhodesia began to demonstrate that she had the potential to develop a greater degree of economic selfsufficiency after the rhodesian front began introducing incentives accorded to domestic production industrial output expanded dramatically a rigid system of countermeasures enacted to combat sanctions succeeded in blunting their impact for at least a decade over the next nine years rhodesian companies spiting the freezing of their assets and blocking of overseas accounts also perfected cunning techniques of sanctions evasion through both local and foreign subsidiaries which operated on a clandestine trade network from  until  there was virtually no further dialogue between rhodesia and the uk this altered immediately after the ascension of edward heath who reopened negotiations smith remained optimistic that heath would do his utmost to remedy anglorhodesian relations although disappointed that he continued to adhere publicly to the original five principles proposed by alec douglashome now foreign secretary in november  douglashome renewed contacts with salisbury and announced a proposed agreement which would be satisfactory to both sides – it recognised rhodesias  constitution as the legal frame of government while agreeing that gradual legislative representation was an acceptable formula for unhindered advance to majority rule nevertheless the new settlement if approved would also implement an immediate improvement in black political status offer a means to terminate racial discrimination and provide a solid guarantee against retrogressive constitutional amendments implementation of the proposed settlement hinged on popular acceptance but the rhodesian government consistently refused to submit it to a universal referendum a twenty fourmember commission headed by an eminent jurist lord pearce was therefore tasked with ascertaining public opinion on the subject in  the commission began interviewing interest groups and sampling opinions – although concern was expressed over the widespread apathy encountered according to every published finding whites were in favour of the settlement and rhodesians of mixed or asian background generally pleased while black reaction was resoundingly negative as many as thirty african chiefs and politicians voiced their opposition prompting britain to withdraw from the proposals on the grounds of the commissions report the bush waredit main article rhodesian bush war as early as  minority rule in southern rhodesia was already being challenged by a rising tide of political violence led by african nationalists such as joshua nkomo and ndabaningi sithole after their public campaigns were initially suppressed many believed that negotiation was completely incapable of meeting their aspirations petrol bombings by radicals became increasingly common with the zimbabwe review observing in  for the first time homemade petrol bombs were used by freedom fighters in salisbury against settler establishments it was officially noted that between january and september  alone  bombings were carried out in addition to  acts of attempted sabotage on communications in that same period nationalists were implicated in arson targeting  schools and  churches nkomos zimbabwe african peoples union zapu subsequently disclosed that it had formed a military wing zimbabwe peoples revolutionary army zipra and the decision to start bringing in arms and ammunition and to send young men away for sabotage training had already been made the rhodesian authorities responded by banning zapu and driving its supporters underground frustrated by their repeated failures nationalists also conducted a campaign of terror against black africans murdering those who had either identified with the colonial administration or had simply failed to demonstrate their allegiance to the cause to protect civilians emergency laws were imposed broadening the legal definition of unlawful gatherings and giving the police greater powers to crack down on agitators or subversives the death sentence was also introduced for terrorism involving explosives and arson a crisis of confidence soon resulted across zapu which was already suffering from poor morale compounded by tribal and ideological factionalism in  party dissidents rejected joshua nkomos authority and formed their own organisation the zimbabwe african national union zanu – which worked out its own strategy for impressing international opinion undermining white assurance and achieving a complete breakdown of order by august  zanu which had brutally intimidated neutrals and opponents alike was outlawed by authorities as well zanus agenda was inwardlooking leftist and panafricanist in nature ndabaningi sithole and avowed marxist robert mugabe its most prominent leaders demanded a one party zimbabwean state with majority rule and a public monopoly on land after being forced from rhodesia they continued to operate in exile creating occupation groups representing urban workers miners and peasant farmers zanu also attracted professionals students and feminists to its ranks while zapu theoretically continued to command the allegiance of most ndebele and shona activists sithole and mugabe drew their support from the mashonaland countryside after the udi zanu officials mapped an elaborate plan for the liberation of zimbabwe which called for attacks on white farmers destruction of cash crops disrupting electricity in urban areas and petrol bombings sithole and nkomo both insisted on the need for armed struggle but disagreed on the means to go about it for example zapu tended to follow soviet thinking placing an emphasis on sophisticated weaponry in the hopes of winning a conventional battle like the viet minh at dien bien phu zanu

sustainable in a country where blacks outnumbered whites  in  there were  rhodesians of european descent and more than six million africans international business groups involved in the country eg lonrho transferred their support from the rhodesian government to black nationalist parties business leaders and politicians feted nkomo on his visits to europe zanu also attracted business supporters who saw the course that future events were likely to take funding and arms support provided by supporters particularly from the soviet union and its allies in the latter s allowed both zipra and the zanla to acquire more sophisticated weaponry thereby increasing the military pressure that the guerrillas were able to place on rhodesia until  containing the guerrillas was little more than a police action even as late as august  when rhodesian government and black nationalist leaders met at victoria falls for negotiations brokered by south africa and zambia the talks never got beyond the procedural phase rhodesian representatives made it clear they were prepared to fight an all out war to prevent majority rule however the situation changed dramatically after the end of portuguese colonial rule in mozambique in  rhodesia now found itself almost entirely surrounded by hostile states and even south africa its only real ally pressed for a settlement having let slip one chance

pressure on smith to agree to a form of majority rule in response to the initiative of us secretary of state henry kissinger in  ian smith accepted the principle of black majority rule within two years the rhodesians now offered more concessions but those concessions focused on reaching an internal settlement with moderate black leaders were insufficient to end the war at the time some rhodesians said the still embittered history between the britishdominated rhodesia and the afrikanerdominated south africa partly led south african government to withdraw its aid to rhodesia ian smith said in his memoirs that even though many white south africans supported rhodesia south african prime minister john vorsters policy of détente with the black african states ended up with rhodesia being offered as the sacrificial lamb to buy more time for south africa other observers perceived south africas distancing itself from rhodesia as being an early move in the process that led to majority rule in south africa itself in  south africa saw settlement of the rhodesian question as vital on several fronts to cauterise the wound of the psychological blow … caused by her defeat in the

weapons of mass destruction the programs primary purpose was to kill guerrillas whether they were recruits transiting to camps in mozambique or guerrillas operating inside rhodesia the cbw effort took on the guerrilla threat from three fronts first the effort aimed to eliminate guerrillas operating inside rhodesia through contaminated supplies either provided by contact men recovered from hidden caches or stolen from rural stores secondly the effort worked to contaminate water supplies along guerrilla infiltration routes into rhodesia forcing the guerrillas either to travel through arid regions to carry more water and less ammunition or travel through areas patrolled by the security forces finally the rhodesians sought to hit the guerrillas in their camps in mozambique by poisoning food beverages and medicines the chemicals most used in the rhodesian program were parathion an organophosphate insecticide and thallium a heavy metal commonly found in rodenticide the rhodesians selected for use also included vibrio cholerae causative agent of cholera and possibly bacillus anthracis causative agent of anthrax they also looked at using rickettsia prowazekii causative agent of epidemic typhus and salmonella typhi causative agent of typhoid fever and toxins—such as ricin and botulinum toxin biological agents namely vibrio cholerae causative agent of cholera had some impact on the fighting capability of zanla some former officers of the rhodesian security forces alleged that anthrax was covertly used by rhodesian psyops units during the late s but these statements are unfounded rhodesia never possessed the capability to produce anthrax spores on the scale needed for widespread dissemination use of anthracis ricin or botulinum toxin would have been confined to

judiciary in white hands for the moment it assured whites of about one third of the seats in parliament it was essentially a powersharing arrangement between whites and blacks which in the eyes of

by the rhodesian government as nonracial and democratic it did not include the main nationalist parties zanu and zapu in spite of offers from ian smith the latter parties declined to participate in an election in which their political position would be insecure and under a proposed constitution which they had played no part in drafting and which was perceived as retaining strong white minority privilege bishop muzorewas government did not receive international recognition the bush war continued unabated and sanctions were not lifted the international community refused to accept the validity

supporters of zapu through former insurgents that had not confined themselves to the designated guerrilla assembly points as stipulated by the lancaster house agreement the observers and the newly installed governor lord soames were accused of looking the other way and mugabes victory was certified nevertheless few could doubt that mugabes support within his majority shona tribal group was extremely strong the rhodesian military seriously considered mounting a coup against a perceived stolen election operation quartz to prevent zanu from taking over the country the alleged coup was to include the assassination of mugabe and coordinated assaults on guerrilla assembly points throughout the country the plan was eventually scuttled as it was obvious that mugabe enjoyed widespread support from the black majority despite voter intimidation as well as the fact that the coup would gain no external support and a conflagration which would engulf the country was seen as inevitable republic of zimbabwe edit mugabe and the victorious black nationalists were rather less concerned by operation quartz than by the possibility that there might be a mass exodus of the white community

african troops had entered the country to secure the road approaches to the beit bridge border crossing point refugee camps had been prepared in the transvaal on the day the election results became known most white families had prepared contingency plans for flight including the packing of cars and suitcases however after a meeting with robert mugabe and the central committee of zanu pf ian smith was reassured that whites could and should stay in the new zimbabwe mugabe promised that he would abide strictly by the terms of the lancaster house agreement and that changes in zimbabwe would be made gradually and by proper legal process in a cbs news interview mugabe claimed that rhodesian whites are still in control of the economy the majority being commercial farmers mugabe however would reverse his commitment to these agreements some years later the regime began confiscating white owned farm lands this is widely blamed for leading to the deterioration of the zimbabwean economy

requirement voters to be british subjects male  years of age and older able to write their address and occupation and then to fulfil the following financial requirements a ownership of a registered mining claim in southern rhodesia or b occupying immovable property worth £ or c receiving wages or salary of £ per annum in southern rhodesia six months continuous residence was also required for qualifications b and c following cecil rhodess dictum of equal rights for all civilised men there was no overt racial component to the franchise however the requirement excluded a majority of native blacks from the electorate up until the s southern rhodesia had a vibrant political life with right and left wing parties competing for power the rhodesian labour party held seats in the assembly and in municipal councils throughout the s and s from  to  the prime minister was garfield todd a liberal who did much to promote the development of the black community through investment in education housing and healthcare however the government forced todd from office because his proposed reforms were seen by many whites as too radical from  onwards white settler politics consolidated and ossified around resistance to majority rule setting the stage for udi the  constitution governed southern rhodesia and independent rhodesia up until  using the westminster parliamentary system modified by a system of separate voter rolls with differing property and education qualifications without regard to race whites ended up with the majority of assembly seats the  republican constitution established a bicameral parliament consisting of an indirectly elected senate and a directly elected house of assembly effectively reserving the majority of seats for whites the office of president had only ceremonial significance with the prime minister holding executive power the constitution of the shortlived zimbabwe rhodesia which saw a blackled government elected for the first time reserved  of the  parliamentary seats for whites the independence constitution agreed at lancaster house watered those provisions down and reserved  out of  seats for whites in the house of assembly and  out of  seats in the senate the constitution prohibited zimbabwe authorities from altering the constitution for seven years without unanimous consent and required a threequarters vote in parliament for a further three years the government amended the constitution in  to abolish the seats reserved for whites and replace the office of prime minister with an executive president in  the

throughout the period of its unilateral declaration of independence  to  rhodesia pursued a foreign policy of attempting to secure recognition as an independent country and insisting that its political system would include gradual steps to majority rule ardently anticommunist rhodesia tried to present itself to the west as a frontline state against communist expansion in africa to little avail rhodesia received little international recognition during its existence recognition only occurred after elections in  and a transition to majority rule rhodesia wished to retain its economic prosperity and also feared communist elements in the rebel forces and thus felt their policy of a gradual progression to black majority rule was justified however the international community refused to accept this rationale believing that their policies were perpetuating racism this attitude was part of the larger decolonisation context during which western powers such as the united kingdom france and belgium hastened to grant independence to their colonies in africa britain and the udiedit rhodesia was originally a british colony although decolonisation in africa had begun after world war ii it began accelerating in the early s causing britain to negotiate independence rapidly with several of its colonies during this period it adopted a foreign policy called nibmar or no independence before majority african rule mandating democratic reforms that placed governance in the hands of the majority black africans the governing white minority of rhodesia led by ian smith opposed the policy and its implications on  november  rhodesias minority white government made a unilateral declaration of independence udi from the united kingdom as it became apparent that negotiations would not lead to independence under the white regime the united kingdom government immediately brought in legislation southern rhodesia act  which formally abolished all rhodesian government institutions this move made life difficult for rhodesian citizens who wished to travel internationally as passports issued by rhodesias udi administration were not recognised as valid in january  the british issued a statement accepting as valid any passport issued before the declaration of independence and allowing sixmonth united kingdom passports to be granted when they expired – provided that the bearer declared they did not intend to aid the udi rhodesian government until late  rhodesia still recognised queen elizabeth ii as head of state even though it opposed the british government itself for hindering its goals of independence the queen however refused to accept the title queen of rhodesia eventually the smith government abandoned attempts to remain loyal to the crown and in  a majority of the electorate voted in referendum to declare rhodesia a republic they hoped that this move would facilitate recognition as an independent state by the international community but the issues of white minority control remained and hindered this effort and like the udi before it the proclamation of a republic lacked international recognition sanctionsedit after the declaration of independence and indeed for the entire duration of its existence rhodesia did not receive official recognition from any state although it did maintain diplomatic relations with south africa which was then under apartheid south africa did not recognise rhodesia to preserve its fragile positions with other nations but frequently assisted the republic portugal maintained informal relations until the carnation revolution of  the day following the declaration of independence the united nations security council passed a resolution sres calling upon all states not to accord rhodesia recognition and to refrain from any assistance the security council also imposed selective mandatory economic sanctions which were later made comprehensive malawi israel south africa portugal and iran did not comply with economic sanctions against rhodesia the us despite voting in favor of the sanctions at the unsc violated them to buy chrome ore from rhodesia kenneth kaunda president of zambia also accused western oil companies of violating the sanctions and selling oil to rhodesia international perspectiveedit rhodesias unilateral declaration of independence from the united kingdom on  november  was promptly condemned by the international community the united nations security council resolution  of  november  called upon all states not to recognise this illegal racist minority regime in southern rhodesia rhodesia campaigned for international acceptance and invoked the doctrine of nonintervention in internal affairs as justification for rebuking external criticism of its internal policies however the emerging doctrine of selfdetermination in colonial situations meant that most nations regarded rhodesia as illegitimate zambia formerly northern rhodesia took a pragmatic approach towards rhodesia kenneth kaunda heavily dependent on access through rhodesia for his nations copper ore exports fuel and power imports unofficially worked with the rhodesian government rhodesia still allowed zambia to export and import its goods through its territory to mozambique ports despite the zambian governments official policy of hostility and nonrecognition of the postudi smith administration the united states like all other western nations refused to recognise rhodesia but unlike others allowed its consulategeneral to function as a communications conduit between the american government in washington dc and the rhodesian government in salisbury when rhodesia set up an information office in washington dc oas nations loudly protested the us government responded by saying the rhodesian mission and its staff had no official diplomatic status and violated no us laws portugal pursued a middle path with rhodesia while not officially recognising rhodesia under ian smith the government of antónio salazar did permit rhodesia to establish a representative mission in lisbon and permitted rhodesian exports and imports through their colony of mozambique the portuguese government in power at that time authoritarian and ardently anticommunist gave active behindthescenes support in rhodesias fight against the guerrilla groups south africa itself under international pressure as a white minority government pursued a policy of détente with the black african states at the time these states wanted south africa to pressure ian smith to accept a faster transition to majority rule in rhodesia in return for pledges of noninterference in south africas internal affairs prime minister john vorster believing majority rule in rhodesia would lead to international acceptance for south africa used a number of tactics to pressure smith the south african government held up shipments of fuel and ammunition and pulled out friendly south african forces from rhodesia the combined loss of mozambique and the loss of support from south africa dealt critical blows to the rhodesian government diplomatic relationsedit after the udi rhodesia maintained several overseas missions including pretoria and until  lisbon in portugal and lourenço marques now maputo in mozambique since  rhodesia had had an accredited diplomatic representative with south africa heading a rhodesian diplomatic mission or de facto embassy before south africa left the commonwealth that year the then southern rhodesia had exchanged high commissioners with the then union of south africa but following the change in status the republic now had a south african diplomatic mission in salisbury during  the government of rhodesia made moves to establish a mission in lisbon separate from the british embassy with its own accredited representative having previously been able to establish its own consulate in lourenço marques capital of portuguese mozambique this prompted protests from the british government which was determined that the representative harry reedman should be a nominal member of the british ambassadors staff for their part the portuguese authorities sought a compromise whereby they would accept reedman as an independent representative but deny him diplomatic status the rhodesian information office in washington remained open following udi but its director ken towsey and his staff were deprived of their diplomatic status previously there had been a minister for rhodesian affairs operating under the aegis of the british embassy in washington as well representatives in tokyo and bonn following the countrys independence as zimbabwe towsey became chargé daffaires at the new embassy the high commission in london known as rhodesia house continued to function until it was closed in  following the decision by white rhodesians in a referendum to make the country a republic along with the british residual mission in salisbury prior to its closure the mission flew the newly adopted flag of rhodesia considered illegal by the foreign office prompting calls by labour mp willie hamilton for its removal in australia the federal government in canberra sought to close the rhodesian information centre in sydney but it remained open operating under the jurisdiction of the state of new south wales in  the labor government of gough whitlam cut post and telephone links to the centre but this was ruled illegal by the high court an office was also established in paris but this was closed down by the french government in  similarly the united states recalled its consulgeneral from salisbury and reduced consular staff but did not move to close its consulate until the declaration of a republic in  south africa however retained its accredited diplomatic representative after udi which allowed it to continue to recognise british sovereignty as well as to deal with the de facto authority of the government of ian smith the south african diplomatic mission in salisbury became the only such mission remaining in the country after  when portugal downgraded its mission to consul level having recalled its consulgeneral in salisbury in may  after zimbabwes independence the new government closed its missions in pretoria and cape town only maintaining a trade mission in johannesburg while the south african diplomatic mission in salisbury was also closed resultsedit continuing civil war and a lack of international support eventually led the rhodesian government to submit to an agreement with the uk in  this led to internationally supervised elections won by zimbabwe african national union  patriotic front and robert mugabe establishing the internationally recognised zimbabwe legacyedit in the ten years after independence around  of the white population of zimbabwe emigrated most to south africa and to other mainly white english speaking countries where they formed expatriate communities politically within zimbabwe the consolidation of power by robert mugabe continued through the s following amendments to the countrys constitution in  parliamentary seats reserved for whites were abolished and an executive presidency was created held by mugabe many expatriates and some of the whites who stayed in zimbabwe became deeply nostalgic for rhodesia these individuals are known as rhodies native whites who are more accepting of the new order are known as zimbos while as rhodesia the country was once considered the breadbasket of africa today zimbabwe is a net importer of foodstuffs with the european union and united states providing emergency food relief as humanitarian aid on a regular basis the nation has suffered profound economic and social decline in the past twenty years recently the agriculture sector has started to do well since the availability of expertise and machines has improved supported mainly by china zimbabwe also suffered from a crippling inflation rate as the reserve bank of zimbabwe had a policy of printing money to satisfy government debts which introduces excessive currency into the economic system which led to the demise of the local currency this policy caused the inflation rate to soar from  in  considered extremely high by most economic standards to an astonishing  by  monetary aid by the international monetary fund has been suspended due to the zimbabwe governments defaulting on past loans inability to stabilise its own economy and its inability to stem corruption and advance human rights in  zimbabwe abandoned its currency relying instead on foreign currencies such as the south african rand the us dollar the botswana pula the euro and the british pound among others in  elections mugabe garnered  simba makoni  and morgan tsvangirai  of the votes cast for president forcing a runoff election called by the zimbabwe electoral commission zec in the months leading to the runoff instances of extreme violence between the two major parties zanu pf and mdc led tsvangirai to withdraw from the election in february  a powersharing accord was reached which resulted in the zimbabwe government of national unity of  the accord was essentially to create the position of prime minister for tsvangirai who served in that role from  to  mugabe retained the title of president rhodesian mediaedit the main newspapers were the rhodesia herald in salisbury and the
