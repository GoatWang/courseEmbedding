podcasts events ✕ alphabet smart home google alphabet’s cfo says home and nest are different entities whether it seems intuitive or not the two hardware units are staying separate by tess townsend may   pm edt tweet share linkedin justin sullivan  getty alphabet has two smart home systems google home and separate alphabet subsidiary nest and it’s going to stay that way said alphabet cfo ruth porat at the code conference wednesday in rancho palos verdes california “our view is that home is pursuing one path and nest is looking at a different set of products and gotomarket strategy” she said this view is not necessarily intuitive given the overlap between the two companies not just from a consumer perspective but from the perspective of companies that work with the products “it’s really a huge separation between dealing with the nest people and product line and the google home people and product line” said hellotech ceo richard wolpert whose ondemand tech setup and support company installs nest and home devices the nest suite of smart home products was originally part of google before being spun out into its own company when google reorganized into alphabet that spinout happened before google introduced the home device an artificially intelligent hub that responds to voice commands and controls smart devices from a variety of makers including nest nest cofounder and ceo tony fadell left the company about a year ago raising questions at the time about whether there might be a change in direction or whether alphabet might just sell the company “i think that we have evolved the business” porat said when kara swisher asked about fadell’s departure she said alphabet was happy with nest’s performance “i talk about them every quarter we’re very pleased with what they’re doing they are continuing to expand globally expand the product suite” she said “we have found areas where its efficient to work with the google hardware team but they are a separate entity within other

google  email comment one page print porat encourages employees to find a satisfying “mix” of family and work porat the most powerful woman on wall street share on facebook share on twitter ruth porat the chief financial officer at morgan stanley has one especially cherished item on her desk in midtown manhattan it’s a note from her three boys from  when porat was working around the clock to help the federal reserve save american international group the giant insurance company whose imminent failure threatened to nuke an already crashing global economy story continued below “on one of those nights where we were working through the night i came home and my three boys left me a little note because they knew i’d at least come home and shower” porat recalled in an interview though she didn’t say what exactly her boys wrote she added “in their own words three different personalities underscored how very proud they were and how important they thought the work was”  also on politico money gap why dont women give porat often called “the most powerful woman on wall street” viewed it as a triumph of her careerlong approach to “worklife balance” a phrase she abhors “it was really sweet because it said to me ‘they get it’ they’re proud … and they have been integrated into morgan stanley throughout their lives” instead of “balance” — something she says sets women and increasingly men up to fail — porat encourages employees to find a satisfying “mix” of family and work in their lives the mix will shift depending on needs in both places but the two should never be fully isolated from each other porat grew up in northern england cambridge massachusetts and palo alto california the daughter of a research engineer father and psychologist mother there was never any question that she would have both a family and a major career after undergrad at stanford and a pair of master’s degrees porat  entered morgan stanley in  and quickly became a mergersandacquisitions whiz before leaving for smith barney in   also on politico maya wileys push for civil rights it was a rare career misstep for porat who immediately realized she wanted to return to morgan stanley which she did in  going on to head a pair of investment banking teams before becoming chief financial officer in  in her current role porat alongside morgan stanley chief executive james gorman has retooled the blue chip bank’s business mix into a more stable postcrisis franchise that is in many ways now the envy of wall street why aren’t there more women in senior positions of power including ceos on wall street if there were would some of the meltdowns not have happened when i started there were very few women at the managing director level and very few who had families which is something that was important to me so it’s not like when i looked up i could say “well that’s who i want to be” and you see this real narrowing of a lot of women opting out of the profession as they ascend up the ranks which i think is really unfortunate since  there are now many more of us as at the higher levels with families so i think as role models we are encouraging more women to stay within banking and rise up through the ranks  also on politico tenacity helps dixon in gop ranks i think what sheryl sandberg said about the importance of “leaning in” is very true but it’s not sufficient because if you are leaning in to a door that is nailed shut you are just going to get bloodied and tired of trying to push that door open so you have got to have the next level which is “how do you open up those doors to the everbigger roles” the second point you make is intriguing would ’ have been different had there been different voices around the table and i think one thing that is encouraging to me is the increase in data that suggest that organizations with a higher percentage of women in the csuite or boards with a greater number of women or other underrepresented minorities are more effective and have greater financial results did going into the maledominated testosteronefueled world of wall street give you pause there were enough times even coming up to that point where i was one of very few women i remember the first time it struck me is i was an econ major at stanford as an undergrad and it struck me how few women were econ majors back in the ’s and then in business school how few women … and even then i thought gosh this is really unfortunate so when i started here what was very different was that there were very few women at senior levels period and very few that had a family there were certain things along the way where being a woman was actually intriguingly helpful … when i was a very young associate i was asked by a managing director to present to a board of directors … at the time the ceo had said they needed more women in the boardroom and part of the reason was that they had an rd focus that was actually pretty nonsensical because it was run by men … they were having problems with their product development because they didn’t have enough women at the seniormost ranks who could provide an overlay that was quite relevant for their customer base” share on facebook

fortunecom subscribe the wall street veteran who’s helping google get disciplined by leena rao weinbergclark photography september    am edt cfo ruth porat is pushing google “creatives” to bring their costs under control subfreezing temperatures didn’t stop ruth porat from setting out for her beloved spinning class but black ice kept her from getting there early one sunday in january  porat slipped and fell near her home on manhattan’s upper west side shattering her left shoulder blade after she rushed to an emergency room doctors told her she would need immediate surgery wrong answer porat was the chief financial officer of morgan stanley ms  whose annual earnings call was two days away instead of going under the knife she went to her office arm in a sling porat refused painkillers saying they would impair her judgment and put in two long workdays before the tuesday morning call only after that did she go in for surgery—driving straight from the office to the hospital but within days she was back in midtown manhattan explaining the company’s results to morgan stanley’s board “we could all see her hand was very swollen and black and blue” recalls hutham olayan a senior executive at saudi conglomerate olayan group and a longtime board member but porat “was presenting as if nothing had happened” porat’s shoulder remained painful for months but it didn’t keep her from traveling a few weeks after the accident she flew to california on a trip that helped her land one of the most prominent and difficult jobs in technology—becoming cfo at google goog and helping the tech giant transform itself as it approaches its third decade to see the full  most powerful women list click here ruth porat is no  click to enlarge a high tolerance for pain isn’t literally a job requirement for most leaders but over a career at the highest levels in corporate finance porat has been equally unflappable navigating physical obstacles and fighting great metaphorical ­discomfort—the racetheclock stress of the financial crisis the tension of negotiations among bigego executives and now the culture clash of imposing financial discipline at tech’s biggest idea factory in doing so porat  has the rare distinction of having been one of the most powerful women in both finance and technology—two industries in which women have struggled to reach senior positions porat’s work ethic stands out even by the caffeinated standards of wall street but she far outshines the pack according to former morgan stanley ceo john mack in her ability to reason her way through the most difficult financial problems she matches that analytical rigor with an approachability and warmth that make her a consummate boardroom diplomat “ruth is the only person who can deliver bad news to me and i’ll still like her” says jeff immelt ceo of ge ge  after nearly  years in finance porat now calls a different industry her home at google where she started in may  porat has traded suits and heels for hoodies and jeans she jumped immediately into the task of restructuring google under a new corporate umbrella alphabet—and showing investors how much the company was earning from and spending on its core search and ads business on the one hand and its “moonshot” projects on the other so far she has given shareholders plenty to celebrate after her first earnings report in july  google’s market value increased  billion in a single day the largest such gain ever for a us company in all google’s stock now alphabet’s is up more than  since porat switched to pacific time “no normal person could walk into a massive restructuring … with new subsidiaries and compensation and be completely fine” says alphabet chairman eric schmidt who calls porat “extraordinary” still the alphabet reshuffle is just one step in a longterm transformation one that puts porat at the center of a contentious struggle over google’s future for all its impressive innovations from the android operating system to advances in artificial intelligence google still gets about  of its revenue from online advertising and industry watchers believe it will inevitably lose its edge there as rivals grow stronger “the clock is ticking on alphabet’s dominance” says independent technology analyst rob enderle google needs another hit—ideally from one of the nonadvertising businesses now labeled other bets inventing the next breakthrough isn’t porat’s job but as cfo she’s the one leaning on the inventors to show results porat led google’s ­reorganization under the holding company alphabet last year since she joined the company in may  its stock price has risen more than weinbergclark photography and that’s where the tension lies under porat’s scrutiny those business units are facing unprecedented pressure to bring their costs in line with their revenue schmidt and google founders larry page and sergey brin say such discipline will help google spot winners more efficiently but some of the company’s “smart creatives” fear that alphabet could inadvertently strangle the next great innovation in its infancy in the name of fiscal prudence porat herself recently told an audience that “you can’t cost cut your way to greatness” she declined to speak on the record for this article yet that principle hasn’t stopped the company from cutting and a recent string of executive departures suggests that some cuts are drawing blood in short the hoodie honeymoon phase is over porat’s transition to silicon valley was in fact a homecoming she was born in england but her family moved to palo alto when she was a child when her father joined stanford’s slac national accelerator laboratory dan porat a holocaust survivor who never earned a high school diploma became an accomplished physicist who authored more than  scientific and technical papers frieda porat ruth’s mother was a psychologist and ruth never doubted she would have both a family and a career her love for math and problem solving led porat to wall street after graduating from stanford and from business school at wharton porat joined morgan stanley as a junior mergersandacquisitions banker in  she hit her stride in the mids after becoming head of morgan stanley’s technology banking team just as wall street was growing infatuated with the shiny new internet porat worked closely with mary meeker morgan stanley’s influential techstock analyst who’s a confidante to porat and godmother to her three sons porat and securities lawyer anthony ­paduano married in  at a time when tech analysts tended to be exuberant bulls while bankers were more skeptical “ruth was the oil in the machinery” that helped the team agree on which transactions to back says joe perella then head of morgan stanley’s investment banking porat and meeker could be an irresistible sales force bombarding tech executives with data and ideas to win the right to lead their stock offerings but porat also had no problem telling startups to slow down and prove their business models before going public porat right with famed techstock analyst mary meeker in  when porat headed morgan stanley’s technology banking team the duo helped the bank become a dominant force in tech iposphoto jeffery salter—the new york timesredux mack eventually promoted porat to vice chairwoman of investment banking—a job that gave her influence with bigger companies when immelt first met porat he had just succeeded jack welch at ge “when bankers would visit they would take the first  minutes and tell me jack welch stories like that was supposed to make me feel good” immelt recalls “ruth never did that” with immelt too ruth earned respect by advising against some deals even when saying yes could have reaped big fees for morgan stanley when ge spun off insurance unit genworth gnw in  in a  billion ipo porat pressed immelt to set the opening share price lower arguing that the stock would flounder if priced too high “ceos hate to hear shit like that” immelt says “but she was right” in  morgan stanley assigned porat to its financial institutions banking business which helped big banks raise capital that meant she was in effect sitting in a lifeguard tower when the financialcrisis tidal wave made landfall in june  mack received a call from hank paulson then the treasury secretary who was assembling a team to help the ailing mortgage giants fannie mae fnma and freddie mac fmcc  “i need the best minds you have to help figure out what to do” paulson told mack mack sent two top bankers porat and bob scully when porat arrived in washington paulson told her “this is going to be the most exhausting and rewarding thing you ever do” “ruth is the only person who can deliver bad news to me and i’ll still like her” —jeff immelt ceo ge porat and scully designed a plan to put the two entities under conservatorship with the feds taking over their management—the only way paulson says today to provide “a very necessary longterm guarantee” to keep the mortgage market liquid executives at fannie mae and freddie mac bitterly opposed the move but it very likely kept the great recession from getting even worse “i can’t tell you how many times paulson called to thank me for giving him ruth” mack says paulson also tapped porat to help rescue insurance giant aig aig  when she returned home late one night to shower during that ordeal a former colleague recalls she found a collage of postit notes of support waiting in the kitchen porat’s yearold son wrote “fix this so i can have my mommy back” porat’s washington experience helped her earn a promotion to chief financial officer in january  the ensuing years weren’t great for morgan stanley—its profits have lagged since the financial crisis—but porat earned plaudits for stabilizing its finances and helping it meet government “stress tests” she also showed a knack for lightening the mood when the staff would work weekends and nights to prep for earnings reports for example porat would blast pop music and sing along   by late  porat was ready for a change she had been considered as a candidate for deputy treasury secretary but withdrew rather than undergo a bankerbashing confirmation hearing as a trustee at stanford she was making more trips to the west coast and colleagues say she felt nostalgia for palo alto where her father still lives read more one year in ruth porat remains google’s financial disciplinarian mack encouraged porat to reach out to bill campbell the longtime top adviser to google and apple aapl  one saturday in february  porat visited campbell at his palo alto home to talk about a career change as campbell later told fortune in an interview before his death this april porat had one stipulation she didn’t want another cfo job campbell responded “well i have the perfect job for you how about the cfo of google” what porat hadn’t known was that google’s thencfo patrick pichette was leaving—and that her work during the financial crisis had impressed google’s leaders porat told campbell she was intrigued and word got around fast almost immediately after she left campbell’s house she got a call from page’s assistant setting up a meeting the courtship was quick too less than a month after her visit with campbell porat had a job offer with stock and bonuses that brought her hiring package to almost  million comparing today’s google to crisisera wall street may sound like comparing a mosquito bite to a heart attack but even successful executives have nightmares and at google those involve the company becoming the next yahoo or nokia—tech bellwethers that fell behind as the industry’s landscape changed that’s why the eventual success of other bets innovations matters so much investors too want assurances that google’s research is paying off when the company went public in  page and brin publicly declared that google would never sacrifice longterm goals in response to pressure from shareholders twelve years later with google one of the world’s most widely owned stocks the company can no longer say “just trust us” on porat’s first day at google page explained to her his vision for a holdingcompany corporate structure and told porat that implementing it would be her top priority in august  three months after porat had started she and page announced the creation of alphabet google became a subsidiary of alphabet as did most of its smaller researchdriven units including connectedhome business nest and google fiber its home broadband initiative alphabet now discloses revenue and profits for two categories google and other bets the google bucket includes not only the advertising business but also cloud services and android in the second quarter of this year that bucket accounted for  of alphabet’s  billion in revenue all the other bets just  porat’s investorrelations team is explaining wall street analysts in  to minute “office hours” meetings—standard procedure for many companies but previously unheardof at google “i was shocked when i met ruth for the first time and she actually asked our team ‘what can alphabet do better’ ” says eric sheridan managing director of ubs’s internet and interactive entertainment research group ­porat won more investor goodwill in october  by announcing a  billion stock buyback click to enlarge but inside alphabet the new order is generating more tension than elation porat’s team meets regularly with each other bets business walking them through their units’ spending and earnings and urging them to make tradeoffs to bring them in line this is corporate finance  but it represents a drastic shift—and an uncomfortable one for many project managers “ruth is approachable and warm but she is persistent in what she wants—and she asks direct questions” says one google em­ployee implying that such bluntness is itself new current and former employees also say the scrutiny goes hand in hand with the kind of cost cutting companies that aren’t google have endured for decades some cuts are relatively minor employees are encouraged to use video conferencing instead of traveling to meetings for example but others have deeper strategic implications one source close to the company says it’s now difficult for other bets to get new hires approved the bets are also being told to be selfsufficient administratively they can rely on alphabet for functions like legal counsel human resources and public relations but only if they pay alphabet for the services one other bets subsidiary was billed  for a year’s worth of pr help if these units were independent companies of course they’d be shouldering these costs on their own but within alphabet they represent unfamiliar constraints and for some a signal that the culture google was built on—­focusing on innovation over profits—is dissipating google executives reject that assertion schmidt the chairman acknowledges that the focus is new but says it allows alphabet to invest more efficiently in its winners alphabet has been aggressively hiring engineers for cloudcomputing and artificialintelligence projects for example “the cost cutting is real and it’s the right thing to be done and it’s driven by porat” schmidt says “before she was there we had lost discipline” but is discipline really the problem in the most recent quarter other bets lost an ugly  million on  million in revenue still when you consider that alphabet generated  billion in free cash that quarter the losses seem like something the company could easily absorb cost cutting says enderle the analyst “is like taking painkillers when you are sick at some point you are going to have to address what is making you sick” the real issue at alphabet he adds is that “what they are spending money on isn’t successful” merited or not alphabet’s reforms have pushed some managers toward the exits nest founder tony fadell left in june not long after telling tech website the information that “the fiscaldiscipline era has now descended upon everything” he remains an alphabet adviser three executives from google’s selfdrivingcar unit left in august as did bill maris founder and head of google’s venture arm and there have been reports of an executive shakeup at x alphabet’s research lab alphabet’s project loon autolauncher designed to fill and launch a new balloon every  minutesphoto courtesy of google the departures have prompted plentiful chatter around palo alto but having navigated the battles of the financial crisis porat knows how to tune out noise she also has the kind of personal experience that keeps corporate infighting in perspective she has beaten breast cancer twice and has been in remission since  as meeker now a partner at venture capital firm kleiner perkins puts it “don’t underestimate the leadership talent that develops from crisis management” that talent has made porat an important voice for google inside the company and out at a time of momentous change this past january at the world economic forum summit in davos switzerland porat and schmidt hosted a dinner for european leaders they decided that porat would make introductory remarks and then yield the floor to schmidt but as porat began talking schmidt realized she was giving a far better speech than he could “the way she spoke showed she knew google so well” he recalls for a moment schmidt wasn’t sure what to do but he quickly arrived at an answer “just shut up and listen to ruth” for more on former female executives at google watch this fortune video correction an earlier version of this article said that ruth porat and her investorrelations team have been holding regular “office hours” with google investors in fact those meetings involve analysts and porat does not take part in them
