applicationsthis application is a us nationalization of pct international application no pctep filed  mar  entitled “product vending machine” which claims priority to italian patent application no toa filed  mar  the contents of both of the foregoing applications are incorporated herein in their entirety by this referencetechnical fieldembodiments of the present invention relate to a product vending machinemore specifically embodiments of the present invention relate to a product vending machine of the type comprising a cabinet defining a space and a number of movable parts comprising a front door for closing the space and a number of trays arranged inside the space and for supporting respective numbers of products each movable part being movable between a respective first and a respective second operating positionbackground artthe trays in vending machines of the above type are normally moved from a normal stowed position inside the space to an extracted loading position after first opening the door for easy product loading by an operatorthe relatively heavy weight of the trays when loaded poses the problem of enabling movement of one tray at a time when loading the products to prevent the machine from toppling overin normal ie closeddoor operating conditions vending machines of the above type also pose the problem of securing the trays in their respective stowed positions so that in the event of violent shaking of the machine eg by vandals the trays are prevented from working loose and crashing into the door thus damaging both the door and the trays and possibly also toppling the machinesummaryone or more embodiments of the present invention provide a product vending machine designed to provide a straightforward lowcost solution to both the above problemsaccording to an embodiment of the present invention there is provided a product vending machine the product vending machine includes a locking device and a column of rollers fitted along a guide with sufficient play to roll along the guide the column is selectively engaged by one of a number of wedge members to eliminate the play and move the rollers into a compact configuration preventing insertion of the other wedge members each wedge member is movable with a relative movable part eg a tray or a door of the machinebrief description of the drawingsa nonlimiting embodiment of the present invention will be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings in whichfig  shows a view in perspective of a preferred embodiment of the vending machine according to the present inventionfig  shows a largerscale detail of fig figs  and  show side views of a fig  detail in respective operating configurationsfig  shows a largerscale view with parts removed for clarity of a detail in fig fig  shows a section along line vivi in fig best mode for carrying out the inventionnumber  in fig  indicates as a whole a product vending machine comprising a cabinet  which defines an internal space  and has two lateral walls  and a front door partly defined by a panel of transparent material a hatch  in a bottom portion of door  closes a takeout bin not shown connected to the inner side of door  and can be opened from the outside to allow the user to remove a product selected on a pushbutton panel  on door  alongside the panel of transparent materialinside space  machine  houses a number of productsupporting trays  which are positioned facing door  are arranged one over the other and spaced apart vertically and extend between lateral walls  in respective substantially horizontal planes crosswise to lateral walls  and door  as shown in fig  and more clearly in fig  in the normal vending position trays  occupy a rear portion of space  so as to define between door  and the respective front ends of the trays facing door  a drop shaft  communicating with the takeout bin not shown underneathwith reference to figs  and  each tray  comprises a frame defined by a base  lying in a substantially horizontal plane by two sides  each facing a respective lateral wall  of cabinet  and by a number of partitions  perpendicular to base  and door  and which divide tray  into a number of channels which may be of different widths extend perpendicular to door  and each house a number of products arranged in one or more columns depending on the width of the channeleach channel has powered conveying means which are activated selectively in use to feed a relative column of products along the channel in a travelling direction d perpendicular to door  and feed the products one at a time into drop shaft each channel of the top tray  in fig  for example has for each column of products a spiral conveyor  for feeding the relative products in direction d to drop shaft  and each channel of the bottom tray  in fig  has for each column of products a belt conveyor  for feeding the relative products in direction d to drop shaft  via a respective selective product release device  both spiral conveyor  and belt conveyor  and relative release device  are known and commonly used in the product vending machine industry and therefore not described in detailto enable the operator to load the products easily onto trays  each tray  is mounted between lateral walls  so that when door  is opened the tray can be moved in direction d from the normal vending position top tray in fig  to a loading position bottom tray in fig  in which tray  projects partly from space  across drop shaft to permit this movement the frame of each tray  comprises two lateral guides not shown each of which is integral with an edge of the frame facing a corresponding lateral wall  is engaged in sliding manner by base  and removably engages at least two fastening cavities  which are coplanar with each other and with the cavities  engaged by the other lateral guide and lie in a horizontal plane perpendicular to door  more specifically the cavities  in each lateral wall  are arranged in at least two parallel vertical columns only one shown in fig  in each of which cavities  are equally spaced with a given centre distance p so the height of each tray  can be adjusted in use by the operator simply moving tray  to a different level as requiredas shown in figs   and  machine  also comprises a locking device  which when door  is closed locks all the trays  in their respective vending positions and when door  is open and one tray  is in the loading position locks all the other trays  in their respective vending positions ie only allows one tray  at a time to be extractedlocking device  comprises a rolling member retainer defined by a tubular guide  connected rigidly to a lateral wall  and extending vertically between trays  and drop shaft  and a column of rollers  fitted in transversely rolling manner to guide more specifically as shown in fig  and in more detail in fig  guide  is defined by a tubular csection profile defining an internal cavity  which is coaxial with a vertical axis  is open outwards through a longitudinal slit  on the side facing the opposite lateral wall  to the one supporting guide  and is closed at its axial ends by two stops  only the top one of which is shown in the drawings defining respective stops of guide each roller  has an axis  perpendicular to axis  and comprises two end portions   of the same diameter and of which portion  is housed in transversely rolling manner inside cavity  and a smallerdiameter centre portion  which connects portions  and  and engages slit  in transversely rolling manner to guide roller  along guide when locking device  is idle not shown the column of rollers  is seated loosely in guide  with an amount a of play along axis  equal to roughly the diameter of a roller  being free to roll along slit  rollers  therefore rest by gravity one on top of the other and on top of the bottom stop  not shown and a gap of size a equal to the amount of play is formed between the top stop  and the top roller  in the columnlocking device  also comprises wedging means designed to selectively fit between rollers  to eliminate the play between rollers  and so move the column of rollers  into a compact operating configuration in which the column of rollers  forms a barrier in front of trays  to prevent trays  in the vending position from moving into the loading positionas stated when door  is open the wedging means are activated by moving a tray  into the loading position to lock all the other trays  in the vending position or are activated by closing door  to lock all of trays  in the vending positionto achieve the first of the above locking modes the wedging means comprise for each tray  a rod  which is connected rigidly to the side of tray  facing the lateral wall  supporting guide  extends in a horizontal direction parallel to said lateral wall  and has a sharp end  which is positioned with its tip facing guide  lies in the tangency plane of two rollers  and is aligned with the contact line of the two rollers  consequently when one of trays  is moved together with respective rod  from the vending to the loading position fig  rod  is inserted between the two rollers  aligned horizontally with it so as to raise the column of rollers  above tray  each rod  is of a thickness substantially equal to the amount a of play so that when rod  is inserted between two rollers  aligned with it the top roller  in the column is pushed against the top stop  and rollers  assume the compact configuration preventing insertion of another rod as shown in fig  depending on the type of tray  and the space available on it rod  may be located on a top edge of the side  facing guide  as in the case of tray  with belt conveyor  or on the outside of side  on a lateral edge of base  as in the case of tray  with spiral conveyor regardless of where rod  is located on tray  it is important that end  be substantially aligned horizontally with the contact line of two rollers  so that rod  fits smoothly between the two rollers  when tray  is moved into the loading positionaccordingly and since as stated trays  can be positioned at different heights inside space  by means of cavities  the centre distance of rollers  equals the centre distance of cavities  once the correct position of rod  on tray  is established the above alignment is therefore achieved for each height of tray  inside space to lock all of trays  when door  is closed the wedging means comprise a wedge member  located between door  and guide  close to the top stop  and defined by a substantially rectangular plate this has a projection  on the side facing guide  and is hinged to wall  to oscillate about a pin  parallel to axes  between a rest position figs   assumed when door  is open and in which wedge member  does not interfere with guide  or the column of rollers  and a work position fig  assumed when door  is closed and trays  are all in the vending position and in which wedge member  is pushed against guide  by a fixed push member  integral with door  so that projection  completely fills the gap between top stop  and the top roller  in the column thus eliminating the play between guide  and rollers  which therefore assume the compact configuration so that when door  is closed none of trays  can move out of the vending positionoperation of machine  is clear from the above description with no further explanation requiredto conclude it should be pointed out that in a version not shown as opposed to being located along drop shaft  guide  may be located in the rear of space  alongside trays  in which case transmission members are interposed between each tray  and respective rod  and between push member  and wedge member  so that movement of tray  moves rod  and movement of push member  moves wedge member  as described above  previous patent selfserve kiosk wit      next patent product delivery and  home search
