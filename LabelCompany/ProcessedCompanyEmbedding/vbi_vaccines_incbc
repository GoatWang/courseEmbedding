our products and product candidates face and will continue to face intense competition from large pharmaceutical companies specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as well as academic and research institutions we compete in an industry that is characterized by i rapid technological change ii evolving industry standards iii emerging competition and iv new product introductions competitors have existing products and technologies that will compete with our product candidates and technologies and may develop and commercialize additional products and technologies that will compete with our product candidates and technologies because several competing companies and institutions have greater financial resources than us they may be able to i provide broader services and product lines ii make greater investments in research and development “rd” and iii carry on larger rd initiatives competitors also have greater development capabilities than we do and have substantially greater experience in undertaking nonclinical and clinical testing of products obtaining regulatory approvals and manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products they also have greater name recognition and better access to customers our chief competitors in the field of hbv vaccines include companies such as pfizer dynavax technologies merck  co “merck” sanofi pasteur and gsk we face general market competition from several subsectors of the vaccine development field including i large multinational pharmaceutical companies including sanofi gsk merck and pfizer inc ii midsize pharmaceutical companies and emerging biotechnology companies including takeda pharmaceutical company limited dynavax technologies corporation genocea biosciences inc mitsubishi tanabe pharma corporation vical inc and hookipa biotech ag and iii academic and notforprofit vaccine researchers and developers including the national institutes of health and butantan institute the industry is typified by extensive collaboration licensing and merger and acquisition activity despite the intense competition within the cmv vaccine space we have several key competitors some of whom are further advanced with their cmv vaccine development as compared to us among these merck has a highly potent vaccine based on a replication of a defective cmv virus with an adjuvant and is completing a phase i clinical trial additionally hookipa biotech ag has initiated clinical development of hb   a prophylactic cmv vaccine based on its vaxwave™ technology despite this competition we believe there are reasons why our cmv vaccine may have some advantages including that i our vaccine is based on the successful vlp category of vaccines which has recently been used in the successful introduction of cervical cancer vaccines ii it is currently expected to use aluminum phosphate as an adjuvant which has a more extensive history of safety through its inclusion in several pediatric vaccines and iii it has demonstrated competitive anticmv responses in preclinical animal models we believe that these advantages merit advancement of the product candidate but do not guarantee its success company

vbi is a commercialstage biopharmaceutical company developing next generation vaccines to address unmet needs in infectious disease and immunooncology we currently manufacture our product scibvactm a third generation hepatitis b hbv vaccine for adults children and newborns which is approved for use in israel and  other countries scibvactm but has not yet been approved by the us food and drug

developing a clinical program to obtain fda and ema market approvals for commercial sale of scibvactm in the united states and the european union the eu respectively vbi recently received positive scientific advice from the committee for medicinal products for human use chmp of the ema regarding the companys development path for its scibvactm vaccine in europe in its letter the chmp expressed its support of vbis proposed plan to proceed to the phase iii clinical studies of scibvactm the chmp also agreed that the product information as well as data from ongoing studies supports the phase iii clinical studies and vbis planned filing of a market authorization application maa for scibvactm our whollyowned subsidiary in rehovot israel currently manufactures and sells scibvactm as a result of our acquisition of vbi vaccines delaware inc vbi de on may   see background of vbi de below we are developing novel technologies that seek to enhance vaccine protection in large underserved markets these include an enveloped virus like particle or evlp vaccine platform that allows for the design of enveloped viruslike particle vaccines that closely mimic the target viruses vbi is advancing a pipeline of evlp vaccines with lead programs in human cytomegalovirus cmv an infection that while common can lead to serious complications in babies and people with weak immune systems and is involved in the progression of glioblastoma multiforme gbm which is a form of brain cancer in september  the company completed the enrollment and initial dosing of  participants in the phase i clinical study to evaluate its preventative cmv vaccine candidate the phase i study is designed to assess the safety and tolerability of vbis cmv vaccine candidate in  healthy cmvnegative adults the study will also measure levels of vaccineinduced cmv neutralizing antibodies that may prevent cmv infection preliminary results are anticipated in the first half of  the company is also advancing its lpvtm thermostability platform a proprietary formulation and process that allows vaccines and biologics to preserve stability potency and safety we may also seek to inlicense clinicalstage vaccines that we believe complement our product portfolio in addition to technologies that may supplement our therapeutic vaccination efforts in immunooncology at present the companys operations are focused on  manufacturing and sale of scibvactm in territories where it is currently registered  continuing the phase iv trial in israel as described above  preparing for scibvactm clinical trials to support various marketing authorizations in the us canada and europe  conducting human proofofconcept clinical trials with our cmv vaccine candidate  continuing preclinical development of our gbm vaccine candidate  scalingup manufacturing capabilities to commercialize products and dose forms for which we may obtain regulatory approval  continuing the research and development of our product candidates including the exploration and development of new product candidates  providing contracted services primarily to customers in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors  adding operational financial and management information systems and human resources support including additional personnel to support our vaccine development  maintaining expanding and protecting our intellectual property portfolio vbis income generating activities have been from sales of its scibvactm product in markets that have generated a limited number of sales todate as well as fees from rd services vbi has also incurred significant net losses and negative operating cash flows since inception as of december   vbi had an accumulated deficit of approximately  million and stockholders equity of approximately  million our ability to maintain our status as an operating company is dependent upon obtaining adequate cash to finance our clinical development our administrative overhead and our research and development activities we plan to finance future operations with a combination of existing cash reserves proceeds from the issuance of equity securities the issuance of additional debt and revenues from potential collaborations if any there is no assurance the company will manage to obtain these sources of financing these factors raise substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern the accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern the financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should we be unable to continue as a going concern we have incurred operating losses since inception have not generated significant product sales revenue and have not achieved profitable operations we incurred net losses of  million for the year ended december   and we expect to continue to incur substantial losses in future periods we anticipate that our operating expenses will increase substantially as we continue the clinical development of the scibvactm product and cmv vaccine candidate as well as advance our preclinicalstage product candidate gbm these include expenses related to  conducting human proofofconcept clinical trials including the continuation of the cmv phase i clinical trial a planned gbm phase i clinical trial and preparation for a scibvactm phase iii trial will require significant financial resources  continuing the research and development of our product candidates  scalingup manufacturing capabilities through subcontractors to commercialize products and dose forms for which we may obtain regulatory approval  maintaining expanding and protecting our intellectual property portfolio  hiring additional clinical manufacturing and scientific personnel or contractors and  adding operational financial and management information systems and human resources support including additional personnel to support our vaccine development in addition we have incurred and will continue to incur significant expenses as a public company which subjects us to the reporting requirements of the exchange act the sarbanesoxley act and the rules and regulations of the nasdaq capital market in  we raised  million in equity and  million in debt financing to support our scibvactm cmv and gbm vaccine program to continue the advancement of our research programs and for other general corporate purposes based upon our current cash position and by monitoring our discretionary expenditures as well as the careful management of our clinical trial commitments and operating costs we believe these proceeds will be sufficient to fund our activities including our approved capital expenditure requirements into  we expect however that we will need to secure additional financing in the future to carry out all of our planned clinical regulatory rd sales and manufacturing activities with respect to the advancement of our scibvactm and new vaccine candidates since inception vbi and its subsidiaries collectively have raised approximately  million in total equity and debt financing to support clinical and research development and general business operations rd services pursuant to an agreement with the office of the chief scientist in israel the company is required to make services available for the biotechnology industry in israel these services include relevant activities for development and manufacturing of therapeutic proteins according to international standards and cgmp quality level suitable for toxicological studies in animals and clinical studies phase i  ii in humans service activities include analyticsbio analytics methods for development and process development of therapeutic proteins starting with a lead candidate clone through the upstream purification formulation and filling processes and manufacturing for phase i  ii clinical trials these rd services are primarily marketed to the israeli research community in academia and israeli biotechnology companies in the life sciences lacking the infrastructure or experience in the development and production of therapeutic proteins in the standards and quality required for clinical trials for human use in  and  the company provided

manufacturing clinical trial materials and other consumables and lab supplies used in our preclinical studies  expenses incurred under agreements with contractors or contract manufacturing organizations to advance the cmv vaccine into clinical trials and  employeerelated expenses including salaries benefits travel and stockbased compensation expense we expense research and development

travel and conference fees including board and scientific advisory board meeting costs rent maintenance of facilities depreciation office supplies and expenses insurance and other general expenses general and administrative expenses are expensed when incurred we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as a result of adding employees and scaling our operations commensurate with advancing a clinical candidate and continuing to support a public company infrastructure these increases will likely include increased costs for insurance hiring of additional personnel board committees outside consultants investor relations lawyers and accountants among other expenses interest income interest income consists principally of interest income earned

technology this onetime cost was not repeated during the year ended december   during the year ended december   the decrease in the cost of rd due to the nonrecurrence of the technology acquisition was largely offset by the rd expenses incurred by vbi de since the vbiscivac merger in the amount of  million these costs included fees paid to cros and other contractors in support of the trials as

partially offset by the nonrecurrence of professional and transaction fees arising from the levon merger that closed july   net loss from operations the net loss from operations for the year ended december   was  as compared to  for the year ended december   the  increase in the net loss from operations resulted from the increased rd and ga costs resulting from the vbiscivac merger largely offset by the nonrecurrence of  in costs related to the dnase technology that were incurred during the year ended december   discussed above interest expense net the interest expense decrease of  is a result of the deemed interest of certain previously outstanding related party loans that were held in scivac prior to the levon merger these loans and capital notes were exchanged for common shares of the company as part of the levon merger this decrease was partially offset by  of interest recorded in  related to the longterm loan in  the interest expense relates to the interest on the debt

loss the net loss decreased by  or  from  for the year ended december   to  for the year ended december   the decrease in our net loss is mainly attributable to the decrease in our loss from

of  at december   working capital is calculated by subtracting current liabilities from current assets we expect that we will need to secure additional financing in the future to carry out all of our planned clinical regulatory rd sales and manufacturing activities with respect to the advancement of our scibvactm and new vaccine candidates we base this belief on assumptions that are subject to change and we may be required to use our available cash resources sooner than we currently expect the company expects a need to raise additional funds in order to continue its ongoing development programs the additional funds may be in the form of additional debt equity or a combination of both and may require that additional warrants be issued the accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern however the above conditions raise substantial doubt about the companys ability to do so the financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should the company be unable to continue as a going concern on june   the company closed an equity private placement under the terms of the financing the company sold an aggregate of  of its common shares at a price of approximately  per share for total gross proceeds of approximately  million as previously disclosed the company has and will continue to use the proceeds from the private placement for working capital and general corporate purposes including the continued development of its growing vaccine pipeline the securities sold in the private placement have not been registered under the securities act of  as amended and may not be resold absent registration under or exemption from such act contemporaneously with the december  transaction discussed below an additional  common shares were issued pursuant to an antidilution provision included in the share purchase agreement on december   we raised  million in an equity financing transaction with perceptive life sciences master fund ltd and titanperc ltd under the terms of the equity financing we sold an aggregate of  of our common shares at a price of  per share for total gross proceeds of approximately  million in a concurrent debt financing transaction with perceptive credit holdings lp perceptive credit we raised an additional  million net of  in deferring financing charges additionally perceptive credit increased its current credit agreement with us by funding an additional  million in secured debt in conjunction with the additional debt funding we issued a year warrant to perceptive credit for the purchase of an aggregate of  common shares up to  of the common shares underlying the warrant may be exercised at a price of  per share and up to  of the common shares underlying the warrant may be exercised at a price of  per share we have and will continue to use the proceeds of the private placement for working capital and general corporate purposes including the continued development of our growing vaccine pipeline our actual future capital requirements will depend on many factors including the progress and results of our clinical trials the duration and cost of discovery and preclinical development laboratory testing and clinical trials for our products the timing and outcome of regulatory review of our products product sales outside of israel the costs involved in preparing filing prosecuting maintaining defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights the number and development requirements of other product candidates that we pursue and the costs of commercialization activities including product marketing sales and distribution the company will require significant additional funds to conduct clinical and nonclinical trials achieve regulatory approvals and subject to such approvals commercially launch its products if adequate funds are not available in order to continue operations the company may be required to delay reduce the scope of or eliminate our research and development programs reduce our planned commercialization efforts or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain product candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently we may need to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity offerings debt financings or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements although we are pursuing different opportunities other than as disclosed in this report we currently do not have any signed commitments for future external funding we may need to raise additional funds more quickly if one or more of our assumptions prove to be incorrect or if we choose to expand our product development efforts more rapidly than we presently anticipate we may also decide to raise additional funds even before we need them if the conditions for raising capital are favorable the sale of additional equity or debt securities will likely result in dilution to our shareholders the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also result in covenants that would restrict our operations

manufacturing facility for maintenance and upgrades research and development rd expenses for the three months ended march   were  as compared to  for the three months ended march   during the three

current liabilities from current assets we expect that we will need to secure additional financing in the future to carry out all of our planned clinical regulatory rd sales and manufacturing activities with respect to the advancement of scibvactm and new vaccine candidates we base this belief on assumptions that are subject to change and we may be required to use our available cash resources sooner than we currently expect the company expects a need to raise additional funds in order to continue its ongoing development programs the additional funds may be in the form of additional debt equity or a combination of both and may require that additional warrants be issued the report of our independent registered public accounting firm on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   contains an explanatory paragraph regarding our ability to continue as a going concern the accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern however the above conditions raise substantial doubt about the companys ability to do so the financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should the company be unable to continue as a going concern on june   the company closed an equity private placement under the terms of the financing the company sold an aggregate of  of its common shares at a price of approximately  per share for total gross proceeds of approximately  million as previously disclosed the company has and will continue to use the proceeds from the private placement for working capital and general corporate purposes including the continued development of its growing vaccine pipeline the securities sold in the private placement have not been registered under the securities act and may not be resold absent registration under or exemption from the securities act on december   we raised  million in an equity financing transaction with perceptive life sciences master fund ltd and titanperc ltd under the terms of the equity financing we sold an aggregate of  of our common shares at a price of  per share for total gross proceeds of approximately  million in a concurrent debt financing transaction with perceptive credit holdings lp perceptive credit we raised an additional  million net of  in deferring financing charges additionally perceptive credit increased its current credit agreement with us by funding an additional  million in secured debt in conjunction with the additional debt funding we issued a year warrant to perceptive credit for the purchase of an aggregate of  common shares up to  of the common shares underlying the warrant may be exercised at a price of  per share and up to  of the common shares underlying the warrant may be exercised at a price of  per share we have and will continue to use the proceeds of the private placement for working capital and general corporate purposes including the continued development of our growing vaccine pipeline our actual future capital requirements will depend on many factors including the progress and results of our clinical studies the duration and cost of discovery and preclinical development laboratory testing and clinical studies for our products the timing and outcome of regulatory review of our products product sales outside of israel the costs involved in preparing filing prosecuting maintaining defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights the number and development requirements of other product candidates that we pursue and the costs of commercialization activities including product marketing sales and distribution the company will require significant additional funds to conduct clinical and nonclinical studies achieve regulatory approvals and subject to such approvals commercially launch its products if adequate funds are not available in order to continue operations the company may be required to delay reduce the scope of or eliminate our research and development programs reduce our planned commercialization efforts or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain product candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently we may need to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity offerings debt financings or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements although we are pursuing different opportunities other than as disclosed in this form q we currently do not have any signed commitments for future external funding we may need to raise additional funds more quickly if one or more of our assumptions prove to be incorrect or if we choose to expand our product development efforts more rapidly than we presently anticipate we may also decide to raise additional funds even before we need them if the conditions for raising capital are favorable the sale of additional equity or debt securities will likely result in dilution to our stockholders additional equity or debt financing grants or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements may not be available on acceptable terms if at all to the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities or obtaining borrowings convertible into equity ownership dilution to existing stockholders will result and future investors may be granted rights superior to those of existing stockholders the incurrence of indebtedness or debt financing would result in increased fixed obligations and could also result in covenants that would restrict our operations our ability to obtain additional capital may depend on prevailing economic conditions and financial business and other factors beyond our control the unstable economic environment in the eu the recent us election and disruptions in the us and global financial markets may adversely impact the availability and cost of credit as well as our ability to raise money in the capital markets current economic conditions have been and continue to be volatile continued instability in these market conditions may limit our ability to access the capital necessary to fund and grow our business net cash used by operating activities the company incurred net losses of  and  in the three months ended march   and  respectively the company used  and  in cash for operating activities during the three months ended march   and  respectively the increase in cash outflows is largely as a result of increased professional fees and additional operating costs related to the vbiscivac merger transaction as well as increased rd expenses related to the advancement of the cmv and scibvactm vaccines net cash provided by investing activities cash flows used in investing activities increased by  from  for the three months ended march   to  for the three months ended march   largely related to the purchase of additional property and equipment in scivac going forward the company will be required to refresh some information technology equipment and to purchase additional rd equipment net cash received from financing activities cash flows related to financing activities were not significant in three months ended march   and  the companys longterm success and ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon obtaining sufficient capital to fund the research and development of its products to bring about their successful commercial release to generate revenue and ultimately to attain profitable operations or alternatively to advance its products and technology to such a point that they would be attractive candidates for acquisition by others in the industry to date the company has been able to obtain financing as and when it was needed however there is no assurance that financing will be available in the future or if it is that it will be available at acceptable terms offbalance sheet arrangements as of march   we had no offbalance sheet arrangements commitment and contingencies leases the remaining minimum annual lease commitments relating to office lab and manufacturing facilities during the next five years are as follows see

infections are “silent” meaning most people who are infected with cmv exhibit no signs or symptoms however cmv can cause serious disease in newborns when a mother is infected during pregnancy – this is known as congenital cmv infection each year approximately  us infants will develop permanent problems due to cmv some of them severe including deafness blindness and mental retardation cmv affects more live births than down syndrome or fetal alcohol syndrome making it a key public health priority and a strong candidate for recommended universal vaccination among certain highrisk populations lpv™ platform the lpv platform is a proprietary formulation and process that allows vaccines and biologics to preserve stability potency and safety many vaccines and biologics are highly sensitive to temperature and physical stress and many must be stored between ° c and ° c to preserve their integrity without proper storage exposure to elevated or freezing temperatures can lead to a loss in potency or reduced safety limiting protective benefits or therapeutic effects learn more  platform highlights longlasting stability across a variety of conditions demonstrated potency in multiple preclinical animal models including nonhuman primates suitable for a variety of vaccines and biologics has been used to preserve stability and potency of several classes of vaccine antigens including proteinbased monoclonal antibodies wholeinactivated and liveattenuated vaccines and viral vectors successfully tested in a gmpcompliant production plant at pilot levels data demonstrates product consistency across batches novel fully synthetic lipid combinations with wellestablished safety profiles lipids reduce protein aggregation and reduce other processrelated sheer stresses

conditions proof of concept studies influenza  months at ° c rabies  months at ° c mmr  weeks at ° c herceptin®like  weeks at ° c vaccines and biologics vary greatly in their ability to remain viable during handling storage and administration the stability of a particular vaccine formulation depends on many factors including the type of antigen active ingredient and the presence of other vaccine components such as adjuvants stabilizers and preservatives one factor that is known to affects characteristics of all vaccines over time is temperature without a constant temperature in a very narrow range above freezing many vaccines lose their potency become ineffective or can become hazardous currently more than  of all vaccines require shipment in a temperature controlled supply chain or “cold chain” reliance on a cold chain increases vaccine costs by up to  and is a significant barrier to patient access in many emerging markets in addition to maintaining the cold chain there is a separate challenge of verifying any lapses in the chain to ensure the viability of the vaccine before it is administered particularly in poor or remote areas references evlp platform kirchmeier et al

immunooncology vbi’s first marketed product is scibvac™ a hepatitis b “hbv” vaccine that mimics all three viral surface antigens of the hepatitis b virus scibvac™ is approved for use in israel and  other countries recently vbi completed a postmarketing phase iv clinical study in israel to confirm a new inhouse reference standard for regulatory and quality control purposes scibvac™ has not yet been approved by the us food and drug administration the “fda” the european medicines agency the “ema” or health canada “hc” vbi is currently developing a phase iii clinical program to obtain fda ema and hc market approvals for commercial sale of scibvac™ in the united states europe and canada respectively our whollyowned subsidiary scivac ltd manufactures scibvac™ in rehovot israel   we are also advancing our two platform technologies – our enveloped viruslike particle “evlp” platform technology and our lipid particle vaccine “lpv” technology our evlp platform technology enables the development of enveloped viruslike particle vaccines that closely mimic the target virus to elicit a potent immune response we are advancing a pipeline of evlp vaccines with lead programs in both infectious disease with our congenital cytomegalovirus “cmv” vaccine and in immunooncology with our therapeutic glioblastoma multiforme “gbm” or “glioblastoma” vaccine candidate our lpv thermostability technology is a proprietary formulation of lipids and process that allows vaccines and biologics to preserve stability potency and safety at temperatures outside of the most common cold chain storage requirements of  o c to  o c   vbi is headquartered in cambridge ma with research operations in ottawa canada and manufacturing facilities in rehovot israel   our principal products   our principal products include our hepatitis b vaccine scibvac™ our congenital cmv vaccine our therapeutic gbm vaccine our evlp platform and our lpv platform   scibvac™   scibvac™ is a third generation hepatitis b “hbv” vaccine which is approved for use in israel and in  other countries firstgeneration hepatitis b vaccines were plasmaderived and were developed in the us and in france in the late s in the mids secondgeneration recombinant dnabased vaccines were constructed using yeasts transfected with dna sequences coding for the hbv s antigen these secondgeneration vaccines are currently used for universal vaccination efforts in many countries worldwide in contrast to these secondgeneration hbv vaccines which contain only one surface antigen of hbv the s antigen scibvac™ contains all three surface antigens the s antigen the pres and the pres antigens furthermore scibvac™ is produced in mammalian cho cells whereas secondgeneration vaccines are produced in yeast the composition of scibvac™ may provide more opportunities for the immune system to respond with antibodies or neutralizing antibodies which can recognize one or more components of the hbv virus   several clinical studies have demonstrated that scibvac™ possesses the following benefits relating to the prevention of the hbv virus   ● high levels of antihbv antibodies sufficient to confer immune memory for longterm protection against hepatitis b     ● rapid onset of protection     ● administration at lower doses than competing hepatitis b vaccines and       ● free of nextgeneration adjuvants – scibvac™ is adjuvanted with alum              in the last two decades  clinical studies in over  patients have been completed using the current andor prior formulations of scibvac™ additionally product distribution data globally estimates that over  infants and adults have been vaccinated with scibvac™ in headtohead comparative studies all formulations of scibvac™ have consistently demonstrated higher rates of seroprotection earlier in adult populations compared to currently licensed hepatitis b vaccines the most recent clinical study was a postmarketing phase iv study conducted in israel to support the marketing license and to confirm a new inhouse reference standard for regulatory and quality control purposes this study was conducted in  healthy hbvseronegative males and females between  and  years of age –  of participants were seroprotected at month  two months after receiving a second dose of scibvac™   scibvac™ is generally welltolerated by patients during the clinical development and studies of scibvac™ approximately  of the patients experienced local reactions at the injection site as commonly observed with the use of most vaccines the injection site reactions included soreness pain tenderness pruritus which is itchiness erythema which is redness ecchymosis which is discoloration of the skin resulting from bleeding underneath the skin swelling warmth and nodule formation these reactions were generally mild and were resolved within two days after vaccination additionally fatigue weakness headache fever malaise nausea diarrhea pharyngitis which is inflammation of the pharynx and upper respiratory infection were observed   we believe the clinical data collected to date from the previous  clinical studies is sufficient to support a phase iii clinical program which when completed would allow us to seek marketing authorization approval “maa” by the fda ema and hc we are in the process of finalizing the protocols negotiating clinical trial agreements and finalizing clinical sites for the proposed phase iii clinical program   on february   we announced that we received positive scientific advice from the committee for medicinal products for human use “chmp” of the ema regarding our development path for scibvac™ in europe in its letter the chmp expressed its support of our proposed plan to proceed to the phase iii clinical studies of scibvac™ the chmp also agreed that the product information as well as data from ongoing studies supports the phase iii clinical studies and our planned filing of an maa for scibvac™   on february   we announced that the biologics and genetic therapies directorate “bgtd” of hc expressed its general support and acceptance of our development path for scibvac™ in a preclinical trial application “cta” meeting a complete cta must be filed with and approved by bgtd and all conditions of bgtd must be met prior to the initiation of a clinical program in canada given the extensive manufacturing data licensed clinical efficacy and safety experience of scibvac™ bgtd agreed in principle with our overall development strategy in addition bgtd agreed that the proposed phase iii program would satisfy the regulatory requirements for marketing authorization in canada supporting the indication for active immunization against hepatitis b in adults   we had similar discussions with the fda in a preind meeting held on april     scibvac™ is currently manufactured by our whollyowned subsidiary scivac ltd in its manufacturing facility in rehovot israel   congenital cmv vaccine candidate   our lead program using our evlp technology targets congenital cmv which is a leading cause of birth defects while cmv is a common virus that infects one in every two people in many developed countries most cmv infections are asymptomatic however cmv can cause serious disease in newborns if the mother is infected during pregnancy – this is called congenital cmv infection each year approximately  us infants will develop permanent problems due to cmv infection including deafness blindness and intellectual disability cmv affects more live births than any other cause of birth defects including down syndrome or fetal alcohol syndrome making it a key public health priority and a strong candidate for recommended universal vaccination              our vaccine candidate expresses the cmv gb antigen on the surface of the evlp preclinical data demonstrated that the structure of the evlp platform generated stronger neutralizing antibodies than immunization with the same gb target protein alone our cmv vaccine is also adjuvanted with alum a safe fdaapproved adjuvant our cmv vaccine has shown promise in early preclinical animal models including in rabbits and in mice with the ability to generate anticmv antibodies and cmv neutralizing responses in both fibroblasts and epithelial cells – two clinicallyrelevant cell types that are susceptible to cmv infection   with the acquisition of vbi de in  a significant rd priority has been the cmv vaccine candidate’s gmp manufacturing and its clinical development our cmv vaccine candidate was designed internally and its manufacturing and purification processes were designed by the nrc in collaboration with our staff such processes and internal knowledge were transferred to our selected gmp manufacturer paragon bioservices “paragon” and required significant project management expertise and confirmatory rd studies throughout  in  we engaged a contract research organization itr laboratories canada inc and completed glp toxicology studies to confirm the safety of the cmv vaccine candidate in animals we initiated a phase i clinical study in june  to assess the safety and tolerability of our cmv vaccine candidate in healthy cmvnegative adults the study will also assess the vaccine immunogenicity by measuring levels of vaccineinduced cmv neutralizing antibodies we completed enrollment and initial dosing of  participants in september  as of may  all participants had received the third and final immunization in the series interim phase i clinical study results are anticipated midyear    therapeutic gbm vaccines   we have also applied our evlp platform in the development of a therapeutic gbm vaccine candidate gbm is among the most common and aggressive malignant primary brain tumors in humans in the us alone  new cases are diagnosed each year the current standard of care for gbm is surgical resection followed by radiation and chemotherapy even with aggressive treatment however gbm progresses rapidly and is exceptionally lethal with median patient survival of less than  months   developing a broadly applicable gbm immunotherapy requires the identification of antigens used to direct the immune response which are consistently expressed on tumor cells a growing body of research has demonstrated that gbm tumors are susceptible to infection by cmv with over  of gbm tumors expressing cmv antigens targeting cmv antigens therefore may represent an attractive strategy for gbm immunotherapy   we intend to create a gbm immunotherapy that will stimulate the patient’s own immune system to identify and kill gbm cancer cells with the goal of creating a commerciallyviable therapy that is more effective and tolerable than current treatments leveraging the flexibility and potency of our evlp platform technology we are developing a polyvalent therapeutic vaccine candidate designed to direct an immune response against gb and pp two cmv antigens that are highly immunogenic targets during natural cmv infection our vaccine candidate also includes granulocytemacrophage colonystimulating factor “gmcsf” an adjuvant that mobilized dendritic function and enhances thtype immunity   ex vivo studies demonstrate the vaccine candidate’s ability to induce desired antitumor immunity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells “pbmcs” harvested from healthy subjects and patients with gbm gbm patient samples were provided by columbia university’s brain tumor center our vaccine candidate also stimulated both cd and cd t cell responses characterized by secretion of ifng and ccl key biomarkers associated with positive clinical outcomes   vbi expects to file an investigational new drug “ind” application with the fda midyear  to initiate a phase iiia clinical study in patients with gbm   evlp vaccine platform   on august   vbi cda acquired the evlp vaccine technology through the acquisition of epixis sa evlps are an innovative new class of synthetic vaccines that are designed to closely mimic the structure of viruses because of their structural similarity to viruses found in nature vaccination with a target protein expressed in an evlp is capable of imparting greater immunity than vaccination with the same recombinant target protein alone evlps are also highly customizable which allows vbi to rationally design preventative and therapeutic vaccine candidates by controlling the expression of both surface and internal target proteins of interest              evlps are produced after transient transfection of cells with plasmids encoding the murine leukemia virus “mlv” gag and target surface or internal proteins of interest the mlv gag expression induces “budding” of particles from the membrane of transfected cells – the target protein of interest is incorporated into the outer envelope during the budding process evlps are purified using a process designed to yield material with acceptable residual host cell impurities batch consistency has also been demonstrated using in vivo potency release assays   in addition to the  initial payment for the technology and  in related transaction costs we paid approximately  and  in milestone payments under the epixis licensing agreement in the years ended december   and  respectively   we expect to continue to explore potential therapeutic and scientific targets where our evlp platform technology can be used effectively to generate new vaccine programs   lpv platform   the lpv thermostability platform is a proprietary formulation and process that allows vaccines and biologics to preserve stability potency and safety many vaccines and biologics are highly sensitive to temperatues and physical stress as a consequence  of vaccines are transported and stored in a “cold chain” of temperaturecontrolled environments between  o c to  o c without proper storage exposure to elevated or freezing temperatures can lead to a loss in potency or reduced safety limiting protective benefits or therapeutic effects additionally reliance on a cold chain increases vaccine costs by up to  and is a significant barrier to patient access in many emerging markets   our lipid particle vaccine technology or “lpv” technology is a vaccine formulation technology that enables the thermostabilization of vaccines through a proprietary formulation and freezedrying process the technology is constituted by three lipids monopalmitoylglycerol “mpg” dicetyl phosphate “dcp” and cholesterol mixed in a proprietary ratio with vaccine antigen using a patented method the resulting mixture is then lyophilized freeze dried and can be stored for extended periods of time outside of the coldchain   we have active collaborations with both sanofi pasteur and glaxosmithkline two of the leading vaccine producers in the world vbi is working with sanofi to explore reformulation a sanofi vaccine candidate to improve stability under the terms of the sanofi agreement sanofi can also acquire certain rights to extend its use of the lpv technology to additional vaccine assets in february  we entered into the research collaboration with gsk which provides gsk with the rights to negotiate an exclusive license to the lpv technology for use within a defined field   in the normal course of our business we assess and consider potential acquisition or collaboration opportunities to gain access to technologies or assets that are adjacent to our core competencies of immunology and formulation development we are currently exploring this lpv technology further through partnerships with other thirdparty collaborators   our research and development efforts   we invest heavily in rd rd expenses which includes clinical development and regulatory related costs were  million for the year ended december   and  million for the year ended december   all rd was funded by equity term loan or convertible note financings or government grants and refundable rd tax credits our most significant rd expense has been and is expected to continue to be related mainly to our development of a cmv vaccine candidate and the related evlp platform such rd expenses are expected to increase significantly as the vaccine moves into the clinical development stage and we explore other vaccine opportunities andor collaborations              with the acquisition of vbi de in  a significant rd priority has been the cmv vaccine candidate’s gmp manufacturing and its clinical development our cmv vaccine candidate was designed internally and its manufacturing and purification

stage biopharmaceutical company developing next generation vaccines to address unmet needs in infectious disease and immunooncology vbi’s first marketed product is scibvac™ a hepatitis b “hbv” vaccine that mimics all three viral surface antigens of the hepatitis b virus scibvac™ is approved for use in israel and  other countries recently vbi completed a postmarketing phase iv clinical study in israel to confirm a new inhouse reference standard for regulatory and quality control purposes scibvac™ has not yet been approved by the us food and drug administration the “fda” the european medicines agency the “ema” or health canada “hc” vbi is currently developing a phase iii clinical program to obtain fda ema and hc market approvals for commercial sale of scibvac™ in the united states europe and canada respectively our whollyowned subsidiary scivac ltd manufactures scibvac™ in rehovot israel   we are also advancing our two platform technologies – our enveloped viruslike particle “evlp” platform technology and our lipid particle vaccine “lpv” technology our evlp platform technology enables the development of enveloped viruslike particle vaccines that closely mimic the target virus to elicit a potent immune response we are advancing a pipeline of evlp vaccines with lead programs in both infectious disease with our congenital cytomegalovirus “cmv” vaccine and in immunooncology with our therapeutic glioblastoma multiforme “gbm” or “glioblastoma” vaccine candidate our lpv thermostability technology is a proprietary formulation of lipids and process that allows vaccines and biologics to preserve stability potency and safety at temperatures outside of the most common cold chain storage requirements of  o c to  o c   vbi is headquartered in cambridge ma with research operations in ottawa canada and manufacturing facilities in rehovot israel   our principal products   our principal products include our hepatitis b vaccine scibvac™ our congenital cmv vaccine our therapeutic gbm vaccine our evlp platform and our lpv platform   scibvac™   scibvac™ is a third generation hepatitis b “hbv” vaccine which is approved for use in israel and in  other countries firstgeneration hepatitis b vaccines were plasmaderived and were developed in the us and in france in the late s in the mids secondgeneration recombinant dnabased vaccines were constructed using yeasts transfected with dna sequences coding for the hbv s antigen these secondgeneration vaccines are currently used for universal vaccination efforts in many countries worldwide in contrast to these secondgeneration hbv vaccines which contain only one surface antigen of hbv the s antigen scibvac™ contains all three surface antigens the s antigen the pres and the pres antigens furthermore scibvac™ is produced in mammalian cho cells whereas secondgeneration vaccines are produced in yeast the composition of scibvac™ may provide more opportunities for the immune system to respond with antibodies or neutralizing antibodies which can recognize one or more components of the hbv virus   several clinical studies have demonstrated that scibvac™ possesses the following benefits relating to the prevention of the hbv virus   ● high levels of antihbv antibodies sufficient to confer immune memory for longterm protection against hepatitis b     ● rapid onset of protection     ● administration at lower doses than competing hepatitis b vaccines and     ● free of nextgeneration adjuvants – scibvac™ is adjuvanted with alum     s        in the last two decades  clinical studies in over  patients have been completed using the current andor prior formulations of scibvac™ additionally product distribution data globally estimates that over  infants and adults have been vaccinated with scibvac™ in headtohead comparative studies all formulations of scibvac™ have consistently demonstrated higher rates of seroprotection earlier in adult populations compared to currently licensed hepatitis b vaccines the most recent clinical study was a postmarketing phase iv study conducted in israel to support the marketing license and to confirm a new inhouse reference standard for regulatory and quality control purposes this study was conducted in  healthy hbvseronegative males and females between  and  years of age –  of participants were seroprotected at month  two months after receiving a second dose of scibvac™   scibvac™ is generally welltolerated by patients during the clinical development and studies of scibvac™ approximately  of the patients experienced local reactions at the injection site as commonly observed with the use of most vaccines the injection site reactions included soreness pain tenderness pruritus which is itchiness erythema which is redness ecchymosis which is discoloration of the skin resulting from bleeding underneath the skin swelling warmth and nodule formation these reactions were generally mild and were resolved within two days after vaccination additionally fatigue weakness headache fever malaise nausea diarrhea pharyngitis which is inflammation of the pharynx and upper respiratory infection were observed   we believe the clinical data collected to date from the previous  clinical studies is sufficient to support a phase iii clinical program which when completed would allow us to seek marketing authorization approval “maa” by the fda ema and hc we are in the process of finalizing the protocols negotiating clinical trial agreements and finalizing clinical sites for the proposed phase iii clinical program   on february   we announced that we received positive scientific advice from the committee for medicinal products for human use “chmp” of the ema regarding our development path for scibvac™ in europe in its letter the chmp expressed its support of our proposed plan to proceed to the phase iii clinical studies of scibvac™ the chmp also agreed that the product information as well as data from ongoing studies supports the phase iii clinical studies and our planned filing of an maa for scibvac™   on february   we announced that the biologics and genetic therapies directorate “bgtd” of hc expressed its general support and acceptance of our development path for scibvac™ in a preclinical trial application “cta” meeting a complete cta must be filed with and approved by bgtd and all conditions of bgtd must be met prior to the initiation of a clinical program in canada given the extensive manufacturing data licensed clinical efficacy and safety experience of scibvac™ bgtd agreed in principle with our overall development strategy in addition bgtd agreed that the proposed phase iii program would satisfy the regulatory requirements for marketing authorization in canada supporting the indication for active immunization against hepatitis b in adults   we had similar discussions with the fda in a preind meeting held on april     scibvac™ is currently manufactured by our whollyowned subsidiary scivac ltd in its manufacturing facility in rehovot israel   congenital cmv vaccine candidate   our lead program using our evlp technology targets congenital cmv which is a leading cause of birth defects while cmv is a common virus that infects one in every two people in many developed countries most cmv infections are asymptomatic however cmv can cause serious disease in newborns if the mother is infected during pregnancy – this is called congenital cmv infection each year approximately  us infants will develop permanent problems due to cmv infection including deafness blindness and intellectual disability cmv affects more live births than any other cause of birth defects including down syndrome or fetal alcohol syndrome making it a key public health priority and a strong candidate for recommended universal vaccination     s        our vaccine candidate expresses the cmv gb antigen on the surface of the evlp preclinical data demonstrated that the structure of the evlp platform generated stronger neutralizing antibodies than immunization with the same gb target protein alone our cmv vaccine is also adjuvanted with alum a safe fdaapproved adjuvant our cmv vaccine has shown promise in early preclinical animal models including in rabbits and in mice with the ability to generate anticmv antibodies and cmv neutralizing responses in both fibroblasts and epithelial cells – two clinicallyrelevant cell types that are susceptible to cmv infection   with the acquisition of vbi de in  a significant rd priority has been the cmv vaccine candidate’s gmp manufacturing and its clinical development our cmv vaccine candidate was designed internally and its manufacturing and purification processes were designed by the nrc in collaboration with our staff such processes and internal knowledge were transferred to our selected gmp manufacturer paragon bioservices “paragon” and required significant project management expertise and confirmatory rd studies throughout  in  we engaged a contract research organization itr laboratories canada inc and completed glp toxicology studies to confirm the safety of the cmv vaccine candidate in animals we initiated a phase i clinical study in june  to assess the safety and tolerability of our cmv vaccine candidate in healthy cmvnegative adults the study will also assess the vaccine immunogenicity by measuring levels of vaccineinduced cmv neutralizing antibodies we completed enrollment and initial dosing of  participants in september  as of may  all participants had received the third and final immunization in the series interim phase i clinical study results are anticipated midyear    therapeutic gbm vaccines   we have also applied our evlp platform in the development of a therapeutic gbm vaccine candidate gbm is among the most common and aggressive malignant primary brain tumors in humans in the us alone  new cases are diagnosed each year the current standard of care for gbm is surgical resection followed by radiation and chemotherapy even with aggressive treatment however gbm progresses rapidly and is exceptionally lethal with median patient survival of less than  months   developing a broadly applicable gbm immunotherapy requires the identification of antigens used to direct the immune response which are consistently expressed on tumor cells a growing body of research has demonstrated that gbm tumors are susceptible to infection by cmv with over  of gbm tumors expressing cmv antigens targeting cmv antigens therefore may represent an attractive strategy for gbm immunotherapy   we intend to create a gbm immunotherapy that will stimulate the patient’s own immune system to identify and kill gbm cancer cells with the goal of creating a commerciallyviable therapy that is more effective and tolerable than current treatments leveraging the flexibility and potency of our evlp platform technology we are developing a polyvalent therapeutic vaccine candidate designed to direct an immune response against gb and pp two cmv antigens that are highly immunogenic targets during natural cmv infection our vaccine candidate also includes granulocytemacrophage colonystimulating factor “gmcsf” an adjuvant that mobilized dendritic function and enhances thtype immunity   ex vivo studies demonstrate the vaccine candidate’s ability to induce desired antitumor immunity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells “pbmcs” harvested from healthy subjects and patients with gbm gbm patient samples were provided by columbia university’s brain tumor center our vaccine candidate also stimulated both cd and cd t cell responses characterized by secretion of ifng and ccl key biomarkers associated with positive clinical outcomes   vbi expects to file an investigational new drug “ind” application with the fda midyear  to initiate a phase iiia clinical study in patients with gbm   evlp vaccine platform   on august   vbi cda acquired the evlp vaccine technology through the acquisition of epixis evlps sa are an innovative new class of synthetic vaccines that are designed to closely mimic the structure of viruses because of their structural similarity to viruses found in nature vaccination with a target protein expressed in an evlp is capable of imparting greater immunity than vaccination with the same recombinant target protein alone evlps are also highly customizable which allows vbi to rationally design preventative and therapeutic vaccine candidates by controlling the expression of both surface and internal target proteins of interest     s        evlps are produced after transient transfection of cells with plasmids encoding the murine leukemia virus “mlv” gag and target surface or internal proteins of interest the mlv gag expression induces “budding” of particles from the membrane of transfected cells – the target protein of interest is incorporated into the outer envelope during the budding process evlps are purified using a process designed to yield material with acceptable residual host cell impurities batch consistency has also been demonstrated using in vivo potency release assays   in addition to the  initial payment for the technology and  in related transaction costs we paid approximately  and  in milestone payments under the epixis licensing agreement in the years ended december   and  respectively   we expect to continue to explore potential therapeutic and scientific targets where our evlp platform technology can be used effectively to generate new vaccine programs   lpv platform   the lpv thermostability platform is a proprietary formulation and process that allows vaccines and biologics to preserve stability potency and safety many vaccines and biologics are highly sensitive to temperatues and physical stress as a consequence  of vaccines are transported and stored in a “cold chain” of temperaturecontrolled environments between  o c to  o c without proper storage exposure to elevated or freezing temperatures can lead to a loss in potency or reduced safety limiting protective benefits or therapeutic effects additionally reliance on a cold chain increases vaccine costs by up to  and is a significant barrier to patient access in many emerging markets   our lipid particle vaccine technology or “lpv” technology is a vaccine formulation technology that enables the thermostabilization of vaccines through a proprietary formulation and freezedrying process the technology is constituted by three lipids monopalmitoylglycerol “mpg” dicetyl phosphate “dcp” and cholesterol mixed in a proprietary ratio with vaccine antigen using a patented method the resulting mixture is then lyophilized freeze dried and can be stored for extended periods of time outside of the coldchain   we have active collaborations with both sanofi pasteur and glaxosmithkline two of the leading vaccine producers in the world vbi is working with sanofi to explore reformulation a sanofi vaccine candidate to improve stability under the terms of the sanofi agreement sanofi can also acquire certain rights to extend its use of the lpv technology to additional vaccine assets in february  we entered into the research collaboration with gsk which provides gsk with the rights to negotiate an exclusive license to the lpv technology for use within a defined field   in the normal course of our business we assess and consider potential acquisition or collaboration opportunities to gain access to technologies or assets that are adjacent to our core competencies of immunology and formulation development we are currently exploring this lpv technology further through partnerships with other thirdparty collaborators   our research and development efforts   we invest heavily in rd rd expenses which includes clinical development and regulatory related costs were  million for the year ended december   and  million for the year ended december   all rd was funded by equity term loan or convertible note financings or government grants and refundable rd tax credits our most significant rd expense has been and is expected to continue to be related mainly to our development of a cmv vaccine candidate and the related evlp platform such rd expenses are expected to increase significantly as the vaccine moves into the clinical development stage and we explore other vaccine opportunities andor collaborations   with the acquisition of vbi de in  a significant rd priority has been the cmv vaccine candidate’s gmp manufacturing and its clinical development our cmv vaccine candidate was designed internally and its manufacturing and purification processes were designed by the nrc in collaboration with our staff such processes and internal knowledge were transferred to our selected gmp manufacturer paragon and

you should carefully consider these risks as well as other information we include or incorporate by reference in this prospectus the risks and uncertainties we have described are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business operations these risks could materially affect our business results of operations or financial condition and cause the value of our securities to decline   risks relating to this offering   resales of our common shares in the public market during this offering by our shareholders may cause the market price of our common shares to fall   we may issue common shares from time to time in connection with this offering the issuance from time to time of these new common shares or our ability to issue new common shares in this offering could result in resales of our common shares by our current shareholders concerned about the potential dilution of their holdings in turn these resales could have the effect of depressing the market price for our common shares   you may experience immediate and substantial dilution in the net tangible book value per common shares you purchase   the price per common shares being offered may be higher than the net tangible book value per common shares outstanding prior to this offering assuming that an aggregate of  shares are sold at a price of  per share the last reported sale price of our common shares on the nasdaq capital market on may   for aggregate proceeds of  in this offering and after deducting commissions and estimated aggregate offering expenses payable by us you will suffer immediate and substantial dilution of  per share representing the difference between the as adjusted net tangible book value per common share as march   after giving effect to this offering and the assumed offering price see the section entitled “dilution” below for a more detailed discussion of the dilution you will incur if you purchase common shares in this offering   until june   we may be required to issue additional common shares to the investors who purchased our common shares in a private placement in june  as a result of a weighted average antidilution adjustment provision in the share purchase agreement entered into in such private placement which would be dilutive to all of our stockholders including new investors in this offering   the share purchase agreement dated june   pursuant to which we sold an aggregate of  of our common shares in a private placement at a purchase price of  per share contains a weighted average antidilution adjustment provision that provides that if we during  months from june   issue or sell any common shares or common share equivalents at a purchase price less than  we will be required subject to certain limitations and adjustments as provided in the share purchase agreement to issue additional common shares to each investor in an amount equal to the number determined by dividing such investor’s investment amount in the private placement offering by the revised purchase price less the number of common shares purchased by such investor in the private placement offering to the extent we issue common shares in this offering at a per share price less than  then we will be required to issue additional common shares and our shareholders and new investors in this offering will experience dilution of their ownership interest in the company   you may experience future dilution as a result of future equity offerings   in order to raise additional capital we may in the future offer additional common shares or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common shares we cannot assure you that we will be able to sell shares or other securities in any other offering at a price per share that is equal to or greater than the price per share paid by investors in this offering and investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing shareholders the price per share at which we sell additional common shares or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common shares in future transactions may be higher or lower than the price per share in this offering     s        if securities andor industry analysts fail to continue publishing research about our business if they change their recommendations adversely or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations our share price and trading volume could decline   the trading market for our common shares will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly we could lose visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause our share price or trading volume to decline in addition it is likely that in some future period our operating results will be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our shares or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations our share price could decline   our management team may invest or spend the proceeds of this offering in ways with which you may not agree or in ways which may not yield a significant return   our management will have broad discretion over the use of proceeds from this offering the net proceeds from this offering will be used for general corporate purposes which may include among other things increasing our working capital and funding clinical development and regulatory research and development general and administrative and capital expenditures as more fully described in the section entitled “use of proceeds” you will not have the opportunity as part of your investment decision to assess whether the proceeds are being used appropriately the net proceeds may be used for corporate purposes that do not increase our operating results or enhance the value of our common shares because of the number and variability of factors that will determine our use of the net proceeds from this offering their ultimate use may vary substantially from their currently intended use the failure by our management to apply these funds effectively could harm our business pending their use we may invest the net proceeds from this offering in shortterm investmentgrade interestbearing securities these investments may not yield a favorable return to our shareholders if we do not invest or apply the net proceeds from this offering in ways that enhance shareholder value we may fail to achieve expected financial results which could cause our share price to decline   because we do not intend to declare cash dividends on our common shares in the foreseeable future shareholders must rely on appreciation of the value of our common shares for any return on their investment   we have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common shares we currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future in addition the terms of any existing or future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends as a result we expect that only appreciation of the price of our common shares if any will provide a return to investors in this offering for the foreseeable future   use of proceeds   we may issue and sell common shares having aggregate sales proceeds of up to  from time to time the amount of proceeds from this offering will depend upon the number of common shares sold and the market price at which they are sold there can be no assurance that we will be able to sell any shares under or fully utilize the equity distribution agreement with canaccord as a source of financing because there is no minimum offering amount required as a condition to close this offering the actual total public offering amount commissions and proceeds to us if any are not determinable at this time   we intend to use the net proceeds if any from this offering for general corporate purposes which may include among other things increasing our working capital and funding clinical development regulatory research and development general and administrative and capital expenditures   as of the date of this prospectus we cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses of the net proceeds of this offering our management will have significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds from this offering and investors will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the application of these net proceeds pending the uses described above we intend to invest the net proceeds from this offering in shortterm interestbearing obligations investmentgrade instruments certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the us government     s        dividend policy   we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common shares and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future we expect to retain available cash to finance ongoing operations and the potential growth of our business any future determination to pay dividends on our common shares will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon among other factors our results of operations financial condition capital requirements business prospects and other factors our board of directors may deem relevant and subject to the restrictions contained in any future financing instruments     s        dilution   our net tangible book value as of march   was approximately  million or  per share net tangible book value per share is determined by dividing our total tangible assets less total liabilities by the number of common shares outstanding as of march   dilution in net tangible book value per share represents the difference between the amount per share paid by purchasers of common shares in this offering and the as adjusted net tangible book value per common share immediately after giving effect to this offering   after giving effect to the sale of our common shares in the aggregate amount of  in this offering at an assumed offering price of  the last reported sale price of our common shares on the nasdaq capital market on may   and after deducting commissions and estimated aggregate offering expenses payable by us our as adjusted net tangible book value as of march   would have been approximately  million or  per share this represents an immediate increase in net tangible book value of  per share to existing shareholders and immediate dilution in net tangible book value of  per share to new investors purchasing our common shares in this offering the following table illustrates this dilution on a per share basis   assumed public offering price per share             net tangible book value per share as of march                 increase per share attributable to the offering               as adjusted net tangible book value per share after this offering               dilution per share attributable to new investors                 the common shares sold in this offering if any will be sold from time to time at various prices an increase of  per share in the price at which the common shares are sold from the assumed offering price of  per share shown in the table above assuming all of our common shares in the aggregate amount of  is sold at that price would cause our as adjusted net tangible book value per share after the offering to be  per share and would increase the dilution in net tangible book value per share to new investors to  per share after deducting commissions and estimated aggregate offering expenses payable by us a decrease of  per share in the price at which the common shares are sold from the assumed offering price of  per share shown in the table above assuming all of our common shares in the aggregate amount of  is sold at that price would cause our as adjusted net tangible book value per share after the offering to be  per share and would decrease the dilution in net tangible book value per share to new investors to  per share after deducting commissions and estimated aggregate offering expenses payable by us this information is supplied for illustrative purposes only   the above discussion and table are based on  common shares outstanding as of march   and exclude as of that date     ●  outstanding equity grants and awards which include  common shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding options having a weighted average exercise price of  per share and  common shares issuable upon the vesting of stock awards having a weighted average fair value at grant date of  per share         ●  common shares reserved for issuance under our equity incentive plans and         ●  common shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding warrants having a weighted average exercise price of  per share   if all of the above issued options and warrants were exercised the pro forma net tangible book value per common share after giving effect to this offering would be  per share and the dilution in net tangible book value per share to investors in this offering would be  per share in addition we may choose to raise additional capital due to market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities the issuance of these securities could result in further dilution to our shareholders     s        plan of distribution   we have entered into an equity distribution agreement with canaccord under which we may issue and sell our common shares having an aggregate gross sales price of up to  from time to time through canaccord acting as agent the equity distribution agreement has been filed as an exhibit to our registration statement on form s of which this prospectus forms a part   upon
