got sold for  billion to eqt corp by admin  june     share facebook twitter daniel j rice iii step down from his moneyspinning position with blackrock inc five years back due to pressure from the board of directors for running a parallel business with his sons under the name of rice energy inc but no one thought that the decision would be so profitable for him in today’s time where that business got sold for  billion to eqt corp after the takeover announcement on monday eqt corp inc becomes the largest natural gas producing firm in the us exceeding to exxon mobil corp daniel rice iii seems to be very happy with the performance of all three sons who are currently the executives of the company according to the deal they would receive  billion as a share of a deal for their family’s stake in the rice energy inc shale production is in high demand in the us and this future prediction of mr rice a decade ago benefited him in the long run he risked his high profile position and money to enter the shale production sector and sowed the seed of rice energy inc with the help of his three sons daniel j rice iv  toby  and derek  contributed and supported the dream of mr rice and got that dream come true by converting it into a billion dollar company separation from blackrock inc didn’t harm mr rice professionally or financially and proved to be a good decision in his favour but it didn’t work well for blackrock inc for  million because they were fined by the us securities and exchange commission for not informing or disclosing rice’s participation in rice energy inc but it was too late to catch hold of rice because he already was on the verge of becoming a billionaire and got his company listed on the stock exchange in january  rice energy inc’s addition to the eqt corp inc is going to set the foot print for the company to enhance their skill sets to explore their opportunities to get much ahead of other competitors in the production of shale gas their aggressive approach helped them to get deeper to  billion cubic feet production of shale gas on a daily basis they were the first one to utilize high end technology and big data analytics to predict the demand and supply of the shale gas which ensured they always stayed ahead of their competitors in the race share thisclick to share on twitter opens in new windowclick to share on facebook opens in new
