family of funds you have received this proxy statement because you own one or more fidelity equity andor high income funds and you are being asked to elect a board of trustees to oversee your fundsr rfidelitys mutual fund business and the broader mutual fund marketplace continue to expand and evolve as a result the trustees of the fidelity funds together with fmr have been considering ways to structure the board for each fidelity fund in order to ensure that fidelitys mutual fund shareholders continue to be well served by trustees in the years ahead historically the board of each fidelity fund has consisted of the same group of individual trustees who serve as trustees for all other fidelity funds in effect the fidelity funds have been overseen by a single board of trustees the trustees of the fidelity funds  with the support of fmr  have made a decision to reorganize themselves into two separate groups and thereby create two boards one board will oversee fidelitys equity and high income funds  funds with approximate assets of over  billion as of november   while the second board will oversee fidelitys investmentgrade bond money market and asset allocation funds  funds with approximate assets of over  billion as of november  r rin connection with creating two boards a slate of trustees must be put in place to oversee each group of funds the funds and trusts were aligned by investment discipline in june  some existing trustees and advisory board members are proposed to serve on the board overseeing the equity and high income funds while the others are proposed to serve on the board overseeing the fixed income and asset allocation funds in some cases the two boards can be created by having one existing trustee resign and the remaining trustees fill the vacancy in the majority of cases however the  act requires that a shareholder meeting be held to elect trustees r the trustees with the support of fmr made the decision to create a twoboard structure in order to plan for the future and based their decision on three specific factors first fidelitys mutual fund business continues to diversify into new asset classes and product types for example over the past few years fidelity has expanded its product line of multiasset class funds that invest in a variety of asset classes such as preferred stocks reits inflationprotected securities floatingrate securities and commodities in addition lifecycle funds and other types of packaged solutions continue to grow in popularity as greater numbers of individuals continue to save for and transition into retirement the trustees and fmr expect an increased demand for innovative products second as the securities marketplace has evolved in recent years increasingly complex investment strategies are available to fidelitys mutual funds for example the fixed income marketplace has significantly expanded with new types of securities including different types of futures options and swaps and that trend is likely to continue finally given prevailing demographic and business trends the trustees and fmr expect that fidelitys mutual fund business will continue to expand in the future in recent years fidelity has made efforts to position the firm as the most trusted provider of lifetime investment solutions in the us at the same time the amount of assets held by americans over age sixty is projected to increase dramatically between now and  as the baby boomer generation nears and enters retirement the trustees and fmr believe this provides a significant growth opportunity for fidelitys business and for the mutual fund industry as a whole increased interest in principal preservation and income distribution is expected to drive asset growth in fidelitys fixed income funds and asset allocation products in particular the twoboard structure will be implemented at the same time for all fidelity funds on august   or if later immediately after the last election is held for any fidelity fund scheduled to elect trustees in connection with implementing a twoboard structure the following will occur current trustees will remain on the boards to which they have been elected or appointed and resign from the boards on which they will no longer serve former advisory board members that have been elected or appointed as trustees will join the boards on which they will serve going forward the size of the board that will oversee the equity and high income funds will be fixed at  trustees and the size of the board that will oversee the fixed income and asset allocation funds will be fixed at  trustees the trustees fully expect that the environment of strong governance of the funds and protection of the interests of fund shareholders will continue under the new structure rexcept for alan j lacy joseph mauriello david m thomas and michael e wiley all nominees for the equity and high income board are currently trustees of the trusts and have served in that

amended each declaration of trust article viii section  would reduce the quorum required to onethird of the shares entitled to voter rlowering the quorum requirement will facilitate holding shareholder meetings to approve important matters necessary for the conduct of a trusts business such as the election of trustees when not enough shareholders vote a trust may be forced to adjourn

requirement is not prohibited by massachusetts or federal lawr ralthough the lower quorum requirement will allow for the approval of some matters by shareholders constituting less than a majority of

in  no one can predict what lies ahead for investors last year stocks posted belowaverage returns and bonds had one of the worst years in history this downturn followed a period in which the investing environment was generally very positive these market ups and downs are a normal part of investing and there are some basic principles that are helpful for investors to remember in different types of markets if you can leave your money invested over the long term you can avoid the results of the volatility that generally accompanies the stock market in the short term as we witnessed last year you also can help to manage some of the risks of investing through diversification a stock fund is already diversified because it invests in many issues you can diversify even further by placing some of your money in several different types of stock funds or in other investment categories such as bonds if you have a short investment time horizon you might want to consider moving some of your investment into a money market fund which seeks income and a stable share price by investing in highquality shortterm investments of course there is no assurance that a money market fund will achieve its goal and it is important to remember that money market funds are not insured or guaranteed by any agency of the us government finally no matter what your investment horizon or portfolio diversity it makes good sense to follow a regular investment plan  investing a certain amount of money at the same time each month or quarter  and to review your portfolio periodically a periodic investment plan will not of course assure a profit or protect against a loss if you have any questions please call us at  we stand ready to provide the information you need to make the investments that are right for you best regards edward c johnson d performance the bottom line there are several ways to evaluate a funds historical performance you can look at the total percentage change in value the average annual percentage change or the growth of a hypothetical  investment each performance figure includes changes in a funds share price plus reinvestment of any dividends or income and capital gains the profits the fund earns when it sells stocks that have grown in value cumulative total returns periods ended april   past  life of year fund midcap stock   sp midcap registered trademark   average midcap fund  na cumulative total returns show the funds performance in percentage terms over a set period  in this case one year or since the fund started on march   for example if you invested  in a fund that had a  return over the past year the value of your investment would be  you can compare the funds returns to the performance of the standard  poors midcap  index  a broad measure of the performance of the midcap market to measure how the funds performance stacked up against its peers you can compare it to the average midcap fund which reflects the performance of  funds with similar objectives tracked by lipper analytical services over the past  months both benchmarks include reinvested dividends and capital gains if any average annual total returns periods ended april   past  life of year fund midcap stock   sp midcap registered trademark   average midcap fund  na average annual total returns take the funds actual or cumulative return and show you what would have happened if the fund had performed at a constant rate each year  over life of fund fidelity mid capstandard  poor                                               over life of fund lets say you invested  in fidelity midcap stock fund on march   when the fund started as the chart shows by april   the value of your investment would have grown to   a  increase on your initial investment for comparison look at how the sp midcap  index did over the same period with dividends reinvested the same  investment in the sp midcap  index would have grown to   a  increase understanding performance how a fund did yesterday is no guarantee of how it will do tomorrow the stock market for example has a history of growth in the long run and volatility in the short run in turn the share price and return of a fund that invests in stocks will vary that means if you sell your shares during a market downturn you might lose money but if you can ride out the markets ups and downs you may have a gain checkmark fund talk the managers overview market recap a rally starting in january   sparked by diminishing concerns about future interest rate increases and solid corporate earnings  helped fuel strong returns in the us stock market for the  months ended april   the standard  poors composite index of  stocks finished the month period with a total return of   topping its historical average of roughly  uncertainty over the effects of rising interest rates had contributed to uneven returns in the stock market from march through december  during the first four months of  however evidence of a gradual slowdown in economic growth calmed inflation fears and soothed worries about further interest rate increases by the federal reserve board these factors along with continued strong corporate earnings reports and a flurry of merger and acquisition activity helped to propel stocks higher in february the dow jones industrial average closed above  for the first time markets outside the us however continued to demonstrate the varied returns that marked most of  mexicos devaluation of the peso in december negatively affected developed and most notably emerging foreign markets as investors brought capital back to the us the morgan stanley emerging markets free index was down  for the  months ended april  rising interest rates also muted stock returns in several developed markets as the morgan stanley eafe europe australia far east index returned  for the same period an interview with jennifer uhrig portfolio manager of fidelity midcap stock fund q jennifer how has the fund performed a it has done very well for the  months ended april   the fund had a total return of  that beat the average mid cap stock fund which returned  over the same period according to lipper analytical services q what helped the fund outperform the lipper average by such a large margin a the fund has done well due to good stock selection and positive results from investments in the technology and finance sectors q what were the stories there a earnings in the technology sector have been driven by businesses desire to increase productivity as well as the growth in sales of personal computers to consumers the funds technology stake   of the funds investments at the end of the period  includes novell a networking software company dynatech a manufacturer of telecommunications equipment and symantec a company that provides utility software such as antivirus and backup programs for personal computers microsoft is introducing a new operating system windows  that will need new associated utilities software so i expect symantec will benefit from this product cycle q and finance a the fund benefited from underweighting these stocks relative to the standard  poors midcap  index in the first half of the period when they underperformed and increasing the weighting over the second half when they performed well two of the funds investments fannie mae and freddie mac  the federal national mortgage association and the federal home loan mortgage corporation respectively  have performed well recently for two reasons first the interest rate environment has started to improve the spread between the rate at which these agencies borrow and the rate at which they lend has begun to increase to more profitable levels second the availability of fixedrate mortgages for them to purchase has increased ive also increased the funds investment in fleet financial group it is acquiring shawmut bank a move i believe will help fleet to consolidate costs and increase market share in new england i also find fleets stock to be inexpensive q what stocks havent performed as well as you would have liked a talbots an apparel retailer  hasnt done badly but its performance has lagged the market the company has a strong niche but its stock hasnt been able to make much headway in an environment where retail apparel stocks have performed poorly one of the reasons behind these struggles has been that too much capacity or square footage has been added over the past  years that means that too many stores are competing for consumer dollars in addition some theorize that retail apparel sales have suffered from the fact that more companies are allowing their employees to dress casually on fridays as a result people are buying fewer business clothes and more casual clothes which cost less and dont provide the apparel companies with as much profit as items such as suits another underperformer rjr nabisco has been under pressure from the threat of legal issues in the tobacco industry and so hasnt performed that well although the stock price has moved up recently in any event i still own both talbots and rjr nabisco because theyre good values and have the potential to perform well going forward q the funds assets have grown quickly over the period how does that affect your management of the fund a in general i try to buy more of the stocks i already own and feel confident about id like to keep the number of stocks in the fund to a manageable number in addition i have to work harder to find new stock ideas that meet my standards q whats your outlook going forward a its possible that the positive investing environment could continue over the next six months particularly since recent statistics including unemployment numbers indicate the economy is slowing down this reduces the likelihood that the federal reserve board will raise interest rates again to slow inflation on the other hand i am concerned that the market may not be able to keep up its current pace and that many stocks are becoming expensive ill continue to look for stocks that are underrecognized and avoid chasing stocks that are becoming overpriced fund facts goal longterm growth of capital by investing mainly in equity securities of companies with mediumsized market capitalizations start date march   size as of april   more than  million manager jennifer uhrig since  manager fidelity select retailing portfolio  fidelity select developing communications portfolio   fidelity select telecommunications portfolio   joined fidelity in  checkmark jennifer uhrig on the effect of the weak dollar the weakness of the dollar is something im keeping my eye on a weak dollar helps companies that have business overseas because it makes their products or services cheaper there smallersized companies tend to have less overseas business which is one of the reasons larger stocks performed better than small stocks in the s as the dollar weakened throughout the decade as a result ive been looking for companies that have overseas exposure for example i have been buying shares of tambrands manufacturers of feminine hygiene products i also own baxter international a health care company that sells renal dialysis equipment and other health care products  which also has significant overseas exposure medium solid bullet the stock of westpoint stevens  a manufacturer of towels and sheets cited in previous reports as an underperformer  rebounded and performed well during the period because it appears cotton prices may fall going forward medium solid bullet at the end of the period the fund had sold its investments in standard  poors midcap  futures contracts using the proceeds for active investments the manager had been using these futures to invest incoming cash
