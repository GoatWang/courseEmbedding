agency on madison avenue go to the media firm and optimize the grps and create a website that delivers the product message model is a disadvantaged one this is brilliant and what is more brilliant is the fact that smirnoff has generated millions and millions of word of mouth generated aka free impressions for their new product posted by ron coughlin at  pm no comments friday april 0 0 the mirror is broken my most random unformed posting yetis the first casualty of the newly empowered informed consumer the classic purely reflective advertising modeleg we as a brand embody the same values or interests as you reflect your aspirations and therefore we are the brand for you and a brand through which you express who you are it seems to me that with so many brands with so many new exciting and specific benefits tailored to sub groups needs purely lifestyle reflective advertising and packaging may be a thing of the past posted by ron coughlin at 0 pm  comment no dead endsheard a snippet from the communications chief at whirlpool that builds on the idea of d marketing the principle is no dead ends each element of the marketing mix must have an active link to the another element of the marketing mix a dead end is a commercial that doesnt link to a text activity or a web activity or a package that doesnt encourage a second experience by phone web or person dead ends are lost consumer engagements lost brand bonding opportunities and lost efficiency great term jeff and who doesnt want to see more of the maytag repairman posted by ron coughlin at  pm no comments thursday april  0 found the snippet below on a business week survey of advertisingmarketing leaders for me user generated content is merely a manifestation of an enabled consumer today the more you enable the consumers to participate in the construction of your products and communication the better off youll be the more you enable the consumer to tailor how they interact with the brand and its components the better off youll be sometimes culture boils things down to their most superficial level  user generated ads may be a passing fad however lets not miss the important partthere are increasing numbers of consumers who want to engage with our brands at a level not contemplated by our mass market textbooks further the more our brands and products tell stories as seth godin likes to proselytize the more consumer desire for engagement will growa great examplewe did a bit of research and found that over 0 of viewers of our tv ads would be interested in our website yet less than  could see the website address from the end of one of our ads now dogma says we dont want to waste too much time featuring the website at the end of the ad because thats boring yet there are a significant group of consumers who want to engage more actively the winners will be those with new approaches and who challenge assumptions to create new paradigms user generated content is only todays tip of that iceburgsnippet belowthe world of marketing and advertising is rife with buzzwords and catch phrases and to round out the survey we asked respondents which words and phrases they were most sick of hearing at the top of the list buzz marketing viral and usergenerated content—the videos made by fans either for brandsponsored competitions or as personal youtube productionsand what did they predict theyll be most sick of hearing about next year usergenerated content rose to the top of the list though they may be sick of usergenerated content cornelius said she for one is skeptical the trend will go away i

curtis it plans to be at the forefront of creating new product categories ron coughlin will be president of hp incs personal systems business  by sophie curtis in barcelona pm bst  oct 0 follow on the first day of next month hp the american technology giant that was famously founded in a garage in palo alto in  is splitting in two the company’s data centre infrastructure business – comprising servers storage and networking – will become hewlettpackard enterprise and its pc and printer business will become hp inc it is arguably the biggest upheaval in the company’s history while hp has bought and spun off many subsidiaries in its  years – from ’s bn acquisition of compaq to the bn purchase of autonomy in 0 that turned into a major corporate scandal – it has never overhauled its core structure in quite such a dramatic fashion the two companies will be of practically equal size hp estimates that hp enterprise will have revenue strength of bn and operating profits of bn while hp inc will have revenues of bn and operating profit of bn the man responsible for the lion’s share of the latter is ron coughlin under the new structure he will be president of hp inc’s personal systems business putting him in charge of pcs tablets accessories and their related services – a unit that currently brings in bn of revenues coughlin will report to dion wesler hp inc’s new chief executive with hp’s current chief meg whitman taking over the other side of the company when the two split “what makes us most excited about the new hp inc is the ability to have the creativity and speed of an entrepreneur and the scale of a fortune  company” said mr coughlin “this means that when we have a great idea we’re going to move fast and we’re going to create new categories but at the same time when we get that idea we can put it in every country every city every province in the world” some argue that the split is long overdue former chief executive leo apotheker proposed spinning off the company’s pc business in 0 but the plan was dropped following pressure from shareholders which ultimately led to apotheker’s departure meg whitman took the helm of hewlett packard shortly before it acquired autonomy for bn £bn in 0  photo reuters ms whitman led a reorganisation of the company in 0 that saw the pc business combined with the imaging and printing group helping to pave the way for the current separation plan hp is now taking a big leaf out of the book of ibm another major it supplier which realised years ago that it was never going to be a onestop shop for corporates and started to sell off “noncore” businesses such as printers pcs and servers rather than gradually divesting businesses though it is splitting which offers several advantages existing shareholders will get shares in both companies and the two have agreed not to compete with each other for three years after the split they will partner to buy supplies jointly sell products to customers and share patents and other intellectual property mr coughlin said part of the reason that the previous attempt to spin off the pc business was unsuccessful was because of “brand dissynergies” in other words hp had decided that the pc business would suffer if it was not able to use its famous brand to sell its products this time both companies will get to keep hp in their name which mr coughlin said “took a lot of the dissynergy out and really unlocked the value” hp spectre x hp inc will focus on three key areas – “core” which is about using hp’s clout and scale to offer highend features at the lowest possible cost “growth” which is about focusing on fastgrowing categories like allinone pcs and convertibles and “future” – creating new product categories at its consumer event in barcelona this week the company unveiled a slew of new devices with this new strategy in mind including the spectre x a elegant lightweight tablet with a detachable metal keyboard an allinone pc with a huge inch curved display and a range of colourful hp stream cloudbased windows laptops the company is also looking to the future with its recently launched sprout computing platform which combines an allinone desktop computer with two touch displays a scanner a depth sensor a highresolution camera and a projector to create a d computing experience – or in hps parlance “blended reality” “we have been on a drumbeat of innovation it started in october 0 when we launched our blended reality” says mr coughlin “it was a vision last october it’s becoming a reality now today if you go on hpcom we sell sprout we also sell sprout bundled with a d printer – 0pc of sprout sales come bundled with a d printer” hp sprout however splitting the company into two comes at a price hp stands to lose m to 0m during the split the company hopes its costcutting efforts will help offset that number last month hp said it expects to cut about  jobs over the next three years on top of the 0 layoffs previously announced the latest cuts represent a 0pc reduction in the company’s total workforce revenue from the pc and printer business – what will become hp inc after the split – fell pc in its fiscal third quarter which ended on july  hp has said it expects the market for pcs and printers to remain tough for “several quarters” the growing popularity of smartphones and tablets as well as sluggish business investment has meant both corporate customers and consumers holding back on buying computers despite this mr coughlin is optimistic about the future of the pc market and confident of hp’s place within it the addressable market for personal systems – hardware ranging from pcs to printers to mobile devices – is worth 0bn he said with half of that market growing at nine per cent “we have a scale market with significant growth pockets and we’ve proven we can gain share in the pc category” he said “i’m also optimistic because we have momentum we are blessed with being able to go public with one of the world’s strongest brands our marketing engine has never revved stronger”   on the whole analysts tend to agree that hp inc has an opportunity to take a lead in the development of innovative hardware in partnership with microsoft which under its chief executive satya nadella is undergoing something of a revolution focused on its new windows 0 software however many believe that it has to look beyond its traditional markets having seen the smartphone revolution pass it by almost completely the growing “internet of things” industry – connecting everyday devices to mobile or wifi connections to improve efficiency – could be one of these especially given hp’s reputation among enterprises coughlin says that operating as a separate company will allow hp inc to invest more money in new categories as well as creating its own rather than simply pouring all of its research and development budget into improving its existing technology this is not only an intent but has been built into the new company’s framework he says highlighting how mr wesler was announced as hp inc’s new chief executive when the company unveiled its nextgeneration sprout technology a year ago “it’s not by chance” coughlin says “it highlights the fact that innovation is going to be a centrepiece of the company under his leadership” forrester analyst peter burris said that hp inc will need to “place some big bets” and “run like the wind” if it hopes to play a role in shaping the consumer device and services industry however mr coughlin said that hp inc will only play in markets where it can add value both in terms of experience and from a shareholder perspective “our focus is commercial mobility in january we launched eight new devices in four vertical focus areas – retail field service education and healthcare a great example is our healthcare tablet that is antimicrobial it has a camera to scan the patient’s tag so the whole idea is mobilising work flows and that’s our focus we can add value there we believe there’s a need we don’t believe our competitors serve that market well and we believe that there’s profit pools there” he said “we don’t chase share for share’s sake we don’t believe that we can do well in the  tablet market i don’t think that anybody is going to do well there in commercial the good news is that the whole category has profit and is such that you can offer great experience and great return for shareholders” telegraphsciencetech follow telegraphtech read more from telegraph technology homemade in china   ambitious chinese inventors take on crazy doityourself
