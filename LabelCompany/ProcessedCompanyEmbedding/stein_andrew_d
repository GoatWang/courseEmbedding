and his office staff are very friendly and easy to work with i developed symptoms of left cubital tunnel syndrome in  the symptoms were misdiagnosed by a general practitioner when i finally went to an orthopedic surgeon at kaiser in  he didnt recommend surgery thank goodness i knew about andrew stein through my mothers workmans comp he recommended surgery for my left arm in  i hacherise in castro valley  apr  ill be honest when i first heard about dr stein i was having doubts because of the bad reviews but i went to see him anyway and im glad i did dr stein is wonderful i had two surgeries and they both turned out great dont let a couple bad reviews scare you he is very professional he explains everything to you and his staff is friendly and helpful i would definitely go back to dr stein couldnt ask for a better doctor thanks dr steingene in fremont ca  mar  dr stein removed ganglion cyst from my left wrist in the surgical room located ten yards from his office i recovered very quickly as expected thanks to dr stein for his professionalism and kindnesscastro valley ca  mar  my overall experience with dr stein and his staff was good and i would recommend him to my friendssan leandro  mar  i broke my pinky at work and workers comp sent me to a doctor who did surgery which didnt go too well and after  months i was not able to move iti contacted the insurance and asked to be sent to another doctor for a second opinion i was sent to dr stein and he told me i needed another surgery it took less than a week to schedule appointment for surgery i wish the workers comp insurance wouldve sent me here from the beginning mia y in oakland ca  jan  i was referred to dr stein from the er with a laceration on the back of my hand just over the knuckle small but with concern for tendon injury dr stein and his staff explained all of my options carefully listened to any and all information i could provide they asked about and assessed every aspect of my injury and treatment in several different ways he explained each step and options thoroughly offering but not pushing for surgery im now all healed up and happy no surgery requiredoakland ca  jan  my appointment with this doctor was very disturbing who started the appointment by telling me workers comp horror stories its unlikely thr surgery is approved it can take years you can run out benefits before youre healed using your own insurance would be faster you are likely prediabetic and thats why you have carpal tunnel not due to repetitive work that is a myth women are built differently and thats why women have higher instances of carpal tunnel than men horrificchristina in castro valley ca  jan  i first saw dr stein as a second opinion ten years ago about my carpal tunnel and trigger finger since that time i have had multuple procedures done by him including these cubital tuneel and frozen shoulder he is confident professional tells you all of your options and explains thouroughly your conditions his
