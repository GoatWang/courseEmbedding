patients and providers combine the potential for multiple indications with wide accessibility and cytosen’s method of treatment has the potential to treat hundreds of thousands of cancer patients –cytosen’s nk cell therapies are scalable with broad applications nk cells are a major component of the immune system that guard against cancer however there are important differences between nk cells and t cells t cells need to be “taught” or “engineered” by genetic modification to recognize a cancerous cell and thus are limited in application to cancers that possess identifiable targets nk cells have the natural ability to recognize and kill dangerous cells by detecting cell surface proteins that are indicative of being stressed or foreign or detecting the absence of proteins that indicate normal self cytosen’s cofounder and medical director dr dean lee has developed methods that use “feeder cells” engineered to stimulate logscale expansion growth and multiplying of nk cells while also increasing their potency against cancer cells this methodology is now being used in several clinical trials that are showing safety feasibility and early promise to make nk cell therapies more accessible scalable and robust cytosen has inlicensed technology from dr alicja copik’s lab at the university of central florida dr copik’s team has devised methods to replace the feeder cells with nanoparticles possessing the same nk cell stimulatory effects the nanoparticle expansion technology is a logistically simple and a scalable solution to widely disseminate nk cell therapeutics allowing
