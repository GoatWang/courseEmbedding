registration of macrilen tweet charleston scbusiness wire february   aeterna zentaris inc nasdaq aezs tsx aez the “company” today announced that following a comprehensive review of data obtained from the confirmatory phase  clinical trial of macrilen™ macimorelin for the evaluation of growth hormone deficiency in adults “aghd” using the insulin tolerance test the “itt” as a comparator it concluded that macrilen™ demonstrated performance supportive of achieving registration with the us food and drug administration the “fda” the fda has agreed to consider the company’s conclusions during a type a meeting which is currently being scheduled following a comprehensive analysis of the data from the confirmatory trial the company concluded as follows macrilen™ stimulates the pituitary gland to produce growth hormone more effectively than the itt in approximately  of all patients measured growth hormone levels following the administration of macrilen™ were equal to or higher than the growth hormone levels produced by the itt the macrilen™ test performed well in the study sensitivity  and specificity  of the macrilen™ test were satisfactory data of the previous study  sensitivity  specificity could be reproduced the coprimary endpoint “negative agreement” with the itt which is considered as the more relevant endpoint was met demonstrating that the macrilen™ test provides medical benefit the coprimary endpoint “positive agreement” with the itt was not met in the repeatability part of the study conducted upon request of the european medicines agency macrilen™ results proved to be highly reproducible  reproducibility  out of  cases at the cutoff point defined in the study protocol reproducibility of the itt which was not investigated in this study appears worse than the macrilen™ test as demonstrated by a high number of nonevaluable itts in the study study results can be further optimized by modulation of the predefined cutoff point of  ngml any cutoff point for macrilen™ between  ngml and  ngml would have resulted in a positive study outcome in that both protocoldefined coprimary endpoints would have been met and the dose of macrilen™ used in the study was adequate and appropriate commenting on the company’s review of the data dr richard sachse the company’s chief scientific officer stated “macrilen™ stimulated the pituitary gland more powerfully than the itt and demonstrated good specificity and sensitivity in this study thus reproducing the results of our previous study in our confirmatory study we demonstrated that macrilen™ achieves a high degree of correlation with the itt which could be further optimized when a higher cutoff point such as the itt cutoff point is used for the macrilen™ test we believe that such an increased cutoff point would be justified by the more powerful stimulation of macrilentm as compared to the itt we look forward to having a discussion with the regulatory authorities regarding our conclusions and hope that they will concur with us the itt is inconvenient for patients and physicians and contraindicated in certain patients such as patients with coronary heart disease or seizure disorder requiring the patient to experience hypoglycemia to obtain a result patients and physicians need and deserve a better option than the itt” david a dodd president and chief executive officer of the company stated “we are delighted to report these successful and impressive results following a comprehensive analysis of the data from our confirmatory trial we look forward to upcoming discussions with the fda and hopefully to the subsequent registration and commercialization of macrilen™ in the us providing a much needed new option and alternative to the itt” about the study the confirmatory phase  clinical study of macrilen™ entitled confirmatory validation of oral macimorelin as a growth hormone gh stimulation test st for the diagnosis of adult growth hormone deficiency aghd in comparison with the insulin tolerance test itt was designed as a twoway crossover study with the itt as the benchmark comparator and involved some  sites in the us and europe the trial involved  subjects of whom  completed two evaluable tests for aghd using both macrilen™ and the itt thirtyfour of the patients were evaluated using macrilen™ a second time to measure the repeatability of the result obtained using macrilen™ as the evaluation method the study population consisted of  patients who were suspected of having aghd as a result of the presence of one or more symptoms or risk factors this segment of the population included a range of patients from those considered at low risk of having aghd to those considered at high risk the study population also included  healthy subjects who had no risk of having aghd under the study protocol the evaluation of aghd with macrilen™ will be considered successful if the lower bound of the twosided  confidence interval or lower bound of the onesided  confidence interval for the primary efficacy variables is  or higher for “percent negative agreement” and  or higher for the “percent positive agreement” based on meetings with the fda as well as the european medicines agency “ema” and subsequent written scientific advice the company believes that the study meets the fda’s and the ema’s studydesign expectations allowing us and european approval if successful dr jose m garcia md phd an associate professor of medicine at the puget sound va hospital and the university of washington in seattle was the principal investigator of the confirmatory phase  clinical trial more details about the trial are available at the following link httpswwwclinicaltrialsgovctshowncttermmacimorelinrank about macrilen macimorelin macimorelin a ghrelin agonist is
