kris hennessy an internationally recognized equine expert is conducting morphogenesis’ equine field study to test the safety and efficacy of its ifxeqm vaccine a direct dna form of the immunefx cancer vaccine portfolio the study involves the treatment of malignant melanoma an insidious disease that affects gray horses and up to  of older horses equine melanoma manifests in many different ways making it notoriously difficult to treat melanomas have benign and malignant variants that can be locally invasive as well as metastatic and can vary from superficial skin lesions to obstructive gastrointestinal lesions causing weight loss constipation and colic to neurologic involvement resulting in lameness and lack of muscle control the variable presentation of melanoma and resistance to therapy stems from multiple mutations that result in the formation of abnormal proteins these mutations which occur in melanoma at considerably higher rates compared to other malignancies disrupt the normal functions of the cells even individual tumors within a single patient continue to mutate making melanoma a constantly moving and diverging target immunefx is designed to turn the abnormal patientspecific tumor proteins into its advantage by exposing all of them to the immune system and reducing the chance a tumor cell can escape the equine melanoma study is taking place near kansas
