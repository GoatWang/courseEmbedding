shareholders vote for the proposed merger with care capital properties irvine calif july   globe newswire  sabra health care reit inc sabra or the company nasdaqsbra today filed an investor presentation with the us securities and exchange commission sec highlighting the substantial strategic and financial benefits of its previously announced definitive merger agreement with care capital properties inc ccp nyseccp to create a premier healthcare reit the presentation is available on the investor relations section of the companys website at httpwwwsabrahealthcomfileaspxiidfid sabras board of directors following a thorough evaluation with its outside financial and legal advisors unanimously determined that the proposed merger with ccp is in the best interest of sabras shareholders sabra maintains an open dialogue with its shareholders and values all constructive input towards its goal of driving enhanced value since announcing the merger the company has engaged with many of its shareholders and is pleased with the support it has received for the transaction the company has carefully reviewed the letters and presentation issued by hudson bay capital hudson bay and eminence capital eminence regarding the transaction which included inaccurate and misleading statements that sabra refutes in the presentation filed today highlights of the presentation include sabras board and management team continue to strongly support this strategically important transaction the transaction provides sabra and its shareholders with critical strategic benefits it accomplishes the companys stated objectives of diversifying its tenant base to decrease concentration from its top five tenants delivering significant value creation and dividend growth increasing scale and achieving investment grade credit ratings and balance sheet strength all of these benefits give the company increased competitive advantages in acquiring additional assets as well as providing increased shareholder liquidityhudson bay and eminence overlook all of these strategic benefits to the company and emphasize risks associated with the transaction primarily based upon an oversimplified view on the skilled nursing facility snf sector with which sabra and other experienced snf investors do not agree the transaction is entirely consistent with sabras stated strategy of creating a balanced portfolio across snf and senior housing assets the suggestion by hudson bay and eminence that the transaction represents a deviation in strategy is highly misleading snfs are a core component of the companys asset base and strategy representing  of its portfolio prior to the transaction since its spinoff from sun healthcare the company has acquired approximately  million in skilled nursing assets and in recent quarters has consistently discussed the strong weighting in its pipeline of ma opportunities towards skilled nursing assets given the current attractiveness of those opportunities relative to senior housing the company remains nimble and opportunistic and will continue to accretively pursue highquality assets that drive value for shareholders irrespective of the asset classthe increased scale expected improved cost of capital and strong balance sheet as a result of the merger will make sabra more competitive and open up new investment opportunities that are not available as a standalone company with its enhanced financial strength following the completion of the transaction sabra will continue to diversify its portfolio by tenant and facility type by executing on these attractive opportunities that will now be available the transaction provides significant value creation for shareholders in their analyses of the transaction hudson bay and eminence ignore the significant value creation opportunity for sabra shareholders the acquisition is expected to generate annual cost savings of approximately  million sabra expects to achieve lower cost of capital through achieving investment grade credit ratings the transaction creates immediate and significant cash flow accretion that provides the potential for a meaningful nearterm dividend increase and value creation which is discussed in further detail in the investor presentation ccps tenants are good operators with quality assets  in the snf industry its the operator that matters skilled nursing remains an integral component of the us continuum of care the shift to lower cost of care settings favors quality snf operators over the long term snfs continue to provide significant opportunities for attractive risk adjusted returns for sophisticated and experienced healthcare investors that are able to partner with successful operators on the right assets skilled nursing benefits from the same demographic shifts as independent or assisted living without the oversupply concerns additionally snfs benefit from over  bps of wider cap rates as well as a net lease structure which limits operating risk and rent variability and can offset reimbursement concernsccp has quality operators and the sabra management team is confident it can maximize the performance of ccps assets sabra has strong relationships with many of the ccp operators through existing or previous investments in the space and this transaction creates enhanced growth opportunities to strategically partner with top operators ccps recent acquisition in the behavioral health space also provides increased opportunities to expand within that segment of healthcare sabra management team has substantial operating experience to manage the combined company the sabra management team brings more than  combined years of experience in the industry sabras management team is a leader in the snf industry and has tremendous experience owning and managing snf portfolios sabra has consistently demonstrated an ability to improve the performance of its portfolio delivering quarterly snf coverage growth from x to x since the first quarter of  a  increase the company believes it can utilize this core area of expertise to provide additional value in managing the ccp portfolio going forwardthe company believes hudson bays and eminences discussion and analysis of the potential rent repositioning are misleading and oversimplify the strategic and nuanced approach the sabra management team is experienced in undertaking sabras repositioning of ccps leases will be focused on optimizing rent for reinvestment improving operations with tenants the sabra management team knows well and restructuring with a handful of tenants that can execute a successful facility turnaround the companys efforts are focused on tenants that provide quality care with high skilled mix which represents higher patient acuity and therefore higher reimbursement rates sabra believes hudson bay and eminence are new sabra shareholders are new to the story and have provided no alternatives for longterm value creation despite hudson bays and eminences claimed concern for the longterm the company believes that both became shareholders only after the announcement of the ccp transaction as both shareholders are new investors to the story hudson bays and eminences broadbrush assertions in relation to snfs show a lack of appreciation for the distinctions in quality among snf operators and other nuances important in properly evaluating an acquisition in the sectorthe value creation thesis put forward by these new shareholders is predicated on a reversal of the recent transient dislocation in sabras share price that followed the announcement of the ccp transaction without regard to its potential for longterm value creation hudson bay and eminence have proposed no strategic alternative that would benefit shareholders over the long term in the way that the company believes the transaction with ccp willthe company encourages shareholders to question the ultimate motivation behind the public statements by hudson bay and eminence as well as the alignment of these funds with the longterm interests of the company and its other shareholders the board and management are confident that this is the right transaction for sabra shareholders at the right value in its presentation hudson bay included a page directly sourced from another companys investor presentation that asserted that snf transactions have fallen within the  cap range however hudson bay failed to disclose the information from the same presentation that noted the transactions analyzed related to higheryielding smaller oneoff deals ccp is very different and brings a large diversified portfolio that is fairly and efficiently priced every day in the public market their presentations completely ignore the value of the strong balance sheet and investment grade ratings that ccp brings to sabra  as disclosed in sabras proxy statement given the compelling strategic benefits of the transaction the companies have been considering a combination since july  during which time the exchange ratio implied by the public trading prices of the two companies stocks has moved substantially in sabras favorin their analysis of the transaction hudson bay and eminence also fail to recognize the direct positive correlation between rent coverage and valuation multiples observed in the public market and how the company expects to create significant value through portfolio optimization  the management teams experience and knowledge of the operators will enable sabra to work with tenants to assist those operators to improve facility operations and enhance rent coverage in the same manner that the company has demonstrated with its own portfolioadditionally based on the ccp stock price on may   the last trading day prior to the announcement of the merger the implied premium was  which is lower than average control premiums paid in precedent public company healthcare reit transactions sabra is encouraged by the strong level of support from shareholders and positive commentary from wall streetanalysts following the transaction since announcing the transaction the company has spoken at length with many of its longterm shareholders and has received strong support for the transaction many of the shareholders that the company has spoken with clearly understand the rationale and benefits of the merger sabra has also articulated the management teams ability to create value from the transaction as well as the scale and financial benefits that will come from being a larger diversified reit with investment grade metrics industry analyst commentary from reports regarding the ccp merger highlight these and other benefits for shareholders we believe that the combination of sbra and ccp highlights the growing discrepancy between the public and private market value of senior housing particularly skilled nursing and we expect it to spark greater enthusiasm for reits and operators focused on the sector sbras combination with ccp which they estimate is  accretive in the first full year creates a much larger health care reit that is considerably more diversified and continues the companies focus on senior housing especially skilled nursing cantor fitzgerald may   despite the mixed reception of the pending sabracare capital properties ccp  nr merger we remain positive on the deal we acknowledge near term hurdles but believe the opportunity and long term benefits more than outweigh the short term volatility suntrust july   a strong positive is the diversification the deal brings with no one tenant representing more than  of annualized cash noi once sbras previously announced genesis dispositions are closed and ccp closes its previously announced behavioral hospitals acquisition sabra on a standalone basis has  exposure to genesis as a tenant and  to holiday per the press release concerning the deal sbra expects the deal to be  accretive to affo in the first full year which our analysis supports drivers of accretion include  m of synergies  assumption of relatively cheap debt from ccp jefferies may   sabra health care reit  sbra  announced that it is merging with healthcare reit peer care capital properties ccp  unrated in an all stock deal we believe that this is a surprise to investors and could actually support sbras current valuation as tenant concentration in its top  tenants declines significantly which has been somewhat of an overhang on valuation in our view getting to a pro forma market cap of b up from the current b would help with improving relevance with investors and ratings agencies in our view wells fargo may   the balance sheet will be strong and trading liquidity should improve and would also allow for more flexibility to manage the portfolio through asset sales given the increased sizescale mizuho may   we believe the company will have strong leadership as sabra management is well thought of in the investment community stifel may   permission to use quotations neither sought nor obtained  sabras management teams interests are directly aligned with all sabra shareholders sabras ceo is a top ten shareholder

merger between sabra health care reit inc and care capital eminence capital to vote against merger between sabra health care reit inc and care capital properties inc major sabra shareholder tells board that doubling down on skilled nursing facilities by purchasing ccps increasinglytroubled portfolio would hurt companys longterm growth news provided by eminence capital lp jul    et share this article new york july   prnewswire  eminence capital lp which owns  percent of the common stock of sabra health care reit inc nasdaq sbra today sent the following letter to the board of directors regarding their announced merger with care capital properties inc nyse ccp july   richard k matros chairman  board of directors  sabra health care reit inc   von karman avenue suite   irvine ca  dear chairman matros and members of the board of sabra health care reit inc we are writing this letter in regard to your proposed acquisition of care capital properties nyse ccp ccp announced may    eminence capital lp owns  of sabra health care reit inc nasdaq sbra sabra or the company and plans to vote against the deal  our opinion is predicated on the following skilled nursing facilities snfs are under tremendous pressure for various reasons and we see no end in sight  ccp is  exposed to snfs and in our view its snf portfolio in particular is terribly positioned to navigate through this increasingly challenged industry these pressures will drive larger rent cuts and more dramatic portfolio repositioning versus what the company represents resulting in value destruction for shareholders  the company is swapping its own valuable currency for ccp assets that will be worth materially less threetofive years from now in its public filings the company makes it clear that asset class diversification is an achievement  we therefore have serious questions with respect to the motivation and rationale for this deal while we emphasize poor strategic fit as our primary issue with the transaction the price sabra is paying is also meaningfully too high below are the specific and significant challenges faced by ccp as of the first quarter of   of rents were covered at less than x ebitdar up dramatically from  just one quarter ago and  one year ago in retrospect sabra managements claims during its first quarter  earnings call which was held before ccp released its first quarter  earnings supplement that ccps portfolio had not deteriorated relative to the prior quarter were clearly disingenuous  of rents are concentrated in its topfive operators where the combined coverage is x and overall portfolio samestore cash rents are in yearoveryear decline signature healthcare ccps second largest tenant representing  of rent is going through significant financial distress and could very likely need to file for bankruptcy protection sabra management is well aware of this but we believe that based on the continued industry stress this is not a straight forward situation where coverage needs to be reset at a modestly higher level signature could have continued deterioration for years to come that needs to be considered on its third quarter  earnings conference call and during subsequent followup conversations ccp began talking about some of its tenants requesting rent concessions which when coupled with the trends in coverage is very concerning the ccp portfolios average star rating is among the worst in the industry relative to other large or reitowned portfolios a reflection of poorquality assets the quality rating system is a program administered by the centers for medicare and medicaid cms and is increasingly being used by snf referral sources as a means to determine which snfs to partner with and where to send patient referrals a difficult operating environment makes it extremely challenging to turn these assets around these trends and absolute levels of portfolio coverage are particularly problematic given our belief that industry conditions will remain just as poor if not deteriorate further during the coming years  based on extensive primary research our view is that snf industry profitability will decline meaningfully over the next threetofive years  the primary drivers of this fundamental outlook are traditional medicare ffs to medicare advantage – snfs have seen and will continue to see tremendous profit pressure from a mixshift towards medicare advantage now representing roughly onethird of all medicare beneficiaries which carries significantly shorter lengths of stay and lower per diem payments to snfs medicare represents the large majority of industry profitability given its extremely high profit margins relative to medicaid we believe the strong growth in medicare advantage penetration will continue as will the consequent pressure on snf profitability valuebased reimbursement – snf referral sources hospitals in particular are becoming increasingly responsible for and incentivized around managing a patients overall cost and quality of care ie before during and after the hospital stay this shift from volume to value exposes waste within the healthcare continuum by forcing hospitals to more strongly consider the highestquality lowestcost sites of care snfs are very poorly positioned in this debate – hospitals are cutting snf referral networks by more than  and shortening lengths of stay for patients they do still send to snfs cost inflation – labornursing the largest cost item for snfs is feeling the effects of wage inflation nursing turnover at snfs can be incredibly high and these facilities struggle to recruit and retain top talent a in a world of staffing supply shortages and b given the competitive disadvantages versus deeperpocketed hospitals we believe wage inflation has moved from  to more like  which can be troublesome when snf revenues are declining added regulatory burden – the majority of snfs are  years old and in need of massive capital investment these lowerquality underinvested facilities play a role in the poor quality and compliance controls known to the industry not surprisingly we have witnessed an increased number of government investigations into various players in the space in addition newly passed regulations require snfs to comply with timeintensive and costly mandates reimbursement risk – for years and to a greater extent more recently certain independent advisory groups and regulatory authorities have recommended payment reform for snfs which in our opinion is a function of flaws in the current payment system and misaligned incentives leading to generous medicare margins over the years snfs have increasingly billed for the highest categories of therapy despite key characteristics of snf beneficiaries remaining unchanged resulting in billions in overpayments we believe significant payment reform will take place in the foreseeable future and that it is likely to be negative for snfs traditional medicaid to managed medicaid – states are increasingly outsourcing the management and reimbursement for snf patient populations to managed medicaid players similar to certain effects the shift from traditional medicare to medicare advantage has on snfs this shift towards more managed medicaid while still early days could have a significant effect on volumes length of stay and payment rates in recent presentations the company has illustrated rent cut scenarios for the ccp portfolio  we view this as an attempt to reassure shareholders that the portfolio can withstand a rent cut and the deal would still be modestly accretive to funds from operations ffo  however we believe the companys analysis is deeply flawed and that nearterm accretion will turn into significant longterm earnings dilution sabra is underestimating the risk – the companys scenarios suggest that ccp may see a rent cut of approximately   in our view the cut should reasonably be  or greater   we believe sabra management is overly focused on the nearterm issues at signature as the only major problem  we see no end in sight for the industry pressures  we believe there will be continued pressure on rent over the next threetofive years and given ccps poor relative positioning its portfolio will witness trends that are at least as bad as what we predict for the industry over the years sabras management and board have done an admirable job recognizing the need to diversify the companys portfolio and executed on this strategy  in its  proxy statement the company discussed this success as achievements related to diversifying the investment portfolio  in its first highlight supporting this demonstrated success it reads we further diversified our investment portfolio by tenant asset class and geography  in continuing to discuss further diversification success from its largest tenant genesis healthcare inc genesis sabra goes on to say upon completion of the genesis sales these asset sales and amendments will have the benefit of reducing our revenue concentration in genesis and skilled nursing facilities…  the proxy makes it very clear that the company views asset class diversification as a clear success  yet despite this prudent strategy applauded by both shareholders and the board management is unjustifiably reversing course by increasing its snf exposure back to  from   we have a very hard time understanding the rationale or motivation behind such a deal  two possible theories could be sabra is extremely worried about its largest tenant genesis  the company is desperate to diversify away more quickly andor plug the hole in ffo and is obtuse to the fact that less exposure to genesis does not make sense if its new exposure is even more problematic  the belief that sabras cost of capital over the longterm will be lower if it diversifies is misguided because they are embarking on a flawed strategy of swapping one bad hand for one even worse acquiring ccp will increase sabras market cap by x  per the proxy the compensation committee benchmarks management compensation against a list of companies that are of a similar size  a material increase in the market cap would leapfrog sabra into a peer group with a larger market cap and correspondingly higher range of compensation given our views on the snf industry and ccp in particular we would have a very hard time justifying a price at which this deal makes sense  we would however be remiss to not mention our view that the company is significantly overpaying for this asset even putting our strategic concerns aside  management has said that it paid an initial cap rate of   however when adjusted for potential nearterm rent cuts that rebase coverage merely to industry averages that falls to the mid range per management  relative to the  range where we believe other snf portfolios trade in the marketplace sabra is paying a huge premium  finally while this deal may be nearterm accretive we strongly believe it will be decidedly dilutive after larger rent adjustments and continued industry pressures  as sabra shareholders we recommend that the company take an alternative path – one similar to the previous strategy of diversifying away from large tenants snfs and government reimbursement and we welcome the opportunity to discuss this further sincerely ricky c sandler  chief executive officer and  chief
