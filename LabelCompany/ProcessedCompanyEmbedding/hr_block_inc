create an account search hrblockcom or find a tax office or tax pro get answers   online tax return tax return online filing an online tax return is often presented as an easy alternative to traditional filing practices but that doesnt necessarily mean that the process is selfexplanatory there are a number of important factors to consider when choosing the right service provider and taking advantage of deduction opportunities start with these tips for a successful experience only choose irsauthorized efilers in the fiscal year  the internal revenue service conducted  identity theftrelated criminal investigations unfortunately this figure increases every year with the growth of efiling services in many cases the problem involved using an efiler that wasnt authorized by the irs make sure to take advantage of the authorized irs efile provider locator which allows you to contact an irsauthorized tax professional in your area who has an approved electronic filing program take advantage of ira contributions say you went through the whole efile process and arent exactly happy with the figure you got with most deductions the deadline for your tax return is december  of the previous year however those who qualify for ira contributions can make them up until april  of the following year choosing this method can help you keep more of your money in the long run choose direct deductions and deposits one of the most convenient aspects of filing a tax return online is that you can pay with a debit or credit card or take the funds directly from your bank account direct deduction and deposit is typically the fastest way to undergo the process while also reducing the risk of identity theft and processing errors   hr block is an irsapproved center for filing online tax

initial questions about our taxes this year and sudhanshu was honest knowledgeable and gave us some great next steps had a  am appointment with bill chan this morning he is such a personable fellow he made the whole nasty tax paying ordeal a walk in the park the lady upfront seemed to be a little lost as to what her duties were not sure if it was her first day or if she was in training i let her know i was there she seemed to try to verify my appointment then nothing i just stood there not knowing if she had finished with me or not finally i just went and sat down then someone else came out and let me know my appointment would be in a few minutes other than that it wouldve been  stars a humorous side note the poor receptionist also had the printer run out of ink on her tough first morning and she wasnt sure how to fix it my girlfriend over heard her dilemma and when bill and i came out of the cubicle my girlfriend was loading the printer ink for the lady glad she could help and i will definitely use them again parking was not to bad the tax consultant mindy szutu was not able to explain any of the decisions she was talking while filing my returns at the very least she should have been able to explain why she was using itemized versus standard deductions but she could not since she was basically trying the brute force method of keying in different combinations into the software to see which combination gave the lowest tax she was also not able to explain other things like whether we should file jointly since we were married or separately she came to the conclusion based on  reports she ran that we should file separately however when cross checking her work i realized she had made an error that would have led me to pay  in excess tax also similar to other peoples experience the initial estimate was  but in the end it became  because our returns werecomplicated both my husband and i have usual bay area type income  salary and stock options from our employers plus some mutual fund investments nothing too complicated yet they were unable to give us an accurate estimate of the cost of filing a return i do not see the point of paying  for shoddy work where i have no confidence in the decisions made ive been getting my taxes done at this location for about a decade now and block has never let me down ive had the same person the entire time and she is great she checks in with me a few weeks before the office opens to make sure im ready to come back and if not she helps me figure out what papers i need no one likes to pay taxes but block makes it pretty easy to be done in about an hour with their computers having all my previous information stored thanks to them im guaranteed to be getting my maximum refund and i like that thanks hr block when you come to this particular hr block please check which agent you are going to be going to and avoid annie jones i filed this years taxes with her and i had an awful experience after getting a quote of about  i finally ended up paying  this is almost thrice the amount quoted and she justified with a random splitup from her computer to top it all she wasnt able to convincingly answer any of the questions i asked about the very numbers she was handing us the whole point of going to an external agent to handle all this is to be sure that it is all handled but the service was poor and misquoted and worst of all provided no confidence whatsoever anna always make filing taxes for me so easy being someone who waits until the last few days to file its nice to know that i can count on her and her team to help me get my taxes done right and in less than an hour she was calm patient even gave me tips on how to save money and what to watch out for when filing thanks for having my back anna and ill see you next year i had to remove a star  for lack of wifi but had an overall great experience never use annie jones she forgot to file our return i honestly do not think i need to write any more than that because forgetting to file someones returns equals she doesnt do her job but here it goes my husband and i went to hr block for the first time we were loyal turbotax users but seeing as we bought a house last year we gave this a shot we set up the appointment and went annies demenaor was unemotional unfriendly and uncommunicative she did not explain any part of the process or ramifications she just put numbers into the computer which spit out how much we owed when we had questions she was unable to answer them intelligently or give us any kind of remedial suggestions for next year i asked her up front how much the services would cost and she quoted us about  it turned out to be  we paid it reluctantly and said whatever our taxes are done or so we thought on taxes you can choose the date that the govt removes the owed funds we chose  weeks from when we met with annie that day came and went and nothing was deducted i thought that odd because at the end of the day its the feds they need their money so i gave it a few more days and still no withdrawal so i called the office and asked about it i was met with a highly unintelligent very difficult to understand women on the other end of the phone that could not understand my question once we finally gained comprehension at a st grad level they said oh that date is arbitrary dont worry the govt will take out their money i laughed and said well then dont give people the option to set the date just tell them it will be taken out when the govt gets around to it i then went home a little skeptical and looked up on the hr block website the status of our filing it came up with no information that again raised red flags i called the office again and got a new lady much more helpful and intelligent she looked up my info and thought that was odd so she promised to call me back no call was returned the next morning blood beginning to boil i checked online again the status now said our return was rejected by the irs neat i called the customer service line which they recommended doing which had no more information and told me to call the office that had filed to work with them here we go again i called same unintelligible woman answers i ask to speak to someone else or a manager she refuses so i try to once again explain the situation and she says oh i filed your return last night i am sorry what you filed my returns only after i reminded you that they were not filed you filed them in a hurry because the client called you and told you to do your job cool she then told me she was with someone and would have to call me back i told her that i had some serious questions for her but she refused to answer them and told me she would call me back i said fine and hung up no call was returned i finally call back get the nice lady again she said that my tax preparer was going to call me back in  minutes nope she didnt so i went over there to see this through in person i get there and my tax preparer is getting water and chatting it up with the receptionist she sees me and gets uncomfortable i grabbed a tootsie roll from the bowl and sit down in her office she explains that she wasnt in yesterday and thats why there was no call back but our taxes are filed and received by the govt she said she forgot to follow up with her manager to get it approved before sending it in and thats why they werent filed until now i explained how unacceptable that was and how that is not doing her job i told her that i shouldnt have to prompt her to do her job it is my taxes my life my money she needs to be respectful of that she didnt get it no affect no apology i asked her what remedy i could get for this oversight she forwarded me to her manager who i intend to follow up with for a major complaint and requesting a discount this is not the service i am paying for i could have done our taxes with turbotax and trusted that it was filed instead i left this responsibility in annies hands and she failed i was so unimpressed with this office the woman i spoke with was discouraging and unhelpful i have used hr block in the past but this was my first experience at this office the worst service so vague uninterested unhelpful go somewhere else for tax advice i am impressed obviously i am writing this review about my own personal experience a somewhat basic tax return and everyone has different tax issues but i can say that i was pleasantly surprised by the customer service and tax support at this hr block location i have heard some horror stories about hr block and i was usure of what the process would be like i made an appointment with william lucas i came in and was helped right away william is obviously highly knowledgeable in tax preparation he was so helpful and answered all of my questions he truly presented fantastic customer service he encouraged me to do what was best for me and even encouraged me to file taxes on my own if possible to avoid high fees on a basic return i walked away feeling like he really cares about me and is not just after my money you dont see too many people like that these days i am sure that all tax preparers are different but william appeared to be top notch and i would definitely recommend him you can view the tax preparer profiles on the hr block website to see what kind of education and experience they have next time i have tax questions or need someone to do my taxes i will head over to hr block without hesitation i had my taxes done with hr block and was in communication with anna regarding my return when she finished i received an email staying i would receive  back but would pay  in fees to hr block because my return was complicated i am a  year old student with two w forms and some mileage receipts how is that complicated luckily i got my forms back without them filing and i went to turbo tax i get over  back and am paying  in fees not only that but anna told me id lose money if i claimed my donations funny how i did claim that on turbo tax and get more money back dont go to hr block my partner and i were so blown away by our experience here yesterday with annie we have done our own taxes for years but wanted help because we werent sure about how to handle the intricacies of california domestic partnership along with the addition of our baby the former wed figured out on the past but we had questions about claiming the latter between us side note one more reason it sucks that the fed doesnt recognize ssm is the multiple different returns you have to file we made an appt and went in planning to pay however much we needed to in order to get it right on the eyes of the irs we sat down with annie preparing to resist up selling etc she looked at our past years selfprepared returns and said you really dont need us youve already done this just do xyz to handle the baby we were delighted and shocked and went on our happy way then an hour or so later she called us back to say i did some research and wanted to make this small change to my advice i was so so so impressed by her integrity and thoroughness we did not spend a dime and still she went the extra step to follow up after saving us however much money we were willing and ready to pay i think well need help at some point when things get more complicated and when we do i am going back to annie again integrity and awesome customer service hr block claimed this business has been claimed by the owner or a representative learn more  reviews details  opens a popup rating details tax

nonseasonal revenue and is expected to drive revenues and overall company growth during the coming years hrb  statements by management in annual reports and investor meetings block views its key to future success of the investment services segment as retention and recruitment of financial advisors which block pursued in ’ by hiring  experienced advisors this segment of block’s business has experienced severely declining revenue which is suggested to have been a result of the unfavorable environment of the equity market during the recent years however since acquisition of this business in ‘ block has been able to increase clientele in this division by over  hr block’s management lists the investment services business as one of their priorities for the next six years mortgage operations subsidiaries in the mortgage operations segment originate service and sell prime and subprime mortgage loans and securitize residual interests in the united states subprim mortgage originations constitute  of block’s business in this segment through a network of more than  mortgage brokers in all  states this segment offers a diverse mortgage product line to clients that do not meet traditional underwriting criteria according to reuters these services are available through block’s subsidiaries in addition to hrbfa branches block approves about  of their loan applications which come from over  independent sales associates throughout the us block makes money from the gain on the sale of these loans to other lenders through securitization the company makes money from the

planning financial planning wealth management and insurance services to individuals these services are made available through a number of sources the largest of which rsm mcgladrey inc operates more than  offices in  states hrb  the addition of these business units under the parent company along with the core hr block tax services inc created the operational backbone to support a fuller line of financial services cross selling is heavily used and customer information with proper consents is shared amongst the business units for marketing and contacts even though this strategy is well under way and in some ways is doing well other ways not the average person on the street does not have any idea block does more than “taxes” in addition some attempts to cross sell have worked to some degree such as mortgage products but others such as offering ira products to tax clients have not hr block’s average client has an income around  individual and do not seem to be interested in savings vehicles to the degree that would be necessary to meet sales goals strategy defined in an effort to become “america’s yearround tax and financial partner” block transformed itself from a company focused exclusively on tax preparation to a company that provides comprehensive financial services this diversification aimed to offer existing clients a wider range of products and services while compensating for sagging revenue during the off season of the tax preparation business in researching statements by management in annual reports investor meeting materials etc the author finds the following strategic direction is desired by the company several years the new ceo mr ernst at hr block said that the new strategy is to take the steps necessary to transition the company from “tax preparer” to “financial partner” hrb  ask anyone you know what does this company does and you will hear “prepare taxes” but financial partner hr block inc began to implement a strategy to offer clients and potential clients additional financial services beyond tax preparation hr block acquired olde financial based in detroit and used this firm as a launch to create hr block financial advisors inc in addition block acquired option one mortgage based in irvine ca and renamed the firm to hr block mortgage inc block’s management feels that the tax preparation market is so unsaturated that it is foreseeable to open  more stores in order to provide its customers sufficient convenient locations hr block studies indicate that for some of their clients convenience of location is valued higher than brand name and that the only way to capture such fringe customers is open stores throughout market areas these plans are currently under formulation and implementation although there was a  increase in the number of tax return offices tax clients served declined  during ’ which lead block to file  fewer returns than in ‘ this was offset by a jump in software sales of  for the same period block achieved increased profitability during the ’ tax season as a result of higher tax preparation fees average tax preparation fees have increased about  per year over the last four years to  suggesting that demand is slightly price elastic according to mr ernst because of this elasticity block can continue to raise its prices to generate revenue growth the company is competing on quality not on cost and on ‘location’ whether it be a physical location or via online using the web in addition the company has announced the opening of  new offices for tax season  in under served markets with the trending to online and software causing a decrease in office clients this may be a mistake one of the organization’s corporate priorities is to integrate and align tax esolutions financial advisors and retail mortgage incorporating advice as a key differentiator in that respect the company’s vision states “to be the world’s leading provider of financial services through taxand accounting based advisory relationships” it appears that the vision statement does not fully reflect the company’s longterm goals since it only mentions two specific products tax and accounting under the umbrella of financial services by stating only two products the vision statement implied that tax and accounting are the company’s core strategic goals with the other products revolving around them if that were the case then all the integration and arrangement measures through structural changes done in order to accelerate the alignment process would be much ado about nothing that is if the company’s true intention is what can be deduced from the vision statement strategy analyses some of the measurements of an effective strategy as outlined by thompson strickland  gamble  includes consideration of and alignment with the adopted competitive moves and business approaches a focus on competitive advantage resource strengths and overall competitive capabilities by acquiring complimentary businesses financial services and mortgage the company has been able to to a certain degree begin offering the millions of customers who come to block for tax preparation other financial services during the last few years mortgage has done well tax held steady with barely an increase and financial services has lost money online services and software have shown good increases in clients yet profitability is very low at this time consumer awareness and trust as well as infrastructure and technology needs require more work than originally realized in addition the internal problems of an old cash cow business unit tax services being asked to suddenly share clients with and work with business units with differing cultures and operating speeds is a much larger issue perhaps than management anticipated the strategy of providing additional financial products to current tax customers as well as running these complimentary business units as unique operations does have a good fit hr block does have competitive advantage in the service areas mentioned but more so with tax and mortgage than with financial services it may be learned and the results the last few years bears this out that the client base of tax and mortgage are not the most ideal financial services fit tax and mortgage deal primarily with mid to low income groups and high profitability in financial services comes from the mid to high income groups value chain the value chain categorizes the generic value adding activities of an organization the “primary activities” include inbound logistics production outbound logistics sales and marketing maintenance the “support activities” include administrative infrastructure management human resources management rd and procurement the costs and value drivers are identified for each value activity the value chain framework quickly made its way to the forefront of management thought as a powerful analysis tool for strategic planning its ultimate goal is to maximize value creation while minimizing costs porter  the value chain maps a firm into its strategically relevant activities in order to understand the behavior of costs and the existing and potential sources of differentiation differentiation results from the way a firm’s product associated services and other activities affect its buyer’s activities all the activities in the value chain contribute to buyer value and the cumulative costs in the chain will determine the difference between the buyer value and producer cost a firm gains competitive advantage by performing these strategically important activities cheaper or better than its competitors one of the reasons the value chain framework is helpful is because it emphasizes that competitive advantage can come not just from great products or services but from anywhere along the value chain in strategic management it is critical to understand both the competitive advantage of an organization as well as understand the value chain five forces model the five forces model developed by porter  guides the analysis of organization’s environment and the attractiveness of the industry the five forces include the risk of new competitors entering the industry threat of potential substitutes the bargaining power of buyers the bargaining power of suppliers and degree of rivalry between the existing competitors porter a starting point to analyzing the industry is to look at competitive rivalry if entry to an industry is easy then competitive rivalry will likely to be high if it is easy for customers to move to substitute products for example from coke to water then again rivalry will be high generally competitive rivalry will be high if • there is little differentiation between the products sold between customers in this case block has the advantage of a long solid history with the perception being that they know what they are doing and can be trusted in addition electronic filing is a long time product of block that has also gained a lot of trust with customers of the two competitors jackson hewitt and liberty block is the only one with a guarantee that pays additional costs of any errors in work done • competitors are approximately the same size of each other the two competitors are very small compared to block no other tax preparation firm comes close to reaching the size and market share of block • if the competitors all have similar strategies they do have very similar strategies in the tax services arena however this will be an area to review in regards to financial services and mortgage suppliers are also essential for the success of an organization however block is a service business and suppliers are abundant for office supplies computer equipment etc block develops its own tax software all mission critical needs are handled by block so the threat of suppliers is almost non existent although the irs in a sense is a supplier of the electronic filing product infrastructure and does heavily influence what sort of electronic filing products are offered buyers or customers can exert influence and control over an industry in certain circumstances this happens when there is little differentiation over the product and substitutes can be found easily for many low income customers there is no loyalty and they will move to other providers if the fees are lower or they can get their refunds quicker regarding threat of substitutes the question is are there alternative products that customers can purchase over block’s product that offer the same benefit for the same or less price this is high in the case of hr block due to the availability of cheap and easy tax preparation programs the increased use of the internet by a growing number of internet users and technology is creating new forms of service delivery such as online services and software capabilities and price competitive analysis – external industry analyses tax preparation industry the irs projected that for ‘ they would receive  million tax returns a number which they project to continue growing at a rate of  per year until  when the total number is expected to be  million in the us tax payers may file their returns either through pipeline filing methods sending paper forms through the usps or by efiling irs  the irs has strongly encouraged efiling in recent years which is now becoming increasingly popular and consists of both telefiling and online filing online filing can be completed either through a broker or from any personal computer the irs projects that during ‘  million returns will be efiled which would constitute  of all expected returns subsequently the irs projects this number to grow  per year until  when the number of efilers is expected to be  million or  of the expected returns during the  tax season irs  during recent years the irs has promoted this method by touting higher accuracy lower costs less time consuming processing procedures and refund turn around three to five weeks sooner than pipeline filing online filing is expected to increase by  from ‘ to ‘ and is expected to jump another  for the ‘ tax season according to hrb the percentage of individual tax returns completed by paid preparers has risen from  in  to  in  tax preparation competition the most recent us economic census conducted in  suggested that the tax preparation industry is very fragmented while hr block holds  of this market its largest competitors intuit and microsoft hold significantly smaller portions although both of these companies directly compete with a portion of block’s business neither has the same business model or identical products intuit inc is a provider of business and financial management solutions for businesses and consumers and accounting professionals this company not only produces products such as turbotax and the quicken line of software they also provide the general public professional tax help in person intuit has offices in  states while block has offices in all  and both companies have a presence in the uk and canada microsoft also plays a part in the tax preparation industry with microsoft® excel version  inside out software growth of two fairly new competitors jackson hewitt and liberty tax which are using similar business model of combination of retail locations and online services while currently these organizations are no where near the size of block they are growing significantly each year the availability of cheap and easy tax preparation programs is also an external factor which is driven by the customer need to conduct business when and where it is convenient for them the increased use of the internet for tax preparation by a growing number of internet users is also an external factor technology is creating new forms of service delivery as mentioned previously regarding online services and software capabilities and price in addition the internal revenue service factors as both a resource and competitor in a sense in the chapter entitled “conceptions of environments”  scott notes that the most common conception of environment of organizations is that of a task environment he defines this concept as all aspects of the environment that are “potentially relevant to goal setting and goal attainment” and goes on to note that it is typically narrowed to refer to the nature and sources of inputs competitors and markets for output this based on the belief that most organizations are created to achieve goals to perform some type of work scott goes on later in the book and talks about managing task environments and notes  that there are many research resources and theories regarding the various aspects of managing the task environment ie the sources of inputs markets for outputs competitors and regulators at hr block there is a great deal of material that could covered under this subject but one in particular stands out and that is the need at block for the customers it serves in tax operations to continue to need that service i am speaking of the internal revenue service as both a resource and a competitor for block block’s tax service is regulated in that all paid tax preparers must conform to tax professional rules and regulations that are part of the tax code and compliance enforcement in the responsibility of the irs so in one way the irs is a compliance officer to block and block must ensure that all tax professionals and company representatives comply with these rules at all times they include sharing of information application of tax law and theory etc in addition the irs has been a partner to block and these two organizations worked together almost a joint venture in behavior to develop electronic filing in the late ’s this has been a boon to both organizations at irs processing centers labor needs have decreased as more filer’s use electronic filing rather than mailing in paper returns they have experienced other benefits as well less errors etc at block this new product produced a new revenue stream that now makes up approximately  of revenues in the tax services business unit block and the irs also work together on special projects and have a sort of standing arrangement where if the irs wants an idea tested or hammered out they go to block the largest preparer with  million customers five years ago irs was concerned over the pending proposals for changes to the earned income credit irs asked block to analyze what they might mean to lower income tax papers with  million customer records that could be analyzed for impact it is much more than a random sampling the irs used this information to make internal recommendations to the program in many ways over the years block has managed to use the irs to actually help grow the company and the irs has benefited from this enormously this is true case of no organization generates all the resources necessary for its goal attainment or survival  software comparison taxcut versus turbo tax during ’  million filers used intuit’s turbo tax while only  million used block’s taxcut hrb   intuit  block’s software offerings average  less expensive for comparable software with similar features which is illustrated by taxcut and turbo tax’s price ranges  and  respectively both products tout extremely user friendly features such as aggressive deduction finder error double check and import of previous year’s repeatable information to promote continued use complaints regarding turbo tax are that the software is generally designed for one user to do one return and that it difficult to jump to one part of the return process without completing the entire procedure regarding taxcut’s short comings consumers have suggested that it is easier to file more complicated itemized returns with turbo tax than taxcut although this may be outweighed by the smaller price both products are designed to file only the federal tax return for the fiscal year the product is purchased and both also offer a rebate program to get the state version at no cost after rebate because tax legislation varies by year a new version of either product is available each year which sustains demand for this market it is unclear if on of these products will clearly dominate the market in the near future because their extremely similar characteristics pricing and availability what is clear is that the market for ax preparation software is growing and that as long as both products remain innovative and react to consumers demands they will continue to attract new customers block’s brand name is one small advantage regarding taxcut’s prospects in the future although that is only enough to pique interest in the product while the features and ease of use will keep customers retuning year after year mortgage industry the specific activity mortgage bankers engage in is the purchase packaging and sale of loans to third parties this segment of block’s business is sensitive to interest rate fluctuations interest rate cuts have driven mortgage rates to a  year record low which in turn spurred a sharp increase in home mortgage refinances the industry has directly benefited from significantly higher volume of loan transactions in recent years driving a  trillion increase in mortgages originated between ‘ and ‘ because the majority of those interested in refinancing their mortgages have had sufficient opportunity to do so business in this sector will be driven by new mortgage originations rather than additional refinances the market for subprime mortgage will not slow down as much the prime market over a period of rising interest rates due to the cashout refinance nature of the business during ‘ subprime originations constituted  of all loans and during ‘ they constituted  if interest rates rise in ‘ as greenspan has indicated then subprime originations should rise to their normal volume of  of all loans nearly double what they are now over the new few years the subprime industry expects growth of at least  a year regardless that low interest rates may have caused a spike of mortgage refinances in recent years block has experienced steadily increasing rate of mortgage originations the same time period although mortgage refinancing may not continue to be as considerable revenue source in the future hrb management suggested in a goldman sachs conference call that nonrefinance mortgage origination rates are increasing steadily which should at least partially compensate financial advice industry hr block financial advisors hrbfa competes directly with a broad range of companies seeking to attract consumer financial assets including fullservice brokerage firms discount and online brokerage firms mutual fund companies investment banking firms commercial and savings banks insurance companies and others in ‘ there was  trillion invested in mutual funds which is the largest single portion of this industry  of this  trillion was controlled by six firms at that time these were vanguard  janus capital corp  fidelity  pimco alliance and mfs with  each nyse market report searches  clearly block is a small player in this enormous industry in the secondary business units financial services and mortgage there are huge number of competitors currently offering services both businesses who core business are in these areas with high skills and those businesses that branched into these areas whether or not related to their core business for example retailers running credit operations in the regulatory arena block business units are heavily regulated tax services by internal revenue service and treasury department rules financial services by sec and broker regulations and mortgage by lending laws the most out of control areas are mortgage due to interest rate drivers and tax due to tax law changes foreign markets of the five segments at block only one tax services actually operates in foreign markets mortgage financial services and business services operate solely in the united states until recently hr block placed a moderate amount of emphasis on foreign markets but the particular services block offers and especially the nontax segments are not viable in most countries as disclosed in the companies  annual report the international tax operations segment has been aggregated with us tax operations in the tax services segment and prior year results have been reclassified to reflect this change in the  annual report block stated that international operations contributed  million  million and  million in revenues for fiscal years   and  respectively and  million  million and  million of pretax income respectively this represents only  of revenue in  but is up a bit from the  contribution in  australia is flat over this time period and the growth came from tax law changes in canada considering the markets it makes sense that block would not allocate a great deal of resources to foreign markets but instead operate primarily domestically the company’s tax segment provides services to assist taxpayers with required self filings few countries have such systems requiring tax payers to self file in canada the tax reporting system is similar to the united states in that taxpayers file returns on an annual basis this is also true in australia the united kingdom is different in that few taxpayers are required to submit any filings in the financial services area there is impact from foreign markets the financial services industry has become considerably more concentrated as many firms have been acquired by or merged with other firms in recent years some of these competitors have greater financial resources than hrbfa and offer additional financial products and services competition from domestic and international commercial banks and larger securities firms is expected to continue to increase as a result of legislative and regulatory initiatives in the us firms in this industry are impacted by market performance volatility investor sentiment margin balances government regulation and many other factors which cannot be controlled competitive analysis – internal swot analyses a swot analysis is an effective method for identifying hr block’s strengths and weaknesses while examining the opportunities and threats the company may face strengths personalized product and services only brand to offer software online and inoffice solutions dynamic marketing skills and structure brand

services competitors building brand strength and service capabilities that drive consumer expectations service capabilities that lead consumer expectations mortgage industry – scale advantages dominate successful business models business ethics according to thompson business ethics refers to the application of general ethical principles and standards to business behavior they go on to say that business actions are judged by the general ethical standards of society not by a special set of more permissive standards examples of ethical behaviors are honesty integrity keeping one’s word respecting rights of others and practicing the golden rule hr block has a core set of values that the company attempts through training and orientation to instill in each employee hr block’s values are client focused integrity we are honest and ethical in everything we do excellence we take pride in doing our best in everything we do we embrace change to learn and grow respect we treat each other with respect and dignity recognizing that innovation springs from unique perspectives and teamwork everyone’s collaboration and full participation make us stronger and allow us to serve clients better hrb web site in my experience at block these values which include being honest and ethical in all actions are adhered to by the majority of employees and leaders block has a culture of honesty and integrity which was fostered by henry block the founder and i would say this is a very ethical company social responsibility thompson outlines the notion of social responsibility as it applies to businesses concerns a company’s duty to operate by means that avoid harm to stakeholders and the environment and further to consider the overall betterment of society in its decisions and actions at hr block one the products sold is known as a rapid refund this is a loan against a refund the demographics of block clients are typically middle or lower income tax payers and many qualify for a refundable tax credit known as the earned income tax credit this is credit given to low income tax payers and was intended to help those falling into this income range to move higher up in the income levels to assist with supporting their family block’s rapid refund product is a high cost loan and the interest rate is very high considering the length of the loan typically a few weeks the national consumer law center is a nonprofit organization specializing in consumer issues on behalf of lowincome people nclc works with thousands of legal services government and private attorneys as well as community groups and organizations who represent lowincome and elderly individuals on consumer issues according to the nclc refund anticipation loans rals are usurious shortterm loans secured by the taxpayer’s expected tax refund over half of ral consumers are recipients of the earned income tax credit eitc despite the fact that eitc recipients only constitute  of all taxpayers they also state from valid research that low income taxpayers lost over  billion in loan charges and fees in  their research also indicates that check cashing fees add to the cost of getting tax refunds or rals especially for those consumers who do not have bank accounts while many unbanked consumers find ways to get their checks cashed for free commercial check cashers count on tax season to boost their revenues one study found that  percent of eitc recipients planned to use a check casher to cash refund checks further draining this program check cashers are also moving into the taxfiling and ral market for their clientele since irs rules prohibit commercial tax preparers from charging their clients to cash tax refund or ral checks  some tax preparers have formed partnerships with check cashers hr block has teamed up with ace cash express one of the nation’s largest check cashing chains this partnership has been proven very profitable for ace which has seen growth in its income during tax season part of the hr blockace partnership involves placement of selfservice check cashing machines in lobbies of hr block tax preparers ace reported that  of its check cashing fees in fiscal year  came from selfservice machines located in ace stores or in hr block offices ace placed  machines at block locations during  and has an agreement with block to place up to  machines during the  taxfiling season as of the end of june ace had  machines in companyowned locations and  machines available for deployment at hr block locations for  ace expecting a booming business in cashing block checks this year announced cash inventory of  million during the  tax season for  selfservice machines placed in hr block offices ace also has a  million credit line from banks for a total cash inventory of  million available to cash tax refund and refund anticipation loan checks during the  taxfiling season in addition to nclc several other consumer groups have charged this is a rip off and that block is stealing some of this earned income credit from needy families and is perceived as being very unethical block counters that these clients in fact want this service and block is doing nothing more than meeting the needs of its clients this issue draws attention every year and creates quite a bit of bad press currently the national consumer law center consumer federation of america is working to ban refund anticipation loans outright or make them subject to state usury and small loan interest rate laws diversification strategies thompson points out that diversification becomes an attractive strategy when a company runs out of profitable growth opportunities in its original business hr block since it’s inception in the  was focused on one area tax preparation in the ’s they did begin to think about diversification when talk began about a flat tax they purchased a company called compuserve based in columbus oh at the time it was doing well in the new area of online subscription services it did not however fit all the tests for a good acquisition for block and the management team at corporate lost some key people at compuserve and had no skills at all in running such a business in essence for several years it sort of just stayed flat in growth and innovation and aol took off and left compuserve in the dust compuserve was finally sold in the mid ’s and the buyer stripped off the technical infrastructure for their own use the other services were discontinued this was blocks first try at diversification so it was a long while before they tried again in the late ’s a new ceo was hired who is still managing the firm through a brand and strategic shift and he immediately laid plans to diversify but only with complimentary businesses with a good fit to the core competencies of block block certainly fits with the opening remark from thompson in this discussion tax is mature and has growth potential that is limited each year mergers and acquisitions thompson  identifies several strategy choices in chapter  of crafting and executing strategy the quest for competitive advantage and one of those is the merger and acquisition strategy the authors state that a “merger is a pooling of two or more companies as equals with the newly created company often taking on a new name an acquisition is a combination in which one company purchases and absorbs the operations of another” according to thompson the objective of mergers and acquisitions are to achieve one or more of the following organizational business goals paving the way for acquiring firm to gain more market share and create a more efficient operation expanding a firm’s geographic coverage extending a firm’s business into new product categories or international markets gaining quick access to new technologies andor to invent a new industry and lead the convergence of industries whose boundaries are blurred by changing technologies and new market opportunities thompson goes on to indicate that combining operations may result in some negative consequences such as resistance from rankandfile employees hardtoresolve conflicts in management styles and corporate culture and tough problems of integration in addition the author’s state that greaterthananticipated difficulties may occur in achieving expected costsavings sharing of expertise and achieving enhanced competitive capabilities regardless of possible negative effects the mergeracquisition is a much used strategic option and is a common occurrence in business today hr block does have a good example of this strategic method in  block acquired option one mortgage based in irvine ca after running the business as a separate company retaining the name and structure in  this firm was renamed hr block mortgage inc in addition in  hr block acquired olde financial a securities firm based in detroit and used this firm as a launch to create hr block financial advisors inc the addition of these two business units under the parent company along with the core hr block tax services inc created the operational backbone to support a fuller line of financial services cross selling is heavily used and customer information with proper consents is shared amongst the business units for marketing and contacts in many other ways outlined in my final project the company has used these acquired firms to provide the operational structure required to gain entry into new areas relatively quickly moving into financial services and mortgage has been a big plus for the company mortgage has been especially lucrative financially and while financial services are not as strong it is growing steadily as skills and talent is added they do fit very well and there is cross marketing and up selling in and across the business units it is taking longer to really integrate and turn these strategies into operational ways of doing business but they are achieving the plan shareholder value according to thompson there are three tests that if passed indicates the diversification move can produce added value for share holders they also state that “managing a set of unrelated businesses is a much weaker foundation for enhancing shareholder value than is a strategy of related diversification where corporate performance can be boosted by competitively valuable crossbusiness strategic fits” the industry attractiveness test measures whether the industry chosen measures favorably in competitive conditions and a market environment that is as good as or better than the current businesses it seems that block meets this test with their diversification strategy by entering into the financial services and mortgage businesses they are able to cross market and sell to for most products existing customers of the core business the mortgage business has done extremely well in profitability the costofentry test measures whether the business in consideration has a cost of creating or buying that will limit profitability in the case of block the mortgage business has shown incredible returns on the original investment the financial services firm purchased were slow to contribute profit but are doing so now the betteroff test measures whether well as it says the company is better off overall with this business financially if there is no increase in profits and shareholder value with the business than without it than it would not meet the test block is definitely better off with these businesses than without as shown in the contribution rates of the businesses to the overall corporate profit in addition these businesses provide value added services to the  million tax clients out there in the form of these added financial and mortgage services block in my opinion as a former long time executive and based upon operating results has done well in these businesses and seem to have made good choices by using a diversification strategy of related businesses that provide added value to shareholders and customers of the cash cows tax services division unfortunately these units have not all achieved the profitability levels desired and financial services in particular has sustained some heavy losses during the first few years of implementing this strategic plan strategy analysis strategy – integration of services across business units completing its transformation from tax provider to financial services provider hr block is well aware that it is entering into some stiff competition— from brickandmortar to clickandmortar and strictly online ventures one of the areas that could be improved that would allow for better support of the company cross selling and servicing strategy is to create greater cross operational responsibilities for local and regional managers this company does retain a good deal of silo mentality at this level and managers should have more cross operational responsibilities for example those customers using online tax preparation or purchasing taxcut software could have included year round in person service if needed at the local physical block office both managers should be viewed as responsible for this customer and compensation considering accordingly this same scenario could work in reverse with physical office customers seeking assistance via the web infrastructure is in place to accomplish this and only strategic planning and execution of processes changes is needed as thompson states “organizational capabilities emerge from a process of consciously knitting together the efforts of different work groups departments and external allies not from how the boxes on the organization chart are arranged” in the past few years technology and functional areas have been reorganized and processes reengineered to support this type of operational shift however the people have not been paid as much attention to currently if a local block manager has a client come in that had done their taxes with the software about all the help they can offer is an  number to call for support on the product but not with any tax issues there is no incentive to assist this client any more than that customer needs and the market drivers should be primary considerations regardless of what branch of the company the client approaches for assistance hr block already has strong brand equity as a tax preparation company but to successfully take advantage of financial industry deregulation the company needed to leverage the relationships with its traditional tax customers much of this effort falls on its tax preparers as the first point of contact for customers they’re charged with gauging the interest level and potential value a tax customer would receive from other financial services including mortgage products and investment plans once customers express interest the company needed an efficient way to pass information to the appropriate financial advisors and ensure every inquiry was addressed that was the hard part with  advisors spread across  financial centers nationwide because of changes in policies processes structure and technology solutions when a tax customer requests more information on other hr block services information on that customer’s background and interest area is automatically routed to the most qualified financial advisor for an immediate tailored response according to a crm study hrb  within the organization conducted by a software firm the company could enable its financial advisors to provide personalized sales and service they found that hr block is giving its customers reason to be loyal and creating a return on relationship over the customer lifecycle while piloting its financial service center concept hr block initially used a contact management and lead distribution application but it ultimately lacked the robustness needed that’s when the financial services group began seeking a new sales force automation solution meanwhile the company had chosen a technology solution as its scalable webready crm solution to track and route customer inquiries— whether they come in by phone email the web or in person—in the company’s newly consolidated customer contact center its individual call centers had been using disparate call center tracking software which meant that the company wasn’t getting a single view of each of its customers—or their profitability levels the new customer contact center serves the tech support needs of the company’s  offices as well as its client relations financial and ecommerce groups future plans thompson has several key points regarding organizational capabilities companies don’t implement and execute strategies people do all managers have strategyexecuting responsibility in their areas of authority and all employees participate in the strategy execution process and when strategies fail it is often because of poor execution— things that were supposed to get done slip through the cracks a talented management team is essential talent implies that an appropriate mix of skills and experiences exists within the team intellectual capital is more important to strategy execution than other investments also decentralizing decision making which takes full advantage of the talent is important to good strategy execution hr block has been reorganizing and changing the management team over the last five years as they have added businesses through acquisition and development of new products online and software for example they have added key management personnel in those areas with backgrounds and skills in the appropriate fields while this company does not attract “stars” it has a very capable management team and the only criticism is that unfortunately many of those newly added have left after two or so years a great deal of turnover has occurred in seeking just the right individuals in some cases they were not working out and in others they sought greener pastures the management ranks in the middle levels of the company are however stable and exhibits a great deal of talent within their respective operational group this company does retain a good deal of silo mentality at this level and managers should have more cross operational responsibilities for example those customers using online tax preparation or purchasing taxcut software could have included year round in person service if needed at the local physical block office both managers should be viewed as responsible for this customer and compensation considering accordingly this same scenario could work in reverse with physical office customers seeking assistance via the web infrastructure is in place to accomplish this and only strategic planning and execution of processes changes is needed as thompson states “organizational capabilities emerge from a process of consciously knitting together the efforts of different work groups departments and external allies not from how the boxes on the organization chart are arranged” thompson also states that “the ultimate goal of decentralized decision making is not to push decisions down to lower levels but to put decisionmaking authority in the hands of those persons or teams closest to and most knowledgeable about the situation” block is a leader in this area local and regional managers are responsible for most decision making regarding hiring schedule of activities training tax schools etc location selection local marketing bookkeeping public relations etc when i was a district manager the total experience was of running my own business with the absence of financial liability there are however policies and procedures for many areas that must be adhered to in all locations but deviations are allowed with proper approvals and usually this is just one level up rather going to the ceo another area is evaluation of strategy implementation for several years the company has been designing and setting up processes to support a balanced scorecard method kaplan  the balanced scorecard is a management system not only a measurement system that enables organizations to clarify their vision and strategy and translate them into action it provides feedback around both the internal business processes and external outcomes in order to continuously improve strategic performance and results when fully deployed the balanced scorecard transforms strategic planning from an academic exercise into the nerve center of an enterprise kaplan and norton describe the innovation of the balanced scorecard as follows “the balanced scorecard retains traditional financial measures but financial measures tell the story of past events an adequate story for industrial age companies for which investments in longterm capabilities and customer relationships were not critical for success these financial measures are inadequate however for guiding and evaluating the journey that information age companies must make to create future value through investment in customers suppliers employees processes technology and innovation” the balanced scorecard suggests that we view the organization from four perspectives and to develop metrics collect data and analyze it relative to each of these perspectives  the learning and growth perspective  the business process perspective  the customer perspective and  the financial perspective at hr block key performance indicators have been identified and databases put into place to provide executives with data at all levels of the company in the four performance dimensions measured by the scorecard executives indicate in personal conversations with the author that the initiative is going well and the tool is providing much needed information to assist with decision making and measurement of results summary and closing in a forbes article printed in early  author emily lambert stated “april  looms but h  r block chief executive mark a ernst has more than taxes on his mind he’s eager to find out how many of this season’s customers can gradually be convinced to buy h  r block’s newer offerings including home mortgages business consulting and brokerage services last fiscal year the company’s nontax businesses accounted for half of its  billion in revenue most of that from its mortgage lending which it started offering in  its financial services business hemorrhaged  million pretax last year and the business services arm is also lagging the loans which can carry interest rates of  appeal to cashstrapped lowincome customers some customers may be wary too the company is under fire for its “refund anticipation loans” the loans which can carry interest rates of  appeal to cashstrapped lowincome customers the fees accounted for  million in revenue last year hr block has settled a number of loanrelated laws” this is a powerful representation of the state of company as of that time which is result of close inspection during a time of transition what she does not mention is how this compares to the first couple of years of the strategy implementation of broadening services as of today the picture is brighter and the company while still a long way from being there is closer to achieving some of the goals this paper outlined the company the strategy employed the rationale for various components of the strategy and how these areas fit within
