fundersclubs chief executive officer since then the idea of startup investing on the internet is less novel but what has shockingly remained the case is this pretty high level of disinterest or lack of care for returnsthere are caveats most of fundersclubs returns are tied to the private valuations of the startups that it has backed fundersclub sometimes holds startup investments at lower valuations than their last fundraising round but it has still benefited from frothy paper valuations of the 0 million thats been invested through fundersclub only  million has been realized  and some of that came in the form of more stock when portfolio companies were acquired by larger highflying startups like slack technologies incthey have better paper returns than other folks  if the asset

syndicates are   million has been invested in 0 startups since its founding equity crowdfunding hasnt become a booming business yet some members of congress have floated passing legislation to let people become accredited investors on the basis of their financial knowhow not just their wealth or income thats something mittal believes could drive more people to startup investing there is still mostly a focus on accredited investors so that hasnt brought in momandpop folks  which might be a good thing sanwal said i dont think this has become this capitalmarkets sensation folks were maybe
