nowgo»enzo biochem rounds the cornerjul  about enzo biochem enz strong bio long only biotech growth contrariansummaryenzo diagnostics platforms are expanding revenues are increasing and costs are decreasing enzo has a competitive pricepoint advantage and market penetration set to serve impressively large markets enzo is wellpositioned to expand into your investment portfolio enzo biochem inc enz is a  million market cap company focused on gene regulation and gene modification technologies specifically enzo has developed into a leader in the field of recombinant dna technology a major space in modern medicine the key to their business has been generating very low cost physicianbased mdx diagnostic platforms that are highly sensitive versatile and compatible with current open systems in many cases enz offers its clients savings of  versus competitors the company has made its stateoftheart laboratory capabilities available on a reference basis enabling other labs to meet clientphysician needs in a more affordable manner in this space of competitively squeezed reimbursements the company is focused on streamlining product distribution and developing new diagnostics tools to expand its market enz stock has increased about  over the past year and the company has reported improved operating results main growth drivers for the company are in the women’s health space where enz has increased its market share in new york with new york state department of health having recently granted conditional approvals for infectious disease the company’s cost efficient ampiprobe® pcr platform is expanding its specialized analyte panel with three new diagnostics anticipated to be generating revenue by end q  the diagnostic product expansion was for realtime pcrbased diagnostics for neisseria gonorrhoeae chlamydia trachomatis and trichomonas vaginalis enz reported that these are just a few of the diagnostic products to be released in its long line of product developments to come in addition to these products the company is developing assays in its flow cytometry platform flow cytometry can be used in large market applications such as cancer detection infectious disease inflammatory bowel disease urology hiv diabetes immune disorders bone disorders and hematopathology enzo also is developing a line of diagnostic products examining biopsy specimens for oncology according to the company molecularbased laboratory service us products have a market currently estimated to be in excess of  billion q  revenues were reported at  million the company generated clinical lab revenues of  million an  growth over prior year period and represents a sixth straight quarterly increase gross margins are increasing for the company as well life sciences business revenue decreased  to  million citing weakness in academic and government markets but remains a profitable segment having displayed lower operating costs the company was essentially cash neutral having turned the corner over last year period which had a  per share quarterly loss from a market standpoint treatmentresistant strains offer the infectious disease diagnosis market space prospects for growth with genetic testing approaches confirming several advantages genetic testing approaches can screen panels of known mutants as builtin features of a testing platform whereas immunomarkers may fall short without a cocktail of expensive and wasteful tests as a builtin feature however markets for infectious disease and biomarker diagnostics are extremely competitive with advances having led to declining margins for a number of years and it seems unlikely that new players can even target the space at the turn of the century biomarker diagnostics was a hot space and there was no shortage of companies wanting in or analyst coverage but consolidation licensing and acquisitions have streamlined the segment and the mature species of diagnostics firms has now been selected immunoassays still dominate the space but genetic screening technologies have emerged due to technical advantages such as panel analysis costdriven factors and honestly the absolute passion of the genetic engineers who recognized its potential and developed the technology to be so sensitive being efficient was the key to survival and enz has succeeded in costpoint and physicianpatient availability having been named as innetwork provider for the th largest national insurer two critical competitive factors genetic diagnostics as an industry got a lot of coverage by analysts about ten years ago as did enz but it doesnt appear to be getting all that much followup attention right now ironically even though the market is finally telling us opportunity may be passing strong bio regards this as a good potential watchlist candidate for all of the reasons stated above additionally it is possible that acquisition of this infectious disease leader by the onestop shopping push for consolidation in dna diagnostics could reel enz in as part of a larger operation strong bio sees an opportunity for wholegenome screening leaders tumor ctdna leaders and infectious disease leaders to merge and dominate the genetic diagnostic space in the coming decade risks for the company remains in that it is an incredibly competitive space but much of the competitive risk has been resolved due to the critical costpoint and market penetration work that the company has performed with  million in cash and cash equivalents it does not seem likely they would need to raise capital but it is a possibility if the company wants to expand into a new space that requires significant investment reward to risk ratio is as good as one could expect for the industry there is a significant risk in that some competitors have purportedly infringed upon the companys patents for dna detection the company feels that the courts have made errors in its early rulings against enzo but the trend in dnarelated legal judgments have been competitionsupportive perhaps opportunitypromoting legal influence can provide better medical care for patients in the long run in either case the competitive space has yet to work out some of the proprietary boundaries and remains a risk factor for enz investment disclosure iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any
