people wealthier than ever before but capitalisms future is far from assured the global financial meltdown of  nearly triggered another great depression economies in europe are still teetering and powerful forcesincome inequality resource depletion and mass migrations from poor to rich countries to name just a fewpose serious threats to continued prosperity how can the future of capitalism be secured and who should spearhead the effort many observers point to government but in capitalism at risk the authors argue otherwise while they agree that governments must play a role they maintain that businesses should lead the way indeed for enterprising companies the current threats to market capitalism present vital opportunities drawing on discussions with business leaders around the world the authors argue that companies must stop seeing themselves as bystanders and instead develop innovative business strategies that address the disruptors produce profitable growth and strengthen institutions at the community national and international levels   the ceo within why inside outsiders are the key to succession planning with rising ceo turnover companies are increasingly looking outside for qualified candidates sure externally recruited ceos bring fresh perspectives and connections but they lack the indepth knowledge of the company s culture and history that they need to succeed result many deliver disappointing performances companies can avoid this scenario contends joseph bower in the ceo within drawing on a decade s research including interviews with leading ceos and experience managing the succession process bower explains how companies can develop a cohort of internal candidates one of whom may be suited to the increasingly demanding ceo role the key groom insideoutsiders these leaders view their role through the lens of someone who just bought the company unencumbered by the cognitive and emotional baggage that comes from a long tenure in the organization but they also leverage the knowledge they ve accumulated about the company s people suppliers and customers and future direction placed squarely at the intersection of succession planning and leadership development this book describes the distinguishing attributes of the insideoutsider and reveals how to recruit nurture and promote this special type of leader with a healthy supply of qualified internal candidates companies get the leadership they need when they need it the corporate leader how corporate managers contribute value in todays economic climate corporate leaders in multidivisional and multinational companies face a uniquely broad set of challenges while putting in place the systems relationships and strategies that foster business unit success you also must lead

corporations derives from and is focused on seeking monopolistic power” posted on march   by promarket writers in this installment of promarket’s new interview series harvard business school professor emeritus joseph bower shares some thoughts on rentseeking politics and the role of corporations and governments in the market “the neoclassical model simply does not comprehend the modern corporation”     on march  the stigler center at the university of chicago booth school of business along with harvard business school and oxford university hosted a conference in chicago to answer the following questions should the economic theory of the firm be modified and if so how   the standard economic theory of the firm is silent on the role firms can play in shaping the rules of the game under which they operate in reality many firms lobby politicians and try to capture regulators in order to modify the rules of the game in their favor some scholars have argued that the resources devoted to these activities are relatively so small that they are likely to have insignificant effects andor that regardless of how much firms invest in political activities in a wellfunctioning democracy there are countervailing forces that effectively level the playing field other scholars have noted that the resources firms devote to shaping the rules of the game to their own advantage are sufficiently large and their effects sufficiently important to warrant a rethinking of the standard economic theory of the firm which of these two views has more empirical support if the latter should the economic theory of the firm be modified if so how and is the potential fix better or worse than the existing problem   the following interview with harvard business school professor emeritus joseph bower is part of an interview series with influential scholars who are addressing these issues in their work you can view all previous installments here   joseph bower joseph bower is the donald k david professor emeritus at harvard business school he is a leading expert on corporate strategy organization and leadership during his storied career which spans five decades bower has focused his teaching and research on the challenges confronting corporate leaders in a rapidly changing hypercompetitive environment   as one of the leaders of a project on the future of market capitalism bower coauthored the book capitalism at risk rethinking the role of business harvard business review press  with his hbs colleagues herman “dutch” leonard and lynn paine he has also consulted with many companies in the us and abroad on issues related to succession strategy and organization   in a brief interview with promarket bower shared some thoughts on rentseeking politics and the role of corporations and governments in the market    q the neoclassical theory of the firm does not consider political engagement by corporations how big of an omission do you think this is   there has been extensive writing about the power and scope of corporations going back at least to edward mason and carl kaysen in a chapter i wrotebower joseph l “the managerial estate” chap  in the us business corporation an institution in transition edited by john r meyer and james m gustafson – cambridge ma ballinger publishing company  i explored the role of large corporations in terms of their impact on factors other than the product market echoing kaysen i emphasized location employment product line choices vendors that because of their scale and scope give firms powers far beyond those conceived in the neoclassical model and unconstrained by traditional notions of price competition the neoclassical model simply does not comprehend the modern corporation   but if we are talking about a theory carefully constructed on a set of axioms the theory really can’t consider political engagements the essence of the neoclassical theory is the constraint on choice imposed by given and widely shared technology and competitive markets for resources and vendors political engagement derives from and is focused on seeking monopolistic power the various theories of monopolistic competition are instructive but fall far short of the standard sought by neoclassical theory   q to what extent is political engagement by corporations responsible for the current populist discontent   only in a limited way both galbraith countervailing power and raymond bauer competition among lobbying powers note that to a significant degree corporate power is less powerful than it would appear more important is the power of banks which since the th century have played a central role in american life trump is closer to jackson but whether he will act to cut back the power of financial institutions is doubtful    q the world economic forum has called for “reimagining” and “reforming” capitalism to what extent is this need for reform the result of disruption brought by technological change globalization and immigration and to what extent is it the effect of rentseeking and regulatory capture   an important question but almost impossible to attack empirically basically both need attention the essential weaknesses of capitalism and neoclassical theory are   labor is thought to be a resource that prefers leisure to work when the price of labor is high enough individuals withhold their effort but in modern society work is the source of standing in society and at higher ends of the market workers appear to prefer work—almost as an addiction they seek more and more wealth try to fit that kind of behavior on a single labor supply curve   with globalization prices have really become a problem since different legal systems imply different pricing of all kinds of public goods these differences are highly significant when it comes to the consequences of trade   q some people describe donald trump’s economic policies as “corporatism” are you more worried by trump’s interference in the market economy or by companies’ ability to subvert markets’ rules   we don’t know what will be trump’s policies i would say that contemporary republican policies are corporatist whatever that means trump’s decisions do not flow from policy—they are impulsive and transactional in intent   disclaimer the promarket blog is dedicated to discussing how competition tends to be subverted by special interests the posts represent the opinions of their writers not those of the university of chicago the booth school of business or its faculty for more information please visit promarket blog policy  related posts “no mistake about it a revolt against globalization is underway” “so long as corporate managers see their objective as maximizing returns rentseeking and regulatory capture will persist” “under president trump and the republican congress banks will have even more ability to write regulations that favor them” references       ↑ bower joseph l “the

is widely considered the most accomplished bird artist working in london during the mid th century when he arrived in england in  he was already an established wildlife painter in western europe born in germany wolf began his career as a lithographer’s apprentice at age  he was commissioned by eduard rüppell at the frankfurt museum to illustrate his book on african birds this led to commissions from the darmstadt museum and the prominent ornithologist hermann schlegel for traité de fauconnerie and a work on birds of japan at this point wolf who was only  years old moved to leiden and sharpened his skills at the art school there when he came to england he began working in the natural history department of the british museum illustrating george robert gray’s genera of birds he also attracted the interest of the animal painter sir edward landseer who arranged for wolf to exhibit at the royal academy he was the first significant bird artist to publish illustrations in scientific journals dozens of which appeared in the proceedings and transactions of the zoological society of london and the ibis the journal of the british ornithologists’ union other important bird books to which he contributed were john gould’s the birds of asia  and the birds of great britain  he also illustrated important travel books by david livingstone henry walter bates and alfred russel wallace perhaps wolf’s crowning achievements were the plates for daniel giraud elliott’s  monographs on the phasianeidae pheasants and paradiseida birds of paradise wolf’s favorite subjects were birds of prey his explorations of how the subtle colorations of their plumage related to their environment influenced other artists his long and successful career as a natural history painter also encouraged others to enter that field joseph smit was a dutch lithographer of natural history subjects his first commission was by the ornithologist hermann schlegel at the leiden museum he is perhaps best known for his lithographs after joseph wolf including philip sclater’s zoological sketches  and daniel giraud elliott’s  monographs on the phasianeidae pheasants and paradiseida birds of paradise he also

alcatraz come to life get tickets to alcatraz get the mobile guide official bookstore the desperate escape of joe bowers joseph bowers az joe bowers an inmate considered criminally insane by many of his fellow inmates on the rock would make national headlines with a desperate act that for over a half century has been called an escape by some and suicide by others joseph bowers was by all accounts a desperado and loner unable to come to terms with the conditions of alcatraz imprisoned during the toughest and most strict era on alcatraz bowers serving a year sentence for postal mail robbery that netted a mere sixteen dollars and thirty eight cents he held an expansive criminal record and as one report highlighted “if at large he probably would engage again in criminal activities and constitute a serious menace to the public safety and society” he had claimed and it was also supported in belief by fellow inmates that his crimes had resulted from a lacking ability to support himself he claimed that he was completely desperate and out of funds hungry and mostly unable to afford food or proper lodging in a  summary report his background was noted “on this man it has been impossible to get any dependable information he states that it is represented to him that he was born of parents who were members of a travelling circus on february   at el paso texas was immediately deserted by his parents and was raised by circus people who were travelling about and with whom he has lost all contact so that he has been unable to establish his birth as an american citizen claims to have worked in germany france belgium italy spain russia buenos aires mexico cuba and other places principally as an interpreter as he claims to speak six languages he came to the office complaining that he thought his sentence too severe that he was in his present trouble due only to the fact that he had been unable to get work and wanted to know if there was any manner in which he could establish his citizenship so that he could get passports to foreign countries as he said he never had any trouble finding steady employment but did have some trouble because he did not have proper passports when in foreign countries” bowers arrived at alcatraz on september   in one of the first groups and it quickly became obvious that he didn’t fit the archetypical model of the standard rock inmate while imprisoned at mcneil island a federal penitentiary located in the puget sound of washington state he was a considered “unpredictable and at high risk resulting from being emotional unstable” warden johnston later wrote “i did not class him with the shrewd gangsters with whom he associated in prison he was a weakminded man with a strong back who would get peace of mind by exercising his body” the ruleofsilence was in its most strict form and within only six months of his imprisonment bowers was already showing signs of significant mental strain he attempted suicide but the resident physician didn’t feel bowers was making a serious attempt on his life a memo to the director described the attempt department of justice united states penitentiary alcatraz island california march   director bureau of prisons washington dc attention dr f lovell bixby assistant director re joe bowers number az about  am on march   joe bowers az cut the skin of his throat by breaking his eye glasses and using a piece of the broken glass the cut was about three inches long there was very little loss of blood  and he was given immediate medical attention he has been in the hospital since that time and we have had doctor twitchell  consultant psychiatrist make examination and report copy of dr hess report to me with copy of dr twitchells report to dr hess in this case enclosed for your information sincerely yours ja johnston warden joseph bowers fingerprint card alcatraz inmate  joe bowers alcatraz conduct report road tower from where bowers was shot by ef chandler edward twitchell the prison psychiatrist citing to chief medical officer george hess who would later become the resident physician of an ailing al capone wrote about the attempt march   subject joe bower number  dr george hess chief medical officer u s penitentiary alcatraz california dear dr hess the more i listened to bower the less belief i had in him he has been watched now for months and no epileptic seizures have been noted although he insists that he has them the recent attempts at suicide have been theatrically planned and have resulted in very little damage to him had he been a determined suicide he had good opportunity to make a success of it hence i believe the unsuccessful attempts were for the purpose of gaining opinion favorable to him like so many of his kind it must be admitted at first that he is not a normal individual but he is not so crazy as he is trying to make out it is a well recognized fact that many an individual who is insane endeavors to make out his insanity worse than it really is for the purpose of gaining some end bower while an abnormal individual is not truly insane in my opinion and is pretending a mental disturbance for some purpose yours very truly edward w twitchell md treasury department united states public health service us peniitentiary alcatraz california march   warden johnston institution for your information i am transmitting a copy of the latest psychiatric report on joe bowers number  it is my opinion that we have carefully observed this man and have given him every possible consideration my conclusions in the case are that the man is not insane to the degree that he is trying to make us believe and that i am in perfect accord with doctor twitchells belief that he has some purpose in view i see no particular reason for keeping bowers in the hospital any longer however i shall do whatever you think best about the matter respectfully s george hess aa surgeon chief medical officer bowers was assigned to the incinerator detail only a month prior to his escape by flight the incinerator detail was considered a difficult and unpopular work assignment by the general inmate population it was hard and laborious work sorting metals and burning the prison waste working alone and having to endure the cold weather elements of the san francisco bay bowers would soon break the inmates assigned to the incinerator detail passed time slowly under constant watch by the road tower officer bowers could only dream of his freedom as tour boats passed the island in close enough distance where faint laughs could be heard over a seagull screech on april   bowers could serve no one time on alcatraz some inmates called it suicide while others were convinced he was simply trying to climb up to grab garbage wedged in the chain link fence another account claimed he was climbing to feed a seagull but what is clear is bowers ignored the forceful signals to halt at approximately  am just as the signal for the inmate to return to their cells and prepare for lunch bowers started walking towards the industries building and then charged the fence making his ascent the official officer accounts where documented as follows bowers was only  years of age when he fell to the violent rifle fire of ef chandler in his testimony to a coroner’s jury panel chandler stated “bowers was over the deadline he knew what he was doing and i couldn’t go get him without wings” as many historians still debate the sanity of bowers and whether or not his flight over the fence was a true attempt at freedom but as one former correctional officer pointed out to help make sense of the tragedy and determine whether or not his intent to escape was real he stated most aptly that regardless of what bower’s intent was whether to escape feed a bird or collect garbage when he was finally struck by a bullet “he fell over the fence and onto the side of freedom where he fell says it all” sources national archives and records
