share toronto jun   canada newswire via comtex  uo corp uwe otcqbuweff uo corp or the company reports that all matters brought before its shareholders were approved at the annual  special meeting asm held yesterday in toronto ontario a total of  of the corporations common shares were voted representing  of its issued and outstanding stock in addition  million warrants expired and  million warrants were exercised for gross proceeds of  which together reduce the number of outstanding warrants by approximately  warrant exercise  expiry in the press release dated june th  uo corp reported that a shareholder had offered to have  million warrants accelerated at a strike price of over double the current share price the warrant acceleration term ended at midnight last night at which time the warrants had not been exercised and have therefore been cancelled the shareholder who made this offer did so in the broader interest of other shareholders in helping the company achieve a leaner capital structure i would also like to thank the shareholders who voted providing a clear mandate to the board said richard spencer uo corps president and ceo in addition dr keith barron a director of the corporation exercised  million outofthemoney warrants for gross proceeds of  in order to provide the company with working capital without diluting other shareholders key matters approved at the asm include consolidation and deconsolidation of the corporations stock consolidationdeconsolidation the goal of the consolidationdeconsolidation is to provide a costeffective method of paying out for the value of shares held accounts of less than  uo corp shares most accounts that hold less than  shares are inactive and removal of these accounts from the shareholder register would result in significant administrative cost savings the company will be offering a simple and costeffective way for shareholders irrespective of account size to purchase additional shares of the company prior to the consolidationdeconsolidation coming into effect the additional shares will be made available within the next few business days via an existing shareholder prospectus exemption espe  and shareholders will have a two to threeweek window in which to participate general information on the espe is available on the companys homepage at httpwwwuocorpcom and specific terms of the financing will be press released shortly the consolidationdeconsolidation was approved by  of the shares voted with  against share consolidation consolidation shareholders approved the proposal to undertake a

enhances its battery commodity focus by joining vanitec  the only global vanadium organization  to provide access to battery research and development  junior mining network uo corp enhances its battery commodity focus by joining vanitec  the only global vanadium organization  to provide access to battery research and development vanadium toronto feb   cnw  uo corp tsx uwe otcqb uweff uo corp or the company announces that it has become an associate member of vanitec limited vanitec vanitec brings together research organizations and manufacturers of products that contain vanadium with companies involved in the mining and processing of the metal the use of vanadium in batteries is growing exponentially not only for industrialscale vanadium redox flow batteries vrb but also for lithium ion batteries uo corp also has phosphate and nickel resources – commodities that are in demand by the battery industry one of the greatest challenges and opportunities related with renewable energy from solar or wind is its inherent supply variability that needs to be regulated or smoothed in order to be a useful source of electricity said dr richard spencer president and ceo of uo corp  batteries perform this function acting like shockabsorbers storing energy when an excess is produced and delivering electricity when demand rises  lithiumion batteries are ideal for high power output for a few hours but when power is needed for longer periods other technologies such as flow batteries provide a better alternative  vanadium redox flow batteries are a superior alternative when power is needed for more than four hours – and these batteries can easily and costeffectively be scaled up for industrial applications  with its vanadium resources of  million pounds indicated and  million pounds inferred uo corp represents a potential supplier to the battery industry  vanitec provides a forum in which we may forge closer ties with battery manufacturers as well as research facilities that are working on ways of making the batteries more efficient and costeffective  this is an exciting time since after years of weakening markets the vanadium price has rebounded sharply in response to increased demand uo corps vanadium resources uo corp has a significant vanadium resource of  million pounds indicated and  million pounds inferred in its berlin and laguna salada deposits  vanadium would potentially be produced as a byproduct in both deposits constituting approximately  of revenue from the laguna salada deposit and approximately  from berlin  at laguna salada the removal of pebbles by screening results in the uranium and vanadium being concentrated into the finegrained component of the mineralized gravel  test work has shown that beneficiation by screening results in vanadium grades increasing over four times in the finegrained material compared with the gravels in situ grade table   summary of uo corps ni  vanadium resources source preliminary economic assessments on the berlin and laguna salada deposits vanadium resources deposit  ni  resource classification tonnes million grade vo  beneficiated grade contained vomlb berlin colombia indicated     inferred                 laguna salada argentina indicated     inferred     vanadium in batteries vanadium is used in flow batteries as well as some lithium ion types flow batteries  vanadium redox flow batteries vrbs provide utility or industrial– scale electrical storage capacity  the battery consists essentially of two tanks of vanadium electrolyte separated by a membrane  its capacity to store energy can easily be scaled by increasing the size of the tanks  vanadium represents  of the cost of vrbs what really sets these batteries apart is that they can be charged and discharged over and over again without degradation or significant loss of capacity  large vrbs with a megawatt capacity have been through over  chargedischarge cycles equivalent to over  years of operation assuming one chargedischarge cycle per day with no significant degradation of the electrolyte  the operating life of vrbs is considered to be around  years because of gradual degradation of the membrane the actual vanadium electrolyte does not degrade and can be recycled into a new battery  in contrast most longlived lithium ion batteries last up to  chargedischarge cycles – and have a maximum life of about seven years  as a result of the charged ions being in a liquid vrbs charge in a very short time and conversely the stored energy can be released almost instantaneously when required  vrbs also have excellent charge retention they can be left for up to a year and still retain  of their charge  new generation vrbs operate efficiently over a wide temperature range of °c to °c  vrbs are also nonflammable   the energy capacity of current vrb models is relatively low figure   this means that for a given amount of energy storage a vrb will be significantly larger than a lithium ion battery ongoing development is focused on increasing the energy capacity of vrbs and the most recent work shows that the addition of phosphate to the electrolyte doubles its energy capacity  the upfront cost of a vrb is currently more than double that of a lithium ion battery system of similar energy storage capacity  this is counterbalanced by two things  longer battery life  years for a vrb versus  years for a lithium ion battery and the fact that the vrb electrolyte can be reused indefinitely in new batteries lithium vanadium phosphate batteries lithium vanadium phosphate lvp batteries are attracting attention because of their higher energy capacity their capacity to store a large amount of energy for their weight  lvps have an energy capacity almost double that of other mainstream lithium ion batteries whkg versus whkg for lithium cobalt oxide lco and whkg for lithium nickel cobalt aluminium oxide nca batteries – figure   lvps also have a slightly higher voltage v in comparison to the v of the lco and nca batteries which allows for faster acceleration in electric vehicles  the greater thermal and electrochemical stability of phosphate also makes the batteries safer than many other types of lithium ion battery  japans gs yuasa corp which has joint ventures with mitsubishi and honda is manufacturing lvp batteries as is valence technology inc in the usa  byd a large chinese battery manufacturer is currently producing a lithium iron phosphate lfp battery for the electric bus market that its concentrating on but is reported to be evaluating the lvp battery  lvp is also the battery of choice for subarus ge electric car  the growing attractiveness of phosphate in batteries is extremely interesting to uo corp because of the phosphate resource in its berlin deposit in colombia table    originally the company had considered the phosphate in terms of the agricultural fertilizer market only but the emergence of phosphate as a key component of batteries is driving the company to focus more on the battery market especially since the berlin deposit also contains a resource of nickel another commodity used in some lithium ion batteries  table   uo corps ni  phosphate and nickel resource in the berlin deposit other battery commodity resources berlin deposit  ni  resource classification tonnes million phosphate nickel grade po  contained potonnes grade nickel contained nickel mlbs indicated      inferred      vanadium market  outlook the vanadium market is predicted to slip into deficit later this year with demand outstripping supply for the foreseeable future figure   prices have reacted by rising sharply after almost a decade of decline figure   over  of current vanadium demand is from the steel industry and is growing at a steady rate of  per year   demand is driven by vanadiumsteel having one of the highest strength to weight ratios of any steel alloy  adding only  pounds of vanadium to a tonne of steel doubles its strength and rebar made from vanadium steel alloy is a key component to improving the resistance of buildings to earthquakes demand for vanadium from the battery industry is starting to grow exponentially batteries are

raj shah  august    no comments august   source marketwired — uo corp tsxuweotcqxuweff a canadianbased company focused on exploration and development of uranium resources and associated commodities in south america reports a favourable preliminary economic assessment “pea” on its laguna salada deposit in argentina the pea shows that uranium at laguna salada would be produced at an average lifeofmine “lom” cash cost of  per pound “lb” of uo net of a vanadium byproduct credit figure  and the total capital cost of  million would be paid back in  years all figures in this press release are in us unless otherwise noted “the pea achieved our main goal of showing that laguna salada’s cash cost would be well within the lower quartile of the uranium industry – an important achievement that bodes well for the deposit’s potential to ride out cyclical lows in the resource sector” said dr richard spencer uo corp’s president and ceo “with a lifeofmine cash cost of lb laguna salada would be competitive with lowcost insitu recovery uranium projects and with highgrade deposits in the athabasca basin secondly the project has a short payback with an average cash cost of b of uranium over that period this is because the shallow flatlying nature of the laguna salada deposit allows us to start production in the higher grade zones where profit margins are greatest thirdly the project’s economics would be significantly enhanced by increasing the resource size – therefore our immediate goal is to expand the current resource into our adjoining la susana area” pea highlights pretax base case at lb uo low cash cost average cash cost of lb of uranium over the payback period lom cash cost of lb net of a vanadium credit and including a  net smelter royalty “nsr” payable to the state therefore the project would have a healthy operating margin even at current uranium prices and is favourably leveraged to a strengthening uranium price figure  value of initial current resource net present value “npv” at a  discount rate of  million and a pretax internal rate of return “irr” of  and posttax irr of  return on capital total capital cost of  million including startup capital of  million to build the mine and processing plant plus  million in sustaining capital for the lifeofmine and  million for a  contingency on the total capital cost estimate the payback period is  years and initial production  million pounds “mlb” of uranium produced in year  while the average annual production would be mlb per year over the year mine life from a continuous surface mining operation average annual vanadium production would be mlb over the life of the mine dr spencer added “the laguna salada pea marks a key milestone towards positioning uo corp among the few companies that could be in production heading into a sustained and growing global uranium supply deficit forecast to start in  furthermore the study shows that laguna salada is well placed as one of the most advanced uranium projects in argentina that could satisfy the immediate needs of the country’s current nuclear reactors that presently rely on imported uranium for fuel argentina’s third reactor has just come onstream and deals were signed in the last month related to building a fourth reactor with talks underway on a fifth and with districtscale uranium potential evident in the laguna salada region we could serve argentina’s growing nuclear fleet as well as export to other utilities supported by the large number of nuclear cooperation agreements that argentina has signed” the pea is preliminary in nature as it includes inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically for economic consideration that would enable them to be classified as mineral reserves mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability there is no certainty that the results of the pea will be realized low cost of uranium production the pea estimates a lom cash cost of lb of uranium net of a byproduct credit from vanadium and including a  nsr to the state the vanadium contributes an average of  of revenues this would put the laguna salada deposit well within the lower quartile in terms of cash costs in the uranium industry figure  and competitive with operating costs of uranium mines in the athabasca basin and lowcost insitu recovery “isr” operations a beneficial feature of laguna salada is that the mineralization is contained in an unconsolidated flat lying sheet just below surface which allows production to start in the richest part of the deposit where revenue would be maximized so that the capital cost can be paid back in  years this attribute of the deposit also provides us with flexibility to maintain positive operating margins by tailoring the mining plan to prevailing uranium prices throughout the life of the mine by taking this approach initial uranium cash cost averages at lb during the payback period or  in year  and  in year  gradually rising as uranium grades decrease over the year mine life for an average cash cost of  figure  analysts estimate the average marginal cost of production for today’s uranium producers is approximately lb and that some  of the world’s current production is likely to be uneconomic at the present spot price of lb the peas on uo corp’s laguna salada deposit and its berlin deposit in colombia show that our lead projects have a combined weighted average cash cost of lb – one of the lowest in the industry to view “figure  – cash costs of uo corp’s projects compared with other uranium producers” please visit the following link httpmediamarketwirecomdocsuwepraugfigpdf to view “figure  – laguna salada cash cost per pound relative to forecast uranium prices” please visit the following link httpmediamarketwirecomdocsuwepraugfigpdf net present value “npv” and internal rate of return “irr” the pea demonstrates that the project should generate healthy operating margins relative to analysts’ uranium price forecasts figure  the economic model was based on a lb uranium uo price and lb for vanadium vo to yield a npv of  million at a  discount with a pretax irr of  and posttax irr of  at the consensus uranium price forecast of lb the project’s npv at a  discount rate would increase to  million the irr would increase to  and the payback period would shorten to  years table  uo corp undertook this pea before the full extent of the deposit is known in order to have independent verification that laguna salada’s production cost would be comparable with the uranium industry’s lowestcost producers as both of the irr and npv are sensitive to deposit size our next step is to increase the resource which would significantly improve both of these economic measures for example doubling the size of the laguna salada resource from mineralized areas that have a similar grade profile to the current resource and doubling the production rate would result in the npv at a  discount increasing to  million and the irr to  the capital cost of a plant and mining operation that has double the capacity would be approximately  million more than the current plant design or a total of  million including contingency and sustaining capital and would produce an average of mlb of uranium and approximately mlb of vanadium per year over a year mine life therefore the clear priority is to double the resource – and our immediate target to achieve this is the contiguous la susana area december   press release our la susana exploration area has the potential to increase the current resource to mlb of uranium figure  with an exploration budget of approximately  million la susana lies adjacent to the current resource and appears to be an extension of the laguna salada deposit the la susana footprint is about the same size as the current laguna salada resource and exploration indicates that it has a similar grade profile to laguna salada  based on the initial resource and exploration of the la susana mineralized area there is an initial conceptual uranium target of  million tonnes at ppm to ppm uo mlb uo identified in the laguna salada district to date

would produce an average of mlb per year over the year mine life the mining operation contemplates the use of two wirtgen sm  tonne per hour “tph” capacity continuous surface miners that cut a  centimetre layer of unconsolidated gravel with each pass along a trench gravel cut from the leading edge of the trench would be trucked a short distance by tonne “t” trucktrailers to one of two mobile beneficiation units tph capacity where the gravel would be washed over screens to separate the pebbles and coarse sand from the fine uraniumbearing material approximately  of the damp gravel would be returned to the trailing edge of the trench to be levelled to the land’s original topography and replanted with indigenous flora this reclamation would be continuous throughout the mine life and ensures that no open excavation would be left on completion of mining the fine mineralized material derived from the gravel  of the original mass from the guanaco area of the deposit and  from the lago seco area would be mixed with water and pumped to a central hydrometallurgical plant fine material from lago seco would enter a hydrocyclone system for further beneficiation and the fine material in the overflow containing the majority of the uranium would then be mixed with fine material from the guanaco sector for further processing residual gypsum in the combined fines would be leached with saline shallow groundwater from the property and the sulphate would be separated from that solution in a membrane system so that the saline water can be recirculated extraction of uranium and vanadium would be by alkaline leach at a temperature of °c followed by the precipitation of a uraniumvanadium intermediate product the pea contemplates separation of the uranium and vanadium and calcining of the uranium to produce a highgrade uranium oxide as well as recovery of the vanadium as ammonium metavanadate calcining of which would produce vanadium pentoxide the next steps toward development of the laguna salada deposit would be further hydrometallurgical test work and an onsite pilot plant in which beneficiation tests would be undertaken both of which would be to feasibility standards

sse uwecl a canadianbased company focused on the development of deposits of uranium and associated commodities many of which are used in the clean energy industry reports on significant developments in nuclear energy in argentina south americas largest generator of electricity from nuclear argentinas minister of energy and mines emphasized the federal governments support for uranium production from argentina to fuel its growing fleet of nuclear power plants argentina has signed an agreement whereby it will import enriched uranium to fuel its small modular reactor smr on which construction is nearing completion the argentinedesigned carem model is one of the first modern smrs to be built in the world numerous other smr designs for example those in canada usa uk china and japan are advancing through the design and permitting stage smrs are projected to be a highgrowth area in the nuclear and clean energy industry a memorandum of understanding has been signed regarding the financing and construction of argentinas th and th nuclear power plants and the minister of energy and mines has committed to fund upgrades to eleven nuclear medicine facilities in argentina to the companys knowledge there are only three uranium deposits on which economic studies have been concluded in argentina one has been mined out and the other two include the states cerro solo and uo corps laguna salada deposits  production from these deposits could provide the uranium required by argentinas nuclear reactors and alleviate argentinas total reliance on imported nuclear fuel  argentine federal government support for local uranium production at a recent meeting with senator luenzo from chubut province energy and mines minister mr jose aranguren emphasized the new federal governments support for the development of the uranium mining industry in argentina     to the companys knowledge there are three uranium deposits on which economic studies have been undertaken in argentina  the first the sierra pintada deposit has been mined out  the other two deposits are located in chubut province uo corps laguna salada deposit on which a resource estimate and subsequent preliminary economic assessment pea has been completed in accordance with national instrument  ni the cash cost of production at laguna salada was estimated at us per pound of uranium net of byproduct vanadium if actual costs are in line with this estimate laguna salada would be within the lower  of the uranium industry in terms of production cost the company believes that these estimates contained in the pea and the assumptions upon which they are based remain current the pea is preliminary in nature and includes inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves there is no certainty that the results of the pea will be realized and the cerro solo deposit which belongs to argentinas national atomic energy commission cnea is located approximately km from uo corps laguna salada deposit cnea has undertaken a resource estimate and economic assessment of cerro solo but has not released its economic study and hence production cost estimates are not available in the public domain cerro solo is a sandstonehosted deposit that would most likely be mined by underground methods argentina purchases enriched uranium to fuel one of the worlds first small modular reactors brazil recently announced that it has entered into an agreement to sell four tonnes of enriched uranium to argentina to fuel its prototype carem small modular reactor  the carem reactor is one of two smrs with generation capacity of less than  megawatts under construction worldwide  the carem reactor is scheduled to start generating electricity in late  while the other smr of similar size is under construction in russia  the carem is a pressurized water reactor with integral steam generators and the entire passive coolant system is contained within the  metre diameter  metre high pressure vessel the reactor vessel would be similar in size to a  foot shipping container  the reactor would be refuelled annually with standard enriched reactor fuel  at  megawatts the carem model would have an output of only  of a typical generation iii nuclear reactor  some of the smrs of which there are many designs progressing through the permitting process in various countries are generally based on technology similar to that which has been used in nuclearpowered submarines and ships for almost  years  smrs are projected to have a relatively low capital cost and are designed to have low operating costs to provide an affordable lowcarbon source of energy the carem prototype is being built to unequivocally demonstrate the cost of construction as well as to define the actual cost of clean energy production smrs are expected to be a highgrowth area for the nuclear and clean energy industry because the plants can be located close to where the electricity is needed without the environmental footprint cost and energy loss associated with regional hightension power lines connecting the end user with the regional electricity grid  apart from providing power for communities and industries in remote locations the carem reactor is being marketed as a clean power source for the production of fresh water by the desalination of seawater  to that end a joint venture has been established between the argentine company invap and the saudi arabian nuclear power authority to determine the suitability of the carem reactor for desalination plants in saudi arabia  agreement signed regarding the construction of argentinas th and th nuclear power plants minister aranguren has announced the signing of a memorandum of understanding reaffirming plans for the financing and construction of two nuclear power plants argentinas th and th  chinese banks will contribute  of the total estimated cost of us billion  to put the cost of the reactors in context argentina is currently spending us billion per year on energy imports  argentinas th reactor will be a canadiandesigned  megawatt candu model that uses natural unenriched uranium fuel  construction is planned to commence in the first quarter of  at the site where the atucha i and ii reactors are located   the th nuclear power plant will be a  megawatt hualong  reactor a design by china general nuclear and china national nuclear corp that uses enriched fuel construction on the th plant is planned to start in the latter half of   federal funding for nuclear medicine facility in chubut province minister aranguren also confirmed that the federal government is committed to argentinas national nuclear medicine plan through which eleven nuclear medicine centres throughout the country will be upgraded  one of the centres for which funding has been guaranteed is the cabin centro de aplicaciones bionucleares facility in the city of comodoro rivadavia in chubut province planning for the laguna salada deposit the next steps planned for the laguna salada deposit are trial mining and pilot plant processing of bulk samples at one of argentinas processing facilities  the aim of this work is to refine mining and processing costs to feasibility study standards as well as to provide proof of concept for uranium production from mineralized gravels at laguna salada laguna salada lies in the roaring forties latitudes renowned for high winds  to that end the company is involved with a highlevel study to investigate the viability of incorporating windgenerated power into the project as a means of further improving the projects economics  in addition although nuclear reactors do not generate greenhouse gases nuclear energy is not classified as carbonfree because of the use of fossil fuels in the mining and transport of uranium  incorporation of renewable energy into uranium production from laguna salada provides an opportunity to produce a lowcarbon uranium product that would allow our future customers to move closer to carbonfree nuclear energy  uo corp is committed to providing uranium required to fuel the nuclear component of the argentine governments clean energy initiative  that initiative includes increasing argentinas nuclear energy capacity as well as increasing renewable energy production the recently announced target is to have  of the countrys electricity generated by renewable sources by the end of  and  by  technical information dr richard spencer pgeo president

represents  of the cost of vrbswhat really sets these batteries apart is that they can be charged and discharged over and over again without degradation or significant loss of capacity  large vrbs with a megawatt capacity have been through over  chargedischarge cycles equivalent to over  years of operation assuming one chargedischarge cycle per day with no significant degradation of the electrolyte  the operating life of vrbs is considered to be around  years because of gradual degradation of the membrane the actual vanadium electrolyte does not degrade and can be recycled into a new battery  in contrast most longlived lithium ion batteries last up to  chargedischarge cycles – and have a maximum life of about seven years as a result of the charged ions being in a liquid vrbs

retain  of their charge  new generation vrbs operate efficiently over a wide temperature range of °c to °c  vrbs are also nonflammable  read morethe energy capacity of current vrb models is relatively low figure   this means that for a given amount of energy storage a vrb will be significantly larger than a lithium ion battery ongoing development is focused on increasing the energy capacity of vrbs and the most recent work shows that the addition of phosphate to the electrolyte doubles its energy capacity the upfront cost of a vrb is currently more than double that of a lithium ion battery

uranium and associated commodities in south america outlines the final component of the three main sections of the flow sheet that defines the entire process by which uranium phosphate vanadium rare earths and other metals are to be extracted from the berlin project in colombia this flow sheet is an integral part of the preliminary economic assessment pea being undertaken by bateman engineering nv which is on track for delivery by the end of  the flow sheet marks another key achievement by demonstrating how we plan to extract the various commodities from the berlin ore into saleable products said dr richard spencer uo corps president and ceo uo corp has made huge strides in advancing the berlin project from exploration trenching and resource estimation to development of the entire flow sheet and finalizing the upcoming pea in just two and a half years berlin is fast becoming a company maker that we are showing could be a large deposit and lowcost uranium producer thanks to the value of a suite of recoverable byproductsflow sheet for the berlin projectthe process route shown in the flow sheet has been designed to efficiently extract multiple commodities from berlin to be versatile in terms of reagent consumption to be compatible with standard recovery methods and to create an environmentally benign tailing uo corp has now defined the three main components of this process as follows figure beneficiation of the crushed ore using acetic acid vinegar to remove calcite and concentrate the valuable commodities into as small a mass as possible which makes the subsequent extraction and recovery processes more efficient and reduces capital and operating costsextraction of the various commodities into a pregnant solution by an acidic ferric iron leach method andrecovery of the individual elements from the pregnant solution by conventional techniques  details reported in this press release beneficiationas reported in uo corps october   press release beneficiation using a weak solution of acetic acid to dissolve calcite from the mineralized material at berlin concentrated the payable elements into  of the original ore mass as well as producing a potentially saleable gypsum byproduct the significant reduction in volume of material that undergoes further treatment may reduce processing and capital costs simplify the extraction process add a potentially valuable byproduct and decrease the volume of tailings by  the pea is considering both acetic acid and nonacetic acid routes to determine which of these options is most beneficial for the berlin project arafura resources ltd has stated that it plans to use a similar process of adding sulphuric acid to regenerate hydrochloric acid which could produce a gypsum byproduct at its nolans bore deposit in australiaextractionthe residue of the ore that remains after beneficiation by acetic acid is subjected to a twostep ferric iron process as detailed in uo corps january   press release the ferric leach achieved excellent extraction of multiple elements contained in the mineralized rock from the berlin project these results are considered to be representative of the entire resource area since the test work was conducted on  of the bore hole intersections that were included in the resource estimate uo corps ferric process was adapted from proven technology used for uranium and yttrium production at elliott lake in ontario and is now used at rossing mine in namibia and the talvivaara mine in finland step one of the extraction process involves the mineralized residue being mixed with ferric iron and sulphuric acid followed by step two  a wash with weak sulphuric acid these two steps will be combined in a conventional train of reactors to ensure efficient extraction of the soluble metals and phosphate into the pregnant liquorrecovery the beneficiation and extractive leach sections of the process have been designed to create a pregnant liquor solution pls that contains the metals of economic interest and phosphate at a concentration appropriate for conventional recovery techniques and to minimize the presence of elements such as calcium and iron that can complicate the recovery process after beneficiation of the berlin ore with acetic acid the acidic ferric leach would generate a pls with an approximate concentration of elements as follows uranium   milligrams per litre mgl phosphorous   mgl vanadium   mgl rare earths including yttrium   mgl and neodymium   mgl molybdenum  mgl nickel  mgl zinc  mgl and manganese  mglcalcium levels are managed in two ways through the extraction of most of the calcium from the ore in the beneficiation step and secondly by maintaining the residual calcium in the pls in a relatively insoluble form had hydrochloric acid been used instead chlorine would have been introduced into the system which together with calcium would have interfered with extraction of the metals of value the first step in the recovery process involves the alteration of ferric iron in the liquor to the ferrous form in a process called reduction iron in the ferrous state can be carried in the pls through the remainder of the process without interfering significantly with standard ion exchange ix and solvent extraction sx or direct precipitation routines used for select recovery of the valuable elements iron reduction can be readily achieved with the addition of a variety of reducing reagents molybdenum is the first element to be selectively extracted from the pls in the first ix process and is stripped using ammonium hydroxide to prevent gypsum coprecipitation with the molybdenum and is precipitated as calcium molybdate a saleable product the removal of molybdenum before uranium and vanadium extraction is to prevent interference in the subsequent ix and sx processes designed to extract other elements uranium and vanadium are then extracted from the pls in a second ix process into a combined stream using weak sulphuric acid the uranium is separated from vanadium by adding hydrogen peroxide which causes precipitation of uranium peroxide the uranium peroxide uonho is thickened centrifuged and dried for transport offsite the uranium peroxide is subsequently heated to form yellowcake uo the form in which uranium is marketed the vanadium is then precipitated with ammonia to produce ammonium pentavanadate which is thickened centrifuged and dried for transport offsite this process of extracting the uranium and vanadium together and then separating them is used in the following facilities climax uranium co usa talvivaara mining co finland and smith ranch project usafollowing the extraction of molybdenum uranium and vanadium the pls undergoes the first sx process to produce an estimated  strength phosphoric acid by extracting phosphorous with tributyl phosphate tbp in a shellsol diluent followed by stripping with water the resulting phosphoric acid is concentrated to a minimum  strength by a steam evaporator to produce a saleable phosphoric acid productthe rare earths principally yttrium neodymium and cerium are precipitated by elevating the ph level of the pls with ammonia to produce a precipitate which is centrifuged and dried and then the mixed rare earth oxides are packed for transport and separation offsite the pls now contains only base metals and manganese for recovery and undergoes the second sx process for the extraction and stripping of a mixture of nickel zinc and manganese with dehpa diethylhexyl phosphoric acid and sulphuric acid the individual metals could then be separated from the mixture onsite or the mixture could be sent offsite for further processing at the end of the recovery process the ferrous iron contained in solution could be oxidized to the ferric iron form and recycled back into the ferric leach circuit to lower reagent consumption and reduce operating costs qualified persons and accreditationthe metallurgical test work relied

 vanadium in batteriesvanadium is used in flow batteries as well as some lithium ion typesflow batteries vanadium redox flow batteries vrbs provide utility or industrial– scale electrical storage capacity  the battery consists essentially of two tanks of vanadium electrolyte separated by a membrane  its capacity to store energy can easily be scaled by increasing the size of the tanks  vanadium represents  of the cost of vrbswhat really sets these batteries apart is that they can be charged and discharged over and over again without degradation or significant loss of capacity  large vrbs with a megawatt capacity have been through over  chargedischarge cycles equivalent to over  years of operation assuming one chargedischarge cycle per day with no significant degradation of the electrolyte  the operating life of vrbs is considered to be around  years because of gradual degradation of the membrane the actual vanadium electrolyte does not degrade and can be recycled into a new battery  in contrast most longlived lithium ion batteries last up to  chargedischarge cycles – and have a maximum life of about seven years as a result of the charged ions being in a liquid vrbs charge in a very short time and conversely the stored energy can be released almost instantaneously when required  vrbs also have excellent charge retention they can be left for up to a year and still retain  of their charge  new generation vrbs operate efficiently over a wide temperature range of °c to °c  vrbs are also nonflammable  read morethe energy capacity of current vrb models is relatively low figure   this means that for a given amount of energy storage a vrb will be significantly larger than a lithium ion battery ongoing development is focused on increasing the energy capacity of vrbs and the most recent work shows that the addition of phosphate to the electrolyte doubles its energy capacity the upfront cost of a vrb is currently more than double that of a lithium ion battery system of similar energy storage capacity  this is counterbalanced by two things  longer battery life  years for a vrb versus  years for a lithium ion battery and the fact that the vrb electrolyte can be reused indefinitely in new batterieslithium vanadium phosphate batterieslithium vanadium phosphate lvp batteries are attracting attention because of their higher energy capacity their capacity to store a large amount of energy for their weight  lvps have an energy capacity almost double that of other mainstream lithium ion batteries whkg versus whkg for lithium cobalt oxide lco and whkg for lithium nickel cobalt aluminium oxide nca batteries – figure   lvps also have a slightly higher voltage v in comparison to the v of the lco and nca batteries which allows for faster acceleration in electric vehicles  the greater thermal and electrochemical stability of phosphate also makes the batteries safer than many other types of lithium ion battery japans gs yuasa corp which has joint ventures with mitsubishi and honda is manufacturing lvp batteries as is valence technology inc in the usa  byd a large chinese battery manufacturer is currently producing a lithium iron phosphate lfp battery for the electric bus market that its concentrating on but is reported to be evaluating the lvp battery  lvp is also the battery of choice for subarus ge electric car the growing attractiveness of phosphate in batteries is extremely interesting to uo corp because of the phosphate resource in its berlin deposit in colombia table    originally the company had considered the phosphate in terms of the agricultural fertilizer market only but the emergence of phosphate as a key component of batteries is driving the company to focus more on the battery market especially since the berlin deposit also contains a resource of nickel another commodity used in some lithium ion batteries table   uo corps ni  phosphate and nickel resource in the berlin deposit other battery commodity resources

and opportunity for widespread adoption of renewable energy uo corp would produce a basket of “battery commodities” for lithiumion and vanadium redox flow batteries goldman sachs has stated that “lithium is the new gasoline” but one could argue that a truer statement is that electricity is the next gasoline and our challenge is to find efficient and costeffective ways of storing electricity so that it’s available on demand battery prices have been declining steadily but need to fall further before electricity storage can become competitive and start to displace fossil fuels as a company with “battery commodities” we have an opportunity to contribute to the deeper penetration of batteries into the energy market lithiumion batteries lib have been so widely adopted because they store a relatively large amount of power for their size and weight they have a high energy density they have a high power output but for a short duration libs are complimented by longerduration lower power output batteries like the vanadium redox flow battery vrfb that are capable of storing energy on a large scale libs and vrfbs can be visualized as the fast and strong versus the slow and steady many other types of battery are under investigation – this is a field that is evolving at a very quick pace lithium ion batteries lib power delivered from a lib results from the flow of lithium ions from the negative anode to the positive cathode recharging reverses this flow and “restocks” the anode with lithium ions that have migrated back from the cathode graphite is the anode in most libs while various designs use different compounds for the cathode early libs used cobalt in the cathode but this resulted in the batteries overheating and being relatively unstable more recent designs include phosphate compounds such as iron phosphate or vanadium phosphate with a mixture of nickel cobalt manganese andor aluminium uo corp’s berlin deposit in colombia would produce many of the cathode commodities including phosphate nickel and vanadium while manganese and iron that are introduced in the extraction process could be recovered to augment the package of battery commodities available from berlin vanadium redox flow batteries vrfb vanadium would be produced from both the laguna salada and berlin deposits vrfbs make use of the characteristic that vanadium occurs in four charge states – and the batteries work by having v and v constituting the negative anode and v and v together on the positive cathode side of the battery when liquids from the two sides of the battery come in contact with a metal plate electrical current is generated the industrial storage potential of vrfbs is based on the fact that their capacity depends basically on the size of the plastic tanks that store the two vanadium solutions bigger tanks mean greater storage capacity vrfbs can be charged and discharged very quickly – almost instantaneously since there is no chemical reaction between elements on either side of the battery vrfbs do not degrade and lose capacity over time as libs do libs are good for power required over short timeframes of a few hours whereas vrfbs are more suited to longerduration power delivery up to  hours and more about corporate what is uranium why south america investors news projects contact news signup thanks for signing up join uo corps mailing list to
