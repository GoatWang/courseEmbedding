application guide requires acrobat pdf reader step by step kleer kote application guide overview this product is a  solid two component clear polymer coating that is mixed at a  to  ratio by volume each kit contains a bottle of resin and a bottle of hardener the product cures to a clear high build glass like finish that resists scratching yellowing and will not distort with age items coated with it will become permanently preserved and protected for your enjoyment throughout a lifetime this product will not exhibit blushing or sweat out under high humidity conditions primary use this product is commonly seen on bar tops and table tops in many bars and restaurants application the product should be applied in two stages the first stage is referred to as the seal coat the seal coat is brushed on in a thin layer and is used to seal any pores in the surface and prevent air bubbles from forming in the following flood coats this stage is followed by the flood coat which will flow and self level clean brushes or squeeges can be used to help spread the epoxy flood coats are applied in  layers at a time as many as desired can be applied however one to three coats is average for most table or bar coatings recoatingbetween layers recoating can usually be be done within  to  hours if recoated within this time period no sanding is necessary between layers if your previous layer has fully dried very light sanding with  grit sandpaper is recommended to achieve a good bonding surface after sanding you should wipe down with a solvent such as denatured alcohol or acetone to remove any impurities from the surface do not use mineral spirits imbedding pictures objects such as pictures maps etc can be imbedded in this product during the pours most photo quality paper does not require any special preparation however sometimes thin paper objects must first be sealed with a white glue or similar product to prevent the kleer koat from fully penetrating the paper and causing it to become transparent imbedding solid objects wood rocks shells etc all porous materials should first have a seal coat of epoxy applied this will prevent air bubbles from occurring in subsequent flood coats usually the objects can be set in place before sealing working conditions for best results the product must be used at temperatures from  degrees f the room which you are working should be clean dry dust and insect free settling dust can often cause blemishes on the glassy surface exterior applications please not that although this product will resist yellowing better than other epoxies it is not  uv resistant continuous outdoor uv exposure over months or years will cause the finish to lose its gloss cause gradual changes in color and possibly warp storage conditions liquids should be stored in a cool dry dark environment product will last for at least  months and many times will last longer but small testing should be done if in doubt the hardener may get more amber in color as it gets older but this does not affect the use of the product coverage see the coverage charts shown below to calculate the amount you will need for your area remember not to combine seal and flood coat coverages flood coats are designed to go on approximately  thick which is about three times thicker than that of a seal coat example a ft x ft bare wood table sq ft would require  quarts to complete one seal coat and about a gallon and a half to complete one flood coat for a total of two gallons beginners notes this material leaves professional results when applied correctly so take your time and make sure to beware of these of the common problems we have seen encountered by first time users  always make sure that your mixing container is clean and your measuring device is accurate this product requires that you mix at a  to  ratio by weight or volume any variances from this can cause the epoxy to stay soft and not fully cure  this product requires a thorough mixing usually between  to  minutes of solid mixing without excessive whipping of the mixturewhipping will put lots of air bubbles into the epoxy mixing one gallon at a time can require up to  to  minutes of mixing beginners should never attempt to mix more than one gallon total per batch  quarts per batch is suggested until you feel comfortable with how the product works  after the two components are poured together and stirring begins the mixture will turn a cloudy white color this represents areas in which the epoxy has not fully combined you must continue to mix until all signs of cloudiness and tiny white lines have completely disappeared usually takes  minutes of thorough mixing  always scrape the sides of your mixing container and also the stick during those  minutes if unmixed epoxy remains on the side of the container or the stick it will cause wet spots on your finished product if that unmixed material falls into your projectfollowup while pouring your epoxy onto the surface never scrape the container to remove every last drop because no matter how thorough you mix there will always be an unmixed drop on the side of the container that will leave a wet spot recommendation of materials needed for application link is attached to the materials if we carry the product safety gloves  epoxy can be very sticky graduated mixing cups  an accurate measurement is extremely important to achieve optimum curing clean stir sticks  any dirt will end up showing on your product mixing is very important if you whip while mixing you will end up with air bubbles long thorough stirs are required applicators  rubber squeeges are simple to use and leave no air bubbles foam brushes and nylon bristle brushes are preferred with epoxy make sure there are no loose hairs hair drier heat gun or torch  these are used after the pour is completed and the epoxy is still liquid a very smooth stroke across about  inches above the epoxy surface will burst remaining air bubbles  cold weather warning  if your epoxy arrives cold during shipment is must be allowed to acclimate to at least  degrees f before using mixing this product below  degrees will increase the potential for undermixed epoxy which will create wet or sticky areas on your surface cold temperatures will also trap more very tiny air bubbles during the mixing which cannot always be removed with the torchheat gun to warm the epoxy quickly we recommend using either a heat lamp an electric heater or placing the closed bottles of epoxy in a tub of warm water for  minutes getting the epoxy too hot will result in a faster reaction time so pay careful attention to what youre doing  cold weather warning  order online or by phone   kleer kote epoxy our kleer kote product can be used in any of the above mentioned

were not impressed enough to add them to our product line until water bond came along we consider this epoxy to be a superior water based epoxy and one that should seriously consider if you are in the market for a water based epoxy water based epoxies are used on concrete floors as a sealer a primer and optionally as the complete floor coating itself comparisons like most  solids floor epoxies water based water bond™ epoxy is almost odorless no worse than latex wall paint and offers good chemical and abrasion resistance both offer good adhesion the water bond™ finish will be much thinner than even a single coat of the  solids epoxy water bond™ is also nonhazmat to ship while nearly all  solids floor epoxies are not is is less affected by uv yellowing than the other epoxies although it only comes in medium gray vs a wider selection of colors with the other epoxies being water based water bond™ will soak into porous surfaces such as concrete before it cures thus resulting in a bond that is probably stronger than the ‘surface only bond achieved with  solids epoxies this is why it makes an excellent primer under  solids epoxies or apply a second coat and use the water bond™ as the finished surface coating as well it also works as a sealerprimer over surface degreased concrete helping some contractors will ‘surface seal areas of freshly degreased concrete with a water based epoxy primer to ‘lock in any remaining grease or oils that still might be present from migrating back to the surface and causing adhesion problems right or wrong this sounds like a smart extra step to take considering the huge downside that results when a floor coating fails do to adhesion problems water bond™ offers the widest range of antislip andor decorative treatments for starters one coat sometimes two coats is generally thin enough to let the original antislip texture of the concrete to remain water bond™ is also thin enough to allow the use of our very fine ‘sugar sand antislip additive note in thicker coatings the sugar sand disappears into the coating which gives a sandpaper like finish however the coating is also thick enough to permit the use of our much larger walnut shell antislip additive it will also accept the broadcast of colored sands andor ‘vinyl chips on to its surface unlike the water based floor epoxies sold in hardware stores water bond™ is slightly breathable letting vapor pressure from below pass through rather than lift the epoxy also water bond™ has no induction time required waiting time between mixing and application induction time is generally a sign of a low end epoxy also if the induction time varies from batch to batch the final gloss mould vary from batch to batch   we really appreciate you visiting progressive epoxy polymers

a good company my affiliation is as a diy end user no recompense no funny business ive been refurbishing our  ketch and have done some epoxy work in that process ive never worked with epoxy before this i talked to several local glass workers and researched on line to learn a bit about epoxy i searched for different vendors and their prices i settled on a place in new hampshire called progressive epoxy polymers httpwwwepoxyproductscom my first thought was what a mess of a website i found it very confusing since i first came upon it there have been improvements made to make it more user friendly aside from that the site is most informative to this beginning diys i was won over by the explanations descriptions of chemistries msdss  suggested usages and personal responsiveness of the owner and his wife i did a calculation of prices per ounce approximating the match of the different brands products i realize that there is no way i can say im comparing the same chemistry of different brands nevertheless progressive epoxy prices remain the best i have found ive used the premium no blush  gallons lowv  gal a putty with kevlar and some elastomeric stuff in addition ive used

epoxy as my sole epoxy coating  glue solution throughout this entire project and i just love your product having used all the major brands on the market today i find your epoxy to be the easiest most

behaving kindly with temps in the upper s to  while pot life varies considerably in such a wide range your product is very consistent predictable and telling when its time to wrap it up which is definitely not so much the case with some of your competitors in addition your pricing is very attractive and while price is not the primary reason why i use your product i definitely appreciate the

then found your website in my desperate search for an airshippable underwater epoxy we had been marooned on remote hermit is png for two months banshee sank on october   in three minutes after hitting a coral head and was completely underwater for three days there was a  ft crack through the hull and a punched in hole about a foot in diameter the damage was massive leslie patched the hull with old zspar splash zone and a piece of wood a villager shaped with an axe we kedged it off the reef winched it upright and then the villagers built an underwater cradle of lashed together logs to support banshee we bailed with buckets during a very low tide at night she floated the inside of the boat was trashed the electricelectronics destroyed the engine unusable lots of things stolen and diesel oil sandy sea water and ocean bottom rubble and mold covered everything but the sailing rig survived however it soon became apparent that the old zspar patch would never hold for a  mile open sea voyage to madang png and dry dock for hull repair as i told you when i wrote in december the hull was steadily leaking and we knew the temporary repair would not last much longer i was desperate to save my boat that has been my life for  years i bought your underwater epoxy and you shipped it to manus is png i picked it up and returned to the remote island of hermitwhat a name almost didnt make it back as a storm came up while we were in the open  ft boat making it back to the island  hrs in an open boat with heavy seas with local bush people and me but i had the epoxy and knew we would now sail banshee off hermit the whole saga is a very very long story of an incredible three month ordeal for two women alone i got back to hermit in mid january and les and i applied your stuff according to your directions we patched the hull inside and out as you said by then the leakage from the  year old zspar splash zone was getting worse however your stuff stopped all the leaks after  weeks of working on the boat we left hermit for the voyage to madang png sailing the  miles with no engine no electronics no autopilot no functioning life raft and very little food or water there were very high winds and rough seas and then dead calms and we only had wind and sails alone to get us across that ocean your repair stuff held the hull had a fierce poundingbut no leaks we made it we were towed in at the entrance to madang harbor and collapsed in exhaustion if we had not had your epoxy  our boat which is our life would still be under water at hermit we owe a debt of gratitude to you the boat was put up in a primitive dry dock and we literally cut out the repaired hull with a diamond tipped saw your stuff eats sanding grinders we are good at epoxy repair of hullsthank goodness because no one here knew anything before we had properly repaired big holes where thruhulls had been removed by building up larger and larger layers of mat and roving with epoxy resin leslie is very good at thathaving worked in a fiberglass repair shop this was just a bigger job ghastly work we have pictures of the repair and the  ft long crack and hole in the hull we are now safely sitting in an anchorage in madang rebuilding and rewiring with our very limited funds we plan to leave madang for guam and employment in december the story became such an incredible one about doing the impossible that some publishers in the states are interested i am writing a book about the whole ordeal there will be an article in sailing magazine an article in the online magazine of andrew corp makers of our gps antenna has gone to press now acr electronics maker of our epirb that notified authorities of our disaster is interested in an online article all because you were kind took time to help me and had the right stuff i should have written many times before but work on the boat kept interrupting me its been nonstop since we got in you and your company will have star billing in any written piece that comes from me also i think its important for sailors to feel that if the unspoken fear that we all have  holing and sinking  actually happens one has options other than just walking away as so many told me to do two women did this  they can to i am  and leslie is  we did not walk away i feel that any person taking a boat to sea anywhere anytime should carry your product aboard and know how to apply it if i can assist you in distributing or advertising your product i am more than happy to do so very thankfully joy s and leslie b us yacht banshee madang papua new guinea       since the

etc in ta  overnight and they will be ready to reuse in the morning non evaporating no need to cover your soaking pot reuse over and over works on uncured epoxy but have had some reports of it success with just recently hard epoxy too also use as a flexibilizer in other epoxies  will also blister dried enamel and varnish overnight i also use it as the final step in cleaning brushes enamels latex polyurethane even epoxy no matter how much a solvent or water rinse my paintbrushes after use when i get back to them they are hard and stiff now i dip or soak the socalled clean brush in the ta then shake or spin the ta out of the brush the result is a nonstiff nonsticky nonoily brush ready for use on my next project it gets even better i finally found a way to reuse brushes full of epoxy resin instead of tossing the brush after every epoxy encounter when you are done with the epoxy  squeeze out as much of the epoxy from the brush as you can then rinse brush once or twice with solvent now put the brush into a jar of ta  the ta will not evaporate so you dont need a lid on the jar when you return at a later time pull out the brush  squeezespin the ta  out of the brush you now have a clean soft brush ready for the next batch of epoxy you can also put the brush in the freezer  it slows the epoxy reaction down enough that the brush is still usable the next day it also works with brushes youve cleaned after using them with latex or enamel these clean brushes tend at least for me to get stiff when they fully dry a dip and spin in the ta keeps them like new flexible non hazmat

epoxy vendor even tell you this also when you cannot perform professional concrete floor prep usually with s shot blast machine and also important on floors that seem a bit weak or dusty epoxy floor paints are surface bond only  so a weak surface is a crisis waiting to happen see floor links page  and our other page on concrete sealing best advice from an epoxy pro on how to avoid a  diy epoxy

there might be moisture issues inon the slab  suspect the concrete was not vibrated down and contains lots of air spaces which can cause bubbles and blisters in the wet epoxy  cannot professionally prep the floor usually means a shot blast contractor  any existing coating on the floor is peeling and lifting  the concrete seems dusty gritty weak or crumbling  you are worried about hot tire pickup lifting off your epoxy floor  you have oil stains on the floor especially old oil stains if so consider putting an inexpensive epoxy primer  sealer such as esp   an internet favorite epoxy coating  not for sale in california on the entire floor or over those potential trouble spots then wait a few weeks or months and see what happens if everything looks great it is very likely that a fancy epoxy top coat will be successful and probably issue free you might even decide to just keep the sealed floor and skip the thicker mostly decorative or at least thicker and pigmented epoxy top coat such as  voc industrial floor epoxy if problems developed with the thin nearly clear esp  epoxy sealer it is not that big a deal no worse than having some deckporch enamel paint lift and peel you wont trip

will have a clear glossy looks like a water spill very thin coat of epoxy on the surface it will probably not be thick epoxy to level and fill chips other flaws but it will be a waterproof layer of chemical resistant epoxy if this was your objective you could stop here and optionally paint the esp  with enamel or latex paint for looks only or leave it plain since a half gal kit of esp  covers

fiberglass primer especially boat hulls old and weathered fiberglass is not a good surface to simply paint over this is especially true when working on old fiberglass boat bottoms often old boat bottoms are sand blasted back down to the old fiberglass the blasting itself introduces microscopic chips and cracks blasting or sanding imbeds sandingblasting dust into the old fiberglass surface a

is a progressive epoxy polymers inc best selling favorite product visit our favorites   epoxies that will fix anything  web page at epoxyproductscomfavoritesuhtml view other popular oneofakind products the more i work with this product the more i am impressed with it hence the reason behind this page the product is a clear watery thin epoxy with a simple  to  mix ratio it is sold in two one quart cans it was originally designed for use on concrete to seal the product the cement it wasis then often top coated with some other coating because it is a thin coating it can often fill or seal small voids or holes near the surface of the concrete that can expel air resulting in bubbles and creators in thicker top coatings such as thick epoxies   use for esp  is to precoat wood surfaces prior to painting with latex or enamels wood expands or contracts with moisture levels where as other materials including paints expand and contract with temperature this means that wood and the coating on it can be working against each other resulting in a coating failure in my experience this is more of a problem with wood that has already been ‘weathered outdoors these wood surfaces probably already have a lot of internally trapped moisture besides effecting how wood expands or contracts moisture in wood also affects the adhesion of many coatings most paints and coatings including a majority of epoxies dont bond well to wet damp or moist surfaces  including wood with a high internal moisture level   often used as a primer and sealer on old weak concrete floors and sun damaged fiberglass boat hulls often before the application of a marine epoxy barrier coat bottom paint or  part poly hull paint generally epoxies used as primers use lots of solvents and the lowest quality epoxy available esp is an amazing exception probably nothing else like it available it uses a top of the line cycloaliphatic curing system as a starting point the other penetratingsealing

primer  epoxy sealer esp  solvent thinned commercial epoxy sealer primer solvent thinned epoxy for sealing priming and waterproofing  compare to xyz brand the product also uses a very high end cycloaliphatic epoxy  instead of the very low end epoxies found in other solvent thinned epoxies of this kind one trick with the esp  is to use some of our pigments or some other pigment to shade the esp  slightly it is easier to see how evenly youre applying it when it has some color instead of being clear also if you are going to paint the surface lets say white tinting the esp  white may mean you can skip that second or third coat of white paint if you cannot use the esp  say you live in southern california then your alternative option is our low v™ epoxy the low v epoxy is solvent free so it can be sold anywhere it is thicker than the solvent thinned esp  so it would not in theory seep into the wood or cement as well as the esp  the low v does bond and harden underwater like the esp  in confined spaces such as in a boat hull blister you would not want to use a solvent thinned coating because the solvents have no place to evaporate away to  low v in our marine epoxy catalog  low v

email or call      order online tax free new hampshire location  no sales tax applied   warning dont buy epoxy from any source  that doesnt have batch numbers or date of manufacture stamped on to  their products labels like all primary source manufacturers and vendors we track each each unit with a batch number or manufacturing date hand added to each container label it is a labor intensive handson process that marketing based companies and firms that just want to push product and take your money dont do most maybe all of out competitors dont track or provide this information they dont know it or they dont want to let you know how old their product is only buy your epoxy chemicals from vendors that label their epoxies with actual batch numbers or date of manufacture call before ordering and ask if that information will be on all  containers shipped out  section   pick your table top bar top epoxy vendor carefully clear epoxy temperature notes     warmer temperatures will affect your epoxy it makes the part a thinner lower viscosity and it shortens both your working time and the epoxy curing time note that it takes days for epoxy to fully cure even though it will probably feel hard overnight thinner epoxy means less air bubbles as the bubbles can more easily rise to the surface and pop it also means a thinner layer of epoxy whether you roll squeegee or pour it on and most thickness claims by pour on epoxy vendors are over stated and not as thick as they claim some epoxies are so thick you cannot even get them out of their containers unless the temperatures are warm say  degrees  degrees is a nice temperature for working with clear epoxies not too hot and not too cold thicker epoxies will level out better too can you use them at lower or higher temperature you bet clear epoxy yellowing all epoxies will yellow  some quicker and more than others there is no such thing as a non yellowing epoxy or epoxy with uv blockers chemically not possible epoxies will yellow outdoors in direct sunlight but they will also yellow slowly even in the dark unless it is applied on top of a white surface you probably will not notice the yellowing inside outside it will completely cloud up over time there are some products that can be applied over the epoxy that will block the uv yellowing these are clear epoxy basics that any epoxy vendor should make known up front if they hide this information from you dont do business with them       vendor  product warnings  buyer beware since we started selling bar top and table top epoxies to homeowners and contractors years ago other epoxy sellers have jumped on the bandwagon offering less than ideal epoxies at low prices there are things you need to consider    manymost of the low cost epoxy vendors dont formulate their products at all instead they purchase in bulk the raw resins and curing agents manufactured by the few giant chemical companies that make them  the better vendors use these raw materials purchased by the low end vendors and everyone else as the starting point for their epoxies and formulate the products for improved features it is sort of like the difference between alcohol and jack daniels  using a barrel of oil from an oil rig in your car instead of using the formulatedrefined version called gasoline usually the only clue you have is a dirt cheap price epoxies arent cheap good formulated epoxies cost between about  per gallon to about  per gallon special epoxies can cost hundreds of dollars a gallon generally vendors that sell through distributors have to charge more because the distributors get a  discount on list price and the manufacturer still has to make a profit  customer support is also a key issue for contractors and first time homeowners diy folks first time users often need a lot of hand holding and support before and after the sale to evaluate your potential supplier for support we suggest you email andor call them with questions etc so that you can see if they will be there for you when you are considering the purchase when you purchase when you do your pour and after the pour if you have any issues  best yet call after hours or on the weekend    red flag   dont buy from a marketing company  repeat  dont buy from a marketing company you buy cars from an automobile company computers from a computer company and lumber from a lumber company you dont buy industrial chemicals ie epoxies from a marketing company you buy epoxies from a chemicalepoxy source marketing companies sell  sunglasses plastic containers made in china weight loss pills and pet rocks epoxies are chemicals  deal only with professionals clues that you are dealing with a marketing company and not an epoxy company  a really slick web site but no technical chemical or scientific words or jargon  marketing companies have live chat lines how many small  medium sized manufacturing technology or scientific companies have employees just sitting at desks waiting for you to contact them  a focus on pricing marketing is about making money getting your money and not about the product being sold  marketing companies try to sell you extra high profit to them items   marketing companies will offer only one product and claim it has only one specific use per web site  can you imagine any manufactureagent selling just one product to one small group of potential customers   hello i bought a few gallons of xxxxxxx bar top epoxy from another web site i was planning to coat a hardwoodveneer plywood kitchen countertop stained with minwax waterbased gel stain i read the instructions but also called to ask about something else stirpour time for  person with  gallons or more because i didn’t have time yet to do the coating i was worried about kitchenactivity grease or other spots getting on the counter before it was sealed so i called the vendor that vendor’s web site has a lot of problems with chat windows that don’t work etc and when i commented on these  aspects of the service the manager declined to give me any advice about the product telling me i had not read the instructions it had been a few months so i reread them and asked again he never responded apparently not feeling any obligation even if it meant i couldn’t confidently use the  gallons i purchased—a few hundred dollars’ worth and no i wasn’t abusive nor anything but a little testy after learning i’d been misinformed so in hopes you can give general guidance knowing i wish i had started with your site instead and will do so in future since theirs isn’t returnable thank you note our epoxy is returnable with a  restock fee shipping not included horror stories using competitors  budget epoxies background there are two types of epoxy vendors the serious professional grade epoxies  are formulated by beginning with  the raw resins manufactured by the giant chemical companies call these companies epoxy formulators  generally the low price epoxy vendors merely repackage these raw bulk resins not a good thing  call these companies epoxy repackagers it is the difference between moonshine and jack daniels use only formulated special purpose epoxies like those sold in this web site going cheap can have very  consequences see below example   a commercial epoxy pour contractor recently used our bio clear  pour on  epoxy to replace a badly yellowed epoxy covered logo in the inside  floor of regional airport terminal with our almost no yellowing bio clear  cycloaliphatic epoxies to the rescue we dont know for certain that the original contractor used some inexpensive repackagers epoxy but it certainly sounds like it example  i recently got a phone call from someone using epoxy to seal wooden tables they were selling they were using cheap epoxy from a  repackager uxcoxxxxxxxs after six months the epoxy on the tables all exhibited millions of tiny cracks like shattered safety glass this wouldnt have happened with a specially formulated epoxy designed to overcome the flaws of the raw resins bad news for them example  another phone caller told me how they had ordered over a hundred gallons of epoxy in two separate orders from a low cost repackager bxxxbxxxxxxxxxy the first batch worked fine but the second batch failed completely the vendor knew it was their fault bad batch wrong barrel to jug pour out and refunded their money but that didnt undo the damage done red flag  misinformation wrong stuff some epoxy sites are posting wrong information  epoxies take a week or more for full cure they often can be used in  or  days but they continue to cure for a week or so epoxy pros all know this  to pop bubbles in a liquid epoxy you heat the air above the epoxy with a torch etc you run the torchheat parallel  to the surface this warms and expands the air above the bubble and the bubble pops due to the lower air pressure  you do not point the open flameextreme heat at any chemical that will burn including epoxy you could also bake or cook the area where the heat is applied ask any high school chemistry teacher or lab technician science folks know this marketing types not so much  like most coatings epoxies will not stick to greasy or oil covered surfaces one marketing company states that epoxy will not bond over oil based paints oil based paints are actually regular enamel paints sold at hardware stores that use long chain solvents not really oils any handyman or craft person knows there is no oil film on enamel painted surfaces as  you would expect epoxies stick fine over enamels latex and poly paints any paint professional knows this marketing types not so much red flag  no weekend or evening support that is the time most diy folks are doing epoxy pours they work during the day any company that you cannot reach on a friday night or sunday morning is looking our for their bottom line not yours red flag  overlooked information these issues should be clearly mentioned and explained  epoxy yellowing in uv light  what happens if poured too thick  big heat kick and uneven surface  what happens if you do a poor job mixing you get sticky spots that never get hard  fix  more epoxy on top  epoxy scratch relatively easily treat with care  epoxies soften at about  degrees place a hot object on the epoxy and it will leave a permanent dent in the epoxy   section   epoxies yellow    all epoxies yellow in sunlight and even over time uv protection cannot be added to epoxies but can be added to other kinds of clear coatings that can go over the epoxy we are very upfront about epoxy yellowing if your other epoxy vendor doesnt mention it they are not being completely open and honest with you  some even claim to have non yellowing epoxy this is not chemically possible all epoxies yellow in uv and over time five different epoxies all showing yellowing after a few weeks outdoors white plate for reference we show you the ugly yellow truth   the truth is that some epoxies yellow faster than others but they all do it is the nature of epoxies they are probably claiming the slow to yellow epoxies are non yellowing  acceptable in many marketing based companies  uv blockers and absorbers cannot be added to thermoset resin systems like epoxy or the epoxy will not cross link correctly dont believe claims to the contrary if that magical additive existed it would revolutionize the epoxy coating industry used on ships boats pits storage tanks etc and become quickly accepted and used by every epoxy manufacturer like the invention of the automatic transmission in the auto industry and if it did exist it would come from some large chemical company that makes all the raw epoxy resins and curing agents and not some internet epoxy sales site finally if there was such an additive or curing agent it would certainly be introduced and marketed in much much larger epoxy niches than just bar tops and table tops     stopping uv damage and uv yellowing      josie lewis  wrote hi paul i recently purchased some clear epoxy  and acrylic poly uv plus from your company i have access to a uv chamber which simulates high altitude direct uv exposure i thought you might be interested in my findings i used a masonite panel painted white and then coated with the epoxy on half of the epoxy coated panel i brushed on one coat of uv poly and put it in the chamber for  hours at  c the heat accelerates the exposure attached is a picture of the results the masonite cracked a bit and separated due to a bit of wetness in the wood unrelated to the resin the epoxy  ambered dramatically within about  hours after  hours the uv poly showed a slight bit of ambering from the original control but it is marginal at worst the technician who ran the test said if it isnt yellow at  hours it is basically indestructible i also tested several other part resin products with the uv poly and had the same result you have a great product i now feel secure knowing that my resin art protected with the poly uv plus will be archival and protected for long years i will be ordering more soon best josie  order acrylic poly uv plus  cannot be sold in calif  and all our other products at our king cart storefront acrylic poly uv plus is in the nonepoxy section      because of the yellowing it is generally not a good idea to have a poured epoxy table  bar outside in the sun but if you do  keep it covered with not in use diy  bar top customer example more pictures  examples  info below     section   first things first  the math the big shocker to people considering a thick poured on clear table top is the amount of epoxy necessary here are some numbers you need to know  gallon of anything applied  inch thick will only cover slightly less than  square feet  gallon of anything applied  inch thick will only cover  square feet at  inch thick that gallon of epoxy will only cover about  square feet there  cubic inches in a gallon one square foot is equal to  square inches pour on and over the edge epoxies generally claim they put down  inch layers but it actually less they claim  square feet per gallon but if it was  inch thick coverage would only be  square feet note that  pennies stacked on top of each other equals about  inch why dont the other guys share this basic info with potential customers   note edge all around the table note edge all around the table this is from james in the user notes page your web site is delight to scroll through confusing and funny at the same time with a lot of info you wouldnt find at any serious big corporate web sites keep up the good work and good luck section   first things first  two part epoxy resins epoxies do not do well in direct sunlight direct uv exposure they will turn cloudy and yellow lose their shine and perhaps even chalk all epoxies especially white and clear epoxies do this most do it rather quickly within a few days of constant exposure some do it very very slowly weeks instead of days    keep the table out of direct sun when not in use use a cover epoxies may feel hard and cured within a few hours but they take a week or more to cure completely if you make the mistake of putting some paper or a heavy or sharp object on an epoxy surface that is less than several days old the paper will glue itself to the epoxy and the objects will dent the epoxy epoxies are really just a hard plastic mix parts a and b together and a chemical reaction occurs between the two parts the reaction generates heat and the epoxy gets hard many epoxies generate a lot of heat so much that the mixture might froth up melt the container it is in smoke and most certainly produce an uneven surface with epoxies like these you are generally told not to pour out layers more than half an inch or one quarter inch so that less heat and distortion results due to the lesser amount of epoxy present and the amount of surface area to expel the heat most people would like a thick clear epoxy to apply to their table or bar top thick unfortunately has trouble with trapped tiny air bubbles mixing and pouring the epoxy introduces lots of bubbles to the mixture fortunately most will rise to the surface and pop before the epoxy gets hard and traps them heating the poured epoxy with a hair dryer will aid the bubbles rising to the surface and popping the heat the epoxy generates as it cures if not too great will also help the epoxy rise to the surface and pop like most plastics epoxies will soften with heat generally if you place something that is hotter than about  degrees f such as a hot coffee cup it might soften the epoxy to the point of leaving a dent ring or depression in the epoxy that will not go away keep hot things away from your epoxy surface yes it is common to build up the thickness by doing a multiple layers of epoxy pours generally because of the heat release on most epoxies   hello paul    sending photos of the shower my wife regina and i designed we wanted the shower floor to convey a beach feeling to achieve the effect white cement was used and tiny sea shells were pressed into the surface after the concrete cured i took your advice on which epoxy to use to encapsulate the sea shells basic no blush it was a bit tricky to keep the epoxy from all flowing into the drain  after brushing on three coats i used a hole saw to cut thru the basic no blush epoxy that had collected over painters tape covering the drain heeding your warning that wet epoxy is dangerously slick i finished the job with a top coat of acrylic sealer with a glass dust nonslip additive the results are beautiful and safe thanks for the advise and great epoxy product    best regards  mike   paul finally got my top poured your product is awesome i was hesitant with all i read about go small first my top was xx im the go big or go home guy this top was my first pour  i feel that your product made it as easy as it could be i was very surprised at the lack of fumes i poured in a different location  could have just poured in the store where the counter is going   section   user notes part  and part    prime  seal the surface the surface to be coated is often sealed with some other product prior to pouring the epoxy  this is necessary when pouring over old lumber etc also many of the objects to be covered with epoxy need to be sealed to prevent air and bubbles from coming out of them generally people use a clear polyurethane from the hardware store or marine spar varnish or even glue when sealing old wood seal with at least  coats of sealer as per customer feedback  one coat may not be enough sealing prevents leaks bubbles and show possible bad stuff like grease or oil that will mess up the epoxy pour it an also glue down objects to be placed in the epoxy easier to fix before the epoxy is poured may not be able to fix after the epoxy is poured so two coats of clear sealer recommended  let dry for several days or longer   we recommend you test your sealed surface with water before applying the epoxy the water will test for leaks levelness and bubbles if satisfied sponge the water out  wait a few days to dry completely then pour your epoxy the epoxy will feel dry and hard overnight but it takes a week for it to fully cure and harden do not place objects on the epoxy before then as they will stick or leave a dent or impression in the still hardening epoxy get everything at the same temperature  epoxy and the all surfaces and keep it that way for a day or so after the pour avoid applying near windows etc where sunlight will change the temperature temperature changes warmer temps may cause bubbles to form dont try to get the last few drops of epoxy out of your mixing container the liquid sticking to the sides and cornersedges of the container never get completely mixed pour your mixture out of the mixing container but dont keep it draining out for more than  seconds or so poorly mixed epoxy will always stay tacky or wet either in certain areas or all over even better is to double mix mix in one container pour into a second container and mix again use the double mixed epoxy from the second container on your surface section   what can go wrong   what can go wrong  diy problems we hear about  the epoxy leaks out from the corners fix seal the edges and corners using some of the epoxy varnish etc test maybe with water before your big pour if you are pouring on to a surface with an edge all around it option   bubbles in the epoxy  either from mixing too vigorously youre not making whip cream or from the woodobjects you are covering with the epoxy sealing the surface prior to the pour will take care of the bubbles from objects in the epoxy to remove bubbles quickly pass a torchheat gun over the surface of the epoxy once the bubbles have reached the surface of the epoxy  stress cracks on large pours say over  or  gallons or maybe greater than  or  square feet  stress cracks can form from all the different temperatures generated the bigger the pour the thinner each layer of epoxy has to be to handle all the heat i wish i could be more exact here but i have no real numbers to offer i have found that running a fan across the poured epoxy helps to dissipate and evenout the heat generated permitting thicker and larger pours  ridges and an uneven surface just like the stress cracks this is a result of too much epoxy too thick applied at one time the unevenness is from the heat generated unevenly in the pour we hope the information provided by these pages will convince you to go for quality over low end cheap  rapidly yellowing generic epoxy

epoxies they don’t always happen but they are not that rare although epoxy vendors tend to downplay the risk of fisheyes fisheye will form within about  minutes after the epoxy has been applied to surface causes fisheyes are all about surface tension and often surface contamination of oils waxes silicones etc fisheyes  are much less common in pigmented epoxies and epoxies with fillers and binders which ‘hold the epoxy together’ and preventing fisheyes of course adding fillers pigments or binders results in an epoxy that is no longer clear fisheyes can result when clear epoxies are applied too thin often to slightly contaminated surfaces but not necessarily with surface stresses exceed the ability of the epoxy to ‘hold together they are much more common on smooth glassy surfaces and rare on rough surfaces   fisheyes will not form when using fiberglass cloth with your clear marine type epoxy   fisheyes are rather common when epoxy is applied over newly stained surfaces always allow stains to dry for   weeks before top coating with any sort of coating   prevention thicker layers of clear epoxy are the answer to preventing most fisheyes the bio clear  epoxy is so thin that it is recommended not to be applied in thicknesses of less then  inch thick which requires and edge or dam around all edges it is commonly used in professional bar top and table top applications when working with other ‘pour on’ epoxies fisheyes tend to happen if they are going to happen when the epoxy is spread out or brushed out instead of just poured on and allowed to flow out on its own  resulting in a thicker layer fix keep an eye on your pour on or brushed on clear epoxy for the first  minutes or so after application if you see fisheyes forming you can generally ‘fx’ them by pouring more epoxy over the forming fisheye if your epoxy is already hard when you notice the fisheyes here are your options if the fisheyes are caused by surface contamination then sanding down andor adding more epoxy may not help  the still present contamination will once again cause more fisheyes in the new second coat of epoxy a possible fix is to seal the contaminated epoxy with a clear poly sealer and paint which might separate the contaminates from the the new epoxy to be applied over the poly sealer if the fisheyes are caused by minor surface contamination or just too thin of a layer of epoxy you can  pour on more epoxy over the fisheyes and entire surface but you will still see a slight dimple or depression over the old fisheye sites  sand away the fisheyes and the entire surface and reapply more epoxy   best advice a majority of fisheyes are caused by applying clear epoxies too thin on smooth surfaces in one sense it is best to apply the epoxy as thick as possible however if it does fisheye the you will have a real mess to sand away or redo best advice might be to apply a thin coat of epoxy in a small test spot if it does fisheye you can probably remove the still liquid epoxy with a solvent soaked rag if the epoxy is already hard the thin coat of epoxy in a small test area will not be that big of a deal to sand off if it doesnt fisheye you can proceed with more epoxy at that thickness or thicker without worry do a test brush on a thin coat of your clear epoxy on a  inch by  inch area watch it for about  minutes to see if it fisheyes whether it does or not scrap off or remove with a solvent soaked rag now you know what to expect if you are into your big project and see fisheyes forming adding more epoxy over them is your best fix so keep an eye on your clear epoxy application for about    minutes after you apply the epoxy and be on the lookout for developing  fisheyes   skip it all and get answers fast or just talk about  your idea email us for help or

top coat  ha cool temps worked in my favor to keep potlife long but the rainy weather tried to work against me i ended up tarping over my garage door opening so i could get the area under the seal done without dealing with water on the floor a cheap rubber squeegee from harbor freight was an essential item because it is way too tough to get even distribution of the industrial floor epoxy with just a roller the squeegee was the same price as a single  roller tube anyway and it worked great i ended up broadcasting chips into the epoxy rather than the clear coat because i wanted a slightly smoother floor it probably took more chips this way but i think it was a fair trade if i had to do it over again id seriously consider putting chips into a clear epoxy middle coat because even with two coats of poly my basement floor is a bit rougher than i thought it would be i ended up putting a third coat of uv poly on the garage floor and it still seems pretty nonskid but is smooth enough that it will be easier to keep clean the coverage estimates were spot on for floor epoxy and uv poly top coat the primer was another story my basement floor was pumped concrete and after bead blasting

using your basic noblush marine epoxy as my sole epoxy coating  glue solution throughout this entire project and i just love your product having used all the major brands on the market today i find your epoxy to be the easiest most consistent and most forgiving marine epoxy product of them all this boat is being built in an unheated semiweather tight workshop on an island on lake winnipesaukee central new hampshire and consequently im more often working in temperatures outside of what is optimal for most epoxies ive had success with your epoxy with the regular curing agent setting up in temps in the low s and also behaving kindly with temps in the upper s to  while pot life varies considerably in such a wide range your product is very consistent predictable and telling when its time to wrap it up which is definitely not so much the case with some of your competitors in addition your pricing is very attractive and while price is not the primary reason why i use your product i definitely appreciate the value you offer so thank you jeff    offshore skiff boat builder originally designed for offshore magazine the offshore skiff was intended to be an economical shoaldraft

httpwwwepoxyproductscom my first thought was what a mess of a website i found it very confusing since i first came upon it there have been improvements made to make it more user friendly aside from that the site is most informative to this beginning diys i was won over by the explanations descriptions of chemistries msdss  suggested usages and personal responsiveness of the owner and his wife i did a calculation of prices per ounce approximating the match of the different brands products i realize that there is no way i can say im comparing the same chemistry of different brands nevertheless

hello paul i own a  hunter legend  sailboat i bought the boat in the fall of  and had the hull below the waterline was sandblasted in the spring of  the hull was then coated by the boat yard with a vctar coal tar epoxy at great expense by the fall of  barely  months later the hull started showing signs of osmosis again below the waterline this was likely due to the very thin coat of coal tar applied by the boat yard in the spring of  i proceeded to sand off the vctar from the entire hull and applied five coats your coal tar expoxy once dry i applied a hard antifouling paint the coal tar has held up beautifully and is still in good condition after  years the osmosis has not resurfaced indicating that the coal tar is doing its job as a barrier coat my only disappointment is that the curing time can be lengthy and if you apply antifouling paint over the coal tar before it is fully cured the paint will craze that said i have since sanded the antifouling paint off and subsequent paint coatings hold up well on the rougher surface regards fulvio   cm  a top quality solvent based epoxy paint with extremely long pot life and plenty of flex unlike most brittle epoxy paints used as

mcu and lpu urethanes lets talk      or email   a commercial  industrial  professional  product you wont find this product or products like it in a general purpose mass market consumer diy box store or flashy marketing company website   aluthane tn  bathtub   what is an mcu coating    mcu stands for moisture cured urethane and makes a very superior high performance  coating these are a unique type of coating much better known in commercial industrial painting circles than within the general public market  most mcu coatings use tiny aluminum flake as pigment which gives them their classic silverygray color and enhances their remarkable properties mcu contain lots of solvents which aids in penetrating tiny cracks and crevices the coating scavenges moisture from its contact surfaces and the air and undergoes an crosslinking molecular process which grips or grabs onto surfaces for outstanding adhesion even with poorly prepared surfaces removing internal surface moisture removes one of the key components necessary for rust development the resulting dry surface aided by the stacking aluminum pigment platelets provides a physical barrier to air and oxygen another necessary component for rust to form  the result is a thin hard coating that seals our air water salts minerals etc  essentially encapsulating the surface  it therefore is one of the best easy to apply rust and corrosion control coatings its amazing adhesion results in a versatile coating well suited for use on steel aluminum concrete fiberglass wood etc it can be used as a primersealer a middle coat or a exposed as a topcoat the aluminum pigmented versions have no uv issues can be applied at low temperatures and operate at temperatures of up to about  degrees f besides being used as a rust stopper is also has applications on  boats roofing and flooring applications in is used a lot in the industrial automotive marine and farm marketplaces the auto restoration market is one place these coatings are widely promoted within the diy home marketplace     many aircraft paint systems use finely powdered aluminum as a blocker and this is a proven technology the paint must stick well to dacron retain good flexibility for many years and generally be a tough coating it should seal the fabric reducing any airflow air leakage to a minimum  in my experience aluthane meets these requirements aluthane wets out on dacron beautifully it penetrates and seals too i made up a  x  test panel and stretched  oz aviation fabric at f i had aluthane on a dacron outdoor test panel for five years it was still in good condition after five years and continued to adhere well i flew an airplane for four years with the aluthane topcoated with polyfiber bahama blue both the aluthane and the topcoat remained flexible aluthane also appears to stick like crazy to both aluminum and fiberglass email   hi paul we have been using the aluthane product for  years now and it has been a blessing for our business

extend the life of the piles and the overall structure since the boathouse cost roughly k to build aluthane was recommended at the time the water was down around three feet from normal pool so i was able to paint roughly  feet of the piling that was exposed for prep i used a simple paint scraper to smooth off the rough loose rust and then a wire brush i did not put a lot of effort into preparation total prep time per piling was no more than  minutes i used a  roller and rolled the aluthane on again very simple and quick the aluthane will run so you do have to roll it on and smooth any runs with another quick roll over the results looked great basically a shiny aluminum look when the lake came back up to pool i kept watch for any signs of deterioration and saw none  months after application the water went back down even further in the last few months so i was able to inspect much closer and even apply the aluthane further down the pilings there was absolutely no rust through with  months of submersion the aluthane surpassed all expectations and i now am in a wait and see mode on how long it will last before corrosionno signs yet i know its not advertised for submerged applications but i can attest that it works very well for at a minimum of one year in fresh water applications excellent product that requires very little prep and seems to be very effective   visit the aluthane tm page  hello i have used aluthane to coat machinery and think it’s a marvelous product i use your aluthane as a sealer for fabriccovered airplanes we use dacron and aulthane wets out beautifully on dacron it also fills the weave another desirable characteristic the aluminum pigment protects the dacron from the sunotherwise dacron deteriorates rapidly i have seven years experience with aluthane and it is doing a very good job now i am top coating with acrylic latex paint and thus far i have a good results  jp  paul just thought id let you know used aluthane on bottom of a  fiberglass epoxy hull repair on my high speed powerboat tunnel cat left it on a mooring in maine  for about a total of  months  times for   week stretches since last may paint is still perfect  submerged  weeks at a time  dave  from the iboatcom forum   i have nothing to do with this company but i tried their aluthane primer and it is great this stuff works even better than they claim it does i first tried it on a vinyl top of a old pontiac bonneville w engine that was mechanically sound but the top leaked like a sieve due to rust under the vinyl the options were fiberglass the top to seal the vinyl or paint over it i tried aluthane it worked it water proofed it with two coats and even looks  decent now i have a high speed tow vehicle that ride four in comfort and pull my  foot cc i have also used aluthane on boat trailers and the floor on my small aluminum row boat as i said it is even better than they claim it is   aluthane    aluminum mcu moisture cured urethane super coating paul  just wanted to let you know how well aluthane works as a coating for a boat anchor we have a  foot defever trawler with a  supermax anchor that dates to the late s when they were first produced over the years and a lot of anchoring in various types of bottoms the galvanized coating on the anchor had deteriorated to being almost nonexistent and the underlying steel was starting to rust lightly its almost impossible around here east coast of florida to get anything regalvanized so looked for alternatives aluthane jumped out at me as a good choice for a test before we departed on our latest  mile cruise from florida to maine and return i painted the supermax with two coats of aluthane after brushing off all the rust i could and coating it with ospho prior to the application of aluthane five months lots of rain and ocean spray and  nights at anchor in various types of bottoms from sand and gravel and rock to mud the aluthane had worn off at only the very tips of the anchor the area that digs into the bottom and exposed the underlying steel the vast majority of the surface area of the anchor was still being protected by the aluthane i just finished adding two more coats

to give feedback on products or services but i must comment on the water gard  product i purchased a home  years ago with a fiberglass pool and  years ago it started to significantly chip long story short after significant analysis from multiple experts it turns out that the pool had ruptured and was repaired unfortunately the repair person applied the fiberglass topcoat incorrectly and it is all coming off luckily the pool is structurally sound just very ugly to look at estimates to fix it range from  to  and no one would guarantee that the entire pool would not collapse after draining the water which would require an entire replacement   after a year of searching and countless attempts at other solutions i came across your product this product is amazing i still cant believe its even possible to apply a paint sorry epoxy underwater i used a  foot extension pole with a roller to apply the paintepoxy the most time consuming part was mixing parts a and b together i purchased the

draining a pool with  gallons during the summer is bad enough but fixing the plaster that had been rubbed down to the gunnite is very expensive i needed a quick fix and there did not seem to be one well i was wrong i discovered a man named paul oman at epoxyproductscom on the internet when i searched for plaster underwater repair and to my amazement he told me about an epoxy that you mix in a

would certainly have had to spend to repair the side of my pool once last thing paul sent me the white at my request i mixed a light blue paint from a hobby store and my pool looks great this product is perfect and it is for real do yourself a favor and don’t listen to the pool guys they want your business and that adds up to big bucks thanks again paul for helping me solve this problem  tr amazing water gard   epoxy is mentioned in the paint section above and here in the underwater coatings too our kevlar tm reinforced epoxy paint see above corro coat fc  a also belongs here too in the apply underwater epoxy section hi paul this is dave from san angelo tx as i told you before the underwater applied epoxy worked great i recommend you send your product info to all pool companies and pool supply retailers or if you can find out who has fiberglass pools and send them info if they ever need it thanks    thanks much for the newsletter the epoxy products i bought performed perfectly by bonding to the frp pool what a unique and pleasant experience it was working with you and your company   lance  dear paul  just wanted to let you know that the white water guard  i purchased to repair my fiberglass swimming pool  underwater worked great just what i was looking for the product covered more area than i expected but i may be ordering more did test spots on shallow area and steps and it looks like it did  years ago going to tackle the deep area next tested using a brush and a roller the paint brush worked a little better for me thank you so much i will share with others   helen from la all i can say is thank you i have a small fiberglass inground pool with visible bare spots with the cost of repainting estimates of  and risk of the pool popping out of the ground if it was emptied to be repainted i looked for alternatives and found you used the water gard  you sent i followed your advice and the instructions provided there were  or  bare spots one was about  feet long and down to the fiberglass very ugly the epoxy you recommended for the job was so easy to use saving me money thank you so much virginia  key west      order this product by calling  anytime or

pebble deck      or email   pebble stone decks need recoating every    years sooner if you hired a contractor to do it and they cut all sorts of corners to maximize their profits  the reason why a majority of people reseal their stone decks themselves  if you see loose pebbles and stones you are past the time you should have resealed the deck with new epoxy you can still repair a few loose stones and reseal everything but do not delay much longer lose enough stones the then entire deck will need to be removed and replaced click here epoxy stone pebble decks order this product by calling  anytime or order online using this link epoxy now    just finished using your no blush epoxy on our stonepebble pool deck used four  gallon kits for about  sq feet the rollers you sell for this are the way to go i used  for this job and should have ordered a th to be safe power mixed  gallons at a time and used an oversized paint roller an gallon and a standard size one with  people we were done in  hours the weather was overcast and  degrees and had not trouble at all looks great and hope to get  or  years out of it here in ohio the stone was laid  years ago and am interested to see the comparison great product kevin d four years later kevin did another diy recoat  here are his most recent comments  wanted to let you know how pleased we are with the no blush summer version just finished doing our pebble pool deck and it came out great the summer version gave us more time to roll on the product and not feel rushed i highly recommend the split rollers our deck is around  sq ft  we used  of the  gallon kits and  of the split rollers the split rollers worked great just make sure that you keep them wet and dont over roll the stone so that the roller has little to no epoxy on it it took us around  hours including power blowing the deck surface the temperature was around  really a simple project if you plan ahead used a  gallon plastic bucket to mix the batch using a battery powered drill and mixing device attached cleanup was easy we used old plastic bags to take the roller off and dispose of them by the way the quotes to do our deck  sq ft ranged between  to  also they all were using standard rollers for epoxy and not the foam split rollers you sell the amount of epoxy used by the contractors to recoat was only  to  gallons versus the four of the  gallon kits you sell people need to be sure if they have it done there is enough epoxy being used by the contractors to settle into the gaps with the stone to get a good sealing  proof of a happy repeat

cheap noname clear epoxy you will probably regret it more info comes in regular slow summer cure or fast winter cure the little bit of flex formulated into basic no blush epoxy tm makes a big difference in outdoormarineall weather applications   epoxies because of their chemistry are hard and brittle they will crack or even shatter into lots of pieces with any sort of impact you may have seen epoxy tabletops and surfaces with millions of tiny cracks throughout the epoxy brittleness is an important property of epoxies that few vendors ever bring up when and if problems associated with brittleness occurs it is well past the time to blame the epoxy vendor for this unadvertised negative property look for honest vendors that mention brittleness issues on their website brittlenessflex issues is one of the most important reasons for not buying your epoxy from an epoxy repackager even if they have cheaper prices repackagers simply buy drums of raw resin and drums of raw curing agents from the big chemical companies and pour it out into smaller jugs for resale epoxy formulators who use the raw chemicals but then add or modify or formulate those chemicals for better user properties can add flex agents to their epoxies to reduce brittleness our basic no blush epoxy is a good example about  years ago we decided the epoxy was too brittle so we changed the formulation to add some extra flex and reduce brittleness for several years we called this new formulation basic no blush two we then dropped the two and went back to calling it simply basic no blush epoxy once again note that even the no blush term shows this epoxy uses more expensive chemicals that do not blush during curing which can leave behind a waxy film in cool and damp environments most epoxy vendors sell the cheaper epoxies that do blush in summary epoxy repackagers cannot modify their epoxies to reduce brittleness only epoxy formulators can adjust the epoxy chemistry to reduce brittleness that said not all of them do one of the major marine epoxy vendors is know to have a very brittle product   why basic no blush epoxy is the best in its class  a formulated blended resin system not repackaged raw chemicals  uses non blushing curing agent for blush free results  not too thick not too thin not too brittle  the only marine epoxy with bubble breakers for superior flaw free finishes  the only epoxy

primary applications  applied over a thick or thin layer of epoxy used on table tops and bar tops vanish provides necessary uv protection that all epoxies need as well as a wear surface that can be polished to a mirror finish  varnish is used on natural wood finishes on boats again generally over epoxy such as in stitch  and  glue  or wood strip construction  but sometimes directly on the wood if you using our basic no blush marine  epoxy why not be sure to wash off and remove any amine blush that might have formed on the surface of the epoxy before you varnish it note that spar varnish is a solvent based coating that has been time tested for over a century on boats out in the sun and weather  you wont find any modern polyurethanes  on these boats keep the urethanes for indoor use  better still use india spar varnish on inside applications too  use india spar varnish over naturally finished wood floors usually over an epoxy primer  esp  or thicker epoxy like low v epoxy  used on

a small order thanks again for all you help and patience  lee dec  from doug the following is my opinion of a good company my affiliation is as a diy end user no recompense no funny business ive been refurbishing our  ketch and have done some epoxy work in that process ive never worked with epoxy before this i talked to several local glass workers and researched on line to learn a bit about epoxy i searched for different vendors and their prices i settled on a place in new hampshire called progressive epoxy polymers httpwwwepoxyproductscommainhtml my first thought was what a mess of a web site i found it very confusing since i first came upon it there have been improvements made to make it more user friendly aside from that the site is most informative to this beginning diyr i was won over by the explanations descriptions of chemistries msdss  suggested usages and personal responsiveness of the owner and his wife i did a calculation of prices per ounce approximating the match of the different brands products i realize that there is no way i can say im comparing the same chemistry of different brands nevertheless progressive epoxy prices remain the best i have found ive used the premium no blush  gallons lowv  gal a putty with kevlar and some elastomeric stuff in addition ive used the fumed silica micro balloons ezthick chopped glass  milled glass progressive epoxy polymers is my epoxy resin source i recommend them subject re hello i have an epoxycoating question date tue  feb   from justin justin wrote thanks a bunch i almost gathered that from your site but wanted a knowledgeable second opinion thank you again for the timely response quite possibly the fastest response to any question i have posed online ever bravo to frog pond hollow and the epoxy king paul oman thank you i will buy these products and give it a go id also like to say i appreciate the willingness to suggest a product even though it might not work i cant tell you how many times ive had to feed somebody im asking a question a perfect disclaimer or had to word the question just exactly right to get an answer that falls anywhere out of bounds of the official product offering probably seemed like nothing but you just showed me that your company is smart probably well managed forward thinking on the ball and willing to adapt in an instant to a customer request i have no idea how big you are but i would imagine you have a long growing and prosperous future before you thank you justin subject re epoxy and leaks date fri  jan   from terry terryaaaaacom to pomanixnetcomcom thanks paul i
