issue subscribe let’s make dallas even better the player in his offhours pipeline mogul kelcy warren is interested in music and golf as he demonstrated here at dallas klyde warren park which he helped fund how kelcy warren stays ahead of the curve as the industry evolves energy transfer pursues diverse acquisitions and new growth projects by jennifer warren published in d ceo october  sms kelcy warren’s yearold energy transfer once a small natural gas pipeline operation now includes one of the nation’s most significant portfolios of energy assets at its heart warren’s master limited partnerships or mlps own more than  miles of pipeline transporting crude oil natural gas and rich natural gas liquids the industry’s recent shift in focus to drilling for crude oil rather than gas has created even more opportunity for the enterprise then again gladewater texasborn warren the company’s yearold chairman and ceo seems to have a knack for being on the right side of a trend energy transfer which includes the  billion market cap energy transfer partners lp and the  billion energy transfer equity lp now holds positions in or around most of the country’s major oil and gas plays these include “oily” plays like texas’ eagle ford shale and permian basin and the bakken shale in north dakota as well as the marcellus and utica shales in the northeast where natural gas production still dominates now energy transfer is aggressively redrawing its map of pipelines and services with recent acquisitions in the shaleoil sector and new plans to export liquefied natural gas we began our conversation with warren by asking about the evolution from natural gas to oil production specifically we wondered how far the industry’s “midstream” ie the oil and gas processing storing transporting and marketing sector had lagged behind changes in the “upstream” the exploration and production component kelcy warren two things occurred including one that’s not talked about anymore but remains important when natural gas is produced natural gas liquids are involved for as long as memory serves the price of natural gas liquids had trended slightly above dry natural gas and that’s called the “frac spread” but then about  to  years ago there was a shift as natural gas liquids began to track crude oil prices a decoupling occurred that the industry thought was temporary but a year decoupling is not temporary that’s a trend it took some of us a while to recognize that this was not just a typical energy business cycle but that this was the new normal we had been a natural gasfocused company that changed just a few years ago as we became confident in the movement of heavier hydrocarbons this business is truly going to be a good margin business for a long time   d ceo do you see the current trend holding steady for a whilekw i do none of us knows what the price of crude is going to be in the long term and that’s very very important if crude falls to  a barrel god help us the party has changed what could make that occur i don’t know i don’t see any fundamentals that concern me at present  d ceo energy transfer is now one of the largest distributors of hydrocarbons in the country did you ever expect to achieve so much so quicklykw no it’s funny when you wake up every day and do one thing the best you can during your whole career then that equation kind of solves itself right i am proud of the success we have had over the last  to  years and of what we have become the finest hydrocarbon transportation company in the united states  d ceo your revenue from transporting crude and refined products—as opposed to natural gas—increased from zero in  to  percent in  in the coming years what proportion of revenue do you expect these segments to contribute to your overall revenue kw within two years i would like to see it be  we will still be growing the natural gas business dramatically so it’s not from a lack of focus on the gas side but rather that crude opportunities are greater for us than gas opportunities we will be adding to the gas business incrementally as well as adding more crude opportunities d ceo your crude conversion project also known as the eastern gulf crude access pipeline is the first direct crude oil pipeline to the east coast refinery market from the midwest what need does it solve for midwest productionkw the keystone xl project that gained national attention bringing canadian crude oil via a canadian company through the us no matter the politics was dead on arrival editor’s note at press time us government review of the keystone xl oil pipeline had been extended indefinitely at least until after the november election our crudeconversion project is unique and it accomplishes the same thing it utilizes an existing good quality pipeline that has been in natural gas service and converts it for crude oil transportation it has minimal impact on the environment and landowners this repurposing of an existing asset versus building a new one is a much better utilization d ceo your  acquisition of trunkline lng co a liquefied natural gas import and regasification facility in lake charles louisiana gives you the ability to export liquefied natural gas by around  what kind of role do you expect lng to play at energy transfer kw big it’s a game changer for our whole industry up to now we have only been allowed to export natural gas to canada and mexico lng export was otherwise not allowed so import facilities like lake charles were built for exporting to make sense new lng facilities must be built  there will be at least three facilities built on the gulf coast and probably more like five to seven eventually this adds tremendous growth to the natural gas business however if gas rises above mmbtu lng will not be exported from the united states it will be exported from argentina africa trinidad or qatar billions of dollars of installed infrastructure could become idle i do not believe that will occur though we are so blessed with a ridiculously abundant amount of hydrocarbons in the us i believe this will become a big part of our business—transporting gas from all over the country liquefying it and then putting it on ships primarily bound for asia d ceo your plans at lake charles call for an  billion expansion of the existing facility so it seems that you’ll really be invested in lngkw often overlooked in lng export is that the gas has to be transported to the lng facility itself we will provide that service and upgrade pipelines in order to do so these pipelines were built orginally to take gas from the south to the northeast consumption area but the northeast is now being supplied by the marcellus and utica shale plays so we are going to reverse the flow of gas in the us particularly in our pipeline systems and transport it to this funnel point of lake charles that’s a big deal for us it will create more volume at energy transfer which translates into more profit d ceo along the same lines your mariner south pipeline project will help create a “worldclass” lpg or liquefied petroleum gas exportimport operation on the texas gulf coast why is this project important for your companykw in our business we transport a product that tends to become glutted from time to time in the pipeline business when supply and demand are balanced then you do not do really well but when they are out of balance that creates basis or a spread related to prices with exporting product from the us we have increased the market and demand a wonderful thing for the industry and for energy transfer this is just our first step in … the export of product which we intend to expand d ceo besides oil and natural gas the eagle ford play in south texas produces a considerable amount of condensates or “rich liquids” how is energy transfer leveraging this growth kw we remind ourselves every day at energy transfer like a mantra that we are service providers you’d better supply the services your customers are asking for if you don’t then you will lose their business energy transfer was not previously in the condensate transportation and stabilization business or in natural gas liquids which are necessities in the eagle ford we now provide all those services gathering the rich gas separating the condensate and transporting it we take the rich natural gas to the cryogenic processing facility which fractionates the hydrocarbon streams and sells them to gulf coast markets we did not offer those services until the latter part of  d ceo how is energy transfer positioning itself to accommodate growth in shale oil production in the permian basin in west texas and other similar plays kw once again we realized we were not providing the services that our customers required we could transport their natural gas to as many places as it needed to go—and we did it extremely well they told us however ‘we also have liquids and crude oil’ and we did not have a solution so as a partnership we scrambled to get into those businesses we have been building facilities moving into new business segments and acquiring companies in those businesses our acquisition of sunoco inc in  is one of the greatest examples of these efforts our competitors may say that they can provide better services than us but i’ll challenge them we cover the entire spectrum of services for the ep firms active in the permian we can do it better be more responsive and less costly than anybody today about  percent of all barnett shale production runs through our pipelines that’s big we are not quite there on the permian but we plan to be  d ceo how big an opportunity does the permian play in your future kw in my view there isn’t a bigger opportunity than exists in the permian for us the permian is unique compared to the marcellus and utica shales which are close to their consumption markets the permian is driven by oil with oil comes associated natural gas and with associated natural gas comes natural gas liquids all of those products require transportation the dog as opposed to the tail is crude oil and the services required from that category unlike with the utica which is natural gasoriented driven by economics  d ceo the permian is a big dog to extend your metaphor is the bakken shale that same kind of opportunity for youkw it is crudedriven it’s not as large but the bakken is the real deal we are building a pipeline to the bakken it is an enormous and ambitious project but the permian is massive and includes other hydrocarbon reservoirs  d ceo from  to  your midstream revenue was less than  billion with your various acquisitions by the second half of  midstream revenue was approaching  billion showing stellar growth what’s your strategy to expand revenue capabilities in existing segments or through more acquisitions kw excellent question yes we are going to grow that business aggressively regarding acquisitions when you become the size we are an organic strategy is not a good strategy you need to have a shot of immediate cash flow from time to time your unit holders expect to see consistent distribution increases say you and i make a deal to build a pipeline it could take  months before your gas liquids or oil begin to flow but if i acquire a firm in that month window then i have immediate cash flow acquisitions are more expensive organic growth is more accretive but the correct mix of that is necessary if you are going to run a master limited partnership correctly d ceo what’s the rationale for having so many mlp structures within energy transfer kw a wildly misunderstood concept about an mlp is that it does indeed have a taxation advantage when you purchase units—not shares—you are a unit holder or a partner when we make a profit we distribute it to you and then you owe your taxes if we do our jobs correctly making the right investments your taxes will be minimal—until you ultimately sell your units c corporations are inefficient because of the double taxation at both the corporate and individual’s dividend level with an mlp you have to push all of your earnings out the door that is a tough way to live be careful what you wish for in being an mlp there are only a few types of firms providing infrastructure where this organizational form makes sense mathematically we happen to be in that sweet spot we were criticized for having an overly overcomplicated structure but complexity is okay if your unit holders are receiving greater distribution growth while we recognized that simplification and consolidation were what the markets wanted the tradeoff is less distribution growth we are a family of mlps of varying levels of growth and maturities and this is a much better way to serve the unit holders than a consolidated monster that has minimal growth potential d ceo in a may earnings call energy transfer talked about moving natural gas from the north to the southern states with the gulf coast being the “fastestgrowing market in the world” can you elaborate on that kw given the lng facilities already approved by the energy department which includes our facility and more coming together with the petrochemical business expansions on the gulf coast additional natural gas demand could easily be  billion cubic feet per day on the gulf that coupled with oversupply from the northeast is a pipeliner’s dream you have to repurpose assets from south to north—in ways they were previously not built for—to north to south that sounds like a problem but it really is an opportunity d ceo are you one of the main players repurposing infrastructure to reverse the flow kw we are there is also kinder morgan a very good company and others there are only a few big players that can play in that space though d ceo energy transfer recently announced plans to acquire the retail unit susser holdings for  billion this adds to the previously mentioned  billion acquisition of sunoco which gave you  retail gas stations on the east coast why are the “downstream” business and the retail operations so attractive to energy transfer kw with sunoco we wanted the pipeline assets to move crude which is no secret other businesses came with the acquisition including the retail assets and the sunoco brand likewise the susser brand in the form of a publicly traded partnership was a creative way to move the retail business into a separately traded entity which funds its own growth without burdening other unit holders  d ceo is mexico another area of opportunity for your company kw it looks really good we have wonderful infrastructure and pipeline systems along the mexico border—by far the largest in existence in comparison to other competitors when mexico recently changed its constitution it effectively opened the border for natural gas importation this was a better solution than how it was being imported previously there will now be more efficient movement of gas especially from the eagle ford you will see us capitalize on that and build more infrastructure to mexico d ceo turning from oil and gas to your “nonenergy” pursuits for a moment i understand that you have an interest in golf—and that the musician jackson browne inspired your private music label in austin and related activities what’s so important to you about musickw music is enormously important to me it is not a business that takes up my time per se but one in which i have been involved for a long time it has not been financially rewarding like the energy business but we are very proud of what we do think of the things in life that make everything better like a child’s laughter has anyone ever gotten mad about that well maybe if you were in a conversation at the time or something but music especially music like jackson browne’s has a way in just a few verses to tell a large story in music everyone can have different tastes if it resonates with you and means something to you then it is good d ceo besides your various music activities and the communityservice endowments you’ve given dallas—the contribution funding klyde warren park for example—are there any other endeavors that you’ve yet to pursuekw we are involved in many activities with klyde warren park we chose to be overt for certain reasons normally we prefer covert giving most of our focus is on children’s charities but we have been doing some landmark preservation projects we are proud of what we do and we will continue to do it  d ceo as a ceo what has changed over the last decade in how you view managing and growing energy transferkw we were a small group of guys that had a dream—doing something we thought we did well we grew from  people in  to about  i reminisce about the old days today we are very successful financially but we are the same guys who were struggling to lay five miles of eightinch pipe we have learned many lessons in  the market turned on us and we did not have a friend everyone loves you when the party is at your house but you can get turned on we are going to do things our way and continue to show growth to our unit holders and we are going to be the very best pipeline company in the world we will be we are close to that now but we will be a primary way to make money throughout most of my career was to build something and sell it to a big player for a payday with mlps you build these businesses for the long haul—for generations    business most popular why dallas keeps getting uglier by peter simek dos jefes in uptown is closed by catherine downes

cookie statement mobile view kelcy warren takes over at reco  roatanbruces weblog roatanbruce’s weblog just another wordpresscom weblog « my first super bowl roatan helping haiti – concert under the stars » kelcy warren takes over at reco introducing kelcy warren – the new majority shareholder of reco by bruce starr   after several difficult months for both kelcy warren and the people dependant on electricity provided by reco roatan electric company the enee honduran national electric company intervention was finally lifted and kelcy warren is now formally the undisputed major stockholder of reco he has a lot of responsibility ahead to do his best for tens of thousands of people who have had little dependable power in the last year i believe he is the right man for the job having purchased an island just east of roatan he has made a major investment in the area i look forward to seeing the progress in making reco one of the finest electrical and power supply companies in the caribbean   kelcy warren came to the studio during his first trip to roatan as the new owner   roatan bruce  i would like to officially welcome you kelcy warren the new majority stockholder of reco tell us a little about you i know my listeners would like to get to know you better   kelcy warren i grew up in texas and got my college education in texas i have been in the energy business my entire career i run a company called energy transfer partners it is a fortune  company it is one of the largest companies in america we distribute natural gas and propane across the united states  it’s been a very successful company   i have a son his name is clyde he is probably the thing i am most proud of in my life he is only five years old he loves it here i fell in love with the bay islands awhile back and made an investment here i tried to just blend into the scenery but my nature did not allow me to do that for very long as is evidenced by my participation in reco   roatan bruce  what are some of your plans to get reco back in good working order in the short run mid term and long term   kelcy warren with roatan growing at the rate it is growing you can’t run this business correctly without access to capital without it it will ultimately fail as it did this is not a complicated solution it is very straightforward we generate power here we distribute it and we sell it to consumers hopefully the sales price exceeds the cost to do those things if they don’t you are running a failed business i am going to do everything in my power to correct that   so what do we do it starts with competent management matthew harper is a friend of mine matthew has accepted the roll of interim manager of reco for  days he has done work for me elsewhere i have great confidence in him i also have italo tugliani my legal counsel and advisor i have incredible confidence in him he has been a great friend and advisor  these gentlemen have helped steer me through the decisions i need to make it is my job to fund those decisions that we make and fund them in a timely fashion and correctly   we then start with an infusion of capital there will be some quick fixes that aren’t the most cost efficient fixes we are right now working on the generators even though i don’t officially own reco yet i have funded a great deal of the cash to support fuel purchases and equipment restoration that is ongoing   we have bought in rental units i don’t like that we don’t need to be renting units here at reco but right now we don’t have a choice on the short term   that will get us through the first three months i want everyone to know that consumes power on roatan that this thing is really broke it is really messed up please don’t expect an over night turnaround but i will tell you that i think you will not get a faster turnaround from anyone else i have committed to spending the correct amount of dollars to fix this i have committed to putting the correct kinds of people here to run it these people care about roatan they care about the future they care about the people  we are going to provide power to roatan   now let’s talk about the future this will be tens of millions of dollars later and unfortunately a few years down the road we are going to have a power plant that will be capable of handling a huge amount of growth that i anticipate will be coming to roatan roatan is going to be a massive tourist attraction for years to come but only if it has the correct infrastructure to draw in that economy   roatan bruce  can you give us an idea as to what preferences you see in alternative energies   kelcy warren we have to switch from diesel diesel is not the answer there are cheaper hydrocarbons that we will be switching over to there are heavier residual fuels and they can burn clean going into the future renewable energies is something i really like it is very costly wind power is very costly but there is a good source of wind here on roatan i would love to see us exploit that a more short term fix is to switch over to residual fuel oil and then switch over to a different type of fossil fuel such as possibly coal coal has a bad rap but i assure you that coal is much less pollutive that what you are using now much less you can put in clean burning plants     one thing the island needs to consider is anyone who knows anything about the island knows that trash is eventually going to be a huge issue ultimately that is going to be a huge problem there are generators that can in fact burn trash and use the “btu’s” generated from those combustible fuels to generate power that will require cooperation from the government to do a type of sorting from the combustibles from the noncombustibles and delivering those to the power plant i have a dream that that might be a possibility down the line there are power plants that i can purchase that can burn those types of fuels   roatan bruce  thank you for taking on this task   kelcy warren i want everyone to know that i do exist and that i am a normal person and i would to continue to enjoy my relationship with the people of the bay islands   bruce starr is the host

to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump
