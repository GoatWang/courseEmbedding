strategic planning « tm strategic advisors llc strategic planning strategic planning is a critical aspect of any business planning process  a great strategic plan provides an organization’s employees with both “true north” guidance but also provides very specific guidance on tactical decisions  as important as the strategic plan is we also recognize that the process of its development is as important as the result  nothing can replace the power of having the organization’s team members deeply involved in the plan’s development  we always emphasize significant engagement with a wide range of organizational stakeholders every strategic planning exercise is carefully crafted to the client organization’s needs  an illustrative approach is included here situational assessment – a series of interviews with internal and external stakeholders are conducted to build an accurate and independent view of the organization  a swot strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats analysis is an effective way to summarize this information  clients often find the output of this first step to be immensely valuable on its own it can provide a shared assessment of the organization with that might not have been communicated broadly in the past  an independent environmentalmarket assessment is also often conducted at this stage identification and evaluation of strategic opportunities – most companies have a number of potential opportunities facing them  an important – and usually exciting aspect – of strategic planning is working with stakeholders to identify them  in addition our depth of expertise in the healthcare industry allows us efficiently provide a detailed analysis of these opportunities strategic decisions – strategic planning is all about making decisions and tradeoffs  through a rigorous combination of independent analysis and facilitated meetings with client stakeholders we enable rapidly arriving at these decisions while maximizing buyin from multiple stakeholders strategic plan presentation– writing a great strategic plan is hard work but we can help  it is important that the leadership team is deeply involved in its development but an experienced advisor like tm strategic can make the process much more efficient the strategic plan itself and a summary presentation will typically address topics including future vision of success of the organization key
