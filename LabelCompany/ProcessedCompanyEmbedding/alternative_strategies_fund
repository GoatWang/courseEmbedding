traditional securities the values of commodities and commoditylinked investments are affected by events that might have less impact on the values of stocks and bonds investments linked to the prices of commodities are considered speculative prices of commodities and related contracts may fluctuate significantly over short periods for a variety of factorsderivatives risk a small investment in derivatives could have a potentially large impact on the funds performance the use of derivatives involves risks different from or possibly greater than the risks associated with investing directly in the underlying assets derivatives can be highly volatile illiquid and difficult to valueequity risk equity funds are subject generally to market market sector market liquidity issuer and investment style risks among other factors to varying degrees all of which are more fully described in the funds prospectusforeign currency risk investments in foreign currencies are subject to the risk that those currencies will decline in value relative to the us dollar or in the case of hedged positions that the us dollar will decline relative to the currency being hedgedforeign investment risk to the extent the fund invests in foreign securities its performance will be influenced by political social and economic factors affecting investments in foreign companies these special risks include exposure to currency fluctuations less liquidity less developed or less efficient trading markets lack of comprehensive company information political instability and differing auditing and legal standardsleverage risk additionally some derivatives involve economic leverage which could increase the volatility of these investments as they may fluctuate in value more than the underlying instrument certain derivatives have the potential for unlimited loss regardless of the size of the initial investmentreal estate sector risk because the funds investments are concentrated in the securities of companies principally engaged in the real estate sector the value of the funds shares will be affected by factors particular to the real estate sector and may fluctuate more widely than that of a fund which invests in a broader range of industries the securities of issuers that are principally engaged in the real estate sector may be subject to risks similar to those associated with the direct ownership of real estate these include declines in real estate values and defaults by mortgagors or other borrowersshort sales risk may involve substantial risk and leverage short sales expose the fund to the risk that it will be required to buy the security sold short at a time when the security has appreciated in value thus resulting in a loss risk metrics as of   year trailing

subsidiaries “manager research group” in the united states that subsidiary is morningstar research services llc which is registered with and governed by the us securities and exchange commission the manager research group evaluates funds based on five key pillars which are process performance people parent and price the manager research group uses this five pillar evaluation to determine how they believe funds are likely to perform relative to a benchmark or in the case of exchangetraded funds and index mutual funds a relevant peer group over the long term on a riskadjusted basis they consider quantitative and qualitative factors in their research and the weight of each pillar may vary the analyst rating scale is gold silver bronze neutral and negative a morningstar analyst rating of gold

accordingly the risks associated with an investment in the fund include the risks associated with investments in the underlying funds the fund will indirectly pay a proportional share of the fees and expenses of the underlying funds in which it invests there are risks that the fund will vary from its target weightings if any in the underlying funds that the underlying funds will not achieve their investment objectives that the underlying funds’ performance may be lower than their represented asset classes and that the fund may withdraw its investments in an underlying fund at a disadvantageous time allocation risk the fund’s investment performance depends in part on how its assets are allocated among the underlying funds or asset classes the adviser’s evaluations and assumptions regarding the asset classes or the underlying funds in which the fund invests may be incorrect causing the fund to be invested or not invested in one or more asset classes or underlying funds at an inopportune time which could negatively affect the fund’s performance exchangetraded funds risk in addition to the risks associated with the underlying assets held by the exchangetraded fund investments in exchangetraded funds are subject to the following additional risks  an exchangetraded fund’s shares may trade above or below its net asset value  an active trading market for the exchangetraded fund’s shares may not develop or be maintained  trading an exchangetraded fund’s shares may be halted by the listing exchange  a passivelymanaged exchangetraded fund may not track the performance of the reference asset and  a passively managed exchangetraded fund may hold troubled securities investment in exchangetraded funds may involve duplication of management fees and certain other expenses as the fund or an underlying fund indirectly bears its proportionate share of any expenses paid by the exchangetraded funds in which it invests further certain exchangetraded funds in which the fund or an underlying fund may invest are leveraged which may result in economic leverage permitting the fund or an underlying fund to gain exposure that is greater than would be the case in an unlevered instrument and potentially resulting in greater volatility the principal risks of investing in the fund also include the risks of each underlying fund these risks include the following active trading risk active trading of portfolio securities may result in added expenses a lower return and increased tax liability bank loan risk there are a number of risks associated with an investment in bank loans including credit risk interest rate risk liquidity risk and prepayment risk lack of an active trading market restrictions on resale irregular trading activity wide bidask spreads and extended trade settlement periods may impair an underlying fund’s ability to sell bank loans within its desired time frame or at an acceptable price and its ability to accurately value existing and prospective investments extended trade settlement periods may result in cash not being immediately available to an underlying fund as a result an underlying fund may have to sell other investments or engage in borrowing transactions to raise cash to meet its obligations the risk of holding bank loans is also directly tied to the risk of insolvency or bankruptcy of the issuing banks these risks could cause an underlying fund to lose income or principal on a particular investment which in turn could affect the underlying fund’s returns the value of bank loans can be affected by and sensitive to changes in government regulation and to economic downturns in the united states and abroad bank loans generally are floating rate loans which are subject to interest rate risk as the interest paid on the floating rate loans adjusts periodically based on changes in widely accepted reference rates borrowing risk borrowing money to buy securities exposes an underlying fund to leverage and will cause an underlying fund’s share price to be more volatile because leverage will exaggerate the effect of any increase or decrease in the value of an underlying fund’s portfolio securities borrowing money may also require an underlying fund to liquidate positions when it may not be advantageous to do so in addition an underlying fund will incur interest expenses and other fees on borrowed money there can be no assurance that an underlying fund’s borrowing strategy will enhance and not reduce the underlying fund’s returns cashcash equivalents risk in rising markets holding cash or cash equivalents will negatively affect an underlying fund’s performance relative to its benchmark changing fixed income market conditions risk the current low interest rate environment was created in part by the federal reserve board frb and certain foreign central banks keeping the federal funds and equivalent foreign rates at or near zero increases in the federal funds and equivalent foreign rates may expose fixed income markets to heightened volatility and reduced liquidity for certain fixed income investments particularly those with longer maturities in addition decreases in fixed income dealer marketmaking capacity may also potentially lead to heightened volatility and reduced liquidity in the fixed income markets as a result the value of an underlying fund’s investments and share price may decline changes in central bank policies could also result in higher than normal shareholder redemptions which could potentially increase portfolio turnover and an underlying fund’s transaction costs collateralized loan obligations risk clos are subject to the risks of substantial losses due to actual defaults by underlying borrowers which will be greater during periods of economic or financial stress clos may also lose value due to collateral defaults and disappearance of subordinate tranches market anticipation of defaults and investor aversion to clo securities as a class the risks of clos will be greater if an underlying fund invests in clos that hold loans of uncreditworthy borrowers or if an underlying fund holds subordinate tranches of the clo that absorbs losses from the defaults before senior tranches in addition clos are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk commodities tax risk the tax treatment of commoditylinked derivative instruments may be adversely affected by changes in legislation regulations or other legally binding authority if as a result of any such adverse action the income of an underlying fund from certain commoditylinked derivatives was treated as nonqualifying income an underlying fund might fail to qualify as a regulated investment company and be subject to federal income tax at the fund level should the internal revenue service issue guidance or congress enact legislation that adversely affects the tax treatment of an underlying fund’s use of commoditylinked notes or a whollyowned subsidiary which guidance might be applied to the underlying fund retroactively it could among other consequences limit the underlying fund’s ability to pursue its investment strategy commodity risk an underlying fund will concentrate its investments in commodities markets and will therefore have investment exposure to the commodities markets and one or more sectors of the commodities markets which may subject an underlying fund to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities such as stocks and bonds volatility in the commodities markets may be caused by changes in overall market movements domestic and foreign political and economic events and policies war acts of terrorism changes in domestic or foreign interest rates andor investor expectations concerning interest rates domestic and foreign inflation rates investment and trading activities of mutual funds hedge funds and commodities funds and factors such as drought floods weather livestock disease embargoes tariffs and other regulatory developments or supply and demand disruptions because an underlying fund’s performance is linked to the performance of volatile commodities investors should be willing to assume the risks of potentially significant fluctuations in the value of an underlying fund’s shares commoditylinked notes risk in addition to risks associated with the underlying commodities investments in commoditylinked notes may be subject to additional risks such as nonpayment of interest and loss of principal counterparty risk lack of a secondary market and risk of greater volatility than traditional equity and debt securities the value of the commoditylinked notes an underlying fund buys may fluctuate significantly because the values of the underlying investments to which they are linked are themselves volatile additionally certain commoditylinked notes employ “economic” leverage by requiring payment by the issuer of an amount that is a multiple of the price increase or decrease of the underlying commodity commodity index or other economic variable such economic leverage will increase the volatility of the value of these commoditylinked notes and an underlying fund to the extent it invests in such notes convertible securities risk the market values of convertible securities are affected by market interest rates the risk of actual issuer default on interest or principal payments and the value of the underlying common stock into which the convertible security may be converted additionally a convertible security is subject to the same types of market and issuer risks as apply to the underlying common stock in addition certain convertible securities are subject to involuntary conversions and may undergo principal writedowns upon the occurrence of certain triggering events and as a result are subject to an increased risk of loss correlation risk because an underlying fund’s investment strategy seeks to balance risk across the four sectors of the commodities market and within each commodity sector to balance risk across different commodities to the extent either the sectors of the commodities markets or the selected commodities become correlated in a way not anticipated by an underlying fund’s adviser an underlying fund’s risk allocation process may result in magnified risks and loss instead of balancing reducing the risk of loss credit linked notes risk risks of credit linked notes include those risks associated with the underlying reference obligation including but not limited to market risk interest rate risk credit risk default risk and in some cases foreign currency risk an investor in a credit linked note bears counterparty risk or the risk that the issuer of the credit linked note will default or become bankrupt and not make timely payment of principal and interest of the structured security credit linked notes may be less liquid than other investments and therefore harder to dispose of at the desired time and price in addition credit linked notes may be leveraged and as a result small changes in the value of the underlying reference obligation may produce disproportionate losses to an underlying fund debt securities risk the prices of debt securities held by an underlying fund will be affected by changes in interest rates the creditworthiness of the issuer and other factors an increase in prevailing interest rates typically causes the value of existing debt securities to fall and often has a greater impact on longerduration debt securities and higher quality debt securities falling interest rates will cause an underlying fund to reinvest the proceeds of debt securities that have been repaid by the issuer at lower interest rates falling interest rates may also reduce an underlying fund’s distributable income because interest payments on floating rate debt instruments held by an underlying fund will decline an underlying fund could lose money on investments in debt securities if the issuer or borrower fails to meet its obligations to make interest payments andor to repay principal in a timely manner changes in an issuer’s financial strength the market’s perception of such strength or in the credit rating of the issuer or the security may affect the value of debt securities the adviser’s credit analysis may fail to anticipate such changes which could result in buying a debt security at an inopportune time or failing to sell a debt security in advance of a price decline or other credit event defaulted securities risk defaulted securities pose a greater risk that principal will not be repaid than nondefaulted securities defaulted securities and any securities received in an exchange for such securities may be subject to restrictions on resale derivatives risk the value of a derivative instrument depends largely on and is derived from the value of an underlying security currency commodity interest rate index or other asset each referred to as an underlying asset in addition to risks relating to the underlying assets the use of derivatives may include other possibly greater risks including counterparty leverage and liquidity risks counterparty risk is the risk that the counterparty to the derivative contract will default on its obligation to pay the underlying fund the amount owed or otherwise perform under the derivative contract derivatives create leverage risk because they do not require payment up front equal to the economic exposure created by owning the derivative as a result an adverse change in the value of the underlying asset could result in the underlying fund sustaining a loss that is substantially greater than the amount invested in the derivative which may make the underlying fund’s returns more volatile and increase the risk of loss derivative instruments may also be less liquid than more traditional investments and the underlying fund may be unable to sell or close out its derivative positions at a desirable time or price this risk may be more acute under adverse market conditions during which the underlying fund may be most in need of liquidating its derivative positions derivatives may also be harder to value less tax efficient and subject to changing government regulation that could impact the underlying fund’s ability to use certain derivatives or their cost also derivatives used for hedging or to gain or limit exposure to a particular market segment may not provide the expected benefits particularly during adverse market conditions these risks are greater for certain underlying funds than most other mutual funds because certain underlying funds will implement their investment strategy primarily through derivative instruments rather than direct investments in stocksbonds emerging markets securities risk emerging markets also referred to as developing markets are generally subject to greater market volatility political social and economic instability uncertain trading markets and more governmental limitations on foreign investment than more developed markets in addition companies operating in emerging markets may be subject to lower trading volume and greater price fluctuations than companies in more developed markets securities law and the enforcement of systems of taxation in many emerging market countries may change quickly and unpredictably in addition investments in emerging markets securities may also be subject to additional transaction costs delays in settlement procedures and lack of timely information exchangetraded fund industry concentration risk in following its methodology an underlying exchangetraded fund’s underlying index from time to time may be concentrated to a significant degree in securities of issuers located in a single industry or sector to the extent that an underlying fund’s underlying index concentrates in the securities of issuers in a particular industry or sector an underlying fund will also concentrate its investments to approximately the same extent by concentrating its investments in an industry or sector an underlying fund faces more risks than if it were diversified broadly over numerous industries or sectors such industrybased risks any of which may adversely affect the companies in which an underlying fund invests may include but are not limited to the following general economic conditions or cyclical market patterns that could negatively affect supply and demand in a particular industry competition for resources adverse labor relations political or world events obsolescence of technologies and increased competition or new product introductions that may affect the profitability or viability of companies in an industry in addition at times such industry or sector may be out of favor and underperform other industries or the market as a whole exchangetraded notes risk exchangetraded notes are subject to credit risk counterparty risk and the risk that the value of the exchangetraded note may drop due to a downgrade in the issuer’s credit rating the value of an exchangetraded note may also be influenced by time to maturity level of supply and demand for the exchangetraded note volatility and lack of liquidity in the underlying market changes in the applicable interest rates and economic legal political or geographic events that affect the referenced underlying market or assets an underlying fund will bear its proportionate share of any fees and expenses borne by an exchangetraded note in which it invests for certain exchangetraded notes there may be restrictions on an underlying fund’s right to redeem its investment in an exchangetraded note which is meant to be held until maturity financial services sector risk an underlying fund may be susceptible to adverse economic or regulatory occurrences affecting the financial services sector financial services companies are subject to extensive government regulation and are disproportionately affected by unstable interest rates each of which could adversely affect the profitability of such companies financial services companies may also have concentrated portfolios which makes them especially vulnerable to unstable economic conditions foreign government debt risk investments in foreign government debt securities sometimes referred to as sovereign debt securities involve certain risks in addition to those relating to foreign securities or debt securities generally the issuer of the debt or the governmental authorities that control the repayment of the debt may be unable or unwilling to repay principal or interest when due in accordance with the terms of such debt and the fund may have limited recourse in the event of a default against the defaulting government without the approval of debt holders some governmental debtors have in the past been able to reschedule or restructure their debt payments or declare moratoria on payments foreign securities risk an underlying fund’s foreign investments may be adversely affected by political and social instability changes in economic or taxation policies difficulty in enforcing obligations decreased liquidity or increased volatility foreign investments also involve the risk of the possible seizure nationalization or expropriation of the issuer or foreign deposits in which an underlying fund could lose its entire investments in a certain market and the possible adoption of foreign governmental restrictions such as exchange controls unless an underlying fund has hedged its foreign securities risk foreign securities risk also involves the risk of negative foreign currency rate fluctuations which may cause the value of securities denominated in such foreign currency or other instruments through which an underlying fund has exposure to foreign currencies to decline in value currency exchange rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time currency hedging strategies if used are not always successful geographic focus risk an underlying fund may from time to time invest a substantial amount of its assets in securities of issuers located in a single country or a limited number of countries adverse economic political or social conditions in those countries may therefore have a significant negative impact on an underlying fund’s investment performance high yield debt securities junk bond risk investments in high yield debt securities “junk bonds” and other lowerrated securities will subject an underlying fund to substantial risk of loss these securities are considered to be speculative with respect to the issuer’s ability to pay interest and principal when due are more susceptible to default or decline in market value and are less liquid than investment grade debt securities prices of high yield debt securities tend to be very volatile indexing risk an underlying fund is operated as a passively managed index fund and therefore the adverse performance of a particular security necessarily will not result in the elimination of the security from the underlying fund’s portfolio ordinarily the underlying fund’s adviser will not sell the underlying fund’s portfolio securities except to reflect additions or deletions of the securities that comprise the underlying fund’s underlying index or as may be necessary to raise cash to pay underlying fund shareholders who sell underlying fund shares as such the underlying fund will be negatively affected by declines in the securities represented by its underlying index also there is no guarantee that the underlying fund’s adviser will be able to correlate the underlying fund’s performance with that of its underlying index infrastructurerelated companies risk an underlying fund will concentrate its investments in the infrastructure industry infrastructurerelated companies are subject to a variety of risk factors including costs associated with environmental governmental and other regulations high interest costs for capital construction programs high leverage the effects of economic slowdowns surplus capacity increased competition fluctuations of fuel prices the effects of energy conservation policies unfavorable tax laws or accounting policies environmental damage difficulty in raising capital increased susceptibility to terrorist acts or political actions and general changes in market sentiment towards infrastructure assets liquidity risk an underlying fund may be unable to sell illiquid investments at the time or price it desires and as a result could lose its entire investment in such investments liquid securities can become illiquid during periods of market stress if a significant amount of the an underlying fund’s securities become illiquid an underlying fund may not be able to timely pay redemption proceeds and may need to sell securities at significantly reduced prices management risk there is no guarantee that the underlying funds’ portfolio manager’s investment selection process will produce a portfolio effective at achieving the underlying fund’s respective investment objective in addition certain underlying funds’ investment strategies will likely cause the underlying fund to underperform the broader equity markets in which the underlying fund invests during market rallies further the portfolio managers’ use of instruments that provide economic leverage increases the volatility of an underlying fund’s net asset value which increases the potential of greater losses that may cause an underlying fund to liquidate positions when it may not be advantageous to do so market risk the market values of an underlying fund’s investments and therefore the value of an underlying fund’s shares will go up and down sometimes rapidly or unpredictably market risk may affect a single issuer industry or section of the economy or it may affect the market as a whole individual stock prices tend to go up and down more dramatically than those of certain other types of investments such as bonds during a general downturn in the financial markets multiple asset classes may decline in value when markets perform well there can be no assurance that specific investments held by an underlying fund will rise in value market trading risk an underlying exchangetraded fund faces numerous market trading risks including the potential lack of an active market for its shares losses from trading in secondary markets and disruption in the creationredemption process of an underlying fund any of these factors may lead to an underlying fund’s shares trading at a premium or discount to an underlying fund’s net asset value nav mlp risk an underlying fund invests in securities of mlps which are subject to the following risks limited partner risk an mlp is a public limited partnership or limited liability company taxed as a partnership under the code although the characteristics of mlps closely resemble a traditional limited partnership a major difference is that mlps may trade on a public exchange or in the overthecounter market the risks of investing in an mlp are similar to those of investing in a partnership including more flexible governance structures which could result in less protection for investors than investments in a corporation investors in an mlp normally would not be liable for the debts of the mlp beyond the amount that the investor has contributed but investors may not be shielded to the same extent that a shareholder of a corporation would be in certain circumstances creditors of an mlp would have the right to seek return of capital distributed to a limited partner which right would continue after an investor sold its investment in the mlp liquidity risk the ability to trade on a public exchange or in the overthecounter market provides a certain amount of liquidity not found in many limited partnership investments however mlp interests may be less liquid than conventional publicly traded securities and therefore more difficult to trade at desirable times andor prices interest rate risk in addition mlp distributions may be reduced by fees and other expenses incurred by the mlp mlps generally are considered interestrate sensitive investments during periods of interest rate volatility these investments may not provide attractive returns general partner risk the holder of the general partner or managing member interest can be liable in certain circumstances for amounts greater than the amount of the holder’s investment in the general partner or managing member additionally if an underlying fund were to invest more than  of its total assets in mlps that are taxed as partnerships this could cause an underlying fund to lose its status as regulated investment company under subchapter m of the internal revenue code mlp tax risk mlps taxed as partnerships do not pay us federal income tax at the partnership level a change in current tax law or a change in the underlying business mix of a given mlp however could result in an mlp being classified as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes which would have the effect of reducing the amount of cash available for distribution by the mlp and could cause a reduction of the value of an underlying fund’s investment and consequently the fund’s investment in an underlying fund and lower income mortgage and assetbacked securities risk mortgage and assetbacked securities are subject to prepayment or call risk which is the risk that a borrower’s payments may be received earlier or later than expected due to changes in prepayment rates on underlying loans this could result in an underlying fund reinvesting these early payments at lower interest rates thereby reducing an underlying fund ’s income mortgageand assetbacked securities also are subject to extension risk which is the risk that an unexpected rise in interest rates could reduce the rate of prepayments causing the price of the mortgage and assetbacked securities and an underlying fund’s share price to fall an unexpectedly high rate of defaults on the mortgages held by a mortgage pool will adversely affect the value of mortgagebacked securities and will result in losses to an underlying fund an underlying fund may invest in mortgage pools that include subprime mortgages which are loans made to borrowers with weakened credit histories or with lower capacity to make timely payments on their mortgages privately issued mortgagerelated securities are not subject to the same underwriting requirements as those with government or governmentsponsored entity guarantees and therefore mortgage loans underlying privately issued mortgagerelated securities may have less favorable collateral credit risk or other underwriting characteristics and wider variances in interest rate term size purpose and borrower characteristics nondiversification risk an underlying fund is nondiversified and can invest a greater portion of its assets in the obligations or securities of a small number of issuers or any single issuer than a diversified fund can a change in the value of one or a few issuers’ securities will therefore affect the value of an underlying fund more than would occur in a diversified fund preferred securities risk preferred securities are subject to issuerspecific and market risks applicable generally to equity securities preferred securities also may be subordinated to bonds or other debt instruments subjecting them to a greater risk of nonpayment may be less liquid than many other securities such as common stocks and generally offer no voting rights with respect to the issuer reit riskreal estate risk an underlying fund concentrates its investments in the securities of real estate and real estate related companies investments in real estate related instruments may be affected by economic legal cultural environmental or technological factors that affect property values rents or occupancies of real estate related to an underlying fund’s holdings shares of real estate related companies which tend to be small and midcap companies may be more volatile and less liquid than larger companies the value of investments in real estate related companies may be affected by the quality of management the ability to repay loans the utilization of leverage and financial covenants related thereto whether the company carries adequate insurance and environmental factors if a real estate related company defaults on certain types of debt obligations an underlying fund may own real estate directly which involves additional risks such as environmental liabilities difficulty in valuing and selling the real estate and economic or regulatory changes sampling risk an underlying fund’s use of a representative sampling approach will result in its holding a smaller number of securities than are in its underlying index and in the underlying fund holding securities not included in its underlying index as a result an adverse development respecting an issuer of securities held by the underlying fund could result in a greater decline in the underlying fund’s nav than would be the case if all of the securities in its underlying index were held an underlying fund’s use of a representative sampling approach may also include the risk that it may not track the return of its underlying index as well as it would have if the underlying fund held all of the securities in its underlying index sector focus risk an underlying fund may from time to time invest a significant amount of its assets ie over  in one market sector or group of related industries in this event an underlying fund’s performance will depend to a greater extent on the overall condition of the sector or group of industries and there is increased risk that an underlying fund will lose significant value if conditions adversely affect that sector or group of industries short position risk because an underlying fund’s potential loss on a short position arises from increases in the value of the asset sold short the underlying fund will incur a loss on a short position which is theoretically unlimited if the price of the asset sold short increases from the short sale price the counterparty to a short position or other market factors may prevent an underlying fund from closing out a short position at a desirable time or price and may reduce or eliminate any gain or result in a loss in a rising market an underlying fund’s short positions will cause the underlying fund to underperform the overall market and its peers that do not engage in shorting if an underlying fund holds both long and short positions and both positions decline simultaneously the short positions will not provide any buffer hedge from declines in value of the underlying fund’s long positions certain types of short positions involve leverage which may exaggerate any losses potentially more than the actual cost of the investment and will increase the volatility of an underlying fund’s returns small and midcapitalization companies risks small and midcapitalization companies tend to be more vulnerable to changing market conditions may have little or no operating history or track record of success and may have more limited product lines and markets less experienced management and fewer financial resources than larger companies these companies’ securities may be more volatile and less liquid than those of more established companies and their returns may vary sometimes significantly from the overall securities market subsidiary risk by investing in the subsidiary an underlying fund is indirectly exposed to risks associated with the subsidiary’s investments the subsidiary is not registered under the investment company act of  as amended  act and except as otherwise noted in this prospectus is not subject to the investor protections of the  act changes in the laws of the united states andor the cayman islands under which an underlying fund and the subsidiary respectively are organized could result in the inability of an underlying fund andor the subsidiary to operate as described in this prospectus and the sai and could negatively affect an underlying fund and its shareholders us government obligations risk obligations of us government agencies and authorities receive varying levels of support and may not be backed by the full faith and credit of the us government which could affect an underlying fund’s ability to recover should they default no assurance can be given that the us government will provide financial support to its agencies and authorities if it is not obligated by law to do so volatility risk although an underlying fund’s investment strategy targets a specific volatility level certain of an underlying fund’s investments may appreciate or decrease significantly in value over short periods of time this may cause an underlying fund’s net asset value per share to experience significant increases or declines in value over short periods of time as of  lqlax nav change    nas may appear until data is available data is usually updated between  and  pm cst fund
