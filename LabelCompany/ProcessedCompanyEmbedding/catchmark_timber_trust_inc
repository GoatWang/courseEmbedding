the timber reit sector the preliminary duty rates were within expectations however there was no upside surprise in yesterdays announcement relative to our forecast and we believe the preliminary

is the smallest timber reit with a market cap of  million and based on its smaller size the company should grow at a much faster pacectt is positioned to grow at a much more rapid pace since pulpwood is a baseline product and is best positioned for saw timber recoveryi’m initiating a buy but with a disclaimer that this stock is a smallcap reit with limited public operating experienceyesterday i wrote an article announcing my new small cap reit portfolio and i explained my primary objectives  the reits in the portfolio must all be between  million and  billion  they must be deemed safe based upon my thorough analysis the master list for my initial portfolio consists of a growing number of reits but to be inducted into my smallcap portfolio a company must demonstrate that the dividend is safe and management is disciplined in other words im not just looking for that one hit wonder that turns into an overnight success and then fades into the sunset instead im looking to capitalize on unmined gems that are buried below ground that can be polished and eventually shine in order to find these gems one must dig deep in hopes of uncovering stocks that promise the best alpha that means its important to cover a broad spectrum of sectors and subsectors that includes data centers casinos prisons solar farms ordinary farms and tree farms in my upcoming october newsletter i intend to begin covering the timber reits up until now i have not covered this sector but i decided that its time to include this growing sector in my intelligent reit lab as illustrated below the timber sector has a market cap in excess of  billion the timber performance ytd as illustrated below the timber reit sector was one of the worst sectors in  and ytd  rayonier nyseryn has been the worst timber reit this year with a total return of  smallcap reit catchmark timber nysectt has been the worst performer over the last  days and in this article i intend to examine the company in greater detail it appears that ctt could be a smallcap poised to profit and i intend to add the company to my reit lab commencing with this article the history of catchmark in december  ctt completed its public offering of  million shares of class a stock at  per share and raised gross proceeds of around  million following the offering the stock was listed on the nyse under the ticker ctt the companys shares of class b b and b common stock will convert to listed shares of class a common stock in phases previously ctt was a nontraded reit known as wells timberland reit inc sponsored by wells capital inc a whollyowned subsidiary of wells real estate funds inc and advised by wells timberland management organization llc a whollyowned subsidiary of wells capital since listing on the nyse ctt has returned  unlike other timber reit peers ctt was not born out of the industrial reit complex ie paper mills and other forest products but instead the atlantabased company has focused on raw materials only in other words unlike weyerhaeuser nysewy that originated next to the paper mills ctt was formed to own timberland another differentiator for ctt is that the company has opted to focus on highdemand southeastern us markets  the fiber markets  where the company owns around  acres of timberlands as of q ctt owned  fee acres and  leased acres these markets consist of  million tons if merchantable timber with a welldiversified product mix that includes pine  and hardwood  ctts key markets include txla gaal and south ga ctts pipeline for growth is in excess of  million for  and includes key southeastern markets the pine belt where the company targets deal sizes of  acres ctt focuses on the micro markets as identified below that offer favorable current and longterm supply and demand fundamentals these attractive markets provide robust pulpwood and dimensional lumber opportunities ctt has acquired approximately  acres since listing shares expanding its holdings by around  which will increase sustainable harvest volumes improve product mix and enhance longterm earnings in waycrosspanola ctt purchased around  acres for around  million in oglethorpesatilla river ctt purchased around  acres at a cost of  million in beauregard ctt purchased around  acres at a cost of  million the timber growth reit as noted above ctt is the smallest timber reit with a market cap of  million and based on its smaller size the company should grow at a much faster pace timberland transaction volume totaled over  billion between  and  and the majority was acquired by timos this indicates that there will be significant ma growth as timos look to monetize by pension funds and endowments over the next  to  years this chart provides valuable visibility as it relates to the pipeline for growth ctts recent acquisitions exhibit strong productivity traits which enhance its overall portfolio productivity this chart illustrates the tonsacreyear and volume per acre for each reit  on the left  and ctts latest transactions  on the right the next chart illustrates how ctts harvest production can yield increased cash flow particularly when timber prices recover the  primary drivers for timber are  volume  mix of product and  price as the previous chart above illustrates ctt has demonstrated its capital proficiency as it generates  more production than the peer group the chart below illustrates the volume differential in the second quarter ctt purchased  acres of prime timberlands in two separate transactions for  million that brings the total acquisitions for the year through june  to  acres paying out  million in five separate transactions the purchases have added  tons for the companys merchantable inventory comprising  pine plantations by acreage and  saw timber by tons since the ipo ctt has grown acreage by  in terms of ctts balance sheet i find the capitalization to be sound assets of  million and total debt of  million with a total debt to total capitalization of  in december ctt refinanced its existing credit facilities through a syndicate led by cobank acb increasing its total credit availability to  million from  million the new debt facilities include a  million fiveyear revolving line of credit a  million sevenyear multidraw term loan and a  million year term loan the company noted that the refinancing effectively reduces the companys annual cash interest expense by approximately  to  basis points or approximately  based on its current debt levels additionally the company entered into a hedging transaction for  million effectively fixing the rate at  before patronage also the company said it is now eligible to receive annual patronage refunds which are profit distributions made by cobank and other farm credit system banks the refinancing provides the company additional capital for future acquisitions and other general corporate purposes including share repurchases is catchmark poised to profit as referenced above ctt has lost steam since listing in december  heres the performance since january   is ctt poised to profit i think so especially when you consider the fact there is muted downside risk and tremendous upside opportunity certainly we can see volatility in stumpage prices but the historic trends indicate significant price recovery one of the biggest indicators are housing starts thats what drives saw timber prices mm starts   saw timber vs  today now lets see how annual housing starts compare with real saw timber prices a new supercycle peak  vs  should drive significantly higher saw timber prices heres how i would play this one ctt is a small cap and shares clearly trade alongside the larger peers much like tree farming timber reits should be held for the long term trees take  years to harvestmature and ctt is positioned to grow at a much more rapid pace since pulpwood is a baseline product and is best positioned for saw timber recovery i favor ctt over the others based on simplicity there is minimal capex so ctt has a higher payout ratio and as noted ctt does not own sawmills ctt shares are currently trading at  and there are three analysts now covering the company with a consensus nav of  also ctt is taxadvantaged with  of dividends paid as roc and  capital appreciation i really like ctts liquidity that stands at around  million and thats a big signal that the company will be taking advantage of the wave of consolidation and growing housing starts im initiating a buy but with a disclaimer that this stock is a smallcap reit with limited public operating experience the dividend appears safe based on its payout ratio and i see value in the highest paying dividend yield in the sector sources snl financial and ctt investor presentation disclaimer this article is intended to

superior riskadjusted returns for all stakeholders through disciplined acquisitions sustainable harvests and welltimed sales strategy our objective is to maximize total returns for our shareholders by providing ongoing dividends derived from sustainable harvesting from our existing portfolios of highquality us timberlands  we also intend to selectively pursue timberland acquisition opportunities with focused efforts in the most commercially desirable timberproducing regions of the us south and us pacific northwest although we may also pursue opportunistic acquisitions outside of these regions the current housing market recovery and supply disruptions in canadian timber markets bode well for increasing demand for our timber products from domestic as well as offshore users over the longterm we do not engage in timberrelated manufacturing operations which allows us to focus on optimal management of our timberlands and prevents us from being exposed to the risks inherent in direct ownership of timberrelated manufacturing operations more property highlights catchmark manages approximately  acres of highquality commercial timberland located in alabama florida georgia louisiana north carolina south carolina tennessee and texas the portfolio is well diversified by species and product mix  pine hardwood by acreage and  sawtimber pulpwood by volume  our timberlands are located in proximity to a variety of established wood products pulp and paper manufacturing facilities which provide a steady source of competitive demand for both pulpwood and highervalue sawtimber products  more all data as of  sustainability conscientious forest management serves investors by preserving the integrity of the land and forest habitats which enhances the market value of timberland
