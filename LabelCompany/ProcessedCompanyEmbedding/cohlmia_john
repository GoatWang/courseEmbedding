metcalf llp g michael lewis doerner saunder daniels  anderson llp tulsa ok and james w conner jr and jason l glass richards  connor pllp tulsa ok with him on the brief tulsa ok for appellees dr george cohlmia a cardiovascular and thoracic surgeon in the tulsa oklahoma area sued st john medical center sjmc alleging a number of federal and state antitrust and business tort claims his claims followed sjmcs suspension of his medical privileges after a pair of surgeries one resulting in death and another in permanent disfigurement in response sjmc asserted an affirmative defense that it was immune under federal law from damages pursuant to the health care quality improvement act  usc §  et seq hcqia sjmc also moved for summary judgment on the antitrust and tort claims arguing they failed for lack of evidentiary supportthe district court granted summary judgment on all claims finding sjmc was immune from damages under the hcqia and further that dr cohlmia had not met his burden of showing disputed facts that would demonstrate anticompetitive conduct or injury exercising jurisdiction under  usc §  and after a thorough de novo review of the record we affirm the district courts grants of summary judgment and the cost award to sjmci backgrounddr cohlmias claims arise from two distinct events the first involves sjmcs suspension of his medical privileges following two surgeries performed at its hospital in june  the second involves dr cohlmias attempts at developing a specialty heart hospital in  and a sjmc surgeriesin june  dr cohlmia performed thoracotomy surgeries at sjmc on two patients diagnosed with lung cancer one patient died seven days later and the other was permanently disfigured as a result of the surgery following a report of these results dr allred sjmc vice–president of medical affairs and a physician specializing in colorectal surgery conducted a review of the surgeries to assess whether any physician error was involved during the course of his review of the surgeries he interviewed a pathologist a thoracic surgeon the medical oncologist who treated one of the patients postsurgery and a pulmonologist ultimately dr allred determined that “there was an inadequate workup ․ before the patients were operated on” aple suppapp at  as a result he and the members of the hospitals medical staff executive office concluded dr cohlmias treatment of the two patients demonstrated “significant error in clinical judgment” and that his continued practice at sjmc posed potential harm to patients id at – exercising authority pursuant to the sjmc medical staff bylaws dr cohlmias privileges to practice at sjmc were suspendedonce informed of this decision and in accordance with sjmc bylaws dr cohlmia immediately requested a formal hearing to respond to the concerns dr cohlmia met with dr allred and david pynn the president of sjmc prior to the hearing but no resolution of the suspension issue was reached at a threeday hearing in august  presided over by former united states district court judge thomas r brett dr cohlmia presented the testimony of seven physicians including one expert and sjmc presented the testimony of seven physicians including three experts dr cohlmia testified at length during the hearing in september  judge brett issued a report recommendation and judgment finding that the suspension of dr cohlmia was “the result of a thorough review by appropriate sjmc multidisciplinary medical staff physician specialists of the medical records regarding major thoracic surgery procedures” id  at  with respect to the patient who subsequently died judge brett found that dr cohlmias actions demonstrated “a lack of sound medical judgment” and a “marked deviation from the recognized standard of care” id at  with respect to the patient who was disfigured judge brett found that “dr cohlmias failure to employ extensive workup and staging prior to” the surgery “reflected a gross deviation in medical judgment” id at  ultimately judge brett concluded that sjmc “was justified for medical reasons in summarily suspending dr cohlmias medical and surgical privileges pursuant to ․ sjmc bylaws” id at –subsequent to judge bretts findings the medical executive committee of the sjmc medical staff reviewed the report and voted thirteen to two to uphold dr cohlmias suspension the sjmc board of directors approved the report as well after giving dr cohlmia another chance to present formal opposition to judge bretts findings by november  all of the review proceedings were concluded and dr cohlmias medical privileges were terminatedb specialty heart hospitalprior to his initial suspension dr cohlmia participated in several business ventures that bear on the claims in this appealin  dr cohlmia founded cardiovascular surgical specialists corp cvss the corporate entity through which he practices cvss which employed a number of associate physicians in addition to dr cohlmia provided a variety of surgical services including cardiovascular surgery thoracic surgery vascular surgery and endovascular surgery in june  dr cohlmia personally had active medical staff privileges at several hospitals in the tulsa area sjmc hillcrest medical center hmc saint francis and southcrestin the spring of  dr cohlmia began exploring the idea of opening a specialty heart hospital in tulsa he retained the services of a consulting group technology risk management group along with other professionals to assist him in this project collectively the development team in february  saint francis—where dr cohlmia had privileges—announced its own plans to open a freestanding heart hospital operating as a joint venture between saint francis and local physicians acting as investors many of the physician investors had previously been solicited by the development team as potential investors in dr cohlmias venture in april  the development team distributed a private placement memorandum ppm to potential investors the ppm included business plans financial projections organizational documents and the terms under which investors could participate notably the ppm also acknowledged saint franciss proposed heart hospital describing it as “slightly larger” but “similar in scope of services as the one described in this offering” id at dr cohlmias venture failed to attract any investors and the offer made by the ppm expired at the end of may  the ceo of the consulting group retained by dr cohlmia later stated that the venture failed because many potential investors were uncomfortable with the level of control that dr cohlmia would have over the hospital given that he was known “for not being able to maintain business associations” and that he “had been involved in litigation with a number of former business associates” id at  in addition to having been beaten to the market by saint francis the consultant offered his “professional opinion” that by june  it was clear that the venture “would not be successful” id at beginning in early  hmc instituted a moratorium on certain highrisk cardiovascular surgical procedures—procedures that dr cohlmia performed on a regular basis as a result of the moratorium dr cohlmia shifted much of his practice to sjmc after learning of his suspension at sjmc hmc also placed restrictions on dr cohlmias privileges in july  in october  after review of certain cases at hmc the hmc medical executive committee recommended that dr cohlmias privileges not be renewed in april  after several hearings and reviews—during which time dr cohlmia continued to practice at hmc—the decision was affirmed additionally dr cohlmia voluntarily relinquished his privileges at southcrest and saint francis while the review at hmc was ongoing dr cohlmia and tahlequah city hospital tch formed a joint venture in tahlequah oklahoma where dr cohlmia continues to practice at this time he draws patients from the same market area that sjmc operates in and he describes the venture as “successful” and with “excellent” results id at  he also continues to see patients out of a nonsurgical office in tulsac procedural historydr cohlmia filed his first amended complaint in september  raising a number of claims as a result of the dismissal and repleading of some claims the remaining claims before the district court below were  violations of sections  and  of the sherman antitrust act and section  of the clayton act  violations of the oklahoma antitrust reform act and  tortious interference with contract and prospective advantage sjmc asserted an affirmative defense pursuant to the hcqia that it was immune from damagesdr cohlmias claims survived a motion to dismiss cohlmia v ardent health services llc  fsuppd   ndokla cohlmia i but after discovery sjmc moved for summary judgment on all claims as well as on its affirmative defense of hcqia immunity the district court broke the motion into three segments receiving briefing on  the hcqia defense  the antitrust claims and  the tort claims the district court went on to grant all three summary judgment motions and award costs to sjmc dr cohlmia now appeals the grants of summary judgment as well as the cost awardii discussionour review of the district courts order will begin with the question of hcqia immunity and then consider the federal antitrust claims followed by the state law claims we conclude with the cost award our review of the district courts grants of summary judgment is de novo gwinn v awmiller  fd   th cira hcqiadr cohlmia first challenges the grant of hcqia immunity enacted in  hcqia provides immunity to hospitals or doctors who perform peer reviews or challenges to professional conduct where patient care is at issue hcqia was adopted out of concern “that medical professionals who were sufficiently fearful of the threat of litigation will simply not do meaningful peer review thus leaving patients at the mercy of people who should have been corrected or removed from their positions” ib phillip e areeda  herbert hovenkamp antitrust law  n  d ed internal quotation omittedhcqia provides immunity from “damages under any law of the united states or of any state ․ with respect to a professional review action”  usc § a a “professional review action” is “an action or recommendation of a professional review body which is taken or made in the conduct of professional review activity which is based on the competence or professional conduct of an individual physician which conduct affects or could affect adversely the health or welfare of a patient or patients and which affects or may affect adversely the clinical privileges or membership in a professional society of the physician” id at §  the entity or persons that undertake the professional review are immune under hcqia as long as they substantially comply with a list of objective standards set forth in the act id at § a the “immunity applies only to hospital or clinic dismissals in which the subjects professional conduct is at issue it creates no immunity whatsoever for purely ‘commercial’ terminations such as dropping a specialist when a hospital enters into an exclusive agreement with a different specialist” ib areeda  hovenkamp the act sets forth the procedures the professional review action should honor and provides for immunity when actions are undertaken based on a reasonable belief that patient health is at issue the immunity applies to actions taken in the reasonable belief that the action was in the furtherance of quality health care after a reasonable effort to obtain the facts of the matter after adequate notice and hearing procedures are afforded to the physician involved or after such other procedures as are fair to the physician under the circumstances and in the reasonable belief that the action was warranted by the facts known after such reasonable effort to obtain facts and after meeting the requirement of paragraph id at § aa professional review action is presumed to have met the standards for hcqia immunity unless the presumption is rebutted by the preponderance of the evidence id “courts apply an objective standard in determining whether a peer review action was reasonable under § a ” brown v presbyterian healthcare servs  fd   th cirthe district court focused its analysis on the fact that dr cohlmias evidence failed to rebut the presumption of regularity and concluded that no reasonable jury could find that dr cohlmia had overcome the presumption on appeal dr cohlmia argues the evidence would support an inference rebutting sjmcs procedures and reasonableness relying solely on brown in brown we held a plaintiff had successfully rebutted the hcqia presumption at trial by presenting an expert who argued that the hospitals review of two cases prior to revoking the plaintiffphysicians privileges was unreasonably narrow and that the hospital should not be entitled to a presumption under the second factor which provides immunity only after a “reasonable effort to obtain the facts of the matter” id at –but two important differences exist between this appeal and brown first brown went to trial and the jury determined that the hospital should not be entitled to immunity under hcqia we were reviewing the hospitals argument that the district court failed to find it immune as a matter of law we rejected that argument and affirmed finding the disputed facts at trial would support the jurys verdict id at  second and more importantly the district court below evaluated the record evidence presented by dr cohlmia and found that it was not sufficient to rebut the hcqia presumption in this case in brown the claimed malpractice at issue developed over a long period of time and could not be evaluated except through a lengthy review of the entire period something the hospital failed to do here in contrast sjmc and the requisite reviewing bodies were only concerned with the two acute patient incidents at issue that preceded dr cohlmias initial suspension sjmc argues that the record is undisputed it undertook “reasonable efforts to obtain the facts of the matter before its board made a final decision” aple br at  for example sjmc brought in three independent outside physician experts to review the cases and all testified under oath that the presurgery workup was inadequate and that the surgeries were unnecessary sjmc also consulted a cardiac surgeon a pathologist a pulmonologist and a medical oncologist in regards to the care dr cohlmia provided each of whom expressed concerns that the treatment of the two patients fell well below the standard of care required of a cardiothoracic surgeon finally it retained an independent arbiter to review the evidence and judge bretts report thoroughly documents and supports sjmcs methodology and conclusionsin response dr cohlmia points to a memo written by dr allred on june  —prior to the suspension but after the two surgeries were performed—criticizing dr cohlmias professional judgment see apltapp at  in the memo which appears to be a note for dr allreds personal files detailing an inperson conversation he had with a colleague dr allred opines about a “significant problem” with dr cohlmias care and states “it is very difficult to remove someone from the staff once they have full privileges” id dr cohlmia argues this memo is the best evidence showing that the suspension proceedings were merely a pretext in order to take away his privileges he believes this is evidenced by the fact that the memo does not specifically mention the two cases that were then under review that precipitated the suspension in early julybut it is unclear why this inference would follow from the memo the memo is detailing a conversation that dr allred had already had with a colleague dr allred was listening to and responding to concerns articulated by another physician and dr allred had not yet made public his concerns about the two surgeries it would have been odd—and potentially a violation of privacy or medical ethics—for dr allred to disclose his investigation to an unrelated physician prior to its completion which did not occur until ten days later we agree with the district court that nothing about the memo undercuts the thorough and independent review completed by sjmc in the course of its decision to terminate dr cohlmias medical staff privilegesand despite the allegations of bad faith “the real issue is the sufficiency of the basis for the hospitals actions” bryan v james e holmes regional med ctr  fd   th cir it is the objective reasonableness of the review bodys actions and determinations that count and it is worth noting that dr allred who initiated the peer review investigation as a part of his position as vice–president of medical affairs is a colorectal surgeon and not a medical competitor of dr cohlmia but even if he were a competitor application of hcqia immunity is based on

that the final language was meant to be limited to damages only because a broader protection “might be abused and serve as a shield for anticompetitive economic actions under the guise of quality

the district court found that there was no evidence of antitrust injury no injury in fact no evidence of causation and most importantly no evidence that any conduct was anything other than unilateral dr cohlmias appeal primarily takes issue with three of the district courts findings  whether there was evidence of antitrust injury  whether sjmc had sufficient market power and  whether there was sufficient evidence of conspiracya antitrust injuryto establish an antitrust injury dr cohlmia “must allege a business or property injury an antitrust injury as defined by the sherman act” tal v hogan

additionally “only buyers and sellers in the defendants market are within the target of the antitrust laws” comet mech contractors inc v ea cowen constr inc  fd   th cir thus an antitrust injury requires “an injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes defendants acts unlawful” tal  fd at  citation and quotation omitteddr cohlmia contends that acting through a “sham peer review process” sjmc and others conspired to exclude him from the market for cardiology services in tulsa he argues his exclusion from the tulsa marketplace by itself harmed competition by reducing the number of physicians available to provide the type of medical services he typically providesin support of this argument he relies on the supreme courts decision in summit health v pinhas  us   sct   ledd   in summit health the court considered the antitrust claim of an opthamologist whose medical privileges were revoked after he refused to use an assistant surgeon—resulting in higher costs for himself—during procedures that he performed at the hospital the physician was known throughout the industry for his skill and speed in these types of surgeries and he argued that requiring him to provide an assistant at his own cost was unnecessary and improper id at – the hospital engaged in a peer review process that ended with the revocation of his medical privileges the court found the doctors claims “that members of the peer review committee conspired with others to abuse the process and thereby deny him access to the market ․ had a sufficient nexus with interstate commerce to support federal jurisdiction” id at  dr cohlmia argues the courts decision applies here as wellbut summit health was decided on much narrower grounds rather than standing for the proposition that the “actual effect on the market is not controlling” and “the federal power to protect free markets may be exercised to punish conduct which threatens to impair competition even when no actual harm results” aplt br at  summit health was decided on purely jurisdictional grounds the court was simply answering whether the case should survive a motion to dismiss for lack of federal jurisdiction and was considering whether an opthamologist in the los angeles market was engaged in interstate commerce—the answer was yes summit health does not stand for the proposition that the process sjmc used here injured competitionnor is there antitrust injury every time someone is excluded from a medical hospital as a result of peer reviewa staffing decision does not itself constitute an antitrust injury “if the law were otherwise many a physicians workplace grievance with a hospital would be elevated to the status of an antitrust action to keep the antitrust laws from being so trivialized the reasonableness of a restraint is evaluated based on its impact on competition as a whole within the relevant market ”bcb anesthesia care ltd v passavant meml area

market see also mathews v lancaster gen hosp  fd   d cir “an antitrust plaintiff must prove that challenged conduct affected the prices quantity or quality of goods or services not just his own welfare” internal quotation omittedbased on these authorities the question is whether harm to competition has been demonstrated the district court found no credible evidence from which to infer injury rather the court concluded that “dr cohlmias loss of privileges at sjmc has not had market wide impact on the provision of any of the surgery or interventional cardiology services he claims to provide market wide prices quantity or quality were not affected by dr cohlmias loss of privileges” apltapp at  we agree with this assessment of the recordfinally dr cohlmia points to a third circuit case brader v allegheny gen hosp  fd  d cir for the proposition that the denial of medical staff privileges can injure competition we do not quarrel with that general proposition but although dr cohlmia alleged facts in his complaint sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss—which is what the district court concluded in cohlmia i—to overcome a motion for summary judgment he must “meet his burden of presenting specific facts by reference to specific exhibits in the record” it is not the courts job to “comb the record in order to make” the nonmovants arguments for him mitchell v city of moore  fd   th cir the court in brader acknowledged as much “after summit health the adequacy of a physicians contentions regarding the effect on competition is typically resolved after discovery either on summary judgment or after trial”  fd at  here dr cohlmia failed to show evidence of an “impact on competition as a whole within the relevant market” bcb anesthesia care  fd at  internal quotation omitted in sum as the district court found there is no record evidence of antitrust injuryb market share and market poweranother element of an antitrust claim requires the plaintiff to show the defendant can wield “market power” to do so a plaintiff must show evidence of either power to control prices or the power to exclude competition reazin v blue cross  blue shield inc  fd   th cir power over price and competition may depend on various market characteristics such as “market trends number and strength of other competitors and entry barriers” shoppin bag of pueblo inc v dillon cos  fd   th cir “market share is relevant to the determination of the existence of market or monopoly power but market share alone is insufficient to establish market power” reazin  fd at  internal quotation marks omitted and the absence of market share may give rise to a presumption that market power does not exist id at –dr cohlmias expert testified that sjmc controlled between  and  of the market and sjmc does not dispute this quantitative conclusion from this testimony dr cohlmia argues that market share “between  and  ․ is sufficient to show monopoly power” aplt br at  citing valley liquors inc v renfield importers ltd  fd   th cir but as sjmc notes this is hardly a brightline or even a commonly accepted metric see reazin  fd at  we have not determined “a firm market share percentage ․ before a finding of monopoly power can ever be sustained we prefer the view that market share percentages may give rise to presumptions but will rarely conclusively establish or eliminate market or monopoly power” see also colorado interstate gas co v natural gas pipeline co  fd   n  th cir “while the supreme court has refused to specify a minimum market share necessary to indicate a defendant has monopoly power lower courts generally require a minimum market share of between  and ” thus while high market shares may give rise to presumptions of market power a market share of less than  is woefully short under any metric from which to infer market power see also domed stadium hotel inc v holiday inns inc  fd   th cir  “undisputed evidence of low market share may make monopolization an impossibility as a matter of law” iib areeda  hovenkamp  “we ․ presume that market shares below  or  percent do not constitute monopoly power ․ and even without an absolute rule a clear presumption will almost always be decisive”given the low market share at issue here dr cohlmia argues he can still demonstrate market power by showing “other compelling structural evidence ․ to support monopolization” dimmitt agri indus inc v cpc intl inc  fd   th cir  since the market share percentages held by sjmc are well shy of clear market power in determining whether there is any “other compelling structural evidence” we consider the strength of competition and the difficulty or ease of entry into the market shoppin bag  fd at with respect to the strength of competition there are four hospital systems in tulsa that perform the types of surgeries at issue and sjmc is not even the largestsaint francis is in addition a specialty heart hospital operated by saint francis competed with sjmc hmc and southcrest at the relevant times here while performing surgery is a capital—intensive process for a market the size of tulsa four hospital systems do not indicate significant market power by any one player to the contrary the record shows each participant in tulsa had a roughly equivalent share of the market and no one entity was exercising market power as to barriers of entry sjmc points out that fourteen new surgeons have entered the market since  with many of them being recruited by dr cohlmia while dr cohlmia makes a legitimate argument that exclusion by one hospital can lead to a domino effect of exclusion by other hospitals he still does not overcome the fact that the mishandled surgeries justified sjmcs peer review and as we discussed above the peer review process resulted in a suspension decision affirmed by a neutral evaluator the peer review process is no more an entry barrier than any standard requiring professionals to maintain certain professional credentialsassuming that sjmc lacked the requisite market power dr cohlmias claims may still be pursued for those section  violations that do not require a showing of market power thus a demonstration of anticompetitive conduct can be based on actual adverse effects to competition ftc v indiana fedn of dentists  us  –  sct   ledd  dr cohlmias claim falls short here as well he points to sjmcs “concerted refusal to deal with plaintiff and the coercion of patients” aplt br at  but he is not entitled to practice at sjmc or any other hospital and he never explains how his patients were coerced by sjmc if he is referring to a reduction of choice in the market for physicians that argument is simply circular and refers back to his claims of market power which he cannot supportin sum we agree with the district court that dr cohlmia has not demonstrated sjmc has sufficient market power to control prices or exclude competitionc proof of conspiracyan inference of conspiracy is impermissible if the defendants “had no rational economic motive to conspire and if their conduct is consistent with other equally plausible explanations” matsushita elec indus co v zenith radio corp  us    sct   ledd  dr cohlmia argues he demonstrated ample evidence of conspiracy and that the district court failed to consider his evidence taken as a whole rather than individually dr cohlmias arguments are predicated on his belief that sjmc was conspiring against him to block his specialty heart hospital—an unsuccessful venture that failed to attract any investors dr cohlmias claims are speculative at best and even viewing these arguments in the best light possible there is simply no evidence of an actual conspiracy for the same reasons as the district court we agree summary judgment on the conspiracy claims was properin sum the district court did not err in granting summary judgment on the federal antitrust claims state antitrust claimsnext we turn to dr cohlmias state antitrust claimsunder the oklahoma antitrust reform act it is unlawful for any person to monopolize attempt to monopolize or conspire to monopolize any part of trade or commerce in a relevant market within the state okla stat tit  § b this is essentially the same as the federal test and as with those claims the district court properly awarded summary judgmentone notable difference though is that it is unlawful for any person in control of an essential facility to unreasonably refuse to give a competitor access if the effect of such refusal is to injure competition id at § c an “essential facility” is among other things a facility “which is controlled by an entity that possesses monopoly power” id at § daas discussed above sjmc lacked monopoly power so for the same reasons the state law claim fails in addition dr cohlmia had privileges at several of the other local hospitals at the time of his suspension from sjmc so he was not “locked out” aplt br at  of an essential facility as required by the act and it is not anticompetitive for a hospital to restrict privileges of medical professionals deemed unsafe to practice in a facility see pontius v childrens hosp  fsupp   wdpa reasoning that it would be “inappropriate to apply a doctrine which would prevent a hospital from keeping doctors it had adjudged unqualified off of its staff”dr cohlmia points to an oklahoma case where the court struck down a contractual provision preventing a surgeon from practicing within a –mile radius of tulsa cardiovascular surgical specialists corp v mammana  pd  – okla but that case involved an onerous noncompete agreement ironically drafted by dr cohlmias corporate entity a defendant in the case that completely excluded the surgeon from the market for two years in finding anticompetitive activity the court was clear that the noncompete effectively banned the surgeon “from practicing ․ within  miles” of the community where he had previously been employed and was “much broader than necessary to protect any legitimate interest of” his former employer id at  in this case sjmc has properly received hcqia immunity and at the time of his suspension dr cohlmia had staff privileges at several other area hospitals where he could practice the record is clear that dr cohlmia was upset with this turn of events but he ultimately chose to voluntarily resign his privileges at two hospitals and move his primary practice to tahlequah—which is still in the market area as defined by his own expert there is simply no basis to conclude that sjmc violated oklahoma state antitrust law or specifically the “essential facility” doctrine in sum the district court properly granted summary judgment to sjmc on dr cohlmias state antitrust claims although he presented a coherent theory to survive an initial motion to dismiss once discovery was completed the record lacked sufficient evidence to support his claims tortious interference with contractdr cohlmia also contends the district court erred in dismissing his tortious interference with contract claim we disagreeto state a claim for tortious interference with business or contractual relations the plaintiff must show  he or she had a business or contractual right that was interfered with  the interference was malicious and wrongful and was not justified privileged or excused and  damage was proximately sustained as a result of the interference mac adjustment inc v property loss research bureau  pd   okladr cohlmia claims that sjmc interfered with his contracts with two groups his patients and an insurer blue crossblue shielda patient contractsas to interference with patient contracts dr cohlmia argues that at the time sjmc suspended his privileges both he and his patients were forced to leave the tulsa market in order to continue treatment as sjmc points out the relationship between a doctor and a patient is atwill there is no contract at issue see also vesom v atchison hosp assn  fapp   th cir finding that to recover plaintiff must show a “contractual relationship or exclusive arrangement with his patients on which to base his prospective loss” dr cohlmia acknowledges this point but argues that as a result of sjmcs conduct his interactions with patients were made “more burdensome or expensive” aplt br at  see also john a henry  co v tg  y stores co  fd  – th cir sjmc counters that dr cohlmia presented no evidence to support these allegations and at the time of his suspension dr cohlmia had privileges at three other local hospital systems where he could serve his patients aple br at the district court held that dr cohlmia failed to offer proof of his damages and damages are not automatically presumed on the basis of a loss of privileges apltapp at – in rebutting this determination dr cohlmia relies on the fifth circuits decision in kiepfer v beller  fd   th cir which held that a physician can establish sufficient evidence for a tortious interference claim by showing that defendant physicians interfered with his ability to obtain patient referrals but in that case the doctor at trial “sufficiently proved that his damages—the complete loss of his referral practice—was a proximate result of the tortious interference” id at here there is no evidence demonstrating a loss of patients or monetary damages but dr cohlmia argues that the district court improperly denied his request to submit an expert report detailing his damages the court rejected the report because dr cohlmia failed to comply with the requirements of federal rule of civil procedure f by not filing an affidavit indicating that he was unable to present facts essential to justify his opposition to summary judgment given that he failed to comply with the rules it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to reject dr cohlmias filing based on his failure to comply with rule f b insurance contractsas with his patients dr cohlmia fails to provide evidence of economic damage to his relationship with blue crossblue shield the only reference in dr cohlmias briefs to this issue is that he “had to undergo appellate procedures to remain available under the blue crossblue shield insurance plans of thousands of patients” aplt br at  while not specifically explained it appears dr cohlmia is arguing that once his privileges were suspended at one hospital he had to be “recertified” by other hospitals to continue as a provider in the insurance system while this likely imposed some time cost as with his allegations as to patient interference dr cohlmia failed to properly submit evidence

that he claims were interfered with by sjmc  potential new patients and  potential lost profits from his specialty heart hospital venturethe new patient claim suffers from the same defects discussed above regarding the insufficiency of evidence relating to existing patients and need not be restated hereas to the lost profits claim dr cohlmia claims sjmc was attempting to frustrate his efforts to build and operate a new specialty heart hospital in the tulsa area the district court found that this claim also suffered from “the absence of proof of damages” apltapp at claims for damages based on future profits are generally prohibited since they are typically uncertain and speculative weyerhaeuser co v brantley  fd   th cir citations omitted oklahoma state law holds that when a party seeks to recover loss of future profits the profits should be coming from an established business that shows with some certainty the future losses plummer v fogley  pd   okladr cohlmia submitted an expert report to establish future profits but the court ruled that the report was inadmissible because dr cohlmia failed to comply with the requirements of rule f see apltapp at – ruling  report even if the court had received the report sjmc argues that it “does not speak to the certainty of profits but is an extrapolation of tax returns and reliance on a pro forma which is not part of the record and itself hearsay and unreasonable” aple br at we agree the expert report relies on economic projections going out several years detailing dr cohlmias expected profits from his specialty heart hospital but such projections are speculative at best given that the consultant retained by dr cohlmia for the specialty heart hospital project concluded that the project “would not be successful” in june —over a year before sjmcs suspension of dr cohlmia—and that dr cohlmia failed to attract a single investor after distributing his ppm the district court did not err in concluding oklahoma law required more evidence to support a damage awardthe district court did not err in granting summary judgment with respect to the intentional interference with prospective economic advantage claim various other motionsas noted above dr cohlmias arguments realize the meager state of the record regarding damages but he argues that the district court erred by overruling his motions to supplement the record unfortunately dr cohlmia does not explain why the district court erred and simply points to cases showing that summary judgment reversal is necessary when error occursthe district court was well within its discretion to reject dr cohlmias motions for the simple fact that he did not comply with the required procedures for submission additionally there is nothing here to suggest that they were so substantively important that the outcome in this case would have been differentc cost awardfederal rule of civil procedure  “creates a presumption that the district court will award costs to the

th cir and the amount of a fee or cost award for an abuse of discretion anchondo v anderson crenshaw  assocs llc  fd   th cirdr cohlmia argues that the district court erred by  awarding costs to sjmc in the first instance and  even if awarding costs were legally proper the amount awarded was unreasonable he argues the district court imputed certain costs that had been borne by other defendants to sjmc when calculating their expenses—a problem because other defendants previously settled and the various parties agreed to bear their own costs as a part of that settlement sjmc disagrees arguing that it only ever sought recovery for the costs that it paid out of pocketdr cohlmia points to the copying costs as especially egregious but as sjmc notes at the time of the fee award the case had spanned over four years with almost  pages of discovery produced by sjmc at a cost of almost  we have previously held that “the burden of justifying copy costs is not a high one a prevailing party need not justify each copy it makes ․ but instead demonstrate to the district court that under the particular circumstances the copies were reasonably necessary for use in the case” in re williams  fd at  internal quotation marks omittedthe district court was in the best position to determine the reasonable necessity of the copying cost award and the record is clear that the court rejected dr cohlmias argument that sjmc only be awarded  of their proposed costs an argument presumably raised because sjmc accounted for  of the original defendants as the record and the district court made clear “the costs sought by defendants were actual outofpocket costs they are entitled to recover these costs provided they were reasonably necessary to the litigation of the case” apltapp at nothing in the record indicates that the district courts cost award was unreasonable accordingly we affirm the district courts cost awardiii conclusionbased on the foregoing analysis we affirm the district courts grants of summary judgment and the cost award to sjmcfootnotes  dr cohlmia initially included a number of additional defendants in his complaints see apltapp at – but those defendants settled prior to the disposition below see docket entry   at this time the only parties left in this case are dr cohlmia and the corporate entity through which he practices along with sjmc and two of its physicians in their individual capacities  dr cohlmia urges that he was “forced to withdraw” from these institutions as a result of “sham peer review” that was completed “for political purposes” aplt

over several years” johnson v christus spohn no c––  wl  at  sdtex feb  in johnson the court held that a hospital took reasonable efforts to obtain the facts when it investigated only one case

review during the hearing presided over by judge brett sjmc engaged the services of a thoracic surgeon who was currently on an extended sabbatical from medical practice—so certainly not a competitor at the time see id at   dr cohlmia cites a number of other cases in support of his view that antitrust injury can be demonstrated without an “actual lessening of competition or an increase in prices” aplt br at  quoting blue shield of virginia  us at  but the cases he cites were primarily decided at the motion to dismiss stage when the court is still determining jurisdiction and are predicated on a finding of “an abusive peer review process”—a finding we rejected above by concluding that sjmc is entitled to hcqia immunity see balaklaw v lovell  fd   n  d cir fuentes v south hills cardiology

privileges ․ and the patient market for anesthesia services” id at  while the ninth circuit did so hold the facts in oltz indicate that st peters had an  market share for surgical services id at  in
