morningstar rating based on a morningstar riskadjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund’s monthly performance including the effects of sales charges loads and redemption fees placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance the top  of funds in each category receive  stars the next  receive  stars the next  receive  stars the next  receive

methodology data fees  features home reviews td ameritrade in the process of searching for a wellrounded broker finding the right mix is no easy task trade costs trade platforms tools research and customer service all are important to investors after using a td ameritrade account you cannot help but love the overall experience the broker charges  per trade almost twice that of some of the cheaper discount brokers however the value and quality delivered is so superior it easily justifies the higher price tag commissions  fees while having access to  customer support advanced trade platforms ample research realtime streaming quotes site wide and more is great unfortunately it is expensive td ameritrade charges a flat rate of  per trade with options costing  plus  per contract compared to other fullservice brokers td ameritrade is on par with etrade but is more expensive than the rest including charles schwab fidelity and scottrade in fact considering margin costs td ameritrade is the most expensive broker out of the  included in our  review td ameritradeetradecharles schwabfidelity stock trade fee flatoptions base feeoptions per contract feemutual fund trade feebroker assisted trades feecommission free etfscommissions  fees  stars  stars  stars  stars one bright spot is that td ameritrade offers  commissionfree etfs charles schwab offers the most with  the only caveat is that with td ameritrade any commissionfree etf that is sold within  days of purchase is subject to a shortterm trading fee of  update  – td ameritrade reduced its equity commissions equity trades including stocks and etfs have been lowered to  per trade previously  since these new rates were announced after the  review was published they are not incorporated into td ameritrades star rating for this category customer service if having access to  customer support by phone and email is important to you then td ameritrade has you covered the broker posted fantastic results for phone and email during testing for our  review finishing no  and no  respectively when it comes to support the bottom line is that for a fullservice broker great customer service is expected and td ameritrade delivers regardless of the communication avenue during our phone tests our average wait time was less than two minutes the reps were very well trained every test call we made to td ameritrade regardless of the day or time was answered by a customer service agent who identified himherself provided a pleasant introduction and always left us with a warm closing note eg “have a great day” all our questions were always answered so it was not surprising to see td ameritrade end up no  for phone customer service out of  brokers email testing was also a great experience all our emails were returned within  hours on average in fact in one test td ameritrade responded to our multiquestion support inquiry in a blazingly fast  minutes  customer service agents were clearly well trained as email templates were consistent and thorough of all our eight email tests two resulted in a “good” overall score with the rest being “great” td ameritrade finished third for email live chat support is also offered but only for clients seeking platform support while using thinkorswim or for potential clients who navigate around the site long enough to trigger a live chat popup knowing how the web is evolving and how millennials prefer to communicate i would like to see td ameritrade offer live chat support for all clients and potential clients td ameritrade finished third for live chat when it comes to support the bottom line is that for a fullservice broker great customer service is expected and td ameritrade delivers regardless of the communication avenue td ameritrade finished first overall for customer service in our  review research like its biggest competitors fidelity charles schwab and etrade td ameritrade has a substantial research offering td ameritradefidelity etrademerrill edgecharles schwabequity research  social yes yes yes no yes equity research  metric comparisons yes yes no yes yes equity research  reportsetf research  reports yes yes yes yes yes mutual fund research  reports yes no yes yes yes when i pulled up a quote for apple aapl i found a clean spread of relevant data including seven different thirdparty research reports to choose from and read which is the third highest number in the industry fidelity offers  the featured research report provider is researchteam which combines five research providers into one providing clients quality research is an extremely competitive challenge of all the functionality provided on the website i found td ameritrade had two outstanding functions the social signals tab and the peer comparison tab powered by likefolio social signals displays both a realtime streaming feed of algorithmically filtered brandrelevant tweets – which i found much better than seeing a list of recent stocktwits tweets – and a summary chart of the mosttweeted brands naturally social signals is best used for consumerfocused brands such as apple aapl or nike nke in thinkorswim covered further down the data can be charted for deeper analysis on the peer comparison tab investors find a clean customizable chart showing the stock’s performance against its closest competitors followed by a comparison table of relevant metrics included competitors can also be shown or hidden clean peer comparisons are not easy to do which is where td ameritrade stands out metrics included in the table are relevant and pruned to the most important social signals data is also tied in however i found this data did not appear each time i loaded the page and data was missing for certain securities data was marked as “new” during my testing so i imagine the data will be worked out in time social signals and peer comparisons aside i also enjoyed the onsite charting functionality with  different technical indicators volume macd rsi etc and easytoread big charts the experience is as clean as you will find anywhere i could even pop out the chart into its own window to expand it across my inch monitor the only downside to the experience is the lack of panning flexibility on the chart itself charting is driven by provider sungard and my recommendation to td ameritrade would be to check out chartiq instead for the price customers pay per trade excellent research should be expected when all  variables for research are considered td ameritrade lacks only two features displaying the total number of holdings for etfs and a country allocation chart for mutual funds impressive to say the least td ameritrade finished third behind fidelity and charles schwab for research in  ease of use making research a seamless experience is just one part of td ameritrade’s efforts to make its website easy to use the sitewide quote bar streams realtime quotes – functionality that charles schwab etrade and fidelity do not offer – and includes snapticket a quick trade extension that allows stock and option orders to be placed from any page on the site td ameritrade also offers a fully customizable sidebar my dock which allows clients to display up to  different modules modules can be resorted or placed into separate columns allowing clients with widescreen monitors to maximize their workflow while clean and easy to use i found myself leaving the sidebar collapsed and hidden away despite having a inch monitor capable of maximizing the experience i found it to be a distraction i had to dig deep to find flaws in td ameritrade’s client experience i had to dig deep to find flaws in td ameritrade’s client experience after many hours of testing and comparing i found two disappointing items that stood out the my account overview experience and adding additional accounts the default my account page is data rich but poorly laid out and i found it to be a poor launching pad into my usual workflow enabling my dock in the sidebar did little to patch the user experience charles schwab trade source and fidelity’s new fully responsive accounts experience are both superior i know td ameritrade can do better for managing multiple accounts i found that each new account i created required a completely new username and password once established and logged in i could then link the new account to my primary user id this is a subtle difference from other brokers where you can simply create and add a new brokerage account to your same id with no trouble minor yes however for clients with multiple accounts it can be a confusing experience first time through pickiness aside td ameritrade’s platforms discussed next have both casual and active traders covered and the same twopronged approach is applied to mobile where two separate apps are offered no doubt td ameritrade shines in the category ease of use platforms  tools while there are many attractive features in td ameritrade the brokers two platforms are its bread and butter the flagship platform thinkorswim used to be a standalone broker until td ameritrade acquired it in  td ameritradefidelity etrademerrill edgecharles schwabdesktop platform windows yes yes yes no yes charting  indicators  studiescharting  drawing toolsoption chains  total columnswatch lists  total fields thinkorswim is designed for advanced traders who want complete flexibility and depth furthermore it can be used by any client with no minimums or specific trade criteria required for access this is an important advantage over both fidelity active trader pro and etrade pro which both require minimums for access run as a desktop application thinkorswim is so advanced it is rivaled only by tradestation a few clicks of the mouse will have dozens of charts streaming realtime data and even the pickiest trader will be satisfied with the  technical studies available for each chart highest in the industry not to mention that each study can be customized thereafter using thinkscript thinkorswim’s proprietary coding language traders can even create their own indicators this is most like tradestation’s easylanguage which is the only other broker to offer such functionality it’s a dazzling array of choices that will set your mind spinning – in a good way td ameritrades thinkorswim is also home to a slew of advanced tools whether it be company profiling advanced earnings analysis plotting fred data charting social sentiment backtesting and replaying historical markets tick by tick viewing economic and corporate calendars creating and conducting realtime stock scans sharing charts and workspace layouts or performing advanced options analysis the rabbit hole goes as far as any traders imagination will take them it’s a dazzling array of choices that will set your mind spinning – in a good way focusing on the two most recent innovations adding federal reserve economic data fred and the new earnings analysis tool investors can begin to appreciate the endless brain hub stationed at thinkorswim’s chicago office starting with fred a publicly accessible us government database of over  economic data points think gdp cpi treasury rates median household income etc fred data is used by institutional investors hedge funds and other sophisticated trading operations in its neverending quest to level the playing field the thinkorswim team decided to download all the data process it build a custom interface to graph it and brought it to all td ameritrade clients free make no mistake what thinkorswim has accomplished is truly mind blowing the only other way to view this data as seamlessly as thinkorswim is to pay up for a bloomberg terminal make no mistake what thinkorswim has accomplished is truly mind blowing the only other way to view this data as seamlessly as thinkorswim is to pay up for a bloomberg terminal once a data set is loaded it can be tweaked and customized whichever way the user desires for sophisticated investors fred data is extremely useful in assessing the overall health of the market or specific sectors which is why institutions pay up to access it via bloomberg thanks to thinkorswim now any td ameritrade client can conduct the same analysis alongside fred analysis thinkorswim also launched its new tool for conducting earnings analysis in my personal trading career i have analyzed thousands of earnings releases heading into an earnings event the toughest and most timeconsuming part is researching historical price action and volatility surrounding previous events understanding how the earnings were estimated in the eyes of wall street then gauging the significance of any beat or miss earnings analysis with thinkorswim does all of this in one clean interface starting with the top row five days of price action are plotted before and after each earnings release next volatility is plotted over the same time span followed by an at the money atm straddle extremely insightful data for options traders seeking patterns and outliers in options market behavior finally using data from wall street analysts and crowdsourced ratings from estimize eps estimate ranges alongside actual results are clearly plotted providing an efficient way of assessing the company’s results the whole experience together brings clarity with much less noise it’s magic both fred data and the new earnings analysis experience launched in  are two examples of many where td ameritrade continues to innovate and push the envelope of what is available for traders both fred data and the new earnings analysis experience launched in  are two examples of many where td ameritrade continues to innovate and push the envelope of what is available for traders for casual and active traders earnings analysis with thinkorswim is truly a work of art and the best new trader tool of  in my books one of my gripes with thinkorswim back in  and  was the platform’s reliability during volatile markets on highly volatile and active trading days when there would be a large influx of clients using the system thinkorswim would lag noticeably – sometimes for lengthy periods growing pains are no fun and while it took longer than clients had hoped for thinkorswim addressed them all today thanks to the thinkorswim reskin in  alongside a slew of infrastructure updates in both  and  thinkorswim hums along with no trouble at all in  active traders should be confident relying on thinkorswim to provide a seamless experience regardless of the market environment platform thinkorswim aside td ameritrade also has a webbased platform trade architect which is designed with more casual investors in mind the tools and functionality are purposely kept simple and the design is clean with visual flare everything ran smoothly in my chrome browser bugfree and i quickly became a fan of the platformwide streaming realtime quotes from testing every broker the streaming watch list functionality trade architect offers is my favorite it isnt just the superb layout but also the flexibility ease of use and depth of data available the layout is completely customizable and it’s great having access to visual data such as quote trends trade trends week range and a strength meter the bottom line is simple when it comes to platforms  tools in  for the sixth year in a row td ameritrade is on top mobile trading with mobile trading td ameritrade took a different approach by offering not one but two smartphone apps td ameritrade mobile and td ameritrade mobile trader td ameritrade mobile is designed for new and casual investors while td ameritrade mobile trader is designed for the featurehungry active trader having two separate apps has its noticeable pros and cons having two separate apps has its noticeable pros and cons on the pros side the apps can hone in on their individual target users and provide a specific experience on the cons side it is easy to confuse the two apps initially and not know which one is right for you also some of the functionality that is built for one could really be beneficial on the other for example basic price alerts so it can be tricky at times to find the right home as a client looking at specific functionality td ameritrade mobile trader is “where the magic happens” so to speak advanced charting with a staggering  different technical studies is available alongside a full array of order options an extremely smooth interface for advanced equities trades as well as a seamless experience for complex options trades are compelling features in my view this combination is the best in the industry in  td ameritrade released inapp chat support and mobile desktop linking both for the mobile trader app inapp chat support allows users to use their mobile devices and chat with a customer service agent for live help which includes screen sharing linking enables users to link the thinkorswim desktop platform to the mobile trader app click on the quotes tab select a color next to the search bar that matches a chart or similar in thinkorswim then pull up any quote and thinkorswim will follow suite in  the updates were across the board with td ameritrade mobile highlights included touch id login alongside customized positions and watch list views and the addition of social signals analysis a windows  app was also launched for mobile trader access to saved orders was added with deeper linking to thinkorswim desktop it would be great to see screening and advanced alerts added to td ameritrade’s mobile trader in  in td ameritrade mobile it would also be nice to be able to chart portfolio performance against the overall market and be able to set basic price alerts when all  variables are factored in for the mobile trading category td ameritrade came away with  of possible points in our  review edging out longtime industry leader etrade and taking first place overall when all
