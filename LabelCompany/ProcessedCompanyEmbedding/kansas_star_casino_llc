reprint of this story when there are big bets on the line you can expect strong opinions and plenty of controversy four proposals for casino projects in southeast kansas were submitted to state officials by the jan  deadline two are clearly larger and glitzier sitting a few feet from the oklahoma and missouri state lines and catering mainly to outofstate residents the other two are smaller though still large and would sit  to  miles farther north near southeast kansas’ most populous city pittsburg the four are castle rock casino resort emerald city casino resort kansas crossing casino  hotel and a stillunnamed project by southeast kansas casino partners llc the four are now being studied by the kansas lottery which are applying various criteria including financial sufficiency if approved the proposals would pass in april to an independent board called the lottery gaming facility review board which is expected to name a winner by the end of june ken coleman of southeast kansas casino partners said that the best project for kansas would pull most of its customers from a multistate region that includes springfield and joplin mo and fayetteville ark rather than from southeast kansas pulling in customers from outside the state means having nonresidents paying tax dollars into kansas coffers to capture those gamblers he said the casino must be placed as close as possible to i the main highway between springfield and tulsa which runs less than a mile from the state’s southeast corner castle rock the other casino proposed in that location said its market study showed that  percent of its visitors would be from out of state but the big problem for both projects is they would compete headon with downstream casino resort a giant casino complex sitting just across the state line in oklahoma downstream is owned by the qupaw tribe of northeastern oklahoma the qupaw tribe also backs one of the southeast kansas casinos proposed for the pittsburg area that project would sit on the former greyhound race track in frontenac owned by wichita businessman phil ruffin in a move that could change some calculations the qupaw tribe in december got approval from the national indian gaming commission to expand downstream casino across the kansas state line with a  million addition that would offer table games such as craps and roulette that are not allowed in oklahoma the cherokee county commission this week formally voted to oppose such a move brandon steven said his group’s proposal castle rock casino is not affected by the qupaw tribe’s move “there’s a slim chance they’ll get it” steven said “and really it doesn’t affect us whether they’re  feet closer to us is irrelevant we’re still going to build” john berrey chairman of the qupaw tribe said a direct competitor can’t beat downstream and that the addition would allow it to offer all the games a kansas casino can because downstream is tribeowned he said it pays less in taxes which means he can spend more to compete and still make the same profit he sees the tribe’s emerald casino resort in frontenac as a nice complement to downstream it would pull from the area but reach all the way up to the kansas city area on both sides of the kansasmissouri line carrie tedore spokeswoman for the kansas crossing casino said her group made decisions about location and size based on previous experience winning two of the three competitions for casinos in kansas some of the same parties involved in kansas crossing helped develop the kansas star casino in mulvane and the boot hill casino  resort in dodge city tedore said they think their location at one of the busiest intersections in southeast kansas was the right place and that they have the right size to thrive in that region it’s a casino she said but it’s also an entertainment complex that would provide economic development for the pittsburg area with an arena hotel restaurants and other amenities related stories from the wichita
