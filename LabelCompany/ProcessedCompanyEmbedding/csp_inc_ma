technology solution geographies as well as across high performance products and technology solutions continue to gain traction our managed services pipeline in the us and europe is growing and we are taking actions to capitalize on the rapidly growing global security market from a financial perspective secondquarter sales were down  primarily due to the timing of shipments at our us business in

provider we received royalty revenues from two ed planes in the second quarter and our expectation is to receive royalties from two planes in q and one additional plane in the fourth quarter “in technology solutions strong performance in germany and the uk was more than offset by weakness in the us while timing of shipments affected revenues in the us our managed services pipeline remains robust we are closing managed services deals at a greater frequency and the recurring revenue stream is increasing there is also great interest in the myricom nvoy solutions as part of our security managed service offerings we are continuing to hire engineers in the us to support future growth “looking forward we are expecting solid performance in the third quarter on both the top and bottom

recorded an income tax expense of approximately  million which reflected an effective tax expense rate of  for the year ended september   which was lower than the statutory rate due in part to the tax benefit from research and development credits for the year ended september   the income tax expense was approximately  million which reflected an effective tax rate of  the significantly high effective tax rate was due to the company having a small profit with no tax benefit recorded for the substantial loss in the uk due to the fact that a full valuation allowance is maintained against the deferred tax asset as of september   management assessed the positive and negative evidence in the us operations and estimated that we will have sufficient future taxable income to utilize the existing deferred tax assets significant objective positive evidence included the cumulative profits that we realized in recent fiscal years this evidence enhances our ability to consider other subjective evidence such as our projections for future growth other factors that we considered are the likelihood for continued royalty income in future years and our expectation that the ts segment will continue to be profitable in future years on the basis of this evaluation as of september   we have concluded that our us deferred tax asset is more likely than not to be realized it should be noted however that the amount of the deferred tax asset realized could be adjusted in future years if estimates of taxable income during the carryforward periods are reduced or if there is objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance against our uk deferred tax assets as we have experienced cumulative losses and do not have any indication that the operation will be profitable in the future to an extent that will allow us to utilize much of our net operating loss carryforwards to the extent that actual experience deviates from our assumptions our projections would be affected and hence our assessment of realizability of our deferred tax assets may change liquidity and capital resources our primary source of liquidity is our cash and cash equivalents which increased by approximately  million to  million as of september   from  million as of september   at september   cash equivalents totaled  million of this amount significant sources of cash for the year ended september   included net income of approximately  million an increase in deferred revenues of approximately  million an increase in pension and retirement plans liabilities of  million depreciation of approximately  million and an increase in other assets of approximately  million partially offsetting these sources of cash were a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of approximately  million payment of dividends of approximately  million purchases of property and equipment of approximately  million and unfavorable currency exchange fluctuation of approximately  million cash held by our foreign subsidiaries located in germany and the uk totaled approximately  million as of september   and  million as of september   this cash is included in our total cash and cash equivalents reported above we consider this cash to be permanently reinvested into these foreign locations because repatriating it would result in unfavorable tax consequences consequently it is not available for activities that would require it to be repatriated to the us as of september   and september   the company maintained a line of credit that allows for borrowings of up to  million availability under the facility is reduced by outstanding borrowings thereunder the interest rates on outstanding borrowings is london interbank offer rate libor plus  with a floor of  borrowings under the credit agreements are required to be repaid on demand in certain circumstances upon termination of the agreements or may be prepaid by the company without penalty the company had no amounts outstanding under the line of credit during the fiscal years ending september   and  as of september   and september   the company also maintained an inventory line of credit that may be used by the ts segment in the us to purchase inventory from approved vendors with payment terms which exceed those offered by the vendors no interest accrues under the inventory line of credit when advances are paid within terms late payments are subject to an interest charge of prime plus  the credit agreements for the inventory line of credit contain financial covenants which require the company to maintain the following ts segmentspecific financial ratios  a minimum current ratio of   tangible net worth of no less than  million and  a maximum ratio of total liabilities to total net worth of less than  as of september   and september   company borrowings under the inventory line of credit were  million and  million respectively and the company was in compliance with all covenants for more information please refer to note   lines of credit in the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy working capital requirements we may need to access funds through bank loans the equity markets or other means there is no assurance that we will be able to raise any such capital on terms acceptable to us on a timely basis or at all if we are unable to secure additional financing we may not be able to complete development or enhancement of products take advantage of future opportunities respond to competition or continue to effectively operate our business based on our current plans and business conditions management believes that the companys available cash and cash equivalents the cash generated from operations and availability on our lines of credit will be sufficient to provide for the companys working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to uncollectible receivables inventory valuation goodwill and intangibles income taxes deferred compensation revenue recognition retirement plans restructuring costs and contingencies we base our estimates on historical performance and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition valuation allowances specifically the allowance for doubtful accounts and net deferred tax asset valuation allowance inventory valuation intangibles and pension and retirement plans revenue recognition we derive revenue from the sale of integrated
