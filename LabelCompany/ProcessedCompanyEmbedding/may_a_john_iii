hutton and creativecownet all rights reserved article focus john david hutton takes a look at gnomon d training dvds since these dvds are offered one dvd at a time instead of as a set in this article john david reviews the dvds texture mapping i materials texture mapping ii textures and texture mapping iii projections making a training video is tough even if the students are highly motivated and interested in the topic theyre very likely to fall asleep at some point in your tutorials you need to be verywell organized and have a nice onscreen presence something highly underrated the gnomon videos have an advantage in the maya industry presently  theyre pretty much the only folks offering tutorial videos for sale certainly the only folks who have offered such an extensive selection perhaps not for long for maya one thing i like about gnomons structure is that they offer a dvd on one subject not a library just one dvd its good for us fearofcommittal folks who only want to buy one dvd at a time if texturing confuses you or the hypershade window is a mystery their  part texturing dvd might help i like this approach as opposed to total training that offer an entire library of dvds for a decent chunk of change gnomon also offers a bundled package for the beginner as well as bundled packages for character and dynamics doubtless theyll have more bundles available as time progresses check out the website note  or so dvds at roughly  a piece they started out at  you can easily spend about as much on these videos as maya complete  you gnomon folks might consider dropping the price on each dvd just a tad especially since some other production houses might begin to nip at your heels as competition just a personal aside the downside of offering one tape for one subject means software versions differ over time does the instructor consistently use an old version of maya throughout each one of the  training dvds these newer dvds have conveniently used maya  but this will not always be the case as newer maya versions spring up will the student be using a newer or older version of maya than the trainer suddenly the windows are different the tools are located in a different place confusion happens admittedly this is a common problem in the industry and theres no real good way around it except to offer another video covering the same material displaying the new version of maya  perhaps the way theyre doing it now is best since making a new video for maya  texture mapping would be redundant since the core concepts are the same for maya  or  or  i originally wrote a review on the gnomon videos last year when most of their library still consisted of vhs tapes for various reasons the review was delayed eventually i received all three texturing dvds to review and have also purchased  others mostly in the modeling realm so im fairly confident this review will cover the other dvds offered as well im going to first mention the good points i found about their dvd sets and then offer criticisms and possible solutions hopefully by reading the criticisms the authors of these dvds will not get the impression that i think their product is terrible quite the contrary here are some good points i found about their dvds  good scan converter its such an important aspect of instructional videos and these guys have tackled the problem of having a lot of windows on the screen at the same time and keeping them readable its not crystalclear but then its extremely difficult and very expensive to have perfect scan converters if such a thing exists it takes a lot of effort to maneuver around maya with only one limitedsized screen and these folks have tackled the problem brilliantly  good onscreen  offscreen presence similar to onscreen talent having a good onscreen presence is vital to these videos i product thirty and sixty second commercials on a very regular basis as well as produce radio spots i have a special appreciation for folks who can speak to you in a clear way without a lot of pausing uhhh and uhmm breaks good job on this guys a very important exception to the above praise the presenter on the lightingrendering dvd was not a good presenter an extremely smart maya user i can tell but perhaps someone better suited for behind the scenes work just my opinion alex alvarez was probably the most clear and understandable instructor again just my opinion  lower price as noted above these dvds started out at  and lowered by ten dollars a good stride toward their customers but lowering the price even more would probably be appropriate  dvdrom is the best way to go its so convenient to be able to open the scene and play the dvd from the same drive students are highly encouraged to own a dvdrom in their computer even though its not at all necessary gnomon did a good job with the encoding of these dvds and the scene files albeit unorganized are included in an easytofind place for maya users standard default tree structure under the project folder as i worked through the dvds i found them informative yet flawed knowing that this review may be read by not only potential customers of gnomond but also by the folks who have made the dvds i broke my comments up into  sections  a section devoted to the new maya student and the section devoted to the gnomond authors i dont like to criticize or praise a product without giving reasons as well as offering ways they might improve all of these comments pertain to all  texturing dvd sets even though ive seen quite a few others since these notes were taken student  work out while watching the dvds this tip pertains to any instructional dvd i own three total training sets illustrator  photoshop  after effects  full pb set as well as ken larues combustion  training dvds as well as a lot of gnomon dvds for maya and i regularly work out on my gazelle ski trainer while watching these videos it doesnt matter if you miss a lot of it because of distraction the idea is that youll see it once more in the background or subconscious of your mind then again in the foreground or conscious part of your mind as you work along with the projects at your workstation this method is similar to those who study mnemonics and advanced learning techniques in that you are exposed to the material in a subtle fashion then once again in a more deliberate fashion for those more interested in these advanced learning techniques do a search over at amazoncom with keyword mnemonics  keep your pause button handy these guys are smart and good with maya at times theyre moving fairly quickly and at other times youll have to model things yourself to follow along with what theyre saying youll need to hit the pause button a lot to keep up a case can be made that by the time youre watching the texturing dvds you shouldve already went through the modeling dvds and hence had a good feel for modeling if you dont have a good feeling for modeling youll be feeling that hindrance as you go through the texturing dvds because some of the models arent included authors  files not made in ma format offer the included scene files in ma as well as mb format this allows the user to alter the header information in the ma file to be able to open these scene files in different versions of maya this topic comes up a lot on the general forum at highenddcom  some of the files are missing i was very confused on the texturing set the scene files were numbered but were either in the wrong order or were missing entirely when an instructor explains a scene to us we want to follow along simply watching the instructor do his thing in maya is not very helpful not to me at least everything you talk about should be included on the dvd as scene files and everything should be in order in addition the instructor should mention okay now on scene  were going to work with a candle i didnt get the sense that the instructor was working with the same project files that were offered on the dvd briefly i took a note on some of the missing models  scenes  candles car grayscale marble image etc  cant pan around in the perspective window a scenes perspective camera was essentially locked i know there was a perfectly good reason for this but it wasnt mentioned as to why in the dvds if it was mentioned i missed it entirely details like this are very confusing for new users who at times may struggle to keep up with you  some of the scene files used are on different dvds im still a bit confused as to what happened but my best guess is that dvd  has some of dvd s scene files on it and vice versa again the instructor should be using the same exact scene files in the same folders in addition the instructor should be opening the scene files with the student not simply skipping the opening process or rushing through it texturing  has a different scene marked as  than one used in first lecture this may be related to the note above  texturing  in particular seemed to lose me the instructor seemed all over the place and offered little direction ill turn this up and that off this down this down now my alpha is showing that reflection a better way might be a slower version such as now do this see how that affected the reflection now this  offthecuff lectures are a breeding ground for going off tangents it actually takes a lot of effort some practice and a bit of talent to present offthecuff lectures in a nonconfusing way theres all sorts of potential for digressing into unrelated topics and comments im not saying you should write down wordforword the lecture but it might be a good idea to have a good outline on not only the topic but the main ideas important to that topic sitting there as youre capturing your screen movement dont talk about maya show it to us and allow us to follow you on our own workstations thats the most important point of this review  offer quizzes or an interactive summary at the end of each section this one isnt a criticism so much as a suggestion theres so much a maya user needs to know in order to use the program it might be helpful to cover the basics keys they need to know to move around maya and perform various functions  hold the c down to lock to a curve etc  include both the final and the unfinal version some students benefit from dissecting a project file but in my mind its useless to do that here since the point is to follow along and build the scene alongside the instructor trish  chris meyer do this in their excellent after effects training books in that theyll include the scenestartaep and then the sceneendaep for the student to open in case they got lost along the way this would be an excellent habit to pick up on  the uv explanation on the label on texturing disc  was excellent follow this example during the other topics and youll be well on your way to excellence again just my opinion on disc  the explanation was good on how to increase the resolution of our label but also how you showed a better way to accomplish that through ipr rendering you showed a pitfall and a way around it maya is full of pitfalls you should emphasize this more in the other topics as well  also good use of fcheck and a quickie tutorial on how to use it for checking alpha on disc   verbally repeat what youre doing well at least have a clue as to what youre pushing even when you mess up because newbies mess up and hit the wrong keys sometimes too i had to stop the dvd and go look how you inserted your knots without going to the menu first when someones watching your tutorial dvds remember theyre probably pretty new to maya and may be watching them out of order or may have forgotten what theyve learned i give gnomon d training texturing dvds   and  which cover materials textures projections respectively  cows pros a good learning resource but have a remote close at hand to pause and replay a lot cons they need to

commentaries and omitted by popular ones but more than just an analytic key i ii iii john reflects the latest advances in scholarship on greek grammar and linguistics the volume also contains recommendations for further reading and an uptodate bibliography this volume is perfect for students pastors scholars or laity seeking a deeper understanding of the greek biblical text what’s more

and collections by topic title or scripture reference key features focuses on the greek text of   and  john addresses textcritical questions emphasizes the importance of understanding the grammar syntax and linguistic elements of the greek language praise for the print edition this handbook continues the admirable pattern of applied scholarship displayed in the acts volume by providing real help for the student pastor or scholar who wants to make sense of the greek text of the johannine epistles the author’s linguistic training as evidenced in his approach to semantics syntax and
