investor choice tender notice � dear investors last quarter we shared with you our intention to develop a plan to allow you to choose among several options involving your investment in the endowment fund over the last several months we have worked with intermediaries liquidity providers and regulatory authorities to deliver on that plan we are happy to announce that this letter accompanies a tender offer form that will allow you to choose the option that is right for you and your investment portfolio in accordance with the plan we have developed you have a choice among three options you may also select a mix of these options allocating portions of your investment across the different strategies option  remain invested in the endowment fund an actively managed core alternatives vehicle with a focus on difficulttoaccess and niche alternative strategies with low correlation to equities this is the default option � if you do not make an election you will stay invested in the actively managed fund option  enter into a liquidating fund referred to as the passively managed fund or pmf that will distribute cash as the underlying assets of the current portfolio are liquidated we expect that process to take up to ten years if you choose this option you would tender your interest in the endowment fund in exchange for shares in the pmf we refer to this process as the tef tender offer investors who wish to participate in option  must qualify as an accredited investor as defined in the tender offer materials option  sell your pmf investment for cash at a discount to nav the pmf fund will offer to repurchase your shares at a discount reflecting an agreement by the pmf fund to sell its investment to a thirdparty buyer that was selected through a formal competitive bidding process an institutional broker park hill group llc was engaged to run an auction in which thirteen prospective buyers worked alone or together to produce seven unique bids under option  you would first participate in the tef tender process described in option  above and then choose to participate in pmf�s repurchase offer pmf will repurchase your shares based on selling its investment at a corresponding discount to the winning bidder harbourvest � origami structured solutions lp at the tender offer price outlined below and in the enclosed tender offer solicitation we currently expect investors who elect option  to receive cash payment of the net proceeds of the sale in midmay  subject to possible extension for completion of the sale as described below we refer to this process as the pmf early liquidity offer please be aware that events outside of the fund�s control may impact the timing of these tender offers the underlying general partners the managers of the portfolio funds in which the endowment fund invests must approve the split of those investments between the endowment fund and the passively managed fund it is possible that a sufficient amount of the underlying general partners may decline or defer until june�  which would delay the transaction until that date additionally there is a minimum take up condition in the pmf early liquidity offer which stipulates that in the event participation �  in option  is less than  the transaction may not occur in that case investors who select option  will remain invested in the passively managed fund please review the tender offer materials carefully as they contain important disclosures in this regard please pay particular attention to the response deadlines contained in the accompanying tender offer materials if you do not make an election the default will be remaining in the endowment fund under option  comparison of tender options � � � option the endowment fundcontinuing option � option

confidence that a core alternatives strategy focused on niche private investment funds and difficulttoaccess hedge fund strategies with low correlation to equities can serve an important diversifying role in the typical investor�s public equityoriented portfolio we believe that the private portion of the fund holds a mature and varied portfolio of investments diversified by industry region vintage and investment stage that could not be built or bought elsewhere the endowment fund is currently positioned as follows � � �� asset classes �� current�allocationas of  � � allocation range private investments �� equity �� �  � � typically� �� energy �� � �� real estate �� � hedge funds �� macrotrading �� �  � � typically� �� relative�value �� � �� event driven �� � � � liquidity will be provided via periodic tender offer process as approved quarterly by the board the first tender offer is expected to take place no earlier than q future tender offers may be as frequent as quarterly or as infrequent as annually � investors who elect option  may expect to receive  of their nav as calculated on  subject to certain adjustments as described in the tender offer materials these adjustments are currently estimated to have a  to  impact on the price received but may differ based on factors described in the tender offer materials �  beyond the current positions we are excited about the future of the strategy as well the actively managed endowment fund will continue to seek new investment opportunities across the core alternatives spectrum in practice we expect the fund to be tilted toward a midmarket approach to private markets where we believe smaller investors are challenged to build sufficiently diversified portfolios the fund is also positioned to access seeding opportunities and earlystage investments that allow endowment fund investors to capture more economics and reduce overall fees additionally the adviser has made steady progress on identifying managers in the hedge fund space who can potentially deliver returns in a lower more feeefficient manner as part of our commitment to and enthusiasm about the portfolio we are also pleased to inform you that the adviser has redeemed the interest formerly held by morgan creek capital management the adviser is now whollyowned by salient and the salient team as associated persons of the adviser has sole management of the portfolio the investment team is experienced and benefits from a variety of backgrounds chief investment officer lee partridge served in an executive role for the teacher retirement system of texas one of the largest public pension plans in the country chief risk officer ben hunt was formerly an equity longshort portfolio manager portfolio manager bill enszer has run multimanager portfolios for salient for several years and did so previously at redstone asset management as well deputy chief investment officer rusty guinn was the director of texas teachers�  billion strategic partnerships program a multiasset portfolio spanning a similar range of public and private investments director of investments todd centurino was the portfolio manager for texas teachers� multibillion dollar equity market neutral and longshort equity portfolios these professionals are supported by a team of ten investment and due diligence professionals in the management of the endowment fund and the other more than  billion in alternative investments overseen by salient and its affiliates in summary we believe that the actively managed endowment fund focused on difficulttoaccess and niche alternative strategies with low correlation to equities led by a team of experienced investment professionals continues to serve as a viable core alternative allocation in investors� portfolios you should read carefully the updated private placement memorandum of the endowment fund included in your tender offer materials prior to making a decision as to whether to remain invested in the endowment fund if you take no action you will remain invested in the endowment fund by default your investment will not be discounted in any way option  the passively managed fund long term winddown investors who elect the passively managed fund will receive an approximately pro rata portion of the portfolio they own through their investment in the endowment fund as of the closing date unlike option  however the passively managed fund will include no new investments and will emphasize providing investor liquidity over time investors in the pmf should expect the following � � � � as soon as practicable after the acceptance of interests for purchase in the tender offer the adviser will seek to redeem all underlying funds for which it is possible to do so for underlying funds with lockup periods redemptions will be submitted as soon as it is possible we expect that this will accelerate liquidity of a significant portion of the hedge fund portfolio in  �  � � � any distributions of capital or redemptions from underlying managers will be distributed to investors on a quarterly basis subject to the fund holding up to  in cash to back future capital commitments a minimum quarterly distribution of  million and payment of fees and expenses associated with the fund we expect that complete liquidation of the pmf will take up to  years � � � � the fund must continue to honor commitments of capital to private markets funds other than funding these investments and cash management no new investments will be made option  early liquidity offer cash at closing as noted above we developed an option for shareholders to fully and quickly liquidate their investment as part of a tender offer investors who choose to participate in option  would be able to fully liquidate their tef holdings in the coming months the process would include �participating in the tef tender offer that exchanges tef interests for pmf interests and �participating in the pmf early liquidity offer in which pmf will purchase those pmf shares for cash please see the enclosed tender solicitation materials for a complete description of that offer and the related process � � � � as noted in the enclosure the cash price to be paid in the pmf early liquidity offer will be calculated on the basis of tef�s september�  net asset value the reason for the september� nav �as of� date is that the competitive bidding process required significant lead time for due diligence bidding regulatory matters and contract negotiation � � � � this purchase price will be subject to adjustments based on cash flows out of the endowment fund between september�  and the closing date of the transaction and certain expenses of the transaction please carefully review the tender offer materials to understand each of these adjustments and our estimates of their potential impact on proceeds � � � � third party purchasers are in a position to purchase interests in the passively managed fund equivalent to as many interests as investors wish to sell to pmf in the pmf early liquidity offer if you wish to tender your entire interest or a portion thereof at the pmf early liquidity you may do so � � � � the cash proceeds from this option are expected to be paid out in midmay  subject to possible extension for completion of the sale as you consider each of these options we urge you to thoroughly review the tender offer materials including supplemental disclosures of portfolio positions to make your decision among these options consider in particular certain potential tax implications selling your interest at a discount in accordance with option  does not necessarily mean that it will be treated as a capital loss since your account may still have accrued unrealized gains over the full investment period for those who elect option  you should expect a tax estimate in april subject to possible extension for completion of the sale and final�ks in  investors are
