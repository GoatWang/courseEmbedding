introduction to the bible by andrew e arterbury wh bellinger and derek s dodson a new heaven and a new earth reclaiming biblical eschatology by j richard middleton the church according to paul rediscovering the community conformed to christ author james w thompson publisher baker academic publication date  pages  sample pages              the church according to paul was the winner of the  book of the year award from the academy of parish clergy amid conflicting ideas about what the church should be and do in a postchristian climate the missing voice is that of paul the new testament’s most prolific church planter paul faced diverse challenges as he worked to form congregations leading biblical scholar james thompson examines paul’s ministry of planting and nurturing churches in the prechristian world to offer guidance for the contemporary church the church today as then must define itself and its mission among people who have been shaped by other experiences of community thompson shows that paul offers an unprecedented vision of the community that is being conformed to the image of christ he also addresses contemporary misunderstandings of words like missional megachurch and formation always with one foot planted firmly in the academy and the other in the church james thompson has given us a highly insightful theologically rich and timely study of the apostle paul’s view of the church—one of the best pauline ecclesiologies in print thompson argues compellingly that paul’s firstcentury vision of the church as a distinctive community speaks clearly to the twentyfirst century this excellent volume should be studied not only by students of paul but also by all who are rightly concerned about the identity and mission of the church today —michael j gorman raymond e brown professor of biblical and theological studies st mary’s seminary  university james thompson’s the church according to paul is as challenging as it is clever it is clever because thompson takes contemporary visions of the church and replaces the language of their proponents with paul’s own language thereby upturning today’s categories it is challenging because it virtually dares those who are concerned with the state of the church today to rethink the church according to the mind of paul all in all the church according to paul is a useful and quite valuable read for anyone interested in either the church or the bible perhaps even both —raymond f collins visiting scholar department of religious studies brown university diagnoses of the church’s problems and prescriptions for its flourishing abound as james thompson wisely observes however most contemporary discussion of the church shows little evidence of engagement with the letters of paul in this careful volume thompson studies the church in paul’s words and his work in the hope that paul’s rich wisdom might have its rightful place in contemporary christian reflection —beverly roberts gaventa distinguished professor of new testament department of religion baylor university james w thompson is scholar in residence at the graduate school of theology at abilene christian university in abilene texas he is the editor of restoration quarterly and the author of numerous books including moral formation according to paul pastoral ministry according to paul preaching like paul and hebrews in paideia commentaries on the new testament galatians and christian theology justification the gospel and ethics in paul’s letter editors mark w elliott scott j hafemann n t wright and john frederick publisher baker academic publication date  pages  sample pages              the letter to the galatians is a key source for pauline theology as it presents paul’s understanding of justification the gospel and many topics of keen contemporary interest in this volume some of the world’s top christian scholars offer cuttingedge scholarship on how galatians relates to theology and ethics the stellar list of contributors includes john barclay beverly gaventa richard hays bruce mccormack and oliver odonovan as they emphasize the contribution of galatians to christian theology and ethics the contributors explore how exegesis and theology meet critique and inform each other mark w elliott is reader in church history and head of the school of divinity at the university of st andrews scott j hafemann is reader in new testament studies at the university of st andrews he is the author of paul moses and the history of israel the god of promise and the life of faith understanding the heart of the bible and a commentary on  corinthians he is also the editor of biblical theology retrospect and prospect n t wright is research professor of new testament and early christianity at the university

candidate at st andrews is assistant professor and worship coordinator in the college of theology at grand canyon university ancient israel’s history an introduction to issues and sources editors bill t arnold and richard s hess publisher baker academic publication date  pages  sample pages              the history of israel is a muchdebated topic in old testament studies on one side are minimalists who find little of historical value in the hebrew bible on the other side are those who assume the biblical text is a precise historical record many serious students of the bible find themselves between these two positions and would benefit from a careful exploration of issues in israelite history this substantive history of israel textbook values the bible’s historical contribution without overlooking critical issues and challenges featuring the latest scholarship the book introduces students to the current state of research on issues relevant to the study of ancient israel the editors and contributors all top biblical scholars and historians discuss historical evidence in a readable manner using both canonical and chronological lenses to explore israelite history illustrative items such as maps and images visually support the book’s content tables and sidebars are also included those who take the bible seriously have been subjected to continual attack as skeptics make their accusations concerning the historical unreliability of the old testament the search for scholarly responses has often been futile but that is no longer the case the information in this book provided by an exemplary team of scholars will arm readers with ways to answer skeptics equipped with these insightful investigations of the biblical text and the ancient world readers can now offer an informed defense of the historical credibility of the old testament this tool should become well worn as readers glean the vital information it provides —john h walton professor of old testament wheaton college a superb collection orienting readers to historical data and debates relevant to ancient israel—judiciously weighed accessibly presented —mark j boda professor of old testament mcmaster divinity college professor faculty of theology mcmaster university an excellent new resource for those interested in taking seriously all the evidence both biblical and
