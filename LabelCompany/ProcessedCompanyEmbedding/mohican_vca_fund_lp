profile mohican vca fund lp fund investment objectives we begin with the philosophy that the manager and the strategy are inseparable continued success in managing a portfolio is an integration of people and plans that are eminently right for each other such a matchup is essential to achieving whats best for investors convertible arbitrage is a lowrisk moderatereward pursuit of absolute returns that truly hedges against downside loss the hybrid complexity of convertible securities offers opportunity for excellent performance at the cost of daily intensive effort by a highly skilled manager very early in our careers we recognized the validity of trading in convertible securities and dedicated ourselves to developing the full range of skills required to continually excel in the strategy two attributes of our skills and strategy were emphasized at the inception of mohican funds and account for our record of ongoing exceptional results versatility and focus we are equally comfortable in executing inthemoneycash flow trades atnearthemoney gamma trades and creditsensitiveyieldoriented trades we have worked since  in market conditions that have driven convertible securities from equitysensitive to creditsensitive and back versatility means we can handle all trades and conditions our experience also tells us that issuance and hedging of convertible securities are especially well suited for small and mid cap companies and smaller hedge funds the market is less efficient in this part of the space smaller managers can afford to research the greater uncertainties that exist there and allocations of the bonds lack sufficient size to attract large funds we remain focused on small and mid cap companies to make our strategy produce outstanding results weve created a stable organization and environment in which research the core of our strengths is conducted on a totally independent and rigorous basis we screen the small and mid cap universe monitor companies through media and services and modeltest securities for theoretical cheapness through indepth research on a company credit research business understanding phone calls and visits we finetune our model of the security and examine its fit in the portfolio before making an investment decision microsoft personalized ad preferences to opt out of personalized ads in this browser your browser history must allow
