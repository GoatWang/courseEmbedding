we have identified the policies outlined below as critical to our business operations and an understanding of our results of operations the list is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states with no need for management’s judgment in their application the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations when such policies affect our reported and expected financial results for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see the notes to our december   consolidated financial statements note that our preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period we cannot assure that actual results will not differ from those estimates   revenue recognition   revenue from our hotel operations and related services is recognized when earned and realizable revenue is earned and realizable when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists services if requested by the customers have been rendered and are determinable and ability to collect is reasonably assured amounts billed to customers before these criteria being met are deferred   income taxes   we use the liability method of accounting for income taxes under the liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and on the amount of operating loss carryforwards and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to reverse an allowance against deferred tax assets is recorded when it is more likely than not that such tax benefits will not be realized   recent accounting pronouncements   in february  the fasb issued asu no  “leases topic ” to increase the

effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years early adoption is permitted including adoption in an interim period the amendments should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented if it is impracticable to apply the amendments retrospectively for some of the issues the amendments for those issues would be applied prospectively as of the earliest date practicable the company does not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements   in october  the fasb issued asu  “income taxes topic  intraentity transfer of assets other than inventory” which requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intraentity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs asu  will be effective for the company in its first quarter of  the company does not expect that the adoption of this guidance will

amendments affect reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate a variable interest entity in certain situations involving entities under common control specifically the amendments change the evaluation of whether a reporting entity is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity by changing how a reporting entity that is a single decision maker of a variable interest entity treats indirect interests in the entity held through related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity the amendments are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after december   including interim periods within those fiscal years early adoption is permitted the company does not expect that the adoption of this guidance will

revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers asu  will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in us generally accepted accounting principles when it becomes effective and permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method the guidance also requires additional disclosure about the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts in august  the fasb issued asu no  “deferral of the effective date” which defers the effective date for asu  by one year for public entities the guidance in asu  will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december   including interim reporting periods within those periods which means it will be

guidance on principal versus agent considerations in the new revenue recognition standard in april  the fasb issued asu no  “identifying performance obligations and licensing” which reduces the complexity when applying the guidance for identifying performance obligations and improves the operability and understandability of the license implementation guidance in may  the fasb issued asu no

fasb further issued asu  “technical corrections and improvements to topic  revenue from contracts with customers” which makes minor corrections or minor improvements to the codification that are not expected to have a significant effect on current accounting practice or create a significant administrative cost to most entities the amendments are intended to address implementation issues that were raised by stakeholders and provide additional practical expedients to reduce the cost and complexity of applying the new revenue standard these amendments have the same effective date as the new revenue standard preliminarily we plan to adopt topic  in the first quarter of our fiscal  using the retrospective transition method and are continuing to evaluate the impact our pending adoption of topic  will have on our consolidated financial statements the company’s current revenue recognition policies are generally consistent with the new revenue recognition standards set forth in asu  potential adjustments to input measures are not expected to be pervasive to the majority of the company’s contracts while no significant impact is expected upon adoption of the new guidance the company will not be able to make that determination until the time of adoption based upon outstanding contracts at that time   in january  the fasb issued asu no  “business combinations topic  clarifying the definition of a business” the amendments in this asu clarify the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses basically these amendments provide a screen to determine when a set is not a business if the screen is not met the amendments in this asu first require that to be considered a business a set must include at a minimum an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create output and second remove the evaluation of whether a market participant could replace missing elements these amendments take effect for public businesses for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those periods and all other entities should apply these amendments for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within annual periods beginning after

  our management with the participation of our prior principal executive and financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule de of the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act as of the end of the period covered by this report based on that evaluation our chief executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report based on the evaluation of these controls and procedures required by rule db of the exchange act were not effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act i is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the commission’s rules and forms and ii is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management including its principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure as of the end of the period covered by the report we did not have a formal audit committee and there was a lack of segregation of duties   we believe that a control system no matter how well designed and operated cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within a company have been detected   management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting   our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the

reporting as of december   the end of our fiscal year management based its assessment on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso  criteria management’s assessment included evaluation of such elements as the design and operating effectiveness of key financial reporting controls process documentation accounting policies and our overall control environment        based on our assessment management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of the end of the fiscal year to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles   this annual report does not include an attestation report of the company’s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting management’s report was not subject to attestation by the company’s registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the securities and exchange commission that permit the company to provide only management’s report in this annual report   inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls   internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations which include but is not limited to the use of independent professionals for advice and guidance interpretation of existing andor changing rules and principles segregation of management duties scale of organization and personnel factors internal control over financial reporting is a process which involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process and it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate   changes in internal control over financial reporting   there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting as

accounting policies    nature of operations    heyu leisure holidays corporation heyu leisure or the group or “the registrant” was incorporated on july   under the laws of the state of delaware to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking including but not limited to selected mergers and acquisitions the company manages unique budget hotels in china and internationally and luxury hotels that provide executive facilities leisure clubs and the highest level of operational excellence via selected mergers acquisitions and joint ventures the company will attempt to locate and negotiate with a business entity for the combination of that target company with heyu leisure holidays corporation the combination will normally take the form of a merger stockforstock exchange or stockforassets exchange in most instances the target company will wish to structure the business combination to be within the definition of a taxfree reorganization under section  or section  of the internal revenue code of  as amended the company has been formed to provide a method for a foreign or domestic private company to become a reporting company with a class of securities registered under the securities exchange act of     on february   heyu leisure merged with heyu capital ltd “heyu capital” a corporation existing under the laws of hong kong special administrative region of the prc pursuant to the merger the registrant acquired all of the outstanding common shares of heyu capital through the issuance of common shares of the registrant to the shareholders of heyu capital    as a result of the merger and pursuant to the resolution heyu capital has become a whollyowned subsidiary of the registrant and the registrant issued shares of its common stock to shareholders of heyu capital at a rate of  shares of the registrant’s common stock for all heyu capital common share immediately prior to the merger the registrant had  shares of common stock outstanding   following the merger the registrant has  shares of common stock outstanding after the share exchange and the issuance of  common shares to the shareholder of heyu capital   the transaction has been accounted for as a business combination under a method similar to the poolingofinterest method poolingofinterest as the registrant and heyu capital are both under common control with by our majority shareholder in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc”  it indicated that the financial statements of the receiving entity shall report results of operations for the period in which the transfer occurs as though the transfer of net assets or exchange of equity interests had occurred at the beginning of the period results of operations for that period will thus comprise those of the previously separate entities combined from the beginning of the period to the date the transfer is completed and those of the combined operations from that date to the end of the period further in  indicated that the financial statements and financial information presented for prior years also shall be retrospectively adjusted to furnish comparative information all adjusted financial statements and financial summaries shall indicate clearly that financial data of previously separate entities are combined   the operating entity wu jiaer hotel co ltd “wu jiaer ” has been acquired via xiamen heyu hotel management co “xiamen heyu” on january   as a result of the acquisition xiamen heyu has become its immediate holding company heyu capital becomes its intermediate holding company and the registrant has become an ultimate holding company of wu jiaer   in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc”  business combinations we evaluate each investment in a business to determine if we should account for the investment as a costbasis investment an equity investment a business combination or a common control transaction an investment in which we do not have a controlling interest and which we are not the primary beneficiary but where we have the ability to exert significant influence is accounted for under the equity method of accounting for those investments that we account for in accordance asc  business combinations we record the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at our estimate of their fair values on the date of the business combination our assessment of the estimated fair value of each of these can have a material effect on our reported results as intangible assets are amortized over various lives furthermore a change in the estimated fair value of an asset or liability often has a direct impact on the amount to recognize as goodwill which is not amortized often determining the fair value of these assets and liabilities assumed requires an assessment of the expected use of the asset the expected cost to extinguish a liability or our expectations related to the timing and the successful completion of the integration of the business such estimates are inherently difficult and subjective and can have a material impact on our financial statements   f     organizational structure   the following diagram illustrates our corporate and ownership structure the place of formation and the ownership interests of our subsidiaries as of december   after the acquisition      basis of consolidation    the consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of our company and its subsidiaries all significant transactions and balances between our company and its subsidiaries have been eliminated upon consolidation    a subsidiary is an entity in which our company directly or indirectly controls more than one half of the voting power has the power to appoint or remove the majority of the members of the board of directors and has the power to cast a majority of votes at meetings of the board of directors or to govern the financial and operating policies of the investee under a statute or agreement among the shareholders or equity holders    asc  “consolidation” which provides guidance on the identification of and financial reporting for entities over which control is achieved through means other than voting interests requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity    the group evaluate our business relationships such as those with franchisees to identify potential variable interest entities generally these businesses qualify for the business scope exception under the consolidation guidance therefore we have concluded that consolidation of any such entities is not appropriate for the periods    business combinations    us gaap requires that business combinations be accounted for under the acquisition purchase method from january   the group adopted asc  “business combinations” following this adoption the cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the fair values at the date of exchange of the assets given liabilities incurred and equity instruments issued the costs directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed as incurred identifiable assets liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired or assumed are measured separately at their fair value as of the acquisition date irrespective of the extent of any noncontrolling interests the excess of i the total of cost of acquisition the fair value of the noncontrolling interests and the acquisition date fair value of any previously held equity interest in the acquired over ii the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the acquired is recorded as goodwill if the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the entity acquired the difference is recognized directly in the statements of operations    f     the determination and allocation of fair values to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on various assumptions and valuation methodologies requiring considerable management judgment the most significant variables in these valuations are discount rates terminal values the number of years on which to base the cash flow projections and the assumptions and estimates used to determine the cash inflows and outflows management determines discount rates to be used based on the risk inherent in the related activity’s current business model and industry comparisons terminal values are based on the expected life of assets and forecasted life cycle and forecasted cash flows over that period although the group believe that the assumptions applied in the determinations that the group have made are reasonable based on information available at the date of acquisition actual results may differ from the forecasted amounts and the difference could be material    use of estimates    the preparation of audited consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods some of the significant estimates include values and lives assigned to acquired property reserves for customer returns and allowances uncollectible accounts receivable slow moving obsolete andor damaged inventory actual results could differ from those estimates    revenue recognition    revenue from leased hotel is derived from hotel operations mainly including the rental of rooms food and beverages sales from leased hotels revenue is recognized when rooms are occupied and food and beverage are sold persuasive evidence of an arrangement fixed price and service delivered and collection reasonably assured    account receivable net   accounts receivables mainly consist of amounts due from corporate customers travel agents hotel guests and credit card receivables which are recognized and carried at the original invoice amount less an allowance for doubtful accounts the group establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts primarily based on the age of the receivables and factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers allowance for account receivable amounted to  and  as of december   and  respectively   inventories    inventories mainly consist of food and beverages small appliances bedding and daily consumables small appliances bedding and daily consumables replacement are expensed when used   property and leasehold improvements net    property and leasehold improvements net are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization the renovations betterments and related expenses incurred during the construction are capitalized depreciation and amortization of property and equipment is provided using the straight line method over their expected useful lives the expected useful lives are as follows    leasehold improvements  years furniture fixtures and equipment  years   construction in progress represents leasehold improvements under construction or being installed and is stated at cost cost comprises original cost of property and equipment installation construction and other direct costs construction in progress is transferred to leasehold improvements and depreciation commences when the asset is ready for its intended use the useful live for leasehold improvement is shorter of the term of the lease or the estimated useful lives of the assets    f     impairment of longlived assets   the group evaluates its longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable when these events occur the group measures impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition if the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets the group recognizes an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of these assets there is no impairment as of december     business tax and related taxes    the group is subject to business tax education surtax and urban maintenance and construction tax on the services provided in the prc such taxes are primarily levied based on revenue at applicable rates and are recorded as a reduction of revenue   income tax    the group has implemented certain provisions of asc  income taxes “asc ” which clarifies the accounting and disclosure for uncertain tax positions as defined asc  seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement related to accounting for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases valuation allowances are established when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the group adopted the provisions of asc  and have analyzed filing positions in each prc jurisdictions where we are required to file income tax returns as well as all open tax years in these jurisdictions the group has identified the prc as our “major” tax jurisdiction generally the group remains subject to prc examination of our income tax returns annually   the group believes that our income tax positions and deductions will be sustained by an audit and do not anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material change to our financial position therefore no reserves for uncertain income tax positions have been recorded pursuant to asc  in addition the group did not record a cumulative effect adjustment related to the adoption of asc  our policy for recording interest and penalties associated with incomebased tax audits is to record such items as a component of income taxes   intangible assets   intangible assets with definite useful lives representing software are amortized over their estimated useful lives of  years using the straightline method which represents the economic benefit pattern of the intangible assets   lease    a lease of which substantially all the benefits and risks incidental to ownership remain with the lessor is classified as an operating lease the group is currently classified it as operating lease    concentration of risk    financial instruments that potentially expose the group to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash accounts receivable and amount due from related parties the group places its cash with high quality banking institutions the group didn’t have cash balances in excess of the federal deposit insurance corporation limit as of december   and december   respectively and the group periodically evaluates the creditworthiness of the existing customers in determining an allowance for doubtful accounts primarily based upon the age of the receivables and factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers   fair value    the group follows guidance for accounting for fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair value measurements of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis the guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  measurements and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs level  measurements the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows    level  inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the group has the ability to access at the measurement date    level  inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level  that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly    level  inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability     f     the group monitors the market conditions and evaluates the fair value hierarchy levels at least quarterly for any transfers in and out of the levels of the fair value hierarchy the group elects to disclose the fair value measurement at the beginning of the reporting period during which the transfer occurred    foreign currency translation   the functional and reporting currency of the company is the united states dollar us dollar the financial records of the company located in the hong kong and prc are maintained in their local currency the renminbi rmb and hong kong dollar “hkd” which are the functional currency of these entities   monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date revenues expenses gains and losses are translated using the average rate for the year retained earnings and equity are translated using the historical rate translation adjustments are reported as cumulative translation adjustments and are shown as a separate component of other comprehensive income   comprehensive income loss    comprehensive income loss is defined to include all changes in equity except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners among other disclosures asc  comprehensive income requires that all items are required to be recognized under current accounting standards as components of comprehensive loss are reported in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements for the periods presented the group’s comprehensive loss includes net loss and foreign currency translation adjustments and is presented in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss    concentration of risk    financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash the company places its cash with high quality banking institutions the company did not have cash balances in excess of the federal deposit insurance corporation limit as of december   and december   respectively   recent accounting pronouncements   in february  the fasb

asset for virtually all lease contracts it also requires additional disclosures about leasing arrangements asu  is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   and requires a modified retrospective approach to adoption early adoption is permitted the company does not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements   in august  the fasb issued asu no  “statement of cash flows topic  classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments to address diversity in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows” the amendments provide guidance on the following eight specific cash flow issues  debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs

predominance principle the amendments are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years early adoption is permitted including adoption in an interim period the amendments should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented if it is impracticable to apply the amendments retrospectively for some of the issues the amendments for those issues would be applied prospectively as of the earliest date practicable the company does not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements   in october  the fasb issued asu  “income taxes topic  intraentity transfer of assets other than inventory” which requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intraentity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs asu  will be effective for the company in its first quarter of  the company does not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements   f     in october  the fasb issued asu  “consolidation topic  interests held through related parties that are under common control” the amendments affect reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate a variable interest entity in certain situations involving entities under common control specifically the amendments change the evaluation of whether a reporting entity is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity by changing how a reporting entity that is a single decision maker of a variable interest entity treats indirect interests in the entity held through related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity the amendments are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after december   including interim periods within those fiscal years early adoption is permitted the company does not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements   in may  the fasb issued asu no  “revenue from contracts with customers topic ” asu  requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers asu  will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in us generally accepted accounting principles when it becomes effective and permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method the guidance also requires additional disclosure about the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts in august  the fasb issued asu no  “deferral of the effective date” which defers the effective date for asu  by one year for public entities the guidance in asu  will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december   including interim reporting periods within those periods which means it will be effective for the company’s fiscal year beginning january   in march  the fasb issued asu no  “principal versus agent considerations reporting revenue versus net” which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations in the new revenue recognition standard in april  the fasb issued asu no  “identifying performance obligations and licensing” which reduces the complexity when applying the guidance for identifying performance obligations and improves the operability and understandability of the license implementation guidance in may  the fasb issued asu no  “narrowscope improvements and practical expedients” which amends the guidance on transition collectability noncash consideration and the presentation of sales and other similar taxes in december  the fasb further issued asu  “technical corrections and improvements to topic  revenue from contracts with customers” which makes minor corrections or minor improvements to the codification that are not expected to have a significant effect on current accounting practice or create a significant administrative cost to most entities the amendments are intended to address implementation issues that were raised by stakeholders and provide additional practical expedients to reduce the cost and complexity of applying the new revenue standard these amendments have the same effective date as the new revenue standard preliminarily we plan to adopt topic  in the first quarter of our fiscal  using the retrospective transition method and are continuing to evaluate the impact our pending adoption of topic  will have on our consolidated financial statements the company’s current revenue recognition policies are generally consistent with the new revenue recognition standards set forth in asu  potential adjustments to input measures are not expected to be pervasive to the majority of the company’s contracts while no significant impact is expected upon adoption of the new guidance the company will not be able to make that determination until the time of adoption based upon outstanding contracts at that time   in january  the fasb issued asu no  “business combinations topic  clarifying the definition of a business” the amendments in this asu clarify the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses basically these amendments provide a screen to determine when a set is not a business if the screen is not met the amendments in this asu first require that to be considered a business a set must include at a minimum an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create output and second remove the evaluation of whether a market participant could replace missing elements these amendments take effect for public businesses for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those periods and all other entities should apply these amendments for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within annual periods beginning after december   the company does not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements

corporation notes to condensed consolidated financial statements unaudited   note  nature of operations and summary of significant accounting policies   nature of operations   heyu leisure holidays corporation heyu leisure or the group was incorporated on july   under the laws of the state of delaware   on february   heyu leisure holiday corp “heyu leisure” or the “group” or the “registrant” merged with heyu capital ltd “heyu capital” a corporation existing under the laws of hong kong special administrative region of the prc pursuant to the merger the registrant acquired all of the outstanding common shares of heyu capital through the issuance of common shares of the registrant to the shareholders of heyu capital   as a result of the merger and pursuant to the resolution heyu capital has become a whollyowned subsidiary of the registrant and the registrant issued shares of its common stock to shareholders of heyu capital at a rate of  shares of the registrant’s common stock for all heyu capital common share immediately prior to the merger the registrant had  shares of common stock outstanding   following the merger the registrant has  shares of common stock outstanding after the share exchange and the issuance of  common shares to the shareholder of heyu capital     the transaction has been accounted for as a business combination under a method similar to the poolingofinterest method poolingofinterest as the registrant and heyu capital are both under common control with by our majority shareholder in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc”  it indicated that the financial statements of the receiving entity shall report results of operations for the period in which the transfer occurs as though the transfer of net assets or exchange of equity interests had occurred at the beginning of the period results of operations for that period will thus comprise those of the previously separate entities combined from the beginning of the period to the date the transfer is completed and those of the combined operations from that date to the end of the period further in  indicated that the financial statements and financial information presented for prior years also shall be retrospectively adjusted to furnish comparative information all adjusted financial statements and financial summaries shall indicate clearly that financial data of previously separate entities are combined              heyu leisure holidays corporation notes to condensed consolidated financial statements unaudited   the operating entity wujiaer hotel co ltd “wujiaer” has been acquired via xiamen heyu hotel management co “xiamen heyu” on january   as a result of the acquisition xiamen heyu has become its immediate holding company heyu capital becomes its intermediate holding company and the registrant has become an ultimate holding company of wujiaer   in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc”  business combinations we evaluate each investment in a business to determine if we should account for the investment as a costbasis investment an equity investment a business combination or a common control transaction an investment in which we do not have a controlling interest and which we are not the primary beneficiary but where we have the ability to exert significant influence is accounted for under the equity method of accounting for those investments that we account for in accordance asc  business combinations we record the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at our estimate of their fair values on the date of the business combination our assessment of the estimated fair value of each of these can have a material effect on our reported results as intangible assets are amortized over various lives furthermore a change in the estimated fair value of an asset or liability often has a direct impact on the amount to recognize as goodwill which is not amortized often determining the fair value of these assets and liabilities assumed requires an assessment of the expected use of the asset the expected cost to extinguish a liability or our expectations related to the timing and the successful completion of the integration of the business such estimates are inherently difficult and subjective and can have a material impact on our financial statements   organizational structure   the following diagram illustrates our corporate and ownership structure the place of formation and the ownership interests of our subsidiaries as of september   after the acquisition          basis of presentation   the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission sec for interim financial information accordingly they do not include all of the information and notes required by us gaap for complete financial statements the accompanying unaudited financial statements include all adjustments composed of normal recurring adjustments considered necessary by management to fairly state our results of operations financial position and cash flows the operating results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for any other interim period or for the full year these unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in our annual report on form k for the period ended december   as filed with the sec             heyu leisure holidays corporation notes to condensed consolidated financial statements unaudited   basis of consolidation   the consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of our company and its subsidiaries all significant transactions and balances between our company and its subsidiaries have been eliminated upon consolidation   a subsidiary is an entity in which our company directly or indirectly controls more than one half of the voting power has the power to appoint or remove the majority of the members of the board of directors and has the power to cast a majority of votes at meetings of the board of directors or to govern the financial and operating policies of the investee under a statute or agreement among the shareholders or equity holders   asc  “consolidation” which provides guidance on the identification of and financial reporting for entities over which control is achieved through means other than voting interests requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity   the group evaluates our business relationships such as those with franchisees to identify potential variable interest entities generally these businesses qualify for the business scope exception under the consolidation guidance therefore we have concluded that consolidation of any such entities is not appropriate for the periods   business combinations   us gaap requires that business combinations be accounted for under the acquisition purchase method from january   the group adopted asc  “business combinations” following this adoption the cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the fair values at the date of exchange of the assets given liabilities incurred and equity instruments issued the costs directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed as incurred identifiable assets liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired or assumed are measured separately at their fair value as of the acquisition date irrespective of the extent of any noncontrolling interests the excess of i the total of cost of acquisition the fair value of the noncontrolling interests and the acquisition date fair value of any previously held equity interest in the acquired over ii the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the acquired is recorded as goodwill if the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the entity acquired the difference is recognized directly in the statements of operations    the determination and allocation of fair values to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on various assumptions and valuation methodologies requiring considerable management judgment the most significant variables in these valuations are discount rates terminal values the number of years on which to base the cash flow projections and the assumptions and estimates used to determine the cash inflows and outflows management determines discount rates to be used based on the risk inherent in the related activity’s current business model and industry comparisons terminal values are based on the expected life of assets and forecasted life cycle and forecasted cash flows over that period although the group believe that the assumptions applied in the determinations that the group have made are reasonable based on information available at the date of acquisition actual results may differ from the forecasted amounts and the difference could be material   use of estimates   the preparation of unaudited consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods actual results could differ from those estimates   revenue recognition   revenue from leased hotel is derived from hotel operations mainly including the rental of rooms food and beverages sales from leased hotels revenue is recognized when rooms are occupied and food and beverage are sold persuasive evidence of an arrangement fixed price and service delivered and collection reasonably assured             heyu leisure holidays corporation notes to condensed consolidated financial statements unaudited   account receivable net   accounts receivables mainly consist of amounts due from corporate customers travel agents hotel guests and credit card receivables which are recognized and carried at the original invoice amount less an allowance for doubtful accounts the group establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts primarily based on the age of the receivables and factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers   inventories   inventories mainly consist of food and beverages small appliances bedding and daily consumables small appliances bedding and daily consumables replacement are expensed when used   property and leasehold improvements net   property and leasehold improvements net are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization the renovations betterments and related expenses incurred during the construction are capitalized depreciation and amortization of property and equipment is provided using the straight line method over their expected useful lives the expected useful lives are as follows   leasehold improvements  years furniture fixtures and equipment  years   construction in progress represents leasehold improvements under construction or being installed and is stated at cost cost comprises original cost of property and equipment installation construction and other direct costs construction in progress is transferred to leasehold improvements and depreciation commences when the asset is ready for its intended use the useful live for leasehold improvement is shorter of the term of the lease or the estimated useful lives of the assets   impairment of longlived assets   the group evaluates its longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable when these events occur the group measures impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition if the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets the group recognizes an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of these assets there is no impairment as of september                heyu leisure holidays corporation notes to condensed consolidated financial statements unaudited   business tax and related taxes   the group is subject to business tax education surtax and urban maintenance and construction tax on the services provided in the prc such taxes are primarily levied based on revenue at applicable rates and are recorded as a reduction of revenue   income tax   the group has implemented certain provisions of asc  income taxes “asc ” which clarifies the accounting and disclosure for uncertain tax positions as defined asc  seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement related to accounting for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases valuation allowances are established when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the group adopted the provisions of asc  and have analyzed filing positions in each prc jurisdictions where we are required to file income tax returns as well as all open tax years in these jurisdictions the group has identified the prc as our “major” tax jurisdiction generally the group remains subject to prc examination of our income tax returns annually   the group believes that our income tax positions and deductions will be sustained by an audit and do not anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material change to our financial position therefore no reserves for uncertain income tax positions have been recorded pursuant to asc  in addition the group did not record a cumulative effect adjustment related to the adoption of asc  our policy for recording interest and penalties associated with incomebased tax audits is to record such items as a component of income taxes   intangible assets   intangible assets with definite useful lives representing software are amortized over their estimated useful lives of  years using the straightline method which represents the economic benefit pattern of the intangible assets   lease   a lease of which substantially all the benefits and risks incidental to ownership remain with the lessor is classified as an operating lease the group is currently classified it as operating lease   concentration of risk   financial instruments that potentially expose the group to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and accounts receivable the group places its cash with high quality banking institutions the group didn’t have cash balances in excess of the federal deposit insurance corporation limit as of september   and december   respectively and the group periodically evaluates the creditworthiness of the existing customers in determining an allowance for doubtful accounts primarily based upon the age of the receivables and factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers   fair value   the group follows guidance for accounting for fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair value measurements of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis the guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  measurements and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs level  measurements the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows              heyu leisure holidays corporation notes to condensed consolidated financial statements unaudited   level  inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the group has the ability to access at the measurement date   level  inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level  that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly   level  inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability   the group monitors the market conditions and evaluates the fair value hierarchy levels at least quarterly for any transfers in and out of the levels of the fair value hierarchy the group elects to disclose the fair value measurement at the beginning of the reporting period during which the transfer occurred   foreign currency translation   the functional and reporting currency of the company is the united states dollar us dollar the financial records of the company located in the hong kong and prc are maintained in their local currency the renminbi rmb and hong kong dollar “hkd” which are the functional currency of these entities   monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date revenues expenses gains and losses are translated using the average rate for the year retained earnings and equity are translated using the historical rate translation adjustments are reported as cumulative translation adjustments and are shown as a separate component of other comprehensive income   comprehensive loss   comprehensive loss is defined to include all changes in equity except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners among other disclosures asc  comprehensive income requires that all items are required to be recognized under current accounting standards as components of comprehensive loss are reported in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements for the periods presented the group’s comprehensive loss includes net loss and foreign currency translation adjustments and is presented in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss   concentration of risk   financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash the company places its cash with high quality
