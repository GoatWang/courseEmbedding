profitability and leverage are individual components not the primary determinants of a business’s overall intrinsic value we research and value each company based on a rigorous and consistent methodology emphasizing longerterm growth and expected free cash flow generation we seek to buy competitively advantaged companies with secular growth prospects strong financial profiles and attractive returns on invested capital we manage investment risk and estimate potential return by investing in securities at significant discount to our estimate of a firm’s longerterm value junctures at which a company’s market valuation reflects potentially negative future scenarios at odds with more likely longer term outcomes we are unconstrained equity managers exploring investment opportunities across market capitalizations and in both highgrowth and mature companies fixed income investment process turtle creek management assembles diversified portfolios of high quality corporate treasury agency and municipal bonds with the primary goals of portfolio risk reduction and income generation we utilize a fundamental credit analysis process analyzing the credit quality and duration risk of individual bonds and focusing on attractive relative valuations to the broader universe of fixed income securities we maintain an intermediate duration for each portfolio ten years or less to dampen the impact of potential interest rate movements on a portfolio’s value to ensure best pricing and execution and enhance portfolio yield we avoid the traditional inventory approach to bond sourcing we instead maintain a proactive auction approach consistently sourcing multiple bids and offers for any single issue across a large group of broker counterparties disclosures important
