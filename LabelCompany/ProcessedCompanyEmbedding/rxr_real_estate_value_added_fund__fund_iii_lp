frequently asked questions q what is northstarrxr new york metro real estate inc a we were formed as a maryland corporation to acquire highquality commercial real estate including valueadd real estate investment opportunities concentrated in the new york metropolitan area defined by us to mean within  miles of new york city which we refer to as the new york metropolitan area and in particular new york city with a focus on office and mixeduse properties and a lesser emphasis on multifamily properties we believe that combining core property investments with valueadd opportunities may create a balanced portfolio that may deliver capital appreciation cash flow and riskadjusted returns we intend to complement this strategy by originating and acquiring i cre debt including subordinate loans and participations in such loans and preferred equity interests and ii joint ventures and partnership interests in cre related investments we expect that a majority of our capital will be invested in commercial real estate located in the new york metropolitan area and the remaining portion in cre debt and securities secured primarily by collateral in the new york metropolitan area we also anticipate that more than a majority of our investments will be located in new york city and that the remaining portion of our investments will be located in surrounding suburban markets within the new york metropolitan area we cannot however predict our actual allocation by investment type or geography of our assets under management at this time because such allocation also will be dependent in part on the market conditions market opportunities and upon the amount of financing we are able to obtain with respect to each asset class in which we invest we expect to acquire more than a majority of our investments through joint venture arrangements with rxr real estate value added fund  fund iii lp or rxr value added fund iii an institutional real estate investment fund affiliated with rxr one of our cosponsors or future funds or investment entities advised by affiliates of rxr in addition we may invest directly in rxr value added fund iii as well as current or future funds or investment entities managed or advised by affiliates of rxr we may also complete investments with rxr’s substrategy entity rxr new york metro emerging submarket venture lp or rxr esm venturethe use of the terms northstarrxr our company we us or our in this prospectus refer to northstarrxr new york metro real estate inc and its consolidated subsidiaries acting through our external advisor and subadvisor unless the context indicates otherwisewe are externally advised by cni nsrxr advisors llc or our advisor and rxr ntr subadvisor llc or our subadvisor and collectively with our advisor our advisor entities pursuant to the subadvisory agreement among us our advisor and subadvisor our subadvisor acting on behalf of our advisor will conduct certain aspects of our operations including sourcing investment opportunities and managing our portfolio of real estate investments we have no paid employees q who might benefit from an investment in shares of our common stock a an investment in our shares may be beneficial for you if you i meet the minimum suitability standards described in this prospectus ii seek to diversify your personal portfolio with a reit investment focused on acquiring a portfolio of highquality commercial real estate properties and to a lesser extent cre debt and securities iii seek to receive some current income iv seek to preserve capital v seek capital appreciation and vi are able to hold your investment for at least five years following the completion of our offering stage or for longer consistent with our liquidity strategy on the other hand we caution persons who require liquidity guaranteed income or who seek a shortterm investment that an investment in our shares will not meet those needs q what are the major risks of investing in us a we have a limited operating history and our advisor and subadvisor on whom we will depend to select our investments and conduct our operations are both also recentlyformed companies since this is a blindpool offering you will not have an opportunity to evaluate our investments before we make them and our investments may not be identified when you invest our investments in commercial real estate properties and cre debt and securities may lose their value our tenants may not be able to make lease payments and our borrowers may not be able to make debt payments in addition our acquisition strategy with valueadd real estate investment opportunities may involve a higher risk of loss than would a strategy of investing in stabilized properties and makes our future performance more difficult to predict we expect that a substantial portion of our investments will be concentrated geographically in the new york metropolitan area and anything that adversely affects the cre market in this area could adversely affect us in addition our organizational documents permit us to pay distributions to our stockholders from any source including from borrowings sale of assets and from offering proceeds or we may make distributions in the form of taxable stock dividends we have not established a limit on the amount of proceeds we may use to fund distributions we have paid and may continue to pay distributions from sources other than our cash flow from operations including from offering proceeds and as a result we will have less cash available for investments and your overall return may be reduced you should carefully review the “risk factors” section of this prospectus which contains a detailed discussion of the material risks that you should consider before you invest in shares of our common stock q what is a reit a in general a reit is an entity that • combines the capital of many investors to acquire or provide financing for a diversified portfolio of real estate investments under professional management some of which may focus on a particular property type or geographic location • is able to qualify as a “real estate investment trust” for us federal income tax purposes and is therefore generally not subject to federal corporate income taxes on its net income that is distributed which substantially eliminates the “double taxation” treatment ie taxation at both the corporate and stockholder levels that generally results from investments in a corporation and • pays distributions to investors of at least  of its annual ordinary taxable income in this prospectus we refer to an entity that qualifies and elects to be taxed as a reit for us federal income tax purposes as a reit we intend to make an election to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes commencing with the taxable year that ended on december   q why should i invest in real estate investments a allocating some portion of your investment portfolio to real estate investments may provide you with portfolio diversification reduction of overall risk a hedge against inflation and riskadjusted returns for these reasons real estate has been embraced as a major asset class for purposes of asset allocations within investment portfolios although institutional investors can invest directly in real estate investments and on substantially different terms than individual investors we believe that individual investors can also benefit by adding a real estate component to their investment portfolios you and your financial advisor should determine whether investing in real estate through a company with a portfolio of commercial real estate concentrated on investing in highquality commercial real estate including valueadd real estate investment opportunities in the new york metropolitan area and in particular new york city would benefit your investment portfolio q what kind of offering is this a through our dealer manager we are offering a maximum of  in shares of common stock in a continuous public offering of which  in shares are being offered pursuant to our primary offering or our primary offering and  in shares are being offered pursuant to our drp which are herein collectively referred to as our offering we are offering shares in our primary offering on a “best efforts” basis at  per class a share  per class t share and  per class i share and shares in our drp at  per class a share  per class t share and  per class i share discounts are also available to investors who purchase  or more in class a shares of our common stock and to other categories of investors we reserve the right to reallocate shares of our common stock being offered between our primary offering and our drp q why are we offering three classes of our common stock and what are the similarities and differences between the classes a  we are offering three classes of our common stock in order to provide investors with more flexibility in making their investment in us in determining to offer three classes of shares of common stock our board of directors took into consideration a number of factors including recent amendments to financial industry regulatory authority or finra rule  and nasd rule  these amendments require investor account statements to reflect an estimated value per share as determined based on either the net investment method or appraised value method the net investment method may only be used before the second anniversary of breaking escrow and determines the estimated value per share by deducting related offering and organizational expenses commissions and dealer manager fees from the public offering price the appraised value method requires independent third parties to determine or provide material assistance in the process of determining the estimated net asset value of the company’s portfolio in general we anticipate that class a shares class t shares and class i shares will have the same estimated value per share as reflected on investor account statements each share of our common stock regardless of class will be entitled to one vote per share on matters presented to the common stockholders for approval the differences between each class relate to the offering price per share selling commissions and other underwriting compensation payable in respect of each class as further described below class a shares have higher frontend fees including higher selling commissions and higher dealer manager fees compared to class t shares these fees are paid at the time of the purchase of the class a shares in the primary offering there are no distribution fees paid on class a shares class t shares have lower frontend fees paid at the time of the purchase of the class t shares in the primary offering compared to class a shares subject to among other things the  limit on underwriting compensation we will pay an ongoing distribution fee in an amount equal to  per annum of the then current primary offering price per class t share or in certain cases the amount of our estimated net assets value per share payable on a monthly basis this fee is not paid on class a shares and will result in the per share distributions on class t shares being less than the per share distributions on class a shares or class i shares there is no assurance that we will pay distributions in any particular amount if at all class i shares have no front end fees and no distribution fees the following summarizes the differences in fees and selling commissions among the classes of our common stock   class a class t class i initial offering price    selling commission per share   none dealer manager per share   none annual distribution fee per share none   none  the distribution fee is calculated on outstanding class t shares issued in the primary offering in an amount equal to  per annum of the gross offering price per share or if we are no longer offering shares in a public offering the most recent gross offering price per share or the estimated per share value of class t shares if any has been disclosed we will cease paying distribution fees with respect to each class t share on the earliest to occur of the following i a listing of shares of our common stock on a national securities exchange ii such class t share is no longer outstanding iii our dealer manager’s determination that total underwriting compensation from all sources including dealer manager fees selling commissions distribution fees and any other underwriting compensation paid to participating broker dealers with respect to all class a shares class t shares and class i shares would be in excess of  of the gross proceeds of the primary portion of this offering or iv the end of the month in which the transfer agent on our behalf determines that total underwriting compensation with respect to the primary class t shares held by a stockholder within his or her particular account including dealer manager fees selling commissions and distribution fees would be in excess of  of the total gross offering price at the time of the investment in the class t shares held in such account we cannot predict if or when this will occur all class t shares will automatically convert into class a shares upon a listing of shares of our common stock on a national securities exchange with respect to item iv above all of the class t shares held in a stockholder’s account will automatically convert into class a shares as of the last calendar day of the month in which the  limit on a particular account is reached with respect to the conversion of class t shares into class a shares each class t share will convert into an amount of class a shares based on the respective net asset value per share for each class stockholders will receive notice that their class t shares have been converted into class a shares in accordance with industry practice at that time which we expect to be either a transaction confirmation from the transfer agent notification from the transfer agent or notification through the next account statement following the conversion we currently expect that the conversion will be on a oneforone basis as we expect the net asset value per share of each class a share and class t share to be the same except in the unlikely event that the distribution fees payable by us exceed the amount otherwise available for distribution to holders of class t shares in a particular period prior to the deduction of the distribution fees in which case the excess will be accrued as a reduction to the net asset value per share of each class t share see “description of capital stock—distributions”   our dealer manager may enter into participating dealer agreements that provide for our dealer manager to pay a distribution fee of up to  over a maximum eightyear period in connection with the sale of class i shares in our primary offering we will not reimburse our dealer manager for its payment of these fees and such fees will be subject to the limitations on underwriting compensation under applicable finra rules see “plan of distribution”our class a shares class t shares and class i shares are available for different categories of investors class a shares and class t shares each are available for purchase by the general public class i shares may generally be purchased only by investors who pay an assetbased fee for investment advisory services such as clients of registered investment advisors or brokerdealer customers who have socalled wrap accounts see “plan of distribution” the fees and expenses listed above will be payable on a classspecific basis the per share amount of distributions on class a shares and class i shares will differ from class t shares because of different classspecific expenses specifically distributions paid with respect to all class t shares including those issued pursuant to our drp will be lower than those paid with respect to class a shares and class i shares because the amount available for distributions on all class t shares will be reduced by the amount of distribution fees payable with respect to the class t shares issued in the primary offering see “description of capital stock” for more information concerning the differences between the class a shares class t shares and class i shares in the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation dissolution or winding up of us or any liquidating distribution of our assets then such assets or the proceeds therefrom will be distributed between the holders of class a class t and class i shares ratably in proportion to the respective net asset value for each class until the net asset value for each class has been paid we expect the estimated net asset value per share of each class a share class t share and class i share to be the same except in the unlikely event that the distribution fees exceed the amount otherwise available for distribution to holders of class t shares in a particular period prior to the deduction of the distribution fees in which case the excess will be accrued as a reduction to the estimated net asset value per share of each class t share which would result in the net asset value and distributions upon liquidation with respect to class t shares being lower than the net asset value and distributions upon liquidation with respect to class a shares and class i shares each holder of shares of a particular class of common stock will be entitled to receive proportionately with each other holder of shares of such class that portion of the aggregate assets available for distribution as the number of outstanding shares of the class held by such holder bears to the total number of outstanding shares of such class then outstanding q what is the experience of your colony northstar sponsor a colony northstar is a global real estate and investment management firm formed as a result of the mergers of nsam our prior cosponsor colony northstar a wholly owned subsidiary of nsam colony and northstar realty effective as of january   as a result of the mergers colony northstar became an internallymanaged equity reit with a diversified real estate and investment management platform publicly traded on the nyse under the symbol “clns” and succeeded nsam as our cosponsor cni nsrxr advisors llc as successor to nsam jnsrxr ltd or our advisor is now a subsidiary of colony northstar the mergers had no material impact on our operations colony northstar has significant property holdings in the healthcare industrial and hospitality sectors other real estate equity and debt investments and an embedded institutional and retail investment management business and had assets under management of approximately  billion as of december   adjusted for completion of the mergers colony northstar manages capital on behalf of its stockholders as well as institutional and retail investors in private funds nontraded and traded reits and registered investment companies colony northstar has approximately  employees worldwide with its principal executive office located in los angeles california and additional offices located across seventeen cities in ten countries colony northstar’s management team averages over  years of relevant business experience prior to the mergers nsam was a global asset management firm focused on strategically managing real estate and other investment platforms in the united states and internationally including substantial business raising and managing capital in the retail marketplace accessing a variety of pools of capital through various vehicles that include reits and closedend funds including northstar real estate income trust inc or

companies and the retail companies together with any other investment vehicles sponsored or advised by colony northstar collectively as the clns managed companies q what is the experience of your rxr sponsor a rxr is a leading real estate owner manager and developer in the new york metropolitan area which was formed subsequent to the sale of reckson associates realty corp or reckson a publicly traded reit by several of the senior executives of reckson to sl green realty corp or sl green in january  one of the largest public real estate management buyouts in reit history as of december   rxr’s operating platform managed  commercial real estate properties and investments with an aggregate gross asset value of approximately  billion compromising approximately  million square feet of commercial operating properties and approximately  multifamily and for sale units under active development in the new york metropolitan area rxr has not previously sponsored other nontraded public reits affiliates of the rxr sponsor and the rxr subadvisor advise other funds with respect to real estate assets and projects for more information regarding rxr see “prospectus summary—our sponsors—rxr” q how do we differ from the other publicly traded and public nontraded reits sponsored or managed by colony northstar one of our cosponsors including northstar income northstar income ii and northstar healthcare a colony northstar manages capital on behalf of its stockholders as well as sponsors and manages the clns managed companies including us and three other existing public nontraded reits northstar income northstar income ii and northstar healthcare in addition colony northstar sponsors additional private fund and registered investment companies and expects to sponsor additional investment vehicles in the future we differ from northstar income northstar income ii and northstar healthcare in several respects northstar income and northstar income ii have a substantially similar investment strategy which is focused on originating acquiring and managing a diversified portfolio of cre debt and securities northstar income successfully closed its primary offering on july   and invested substantially all its offering proceeds although northstar income may make investments in the future with proceeds from the sale or repayment of investments northstar income ii successfully completed its offering stage in november  and expects that a majority of its investment portfolio will continue to be comprised of cre debt northstar healthcare completed its offering stage in january  and is still investing its capital however its investment strategy is focused on healthcare real estate in contrast we were formed to primarily acquire highquality commercial real estate including valueadd real estate investment opportunities concentrated in the new york metropolitan area and in particular new york city with a focus on office and mixeduse properties and a lesser emphasis on multifamily properties we intend to complement this strategy by originating and acquiring a diversified portfolio of cre debt and securities secured primarily by collateral in the new york metropolitan area as a result our geographic concentration may be more targeted than that of northstar income northstar income ii and northstar healthcare and our investment strategy does not primarily focus on investments in healthcare real estate or cre debt we also differ from colony northstar and the northstar listed companies colony northstar which is the parent company to northstar realty following the mergers is a diversified commercial real estate company and while it makes cre investments in the new york metropolitan area it also invests in multiple cre asset classes that may take the form of acquiring real estate originating or acquiring senior or subordinate loans as well as pursuing opportunistic cre investments both in the united states and internationally northstar europe is a europeanfocused commercial real estate company with predominantly prime office properties in key cities within germany the united kingdom and france and therefore has a substantially different investment focus q will you compete with other vehicles sponsored by colony northstar and rxr a although our geographic concentration may be more targeted than that of northstar income northstar income ii and northstar healthcare and our investment strategy does not primarily focus on investments in healthcare real estate or cre debt our investments may overlap with those of colony northstar northstar income northstar income ii and northstar healthcare and therefore many investment opportunities that will be suitable for us may also be suitable for colony northstar and other clns managed companies our target investments are expected to overlap with those of rxr value added fund iii even though certain aspects of our investment strategy and criteria are different in addition colony northstar or rxr may sponsor or manage other investment vehicles in the future that may target investments similar to ours and that will rely on colony northstar or rxr to source their investments therefore many targeted investments that are suitable for us may also be suitable for existing or future colony northstar and rxr entities q what is the role of your advisor

offering mergers other changeofcontrol transactions and any liquidity eventsan affiliate of our advisor and our subadvisor owns  of the special units of our operating partnership a delaware limited partnership q what is the experience of your advisor and subadvisor a  our advisor is a company that was formed in jersey on june   as a subsidiary of nsam our prior cosponsor following the mergers our advisor became a subsidiary of colony northstar one of our cosponsors and was domesticated in delaware on march   our advisor has a limited operating history and limited prior experience managing a public company our subadvisor is a limited liability company that was formed in the state of delaware on march   as a whollyowned subsidiary of rxr our other cosponsor our subadvisor has a limited operating history and no prior experience managing a public company q do you currently own any real estate aas of the date of this prospectus we have made one investment on may   we through a subsidiary of our operating partnership completed the acquisition of an indirect minority interest in  avenue of the americas a  million square foot classa office building located in midtown manhattan for a purchase price of approximately  million including closing costs the acquisition was part of an approximately  billion transaction sourced by rxr our cosponsor and affiliate of our subadvisor on december   we through a subsidiary of our operating partnership completed a  million followon investment including closing costs in  avenue of the americas we completed the followon investment by making an additional capital contribution to the partnership which in turn was used to acquire an additional indirect interest in  avenue of the americas from rxr value added fund iii other than the indirect minority interest in  avenue of the americas we do not currently own any real estate properties or other real estate related assets because we have not identified any other properties to acquire we are considered a “blind pool” as specific real property investments become probable we will supplement this prospectus to provide information regarding the probable investment to the extent it is material to an investment decision with respect to shares of our common stock we also will describe material changes to our portfolio including the closing of property acquisitions by means of a supplement to this prospectus q what will you do with the proceeds from your primary offering a if we sell all the shares offered in our primary offering we expect to use approximately  of the gross proceeds assuming the sale of  of class a   shares  of class t shares and  of class i shares in the aggregate to make real estate investments and to pay acquisition expenses and costs related to those investments we will use the remaining approximately  of the gross proceeds to pay sales commissions dealer manager fees and issuer costs our cash flow from operations may be insufficient to fully fund distributions to our stockholders particularly during the period before we have substantially invested the net proceeds from this offering therefore some or all of our distributions may be paid from other sources such as proceeds from our borrowings proceeds from this offering cash advances by our advisor and subadvisor cash resulting from proceeds from the sale of assets we have not placed a cap on the amount of our distributions that may be paid from proceeds from this offering or any of these other sources to the extent distributions are paid from proceeds from this offering which we expect to be the case during the early stages of the offering the amount of proceeds used to make real estate investments and to pay acquisition expenses and costs related to those investments will be less the per share amount of distributions on class a shares and class i shares will differ from class t shares because of different classspecific expenses specifically distributions on class t shares will likely be lower than class a shares and class i shares because of the ongoing distribution fees that are payable with respect to class t shares see “description of capital stock — distributions” q how does a “best efforts” offering work a when shares of common stock are offered to the public on a “best efforts” basis the brokerdealers participating in our offering are only required to use their

brokerdealers for shares sold by the participating brokerdealers in addition we will incur or reimburse our advisor for our cumulative organizational and offering expenses the payment of fees and expenses reduces the funds available to us for payment of distributions and investment in our target assets and therefore may reduce our distributions or our net asset value q how long will our offering last a our primary offering is expected to terminate on february   unless extended by our board as permitted under applicable law and regulations in addition we reserve the right to terminate our offering for any other reason at any time q what is the liquidity event history of programs sponsored by our sponsors a  the prospectuses of each of the retail companies disclose that subject to

stages each of northstar income northstar healthcare and northstar income ii has completed its offering stage as of the date of this prospectus while each of the retail companies expects to consider a liquidity transaction in this time frame there can be no assurance that a suitable transaction will be available or that market conditions for a transaction will be favorable during that time frame

purpose will establish an estimated value per share of each class of our common stock based on an appraisal of our assets and operations and other factors deemed relevant once established we will provide the estimated value per share to you in a periodic report and in each annual report thereafter the estimated value per share of each class of our common stock will be based upon the fair value of our assets less the fair value of our liabilities under market conditions existing at the time of the valuation we will obtain independent third party appraisals for our properties and will value our other assets in a manner we deem most suitable under the circumstances which will include an independent appraisal or valuation a committee comprised of independent directors will be responsible for the oversight of the valuation process including approval of the engagement of any third parties to assist in the valuation of assets liabilities and unconsolidated investments we anticipate that
