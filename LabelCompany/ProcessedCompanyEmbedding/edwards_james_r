new testament commentary is written with the understanding that god stands over us we do not stand in judgment of him this perspective protects against some of the more speculative and skeptical

description▼▲ in this timely book for believers inquirers and skeptics alike james r edwards faces headon the question of whether or not jesus is indeed the sole savior of the world after tracing the currents of modernity from the enlightenment to the jesus seminar edwards contends that the assumptions of the most skeptical historicaljesus scholars are no more intellectually defensible than the claims of faith he then assembles extensive support to show that jesus considered himself the unique and saving mission of god to the world edwards devotes the second half of the book to discussing jesus as savior in light of contemporary cultural currents specifically addressing the thorny issues of religious pluralism moral relativism postmodernism and the quest for world peace illustrated with reallife stories is jesus the only savior gives a fair hearing to twentyfirstcentury concerns while upholding historic christian faith product information▼▲ format paperbacknumber of pages vendor

product description in keeping with the pillar new testament commentarys distinctive character this volume by james r edwards on luke gives special attention to the third gospels vocabulary and historical setting its narrative purpose and unique themes and its theological significance for the church and believers todaythough luke is often thought to have a primarily gentile focus edwards counterbalances that perspective by citing numerous evidences of lukes overarching interest in depicting jesus as the fulfillment of gods providential work in the history of israel and he even considers the possibility that luke himself was a jew in several excursuses edwards discusses particular topics including lukes infancy narratives the mission of jesus as the way of salvation and lukes depiction of the universal scope of the gospelwhile fully conversant with all the latest scholarship edwards writes in a lively fluent style that will commend this commentary to ministers
