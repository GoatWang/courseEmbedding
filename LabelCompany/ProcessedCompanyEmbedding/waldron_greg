ruby frank d waldron project above frank waldron with trumpet wang doodle orchestra seattle circa 9 with saxophone seattle circa 9 photos courtesy of the black heritage society “greg ruby has captured the spirit of early jazz by retrieving and rearranging the long lost compositions of legendary seattle wind instrument “professor” frank waldron mentor to quincy jones buddy catlett and others these songs are an absolute delight a window into a joyful rambunctious jazz past that is too often overlooked” paul de barros the seattle times down beat syncopated classic rediscovering the lost compositions of seattle jazz pioneer frank d waldron celebrates and promotes the legacy of frank d waldron one of the most important yet unknown figures in early seattle jazz frank d waldron 99 never became as famous as his star students quincy jones or buddy catlett but waldron’s presence reaches back to the earliest days of jazz in seattle in 9 he set up shop at  jackson street near the epicenter of seattle’s burgeoning jazz district there he established the waldron school of saxophone and trumpet performing throughout the northwest in numerous ensembles by 9 waldron joined the wang doodle orchestra with an ear towards composition he selfpublished his first song in 9 adding to the canon of wwi patriotic songs with a lively solo piano rag called “the kaiser’s got the blues since uncle sam stepped in” renowned for his impeccable technique exquisite tone and immaculate attire waldron worked during prohibition in the afterhours speakeasies and underground clubs by the 9s waldron turned full time to teaching his students included quincy jones buddy catlett jabo ward and barney hilliard “then we finally got a trumpet teacher named frank waldron he was an african american with a bald head and he used to wear striped pants like the guys in the english parliament he looked like he stepped out of the harlem renaissance he had a little flask of gin and every night he’d take a sip three or four times and he said let me hear you play something he was from a legit school of trumpet players” quincy jones interview academy of achievement while seattle’s jazz scene of the 9s was geographically remote it was not removed as local musicians absorbed the new sounds of jazz bands touring the west coast on vaudeville circuits they formed groups of their own jelly roll morton even resided in seattle years before he became the selfproclaimed “inventor of jazz” with prohibition in full swing the city was home to numerous afterhours speakeasies and underground clubs that created a lucrative and dependable living for many musicians far from the cities that became associated with music’s evolution seattle developed a vibrant jazz scene of its own ignored by the press and recording industries of the east much of seattle’s music and musicians went unnoticed local musicians such as frank d waldron who preferred to remain close to home were never afforded the opportunity to place their music on the indelible medium of a record instead waldron archived his compositions by self publishing “frank d waldron’s syncopated classic” inside the pages of this obscure book are nine compositions that reveal the musical brilliance of one of seattle’s most important early jazz musicians now for the first time in generations you will be able to hear the music waldron wrote back in the roaring s this project began in  when i was composing the music for the first rhythm runners cd washington hall stomp as i was researching about seattle musicians from the 9s i read about waldron and “syncopated classic” in the seattle jazz history book “jackson street after hours” by paul de barros curious about waldron as a composer i sought to find “syncopated classic” eventually i came across a single tattered photocopy and much to my delight the compositions were simply remarkable through research at the library of congress i also found two more of waldron’s works a world war i solo piano rag titled “the kaiser’s got the blues since uncle sam stepped in” and a beautiful waltz titled “valse queen ann” waldron’s full story remains untold—frank waldron’s syncopated classic serves as a unique rare and immediate connection to the roots of jazz in seattle this project will deepen and expand his story as well as publish and record all of his known compositions expanding on waldron’s history and preserving his book frank d waldron’s syncopated classic will ensure that this important document is accessible to current and future generations of professional musicians music students and historians and waldron’s music and legacy remain an integral part of our rich musical history the kickstarter campaign to support syncopated classic is on now help ensure that this recording gets into the ears of music lovers everywhere thanks in advance for your contribution   this project is supported in part by a grant from newsletter first name last name zip email
