gains but does not include sales charges and fees performance would have been lower if sales charges and fees had been included results are hypothetical please keep in mind that high doubledigit returns are highly unusual and cannot be sustained investors should also be aware that these returns were primarily achieved during favorable market conditions  the net asset value nav per share is determined by dividing the value of the funds portfolio securities cash and other assets less all liabilities by the total number of common shares outstanding the common share market price is the price the market is willing to pay for shares of the fund at a given time total return assumes an investment at the beginning of the period reinvestment of all distributions for the period in accordance with the funds dividend reinvestment plan and sale of all shares at the end of the period subject to change daily fund information and portfolio composition are provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell any security or securities in the sectors and countries presented monthly holdings are updated  calendar days after monthend the repurchase information only represents shares repurchased as part of a share repurchase program and does not account for any shares repurchased through a tender offer risk considerations there is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective portfolios are subject to market risk which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them accordingly you can lose money investing in this portfolio please be aware that this portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks share prices also tend to be volatile and there is a significant possibility of loss investments in chinese companies and ashares investments in chinese companies involve certain risks and special considerations not typically associated with the united states including among others a the heavy concentration of market capitalization and trading volume in a small number of chinese companies representing a limited number of industries combined with diversification requirements applicable to the fund under the us internal revenue code of  as amended and chinese law potentially resulting in fewer investment opportunities for the fund b the small size of the market for chinese securities and the low volume of trading resulting in lack of liquidity and in price volatility c currency devaluations and other currency exchange rate fluctuations d lack of a market to engage in hedging transactions to minimize renminbi foreign exchange risk e the nature and extent of intervention by the chinese government in the chinese securities markets whether such intervention will continue and the impact of such intervention or its discrimination f limitations on the use of brokers g higher rates of inflation h greater political economic and social uncertainty i certain chinese government requirements which may restrict the fund’s investment opportunities j custody risks associated with investing through a qfii and k investment and repatriation restrictions these risks may be more pronounced for the ashare market than for chinese securities markets generally because the ashare market is subject to greater government restrictions and control due to these restrictions capital cannot flow freely into the ashare market and it is possible that the liquidity and trading prices of the ashare may be severely affected in addition the risks of investing in emergingmarket countries are greater than the risks generally associated with foreign investments foreign currency considerations the fund’s assets will be invested primarily in the equity securities of issuers in china and hong kong and the income received by the fund will be principally in chinese renminbi meanwhile the fund will compute and expects to distribute its income in us dollars as such there will be inherent risk related to the fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and the chinese renminbi exchange control regulations currency exchange restrictions and costs associated with conversion of investment principal and income from one currency into another derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance they also may be subject to counterparty liquidity valuation correlation and market risks illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than public traded securities liquidity risk nondiversified portfolios often invest in a more limited number of issuers as such changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause greater volatility msci china a index – the msci china a index is a free floatadjusted market capitalization index that is designed to measure equity market performance of the china a share market the performance of the index is listed in us dollars and assumes reinvestment of net dividends the index does not include any expenses fees or sales charges which would have lower performance the index is unmanaged and should not be considered an investment it is not possible to invest directly in an index closed end funds unlike open end funds are not continuously offered there is a onetime public offering and once issued shares of closed end funds are sold in the open market through a stock exchange nav per share is determined by dividing the value of the trusts portfolio securities cash and other assets less all liabilities and preferred shares by the total number of common shares outstanding the common share market price is the price the market is willing to pay for shares of the trust at a given time morgan stanley investment management msim is the asset management division of morgan stanley     wam is the weighted average maturity of the portfolio the wam calculation utilizes the interestrate reset date rather than a securitys stated final maturity for variable and floating rate securities by looking to a portfolios interest rate reset schedule in lieu of final maturity dates the wam measure effectively captures a funds exposure to interest rate movements and the potential price impact resulting from interest rate movements   wal is the weighted average life of the portfolio the wal calculation utilizes a securitys stated final maturity date or when relevant the date of the next demand feature when the fund may receive payment of principal and interest such as a put feature accordingly wal reflects how a portfolio would react to deteriorating credit widening spreads or tightening liquidity conditions   tracking error and information ratio are calculated using the portfolios blended index added october   as this is a better representation of the portfolios global
