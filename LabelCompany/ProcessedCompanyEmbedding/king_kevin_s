jack o balswick pamela ebstyne king and kevin s reimer present a model of human development that ranges across all of lifes stages infancy childhood adolescence young adulthood middle adulthood elder adulthood they do this by drawing on a biblical model of relationality where the created goal or purpose of human development is to become a reciprocating selffully and securely related to others and to god along the way they provide a context for understanding individual development issuesconcerns tensions worries or crises encountered by the self in the context of change awareness of these issues is most pronounced at developmental transitional points learning to talk and walk beginning to eat unassisted going to school developing secondary sexual physical features leaving home obtaining fulltime employment becoming engaged and then married having a child for the first time parenting an adolescent watching children move away from home retiring experiencing decline in physical and mental health and finally facing imminent death throughout balswick king and reimer contend that since god has created human beings for relationship to be a self in reciprocating relationships is of major importance in negotiating these developmental issues critically engaging social science research and theory the reciprocating self offers an integrated approach that provides insight helpful to college and seminary students as well as those serving in the helping professions those preparing for or currently engaged in christian ministry will be especially rewarded by the indepth discussion of the implications for moral and faith development nurtured in the context of the life of the church author bio▼▲ jack o balswick phd university of iowa is senior professor of

self offers an outstanding integration of theological anthropology and social scientific theories of human development the authors demonstrate a hermeneutical sensitivity to the philosophical turn to relationality that has so deeply impacted contemporary discourse as well as a passionate concern for facilitating transformation in religious communities both theologians and psychologists will benefit from this interdisciplinary exploration of the dynamics of reciprocity that shape the relations of human persons to each other in fellowship with the trinitarian god it would be difficult to imagine a book that does a better job of weaving together the very best science on human development over the life course with a reliable christian theology of the trinity this deep integrative writing at the interface of lifespan psychology and theology is extraordinary throughout the book has a wonderful practical emphasis that makes it a remarkable resource for pastoral counseling and for the christian psychologist the authors deserve immense credit for creating an integrative vision that will be of great use to the competent psychologist who is also the committed christian combining years of experience breadth of scholarship and theological insight the authors present a coherent and cohesive new paradigm for understanding the process of human development as simultaneously including social spiritual and psychological reciprocity of personal being drawing upon the relevant theories of human development as well as of current theological reflection on the nature of human personhood as a dynamic imaging of a trinitarian creator god this book sets a new base line for the next generation of students and scholars who wish to study practice and write as christians who are also caregivers this book ought to be required reading for those preparing to be christianoriented counselors and therapists and must reading for those who already are product reviews▼▲ be the first
