product these products provide the minerals and nutrients you need to sustain your energy and improve your performance laird said its not just for extreme sports or for professional athletes like my wife gabby theyre designed for anyone whos looking to get a little more out of life whether its a friendly game of tennis or an exhausting day at the office or a great day of surfing lairds inspired ahha moment materialized when he was adding a scoop of butter to his morning cup of coffee being a fan of the ketogenic diet i recognized the need for healthy fats laird said and i absolutely love a good cup of coffee so i started experimenting with different ways to combine the two i knew there had to be a better way better sweetener better fat better creamer better nutrition the result is laird superfood creamer a nondairy gmofree glutenfree vegan alternative to traditional creamers instead of butter lairds powdered creamer is a mix of healthy oils coconut milk coconut nectar and aquamin natures best source of calcium its a tasty nutrientdense beverage booster that will transform your morning coffee into an important part of a healthy diet click here for more nutritional info of course you dont want to add innovative new creamer to a crummy old cup of coffee so laird scoured the world for the richest most complex organic coffee  he started with highaltitude shadegrown beans from peru that have very low acidity then he found a grower that employs a rare wetprocessing technique that eliminates the chance of contamination and flavor degradation the beans are slowroasted in small batches using a drum roaster and finally vacuumsealed in an oxygenfree package  ive tested coffee from hundreds of cultures on six continents and one thing i learned is it doesnt stay fresh for long laird said it starts losing its flavor and aroma almost immediately thats why local roasters limit their distribution so far laird superfood is the only coffee company that has solved the problem by using foodgrade nitrogen packaging system  laird is not the only company that is using nitro flush to solve the fresh problem  they are the only ones doing it fully by removing  of the oxygen where everyone else leaves  o in the bag which still will age the coffee rapidly  its another item where laird takes the process to the extreme that’s our mantra…   the result is a better freshertasting cup every time  and when you add laird superfood creamer you have the perfect performanceenhancing drink for whatever youre doing click here for  more on the growing roasting and packaging of laird superfood coffee since laird practically lives in the ocean hes extremely sensitive to environmental issues and sustainability  every ingredient is sourced from likeminded organizations like palm done right and natural habitats which adheres to the highest standards for palm oil farming and production the red plam oil is sourced from ecuador not se asia and no deforestation no farmer exploitation no pollution or artificial processes whasoever  by the summer of  every laird superfood product will be certified organic “my biggest concern as a businessman – what keeps me up a night – is the consistency and quality of the products that are a reflection of who i am” laird says i need products that are authentic to who i am and what i believe in… i believe in innovation and authenticity i believe that the foods you eat should be as good for the earth as they are for you and i believe that food should enable you to perform at the highest level no matter what youre doing click here for a

rewards international contact  faqs i see there are two creamers the powder superfood creamer and the top fuel creamer which creamer is right for me our superfood powder creamer is a delicious creamer nondairy vegan nongmo gluten free product that contains coconut milk coconut oil red palm oil aquamin and dried coconut tree blossom nectar to give is a light nutty flavor  this contains mcts and aquamin read more about aquamin here the top fuel creamer comes in single serve packets in a liquid form and contains dairy from grass fed organic butter and the product is overall certified organic gluten free with no added sugar  the top fuel has a higher concentration of mcts naturally occurring from the whole food ingredients in the product  mcts cannot be stored as fat in the body but are used as fuel which may make it a better choice for athletes or people needing extra fuel  it is recommended that this be blended into your coffee tea or smoothies using a blender or our laird super hand mixer  i see that the powder superfood creamer contains coconut sugar is it sweet there is some added dried coconut tree blossom nectar in the superfood powder creamers but not the top fuel creamer  coconut sugar contains a variety of vitamins and minerals in itself and is verified low glycemic  it does not necessarily make your coffee or tea sweet by adding it but it does give it a delicious slight nutty flavor coconut sugar is considered one of the healthiest sugars available you can read more about it here  about shipping laird superfood is currently offering for a limited

launching in sisters  cascade business news twitter facebook rss you are athome»news pages»eheadlines»laird superfood launching in sisters laird superfood launching in sisters  by david clewett cbn feature writer on september   eheadlines photo courtesy of paul hodge the founder of golfboard is launching a new business in central oregon alongside business partner laird hamilton paul hodge is the founder of golfboard which is based in central oregon and a popular product at golf courses around the country now hodge and hamilton have partnered to launch a new business in sisters called laird superfood laird superfood offers organic coffee and a superfood creamer to provide a delicious and healthy twist to the daily coffee ritual the product is manufactured in sisters where hodge has lived since  “i have wanted to build something locally in order to give job opportunities to our community doing a project that has this very large scale potential in such a small community has its challenges however we’re doing everything we can to try and keep it in sisters” hodge said laird superfood is a result of hamilton’s love for coffee combined with his career as a professional big wave surfer surfing big waves requires a high level of focus in order to maintain peak performance levels hamilton understood long ago that premium coffee was a natural and healthy solution to keep him performing at a world class level the company is beginning with coffee and intends to expand by offering a full line of healthy food products “we started with coffee because the coffee market is massive and can provide a gateway to coffee drinkers which may not be currently focused on nutrition laird had heard someone say that in many cases people’s diets are so out of whack that the coffee they consume in the morning is their healthiest meal of the day” hodge said laird superfood’s coffee uses a highaltitude organiccertified wetprocessed lowacid coffee bean that is grown in peru the company currently offers a sweetener performance and energy blend and a coffeecreamer combo hamilton intends to continue expanding the product line of superfood’s to provide healthier food and beverage products to the mass market laird’s superfood creamer combines healthy fats based in mct form with aquamin the healthy fats are paramount for a healthy diet and are the basis for what our brains consume as fuel “recent research has proven that healthy fats are actually the key to losing weight and staying slim the aquamin ingredient is a calcified sea algae that grows only off the coasts of iceland and ireland it’s a highly bioavailable form of calcium which we all need as we age and it also contains  other minerals absorbed from the ocean water which you will be hard pressed to get any other way” hodge said nearly  years ago hamilton began incorporating coffee in his daily regimen and began adding healthy mct fats as fuel for long surf days he realized that carb loading burnt off too quickly and that healthy fat energy would last long enough to get through a day of surfing he soon became a coffee connoisseur and created his own coffee creamer and sweetenerusing natural whole food ingredients “our coffee is organic and laird scoured the earth for what he felt was the best organic coffee available our organic certification coffee is a low acid strain grown at high altitude creating an hb hard bean and shb strictly hard bean class bean and its wet processed to ensure the flesh doesn’t affect the taste as it dries its then slow drum roasted for  minutes instead of flash roasted then packaged in  percent pure food grade nitrogen which keeps it absolutely fresh roasted tasting for  months or longer” hodge said laird superfood products are currently offered on their website and the company is seeking resellers distributors and wholesale opportunities “we have been selling the products online to laird’s fans for about a year we launch september  at the natural products expo east show in baltimore to retailers who we hope will want to provide this to their customers as one of the only healthy coffee creamer alternatives” hodge said currently laird superfood products are being offered to central oregonian’s at melvin’s in sisters and tetherow in bend in preparation for the company launch hamilton has released an online crowdfunder which allows accredited investors to be coowners in the project the crowdfunder can be found at this link wwwcrowdfundercomlairdsuperfood the company has a small d equity offering open it is for accredited
