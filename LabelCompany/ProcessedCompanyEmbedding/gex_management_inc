and printing expense is the estimated costs associated with this offering as more shares are sold we anticipate legal fees to increase due to the likelihood of investors being from other states which could result in state blue sky securities filings although our legal fees are not contingent on the number of shares sold it is likely that the legal fees will increase as our attorney will charge us for these filings also as more shares are sold our printing expenses will increase • other offering expenses include the securities and exchange commission registration fee blue sky fees and

referrals social media we plan to utilize sites such as facebook linkedin and twitter to reach audiences internationally that can use our services personal relationships the three officers of gex have numerous relationships with professions that generally have small practices and need back office and administration support we intend to reach out to all of our personal relationships to expand the business to these potential clients the back office and employeeemployer administration industry including the professional employer organizations peo and administrative services organizations aso is highly fragmented resulting in intense competition competition affects our ability to succeed in both the market segments we currently serve and new market segments that we may enter in the future we compete with several large back office and administration companies as well as peos and asos that provide the same services we provide but also provide additional services these companies may have greater financial marketing and other resources than we do competition in our industry is based primarily on quality of service to the customer price and new and improved innovative services offerings
