appeals of loyalty to the british empire and ran on the slogan canadianism or continentalism in british columbia the party ran on the slogan a white canada playing to the fears of british columbians

that canadians were welltrained and prepared to fight in their own divisions although with mixed results such as the ross rifle arthur currie provided sensible leadership for the canadian divisions in

americans to accept the presence of separate canadian indian australian newfoundland new zealand and south african delegations despite this borden boycotted the opening ceremony protesting at the precedence given to the prime minister of the much smaller newfoundland over him not only did bordens persistence allow him to represent canada in paris as a nation it also ensured that each of the

of john a macdonalds national policy and appeals of loyalty to the british empire and ran on the slogan canadianism or continentalism in british columbia the party ran on the slogan a white canada playing to the fears of british columbians that resented the increasing presence of cheap asian labour and the resulting depression in wages in quebec concurrently henri bourassa led a campaign

provide half a million soldiers for the war effort however volunteers had quickly dried up when canadians realized there would be no quick end to the war bordens determination to meet that huge

hughes the minister of militia generally ensured that canadians were welltrained and prepared to fight in their own divisions although with mixed results such as the ross rifle arthur currie provided

temporary but was never repealedaccording to whom convinced that canada had become a nation on the battlefields of europe borden demanded that it have a separate seat at the paris peace conference this was initially opposed not only by britain but also by the united states who perceived such a delegation as an extra british vote borden responded by pointing out that since canada had lost a far larger proportion of its men compared to the us in the war although not more in absolute numbers canada at least had the right to the representation of a minor power british prime minister david lloyd george eventually relented and convinced the reluctant americans to accept the presence of separate canadian indian australian newfoundland new zealand and south african delegations despite this borden boycotted the opening ceremony protesting at the precedence given to the prime minister of the much smaller newfoundland over him not only did bordens persistence allow him to represent canada in paris as a nation it also ensured that each of the dominions could sign the treaty of versailles in its own right and receive a separate membership in the league of nations during the conference

discussed with lloyd george the possibility of canada taking over the administration of belize and the west indies but no agreement was reached at bordens insistence the treaty was ratified by the

politician b  june  in grand pré ns first child of andrew borden and eunice jane laird m  sept  laura bond d  sept  in halifax they had no children d  june  in ottawa robert laird borden’s paternal ancestor richard borden left headcorn england in  to settle in portsmouth ri more than a century later after the acadians had been expelled from nova scotia in  see charles lawrence richard’s greatgrandson samuel borden a landowner and surveyor in new bedford mass was commissioned by the nova scotia government to survey the vacated lands and lay out plots for new englanders intending to settle there in  samuel received a parcel of land in cornwallis for his work but he returned to new bedford his son perry robert’s greatgrandfather took up the grant beginning the establishment of borden families in the annapolis valley bordering on the bay of fundy the bordens were farmers tilling the rich tidelands rescued from the sea generations earlier by the expelled acadians robert’s father andrew who was born in  owned a substantial farm at grand pré he first married catherine sophia fuller and they had a son thomas andrew and a daughter sophia amelia before her death in  three years later andrew married eunice jane laird the daughter of john laird the village schoolmaster and a classical scholar and mathematician of local repute robert was born in  and was followed by a brother john william a sister julia rebecca and another brother henry clifford born in  john william would become a senior civil servant in the department of militia and defence in ottawa julia remained in grand pré unmarried and living with her parents henry clifford known as hal and robert’s favourite among the siblings graduated from dalhousie law school in halifax and practised as a lawyer of all the members of the family it was eunice robert’s mother who had the strongest influence on his upbringing and development he later wrote that she was of “a highlywrought nervous temperament” “passionate but wholly just and considerate upon reflection” and totally devoted to the welfare of her four children borden admired her “very strong character remarkable energy high ambition and unusual ability” – traits that marked his own emerging personality borden’s reflections on his father were much more restrained andrew did not take to agricultural pursuits and left management of the farm to eunice and the children he dabbled and failed in small business ventures and in time found a comfortable sinecure as stationmaster at grand pré for the windsor and annapolis railway though “a man of good ability and excellent judgment” robert wrote andrew “lacked energy and had no great aptitude for affairs” robert’s education began in the village’s presbyterian sunday school where he was initiated into the mysteries of the shorter catechism and at home where he learned reading with his mother from the pages of john bunyan’s pilgrim’s progress in due course lessons with the village schoolmistress were interspersed with visits from his uncles who introduced him to the poets horace and virgil when he was nine in  his parents sent him as a day student to the local private academy acacia villa school presided over by arthur mcnutt patterson patterson’s mission was to “fit boys physically morally and intellectually for the responsibilities of life” each morning began with patterson reading a chapter of proverbs to his charges who then moved on to exercises in grammar mathematics literature and natural philosophy borden excelled at greek and latin soon his instructor james henry hamilton also had him studying hebrew the classical poetry and literature stayed with borden all his life a volume in latin or greek perhaps one of each was on his bedside table until the day of his death in  when hamilton suddenly left acacia villa to join a private school in new jersey robert at age  found himself promoted to “assistant master” charged with taking hamilton’s place in classical studies the contrast with his chores at home was sharp and telling he later recalled that he never had mastered “the mysteries of building a load of hay” and found hoeing vegetables “extremely disagreeable” and sawing cordwood for winter fires “unpleasurable” even on the rich bottomlands and upland fields of “the valley” the rewards of agriculture were hard won he never forgot that “throughout the year labour was severe and hours long” as attached as he was to his family borden resolved not to spend his life as a farmer in grand pré teaching at acacia villa had more than its share of routine and his failure to complete his schooling precluded study at university still teaching hinted at a better way of life selfeducation he discovered had its own satisfactions one learned the value of time “to waste it seems like wasting one’s future” discipline hard work persistence patience and a sense of humour were common enough virtues but essential to shape the ambitions of a young man determined to succeed borden taught at the academy for four years and then accepted hamilton’s invitation to join him at the glenwood institute in matawan nj it was the first time he had ever been away from home and he was desperately lonely in the fall of  but he was not alone a ferry ride away in the great metropolis of new york his halfbrother thomas a sailor and his wife lived other nova scotia friends resided in brooklyn and he and a fellow boarder named horner a publicschool teacher often went to the city on weekends to visit its parks museums galleries and libraries and to listen to temperance lectures at the glenwood institute he was a yearold professor of classics and mathematics borden found the work demanding he kept a shortlived diary and frequently recorded entries like “i worked too hard this afternoon at reports c i was somewhat ill this evening about  o’clock” he had nine different classes most with fewer than a dozen students and none of them particularly challenging in the spring of  as the school year was drawing to a close borden surveyed his prospects they were not encouraging without completion of his formal education in school and college a career in teaching would likely mean working in secondrate academies trying to inspire dull uninterested students casting about he wrote to an uncle who was a barrister in ontario asking for information on studying law in that province the reply was enough to convince him that he should give the profession a try but his mother would have nothing to do with his going to ontario she told him he could do just as well at home in nova scotia he applied to and was accepted by the prominent halifax firm of robert linton weatherbe and wallace nesbit graham as the fall of  began borden always punctilious recorded “commenced the study of the law by reading a small portion of robert malcolm napier kerr’s  edition of the student’s blackstone on saturday evening sept  at  o’clock” he was apprenticed to weatherbe and graham as an articled clerk for four years “entitled to be instructed in the knowledge and practice of the law” in truth he learned by doing he was expected to prepare briefs for his masters and watch over the ordinary office affairs of their clients formal instruction depended upon his afterhours initiative a diversion from the routine of the office was enlisting in the rd halifax volunteer battalion of rifles there in three yearly terms he earned a meagre but welcome six dollars for twelve days of service and a fifty dollar bonus when he qualified for commission other companions were found at the st andrew’s lodge of british templars and the debating society of the young men’s christian association in september  he joined charles hibbert tupper who had a law degree from harvard and  others to sit the provincial bar examinations borden topped the class he still had a year of apprenticeship before admittance to the bar and during the winter of  also attended the school of military instruction in halifax borden and a classmate briefly had a practice in halifax before he went to kentville as the junior partner of conservative lawyer john pryor chipman then in  wallace graham called him back to halifax john sparrow david thompson a partner in the firm since weatherbe’s promotion to the bench in  had himself been made a judge graham and tupper who had become a partner in  needed help especially so because tupper had just been elected to the house of commons borden had hardly settled in when graham assigned him a long list of cases before the provincial supreme court other work came from the firm’s conservative friends in sir john a macdonald’s government in ottawa borden helped prepare the government’s cases in the seizure of two american fishing vessels in  during the longstanding canadianamerican dispute over fishing rights in the north atlantic then early in  thompson now macdonald’s minister of justice invited borden to work with him in ottawa as deputy minister borden was tempted but declined preferring to remain in practice in halifax in september  robert borden married laura bond a daughter of the late thomas henry bond who had been a successful hardware merchant in halifax how they first met is not known though it may have been at st paul’s anglican church where she was an organist and he a regular attendant their courtship had begun in the summer of  when they were married he was  and she  laura was a lively attractive and strongwilled young woman whose interest in music and theatre complemented his in literature both enjoyed tennis water sports and especially golf at first the bordens rented rooms in downtown halifax but in  borden bought a large home pinehurst on quinpool road in the western suburbs of the city he was now very successful in his career and he and laura spent several weeks in the summers of  and  touring in england and europe there were no children of the marriage but borden’s brother hal was often with them at pinehurst while studying at dalhousie by the mid s the borden firm now including william bruce almon ritchie and others was among the largest in the province the bank of nova scotia canada atlantic steamship nova scotia telephone and the bread and confectionery business of william church moir were among its prominent clients most of borden’s work was on referral of appeals to the supreme court in halifax or in ottawa and in  he appeared for the first time before the judicial committee of the privy council in london he had several cases each year in ottawa while there he frequently visited sir john thompson who had become prime minister and other nova scotia acquaintances his closest friends were the tuppers charles hibbert and his family in the early nineties borden and tupper took up the new fad of bicycling and were often seen on the roads in and about ottawa and hull at home in halifax borden’s reputation and influence in the bar steadily grew he was elected vicepresident of the nova scotia barristers’ society in  and became its president a year later while he was serving in that office he and his colleague charles sidney harrington played leading roles in organizing the founding meeting of the canadian bar association in montreal in  that spring on  april borden was in ottawa arguing cases and went to dinner at sir charles tupper’s home it was the day that sir mackenzie bowell resigned as conservative prime minister and tupper was about to succeed him it was clear that there would be an election before the year was out tupper asked borden to stand for halifax with the veteran catholic mp thomas edward kenny john fitzwilliam stairs halifax businessman and protestant colleague of kenny in the house of commons was stepping down and tupper wanted borden to replace him before borden left the dinner party he accepted it was an abrupt change in borden’s life and opponents would later charge that he had suddenly switched sides what political interests he had had in his earlier years were certainly on the liberal side – the valley was a liberal stronghold – and he had spoken once on behalf of his cousin the liberal politician frederick william borden in  in  however he had abandoned the liberal cause in disagreement with nova scotia premier william stevens fielding’s campaign against confederation several of his legal partners in graham’s firm were prominent conservatives and when borden took over the firm all the new associates he chose had conservative leanings yet borden himself had never before expressed any interest in running for public office nor was he deeply moved by the big issue in the  election the manitoba school question see thomas greenway after winning the nomination he campaigned on the hardy staple of macdonaldera tory politics the national policy this after all was the plank in the conservative platform that captured the interest and support of most of his clients on election day  june halifax voters for only the second time since confederation split their ticket both the conservative and the liberal catholic candidates were defeated borden and liberal benjamin russell another prominent lawyer and protestant were elected borden took his place in the commons as a member of the opposition party tupper and his tory colleagues had been soundly defeated by wilfrid laurier’s liberals for the next four years borden was a backbencher practising law in halifax and politics in ottawa he disliked being away from laura “it is a miserable irregular life one has to lead” he complained early in the  session “and i am more than sick of it i can assure you” as always the duties of the backbencher revolved around attending to the wishes and complaints of his constituents and defending the interests of his riding when occasion demanded borden became involved in his work on house committees and over time grew more confident to speak on broader national issues as one of the few “new men” in the party he was steadfast in his loyalty to his leader tupper and distanced himself from the incessant bickering that characterized the conservatives in opposition by  he had been moved to the front bench and had begun to be noticed as an emerging figure in the party on  nov  the conservatives were soundly defeated in another general election and tupper was ready to give up the leadership at year’s end the more obvious candidates were veteran warriors such as george eulas foster and sir charles hibbert tupper but they had acquired as many rivals and enemies as friends during their long careers and their prospects of beating laurier in a future election were dismal the party needed a fresh face and the tuppers father and son turned to borden he had no enemies in the caucus and had been an able and conscientious worker in parliament charles hibbert approached him in mid november well before his father’s formal resignation was announced in february “i have not either the experience or the qualifications which would enable me to successfully lead the party” borden replied “it would be an absurdity for the party and madness for me” the tuppers persisted and when the disheartened tory mps and senators met in february  they rallied support for their candidate on  february the members many sceptically chose borden as their leader borden played out the formalities of surprise and set two conditions he would he said accept for only one year and he demanded that the party appoint a committee to search for a permanent leader the committee was quickly forgotten and the commitment to one year was never made public borden led the party in opposition for a decade previous leaders macdonald thompson tupper and the others had had years of parliamentary experience before assuming the position borden in his late forties had spent his adult life as a lawyer and had had only a brief apprenticeship in politics though he applied himself to his new duties with the same earnestness and ambition that he had devoted to his legal career he regarded politics with a sense of detachment unknown to the career politicians who preceded him political life he believed was a responsibility something a successful man should take on in the public interest while he had long since conquered his anxieties about arguing the law in the highest courts of his country and the empire borden never enjoyed public speaking and debate he found it both physically and emotionally demanding leading his colleagues was even more challenging they were a fractious lot in parliament and the constituencies cursed with longstanding rivalries and deep divisions between catholic and protestant french and english and reflecting changing times urban and rural factions though ultimately the leader had the authority to decide party organization and party policy had evolved as prerogatives of the mps which they jealously guarded they chafed at borden’s tendency throughout the opposition years to bypass them and seek advice from outsiders conservative provincial premiers and prominent business leaders sympathetic to the tory cause one veteran of party warfare samuel hughes developed a strong affection for his leader but shared his longserving colleagues’ doubts about borden’s political skills borden he observed in  was “a most lovely fellow very capable but not a very good judge of men or tactics and is gentle hearted as a girl” many mps found borden reserved distant and occasionally imperious once in  borden had to reprimand a colleague and then regretted it “wrote john allister currie a consoling letter” he wrote in his diary “he wept georges lafontaine also wept today when i spoke kindly to him” borden’s most difficult problem was with his french canadian mps once the backbone of the conservative party the quebec membership in caucus had been reduced to a tiny rump borden often thought their ideas were parochial but never went out of his way to try to understand them following a practice of macdonald he chose a lieutenant from their ranks frederick debartzch monk monk like borden was a lawyer who had first been elected in  and again like his chief he was serious earnest and moody neither man got on easily with the other monk was a champion of growing nationalist sentiment in quebec borden who spoke competent french was frequently impatient with his lieutenant and failed to grasp the significance of french canadians’ views on national issues that threatened their sense of identity nor was he able to curb the sometimes virulent antagonism of his more ardent ontario protestant colleagues to the quebec conservatives’ aspirations monk feeling isolated and unsupported by his leader resigned his position in january  a year later he and borden clashed over the schools issue in alberta and saskatchewan monk wanted borden to stand up for establishing separate schools in the new provinces while borden knowing they were opposed by local officials backed the arguments for provincial autonomy monk angered said that his leader had set back the conservative cause in quebec by  years borden was influenced by the progressive ideas about democratizing political parties and using state power in the public interest that were being debated in the united states an example was his opposition to the extravagant plans of laurier’s government in  to support the building of two more transcontinental railways the grand trunk pacific and the canadian northern borden agreed that the rapid expansion of the prairie region required new transportation routes but the two railways which would run for miles within a carriage ride’s distance of each other were wasteful and irresponsible he countered with a proposal for a governmentowned and operated transcontinental railway controlled not by private corporations but by the people of canada though the liberals easily carried the day in parliament borden said that in the forthcoming general election the people would have a choice “a governmentowned railway or a railwayowned government” it did not work laurier’s liberals at the peak of their power humiliated the tories in the election of november  they took every seat in nova scotia including borden’s swept british columbia and increased their majority to  borden talked of resigning but the attractions of public life had begun to grow on him he enjoyed the recognition a party leader received and the continual association with men of affairs that political life demanded his confidence in his performance as leader had grown and his job was unfinished “for a long time i more than hesitated” about staying on he would tell his friend john stephen willison but just before christmas  he decided to remain as party leader “i have put all the hesitation and doubt behind me and i shall endeavour to do my full duty” a vacancy was hastily found in carleton constituency in ontario and laurier graciously arranged that borden be acclaimed on  feb  shortly after his election it was clear that borden’s commitment to national politics was complete he told laura on  february that he was house hunting in ottawa the couple moved into their new home glensmere on wurtemburg street and backing onto the rideau river in the summer of  borden spent much of his second term as leader developing a new platform for his party a scheme to hold a policy convention was mooted and then shelved when quebec conservatives declined to attend he turned for advice to the conservative provincial premiers richard mcbride in british columbia rodmond palen roblin in manitoba and james pliny whitney in ontario to some of the new members of his caucus who shared his views and to businessmen such as joseph wesley flavelle and sir thomas george shaughnessy he announced his halifax platform – in his words “the most advanced and progressive policy ever put forward in federal affairs” – in his home city on  aug  it called among other things for reform of the senate and the civil service a more selective immigration policy free rural mail delivery and government regulation of telegraphs telephones and railways and eventually national ownership of telegraphs and telephones the proposals received a cool reception from his parliamentary colleagues who had not been consulted and a mixed public reception among businessmen who were concerned by borden’s unorthodox ideas about state intervention in business affairs though he spent more than a year promoting the platform in speeches across the nation the effort was not enough to prevent another victory by the liberals in october  borden had now lost two general elections and his party four in a row but in  the conservatives gained  seats reducing laurier’s majority to  borden was more determined than ever to carry on many of his parliamentary colleagues had other ideas they resented having been ignored in the planning of the halifax platform they feared his ideas for developing party structures that would lessen their influence and he had now led them to another painful defeat they carried their discontent into the new parliament a parliament soon dominated by two issues that challenged canadians’ views of their relationship with the united kingdom and the united states and that triggered successive revolts against borden’s leadership within his caucus the struggle appeared to be over borden’s determination to break the mps’ dominance of party affairs by holding a national convention and establishing a counterweight of democratically controlled local organizations but what sparked the revolts was borden’s stand on the naval question in  and on reciprocity with the united states in  in february  the conservatives placed upon the order paper of the house of commons notice of a resolution recommending that canada provide for its own coastal defence something laurier had promised in  but never acted upon early in march before the resolution could be debated a shortlived crisis in great britain over the relative strengths of the imperial and german navies shocked and surprised both parties in englishspeaking canada public figures and many of the large urban dailies demanded a canadian contribution to the sudden apparent shortfall in british dreadnoughts neither laurier nor borden was sympathetic to this clamour laurier proposed an amendment to the conservative resolution recommending that the house approve any necessary expenditure designed to promote the organization of a canadian naval service which would work in close cooperation with the imperial navy it was quickly accepted by the conservatives and the revised resolution passed unanimously at the end of march by then however the demand for a contribution of dreadnoughts had been embraced by borden’s three strongest allies premiers mcbride roblin and whitney in january  laurier introduced a bill to create a canadian naval service with ships stationed on both the atlantic and the pacific coasts if required they could be put at the service of the imperial navy in time of war the conservatives were deeply divided monk whom borden had reappointed as his quebec lieutenant a year earlier was demanding a plebiscite on the issue borden continued to support the concept of a canadian naval service – though not necessarily the one proposed by the liberals – but now also favoured immediate aid many other tory members wanted a simple outright contribution to the imperial navy before the session was over laurier’s proposal would be carried by his party’s large majority and soon become law in early april the toronto daily star broke the story of seething discontent in the tory caucus claiming as many as seven different factions at war with each other that was not true but there were three groups the french canadians and two small cliques of english canadians who were challenging borden’s authority and calling for mcbride to abandon victoria and rescue the national party in ottawa borden responded by handing his resignation as party leader to the chief whip on  april he had no intention of leaving instead he was challenging his caucus he addressed it for an hour on the th and left knowing that his allies would beat back the revolt shortly after noon a motion reaffirming support for him was passed by all in november  responding to an invitation from the united states laurier sent his ministers of finance and customs to washington to discuss a new canadianamerican trade arrangement after another session there in january the finance minister william fielding announced the agreement in the house on the th it was staggering in its breadth the two nations undertook to eliminate customs duties on a long list of natural products then there was another long list of reduced duties on many manufactured goods the arrangement concluded with two further lists one canadian and one american of lower duties on yet more processed products of the other nation to avoid the possibility of the agreement being defeated in the united states senate if it was styled a treaty it had been decided to bring it into effect by reciprocal legislation the conservatives to a man were stunned there had never been such a challenge to their national policy there had never been a proposal so calculated to win the support of the vast majority of canada’s farmers fishermen lumbermen and industrial workers laurier’s party though old tired and slipping badly in its organizational prowess seemed assured of another sweeping victory borden’s men faced a fifth deeply humiliating defeat it was the tory premiers who initially rallied the troops for them the issue was not a cheaper cost of living for ordinary canadians it was a betrayal by laurier of canada’s cherished ties to the empire robert rogers roblin’s minister of public works in winnipeg told borden the reciprocity agreement was a “departure from imperialism to continentalism” then the manufacturers who had prospered under the protection of national policy tariffs sustained by both conservative and liberal governments since  took up the cause see sir byron edmund walker the canadian manufacturers’ association quickly developed a shadowy subordinate the canadian home market association to carry on a propaganda war against reciprocity soon important business spokesmen who had long supported laurier’s party zebulon aiton lash and lloyd harris joined clifford sifton a former minister in the liberal cabinet and john willison the conservative editor of the toronto news to propose an alliance with borden’s party their delegation met him on  march anticipating that the reciprocity issue would force a new election what would borden do if he won they asked that he consult their spokesmen before appointing his cabinet and that its membership include “men of outstanding national reputation and influence” who would appeal to the “progressive elements” of the electorate in short they wanted representation of the antireciprocity liberals in his cabinet borden quickly agreed and a curious coalition against the trade agreement began to emerge under his leadership a large majority of his caucus led by its more recent members from the business class such as herbert brown ames george halsey perley and albert edward kemp supported borden’s developing strategy but a group of veteran tories including monk and his friends were appalled by borden’s pact with sifton and the antireciprocity liberals and denounced it in a stormy march caucus borden again threatened to resign triggering a petition asking him to carry on sixtyfive members signed twenty did not for a second time in a year opposition in his caucus had been crushed just as the prospects for eventual electoral victory looked better than they had in  years in the house of commons the party obstructed progress on the reciprocity bill after a twomonth adjournment to allow laurier to attend an imperial conference the liberals lost control of the commons abandoned their bill and dissolved the house on  july borden and his coalition allies campaigned across englishspeaking canada on the slogan “canadianism or continentalism” their appearances in quebec laurier’s fortress were few in a tacit understanding the fight there was left to monk his nationaliste friend henri bourassa a roommate of borden years before and monk’s parliamentary colleagues for them the issue was not reciprocity it was laurier laurier and his naval service act laurier and his capitulations to english canadian interests through the years laurier and his alleged corrupt dominance of politics in quebec the strategy worked brilliantly on  sept  the conservatives took all seven seats in british columbia eight of ten in manitoba and seventythree of eightysix in ontario in quebec their representation jumped from eleven to twentyseven borden’s tories had won  seats in the house of commons laurier’s liberals were returned in  constituencies borden was the new prime minister of canada borden’s cabinet mirrored the groups that had won the election under the conservative banner all the conservative premiers mcbride roblin whitney and john douglas hazen of new brunswick were offered places but only hazen accepted becoming minister of marine and fisheries and minister of the naval service the other three chose to have their interests protected by surrogates martin burrell an mp and a friend of mcbride became minister of agriculture robert rogers from manitoba accepted the department of the interior and francis cochrane from ontario took railways and canals william thomas white a talented young financier and vicepresident of the national trust company was the nominee of the antireciprocity liberal interests though he had no political experience he was appointed minister of finance and quickly became a close friend and trusted colleague of borden there was no shortage of veteran tories waiting to be called george foster deeply hurt that he did not get finance took trade and commerce sam hughes unblushingly wrote to borden celebrating his credentials – “i get the name of bringing success and good luck to a cause” – and was rewarded with the patronagerich department of militia and defence john dowsley doc reid who had been a leader in the caucus revolts against borden was named minister of customs from quebec monk represented the nationaliste forces as minister of public works and louisphilippe pelletier and wilfridbruno nantel were selected from the more traditional bleu wing of conservative support english quebec was recognized by charles joseph doherty’s appointment as minister of justice the new government began with high hopes for a mildly progressive legislative program from the halifax platform borden promised further reform of the civil service – laurier had begun the process with the establishment of the civil service commission in  – but sidestepped the more controversial ideas of government regulation or public ownership of national franchises such as the telegraph and telephone systems the farmers who were the principal victims of the defeat of reciprocity needed attention the canada grain act of  established a board of grain commissioners to supervise grain inspection and regulate the grain trade and enabled the federal government to build or acquire and operate terminal elevators at key points in the grain marketing and export system by  the government would have elevators in operation at port arthur thunder bay ont moose jaw sask calgary saskatoon and vancouver a second measure provided financial support to the provinces for the purpose of encouraging agriculture another proposal had the backing of many manufacturers and businessmen the government introduced a bill in  to establish a tariff commission an innovation that had been mooted in the halifax platform it was to apply “scientific principles” to management of the tariff which accounted for more than  percent of the government’s revenue and remove it from partisan influences yet another measure that year called for financial assistance to the provinces to build or improve provincial highways and begin the construction of a national highway system all of these initiatives seemed promising and a distinct departure from the laurier era then on  march  borden announced that he was halting the liberals’ naval program and preparing a permanent program of his own it was a major tactical error enraging the opposition and leaving canada’s naval service in limbo the liberals who had a huge majority in the senate retaliated borden’s tariff commission was rejected in  and his highways bill in  and again in  the same day that borden suspended the naval plan winston churchill britain’s first lord of the admiralty announced a new construction program for the royal navy to counter a growing threat from germany once again the contributionminded tories in englishspeaking canada demanded action and borden hazen doherty and pelletier soon left for consultations in london monk refused to go in the fall of  borden told his colleagues that his permanent naval plan was postponed and he was going to make a contribution of dreadnoughts the debate among them dragged on for some weeks with monk again insisting that there must first be a plebiscite on  october realizing his position was hopeless he resigned from cabinet on  december borden introduced his naval aid bill which was to provide  million for the construction of three dreadnoughts to be placed “at the disposal of his majesty the king for the common defence of the empire” borden expected something significant in return he was convinced that support for the imperial cause had to be recognized by canada having a voice in the determination of imperial foreign policy following his conversations in london he believed he had received that concession and announced to the house that “no important step in foreign policy would be undertaken without consultation with    a representative of canada” the debate in the house also went on for weeks becoming ever more acrimonious after an allnight session in march borden recorded “our men angry at end and both sides wanted a physical conflict primeval passions” then on  april for the first time in the canadian parliament the government introduced closure and a month later the bill passed but the “gagged” opponents had their revenge the senate rejected the naval aid bill at the end of may see sir james alexander lougheed canada’s naval service was in suspension its emergency contribution to the royal navy dead the impasse would continue in june  when the senate rejected a bill unanimously passed in the commons to increase its numbers so as to give adequate representation to the western provinces with partisan bitterness at a peak and good portions of its legislative program crippled the tories called out the battalions for a snap general election borden had one plank to put to the people a pledge to amend the constitution and have an elected senate however the weakness of the party in quebec and in manitoba where roblin won only the barest of majorities in july combined with the illness of whitney in ontario caused him to draw back on  june  the king had awarded borden the gcmg late in july he and laura escaped ottawa’s summer heat for a vacation in muskoka it was shortlived on friday morning  july borden was on a train rushing for toronto the next day he was in his ottawa office and on tuesday evening  aug  at  a cable from london arrived during an emergency cabinet meeting canada was at war the war was greeted with enthusiasm prominent men of affairs competed for recognition of their contributions to the war effort robert rogers guaranteed to support the dependants of

infantry that were the first canadian troops to land in france the imperial order daughters of the empire solicited funds for a hospital ship and sir richard mcbride surprised both the admiralty and ottawa when he used provincial funds to purchase two submarines being built for the chilean navy in seattle and had his operatives slip them over the border just as the united states neutrality laws were coming into effect in ottawa the government was unprepared for war so was the nation the only member of cabinet with any military experience and it was chequered was sam hughes key departments of the public service finance justice trade and commerce and labour each had fewer than one hundred employees as late as march  small arms – the ross rifle – were manufactured in canada but there was no capacity or manpower to produce heavy armaments a muchtouted war book quickly implemented barely hinted at what a government at war needed to do but by sunday  august the basic orders in council had been proclaimed and a war session of parliament opened just two weeks after the conflict began legislation was quickly passed to secure the nation’s financial institutions and raise tariff duties on some highdemand consumer items the war measures bill giving the government extraordinary powers of coercion over canadians was rushed through three readings finally the canadian patriotic fund was set up to assume responsibility for assistance to the families of soldiers with complete support from laurier and his party the government’s war legislation was in place in just five days the centrepiece of the effort was recruiting the force that canada would send to the front hughes abandoned a mobilization plan that had been drawn up by the chief of the general staff colonel willoughby garnons gwatkin and turned recruiting over to the more than  local militia commanders chaos reigned while hughes went on to contract businessman william price to build a training site from scratch at valcartier near quebec city in less than three weeks the camp had been established and thousands of troops had arrived a division had been offered as canada’s contribution many more men were at valcartier and while hughes strutted and dithered borden decided late in september to send them all to england the men were not trained and would spend months on salisbury plain in winter learning the rudiments of warfare see sir edwin alfred hervey alderson the fear in the government and the country was that the canadians would not get to the front in time it was widely anticipated that the war would be over by christmas on  dec  borden told the halifax canadian club that “there has not been there will not be compulsion or conscription” the eagerly awaited “decisive battle” that would crush the germans never happened almost immediately the western front settled into years of ghastly skirmishes and inconclusive trench warfare in april  when the st division fought its first major battle at second ypres canadians became acquainted with the growing casualty lists that appeared in urban dailies and rural weeklies from nova scotia to british columbia recruiting for a second division had begun as the first was crossing the atlantic the authorized force level of the canadian army rose again and again  in july   in october  and finally  in january  throughout hughes left the responsibility decentralized in the local units and military districts his department remained on the sidelines the recruits very largely from canada’s towns and cities came by the thousands – until mid  by then the war effort in factory and field was running at full capacity and labour shortages were appearing on production lines and farmsteads alike by then too the reality of a war of attrition had been grasped potential recruits had a choice not open to many in  and early  when unemployment had reached serious levels there was a very dangerous job available at  a day in france and another at unprecedented wages in the homefront war economy by july  the seemingly endless flow of recruits had become a mere trickle  men in april and may  especially in the aftermath of vimy ridge just over  men enlisted the days of volunteerism were over the government’s approach to the war effort at home paralleled the volunteerism of military recruiting worried that an already troubled economy might collapse because of “uncertain conditions” borden and white had opted for “business as usual” in  white rejected calls for direct taxation it would cost too much to implement he said and would intrude upon a tax field traditionally used by the provinces after the london market closed at the end of  white reluctantly and complaining about the high rates charged turned to new york for bond issues in   and  he did not believe that the canadian market was big enough to sell major issues but a very tentative offering of  million in  spurred by the escalating costs of the war was doubly subscribed much larger issues in  and  were equally successful and a victory loan of  million in  brought in  million in the manufacturing sector sam hughes’s hastily appointed shell committee vied for munitions orders from the allied governments the canadian government’s contracts for the many needs of its soldiers were dispersed by militia and defence and other departments in the partisan ways that had been practised for decades then minor scandals in early  persuaded borden to set up the war purchasing commission under edward kemp now minister without portfolio it took over the contracting for canada’s military expenditures and for all british and allied orders for war supplies except munitions scandals also struck the shell committee and in november  it was shut down and replaced as contractor for munitions by the imperial munitions board under the leadership of joseph flavelle these were the first manifestations of change others followed as war production in the factories and on the farms of canada began to grow in response to an urgent need for foodstuffs in europe borden’s government commandeered the  wheat crop in  skyrocketing prices led to the establishment of the board of grain supervisors of canada under robert magill which took marketing of the crops of  and  away from the private grain companies it was succeeded by the canadian wheat board with the same mandate for the  crop also in  a food controller william john hanna was appointed to regulate the production and distribution of canada’s food supplies and a fuel controller charles alexander magrath was given the power to regulate the distribution and price of fuels and the wages of coalminers in alberta and nova scotia a year earlier responding to increasing concern about war profiteering by canada’s businesses borden and white had reversed themselves on the tax issue and imposed the nation’s first direct impost the business profits war tax it was politically motivated so too was the income war tax grudgingly introduced by white in  as a companion to the military service act ostensibly to conscript the excesses of the nation’s wealth to match the forced enlistment for military service the rates were deliberately low and affected only a minority of people and the impact of the two direct taxes on the government’s revenue was insignificant both as well were temporary intended to end with the end of the war the profits tax expired in  but was revived in world war ii and the income tax would become the federal government’s largest permanent source of revenue in  the deep and longlasting problems of the new transcontinental railways were temporarily alleviated through government loans the crisis was finally resolved the following year with the takeover of the canadian northern railway see sir william mackenzie sir donald mann and the initial steps toward nationalization of the grand trunkgrand trunk pacific system see edson joseph chamberlin the canadian national railways governmentowned and operated by an arm’slength board would incorporate both lines with other government railways in short by  precedent and tradition had been abandoned business as usual had given way to remarkable government intervention in the economy dramatic and unanticipated changes also took place in policy towards military manpower and in imperial relations borden made his first wartime visit to britain and france in  in paris he visited president raymond poincaré and received the grand cross of the legion of honour in london the government of herbert henry asquith was welcoming and cordial but refused to concede any possibility of consultation on war policy that was true also in  as borden wrestled with the chaotic administration of military manpower in canada and britain under hughes eventually in the fall of  hughes in london deliberately defied borden’s instructions for management of the overseas forces borden stripped him of his responsibilities and in response to hughes’s bitter reaction fired him in november hughes was replaced in ottawa by edward kemp and in london a new ministry of overseas military forces was established with george perley canada’s acting high commissioner as its minister in december the new british prime minister david lloyd george initiated a revolutionary change in the united kingdom’s relations with its dominions he desperately needed more fighting men but realized that the time had come to give the dominions and india some say in the direction of the war “they are fighting not for us” he was reported as saying “but with us” in the spring of  borden the leader of the senior dominion attended the first imperial war cabinet and conference between regular visits to canada’s soldiers in military hospitals borden participated in warcabinet discussions of a wide range of matters including possible peace terms at meetings of the conference he and his brilliant young legal adviser loring cheney christie led the passage of resolution ix which called for a postwar constitutional conference to “provide effective arrangements for continuous consultation in all important matters of common imperial concern and for such necessary concerted action founded on consultation as the several governments may determine” back in canada borden met his cabinet on  may and told them that he was ready to introduce conscription the pressure to impose compulsory service had been building for more than a year especially among more welltodo english canadians convinced that quebeckers were slackers who refused to do their part in  the torontobased bonne entente movement organized by john milton godfrey and arthur hawkes sought but failed to win quebeckers over to a greater military contribution to the war effort the more strident winthewar movement in  openly agitated for conscription and a coalition government to enforce it quebeckers were not impressed they were angered that borden’s government had failed to support their demands for redress of the grievance felt by francoontarians as a result of the whitney government’s imposition of regulation  on their schools see philippe landry this  regulation had abolished the use of french as a language of instruction beyond form one the first two years of instruction in ottawa the dispute was particularly heated as resistance to the regulation grew year by year leading the government of william howard hearst to put the ottawa school board in trusteeship in  see samuel mccallum genest in february  nearly five thousand angry french canadians marched in protest to borden’s office and demanded federal intervention in the dispute borden said he would “see what could be done” he did nothing firmly convinced that the dispute was strictly a provincial matter then in april his three french canadian ministers pierreédouard blondin thomas chasecasgrain and esioffléon patenaude pleaded to have the dispute referred to the privy council in britain he refused calling their request “foolish” in may liberal mp ernest lapointe’s resolution in the commons recommending to the ontario legislature “the wisdom of making it clear that the privilege of the children of french parentage of being taught in their mother tongue be not interfered with” was soundly defeated with “loud cheers” by the tory majority ominously five of borden’s members voted for the resolution and eleven of laurier’s caucus voted with the majority borden’s view that intervention was unconstitutional was sound but his insensitivity to french canadians’ concerns and to the pleas of his quebec colleagues and his adamant refusal to intervene with the conservative government in toronto all but eroded what limited support his government had in quebec the increasingly strident clamour for conscription made matters even worse and sharpened the growing division between french and english in canada for months borden had resisted the conscription agitation fearing largescale unrest if it was imposed “that might mean civil war in quebec” as he told one of the bonne ententists in may  when cabinet was informed there would be conscription blondin and patenaude warned that it would “kill them politically and the party in quebec for  years” borden’s participation in the imperial war cabinet and his keen awareness that voluntary recruiting had fallen well behind battlefield casualties had been decisive in changing his mind casualties in the spring of  were double the number of new recruits being taken into the imperial government’s council participating in discussions of war and peace policy at the centre of the empire borden believed heightened canada’s responsibility to do everything possible to support its soldiers even more important was the bond he had established with “his boys” at the front and in the long rows of hospital beds in england when he introduced the military service bill on  june he asked a hushed and sombre house of commons “if we do not pass this measure if we do not provide reinforcements if we do not keep our plighted faith with what countenance shall we meet them on their return” at that same cabinet meeting in may borden announced that he was going to ask laurier to join him in a coalition government to support conscription he did so a week later laurier hesitated opposed to compulsion but aware that several of his englishspeaking colleagues strongly supported it finally on  june he refused several members of borden’s cabinet were vastly relieved they abhorred the idea of cooperating with the liberals and believed that they could easily win the forthcoming election on a conscription platform without them but borden persisted and worked for months to achieve a coalition of his party with conscriptionist liberals along the way his men rammed through two bills to rig the franchise for the coming election the military voters act made it possible to manipulate the counting of votes at the front and the wartime elections act which finally passed in late september disenfranchised enemy aliens who had come to canada after  and extended the vote to the immediate female relatives of soldiers this raw display of partisan determination finally tipped the scales for coalition dithering conscriptionist liberals such as arthur lewis watkins sifton newton wesley rowell and frank broadstreet carvell knew that this was their last chance and quickly signed up the union government was announced on saturday  october there were seven liberals in the new cabinet and one more would be added before the end of the month doc reid who like dozens in the tory caucus had thought the coalition would never happen reportedly quipped that he would “back borden against job in a patience contest” the angry debates that accompanied passage of the military service act the accusations and recriminations in both parties over coalition were but preludes to the bitterness of the election campaign that began in november the manitoba free press winnipeg declared that “a vote for laurier is a vote for the kaiser” sir john willison’s paper now the toronto daily news published a frontpage map of canada englishspeaking canada was coloured in red quebec in black in quebec albert sévigny borden’s minister of inland revenue was driven from a platform amidst revolver shots and flying stones after he took refuge in a hotel the building’s windows were smashed and sévigny had to escape by sneaking out the back door the campaign of insinuation intimidation and violence came to an end on voting day  december the unionists won a huge majority of  conservative and  liberal members laurier’s liberals won  seats  of them in quebec and only  in western canada the disgraceful attempts to fix the vote were a price borden had been willing to pay so was the fact that both the great national parties had split – the grits over conscription the tories over the necessity of coalition for borden the election of  was a confirmation of “a solemn covenant and a pledge” he and canada had made to the soldiers at the front the union government moved quickly to implement its most important undertakings foremost was support for the war effort the first men called up under the military service act had been required in october to register for service though in keeping with borden’s promise not to introduce conscription until an election had been held they were not to be sent for training until january  the continuing process resulted in hundreds of thousands of petitions across canada for exemptions and easterweekend riots in quebec city in  see françoislouis lessard in due course just under  single men aged  to  would be conscripted in parliament the war appropriation act for a halfbillion dollars was approved the enfranchisement of women partially granted in  as a partisan political ploy was extended to include all eligible females for the purposes of national elections a new civil service act quickly passed to start the process of removing the outside service – federal government employees serving beyond the nation’s capital – from appointment by patronage the dominion bureau of statistics was organized to provide the kinds of systematic information about the nation’s population social structure and economy that had been so deficient during the early years of the war the government also established daylight saving time the parliamentary session ended in may with a heated debate initiated by william folger nickle over the abolition of hereditary titles in canada borden was in agreement “they are very unpopular and entirely incompatible with our institutions” he observed in fact a march order in council then under consideration by the british government had prescribed not only that hereditary titles be abolished but that except for military distinctions honours not be conferred on residents of canada without the approval or the advice of the canadian prime minister later in mid july the government belatedly announced a war labour policy which forbade strikes and lockouts for the duration while assuring employees of the right to organize and guaranteeing female workers equal pay for equal work in june  borden and several colleagues had returned to london for the second set of meetings of the imperial war cabinet and conference he was angry that he had not been consulted before the canadian corps had suffered huge losses at passchendaele and threatened lloyd george that he would send no more troops to the front if such a situation arose again more serious still he had received reports throughout the war critical of the performance of the british high command and of british military planning reports that reached a peak in his consultations with lieutenantgeneral sir arthur william currie commander of the canadian corps at the second meeting of the war cabinet borden gave an impassioned speech detailing the faults of the high command it resulted in appointment of a prime ministers’ committee which held intensive hearings with officials and senior commanders about the war effort its draft report completed in mid august gloomily forecast that the war could go on until at least  perhaps longer it reinforced the commitment to participation by the dominions in war policy and highlighted the need for the civil authorities to exert control over their military commanders but the report was outdated before it was discussed allied forces spearheaded by canadian and australian troops had attacked at amiens launching the final offensive that carried on as borden returned to canada on  october lloyd george summoned him back to britain to prepare for possible peace talks two days later borden replied that “the press and the people of this country take it for granted that canada will be represented at the peace conference” lloyd george was sympathetic but predicted “difficult problems” when borden arrived in london he proposed that borden as the leader of the senior dominion represent all the dominions at any conference that took place borden refused in december it was agreed that dominion and indian representatives would be present when questions directly relating to their interests were at stake and that one of the five members of the british delegation at the peace talks would always be from the dominions or india a month later after the conference had assembled at paris lloyd george persuaded american president woodrow wilson and french premier georges clemenceau that canada australia south africa and india would have two delegates and new zealand one at its plenary meetings borden recognized that these were more matters of form than substance and that representation was “largely a question of sentiment” but he told laura “canada got nothing out of the war except recognition” it was a point worth pressing to its logical conclusion formal acknowledgement of canada’s international status on  may  as discussions on the membership of the league of nations were drawing to a close a memorandum by borden argued that canada as a member should have the right to be elected to the league’s council lloyd george wilson and clemenceau agreed and added that canada should also be eligible for election to the governing body of the international labour organization five days later he was on his way home it was charles j doherty and arthur l sifton who signed the treaty of versailles on canada’s behalf his colleagues in ottawa were in trouble the liberal and conservative unionists were squabbling over white’s  budget and arguing over how to deal with the winnipeg general strike see mike sokolowiski the strikers were put down with force on “bloody saturday”  june when white’s budget had come to a vote two days earlier  liberal unionists joined the opposition then white exhausted by the incessant demands of the war resigned on  august the next day liberal unionist frank carvell left his fellow liberal thomas alexander crerar had quit in june over the budget conservatives doherty foster and burrell also talked of leaving other members of the coalition hoped to transform the union government into a new political party and looked to borden to lead them but the prime minister had also had enough since  he had responded to the challenges of leadership with an energy and zest that contrasted with his more detached approach to governing in the prewar years his soldiers his country and the allied cause had been worth every ounce of effort he could summon after seeing his government through ratification of the treaty of versailles in a short fall session of parliament and after making provision for the appointment of a canadian to deal with canadian affairs at the british embassy in washington he was done “at the end” he recorded “i was very tired” his doctors advised that he should leave politics immediately on  dec  he told his cabinet he was going to resign led by newton rowell they pleaded with him the next day to stay in office but take a vacation for a year unwisely he agreed it did not work even on vacation in the south he was after all the leader of the government and could not dismiss the responsibilities of his office nor could his colleagues leave him alone he returned to ottawa in may and finally announced his retirement to his caucus on dominion day  caucus then asked him to choose his own successor it was an unusual request both national parties had procedures for changes in leadership the tories were long accustomed to selecting a leader in their caucus in the liberal party laurier’s death in february  had led to the calling of a national convention which elected william lyon mackenzie king as leader but the union government was of neither party and of both it had no procedure and was as dependent on borden in leaving as it had been upon him when he formed it borden asked each member to indicate to him their three choices for leader he then recommended white who adamantly refused in due course arthur meighen deeply troubled that he had not been the first choice was persuaded by borden to lead the coalition and assume the prime ministership on  july  sir robert borden lived another  years he and laura remained at glensmere where they entertained friends and he took great pleasure in working in his wildflower garden on the bank of the rideau in season the couple regularly played golf there were frequent dinner parties evenings of bridge and in the twenties the novelty of radio broadcasts laura continued her work with various volunteer associations while borden read and wrote in his library two valuable constitutional studies were published his  marfleet lectures at the university of toronto canadian constitutional studies toronto  and his  rhodes lectures at oxford canada in the commonwealth from conflict to cooperation oxford  in  he began his memoirs a manuscript that was nearly finished when he died it would be published in a hefty two volumes by his nephew henry borden shortly after his death henry would also edit and publish a series of borden’s letters to limbo toronto  his reflections on politics literature friends and a host of other subjects which he had written in the s borden was very well off and the couple’s life in ottawa was as comfortable as it was quiet and understated in  when he had become party leader he had had a substantial income from his law firm that continued until  and was the foundation for a broad range of premium securities in his portfolio in  he had assets of  a large sum for the time and an average annual income of about  all his expenses including considerable support for family members and annual trips to the south in late winter were about  his fee for a  arbitration of a dispute between britain and peru supplemented his income as did his acceptance of the presidency of the crown life insurance company and barclays bank canada in  in  he became the chairman of canada’s first mutual fund the canadian investment fund “there is nothing that oppresses me” he reported to lloyd george “books some business avocation my wild garden the birds and the flowers a little golf and a great deal of life in the open – these together make up the fullness of my days” sir robert laird borden died in early thursday morning of  june  a thousand great war veterans in mufti lined the procession route from glensmere to all saints’ church for a funeral on saturday afternoon he was buried in beechwood cemetery in ottawa it was fitting that the veterans all members of the st division played a prominent role in borden’s funeral world war i had been his greatest political challenge in  he had been unprepared when sir charles tupper had asked him to run for parliament once he had been elected tupper and his son charles hibbert had guided and encouraged him as he moved from the back to the front benches of opposition in  he had been unprepared for party leadership his career as opposition leader was long and conducted against formidable odds with sir wilfrid laurier at the height of his powers and veteran members of his own caucus frustrating his attempts at party reform and challenging his position in  he had been unprepared for government leadership and his first years as a peacetime prime minister were marked by controversy with both the liberaldominated senate and his own nationaliste followers and cabinet colleagues from quebec in the middle of  borden was preparing for an election not war after the initial excitement of august  passed borden and his colleagues were worried that canada’s soldiers would not get to the front in time and hurried them to a winter of training on salisbury plain at home his government proceeded with caution and reserve attempting as far as possible to maintain the stance of business as usual the war measures act gave the administration extraordinary powers but it used them sparingly it tinkered with tariff rates to raise badly needed revenue it distributed the largesse of hundreds of contracts for war supplies by the tried and true methods of patronage and favouritism and borden tried and failed to gain access to imperial war planning what success the government had was in recruiting young men continued to volunteer in huge numbers throughout most of  it was clear by  that the war was not going to end any time soon canada’s soldiers now two divisions were bogged down with their allies in the dirty trenches of the western front their casualty rates were appalling and the first cries for conscription were heard on the home front borden resisted fearing compulsion would divide the war effort there which was producing the goods of war from food to wagons to munitions at an unprecedented pace but the first steps away from business as usual had begun the domestic market for war bonds had been tapped and had surpassed all expectations the government introduced the first measure of direct taxation at the federal level in canada’s history it also took the first modest steps toward resolving the longstanding fiscal problems of the new transcontinental railways by  the last vestiges of hesitation in borden’s leadership were gone displaced by a firm and at times stubborn resolve to commit his government and his nation to whatever contributions of men and machines were needed to win the war in the aftermath of the canadian victory at vimy ridge on easter monday  borden abandoned his promise of no conscription and led the effort to pass the military service act with his quebec support nearly exhausted that spring he sought and failed to persuade sir wilfrid laurier to join him in a coalition to enforce conscription he persisted much to the dismay of a sizeable portion of his caucus and eventually crafted a coalition of conservatives and liberal unionists which crushed the liberal party in the bitter election of december  the political cost was enormous the conservative party’s support in quebec was destroyed and would not be recovered for decades to come moreover unionist support in western canada was ephemeral and vanished at the first hints of peace compulsion for overseas service was echoed by vigorous use of the powers of the state at home the nationalization of the transcontinental railways was begun borden’s government regulated food and fuel distribution and controlled fuel prices and miners’ wages it imposed a “temporary” direct tax on incomes both personal and business it forbade both strikes and lockouts and with the support it enjoyed from the liberal unionists it reformed the federal civil service compared with the exercise of state power during world war ii the actions of borden’s government in world war i were almost amateurish in the context of the time however they were breathtakingly bold borden’s most lasting contribution grew out of his deep commitment to the war effort and his longstanding belief that canada had the capacity and was entitled to control its own external affairs in both peace and war dominion autonomy and the transformation of the empire into the new british commonwealth of nations was born of the great war lloyd george provided the opportunity borden and his legal adviser loring christie seized it canada’s soldiers borden believed had earned it his duty his responsibility to them and to canada was to achieve it recognition of canada’s right to craft its own external policy to have its own diplomatic representation in foreign capitals to have full membership in the league of nations and to play a leading role in development of the commonwealth were the rewards of borden’s persistent campaign for equal status general jan christiaan smuts of south africa a strong supporter in london and paris told borden in  “you were no doubt the main protagonist for dominion status” sir robert borden had not the magnetism of laurier the daring flair of macdonald he was an uncommonly reserved person for a national political leader a man who believed that his often stodgy public persona was the country’s business but his private life belonged to his very close friends and family he was throughout his political career less interested in politics than in policy he was devoted more to his nation than to his party his determination and commitment to lead canada through the great war made him the only allied leader to stay in office throughout the conflict an accomplishment of which he was very proud lloyd george called him “a sagacious and helpful counsellor” who was “always the quintessence of common sense” borden would have liked that robert craig brown r c brown robert laird borden a biography v toronto  provides a complete list of

pearson  pierre trudeau  joe clark  john turner  brian mulroney  kim campbell  jean chretien  paul martin   stephen harper robert bordens family had arrived in canada from england in a round about way as many in nova scotia and ontario did they had immigrated to new england and after the american revolution they made a move to nova scotia in order to remain within the empires sway he grew up on a farm working hard on the property and hard to improve himself academically although he didnt have formal schooling options he spent his evenings studying languages by the time he turned  he had progressed sufficiently to gain employment as an assistant school master and later on took up a position as a school master   like many people of his age he learned his politics from his family and their traditional associations and so borden was brought up as a good liberal but he lived through the exciting events of the confederation movement and was swept up by the creation of a new larger grand country where nova scotia was just a part of the larger family of provinces with the liberal secessionist movement of nova scotia being led by joseph howe attempting to take the province out of canada borden rebelled against his families long standing support of the party and he became a conservative although he did not attend university borden did gain employment in a law office and once again due to hard work he was able to learn the business and establish himself as a lawyer of note in halifax he quickly gained a reputation in the conservative party as a reliable solid worker with an ambition for his party rather then himself laurier had been prime minister since  and it looked as though he might remain in the office forever the conservatives flounder as they looked for a good candidate to run as prime minister against this wily french canadian master of federal politics borden was drafted at the age of  in the election of  he ran against laurier and his liberals borden was able to bring quebec nationalists disillusioned liberals from the west ontario tories and his base in the maritimes into his sphere of influence and beat laurier at the coalition building game to win the election the results of the election left all of the different groups who had come over to the conservative banner with an expectation that they would share in the power the conservatives had been   out of power for  years and hence had little experience in governing but borden set to work to try and satisfy all world events were quickly overtaking any plans that borden had for his government laurier realized that the coalition of the ontario conservatives and the quebec nationalist was one that would be hard for borden to maintain and the best place to attack borden would be over his support of british empire policies this strategy was indeed sound but would not be successful until after a world war and another election during that conflict   robert borden began to develop a vision of canada which was to move the nation forward in its development he saw that indeed canada could and probably should support britain in its move towards stopping german expansion andor domination of the european scene but was unwilling to offer this support without british concessions to canadian control over its own affairs borden under pressure from winston churchill who was the first lord of the admiralty agreed to have canada pay for the building of  dreadnaughts after severe opposition form laurier in the house of commons the bill was passed and sent to the senate for approval where it was defeated by the liberal majority in that house these ships could have been of use during the coming war but undoubtedly not as useful as the manpower which canada supplied as an army during the golden summer days of  the government was not sitting and borden was holidaying in northern ontario the archduke franz ferdinand had been shot in the balkans and the germans russians austrians and french were all moving towards another international confrontation that had become all too common in the previous decade the difference this time was that events were allowed to spin out of control and the war by timetable began to run the reaction in canada to unfolding events was overwhelmingly to support the british empire and almost all notable canadians from every party voiced their support of borden and his actions to take canada into the great war   borden appointed sam hughes as commander of the quickly expanding canadian forces that were being trained at valcartier and being readied for the fight in europe hughes who was a strange eccentric figure in canadian history pulled together all of the resources required and got the troops trained shipped to england and stationed on the salisbury plains ready for action the british commander lord kitchener considered the canadian troops as colonials who would be used as he saw fit and be fed into british units as piecemeal replacements hughes with the backing of borden absolutely refused to let the canadian troops be broken up and this policy eventually led to the growth of the canadian divisions into a canadian corp which distinguished itself throughout the war and fought and won one of the most outstanding victories of the first world war  vimy ridge   vimy ridge was a moment in canadian history where all of the nationalist feelings aspirations and visions of the country came together in an outburst of joy as the news of the stunning canadian victory over the german forces on the ridge some would go so far as to say that this was the event which took canada from a member of the british empire to a nation bordens government was hit with two scandals related to the purchase and supply of military munitions and weapons the first had to do with profiteering in the purchase of artillery shells which died a conspicuous death but the second scandal had to do with the ross rifle which was a canadian produced rifle which had severe problems when overused  it would overheat and jam eventually the canadian troops had their ross rifles replaced with the reliable british lee enfield rifle the other scandals had to do with domestic affairs and one in particular was to effect bordens rule and set the tone for his two successors arthur meighen and rb bennett this scandal was the canadian northern railway which had pushed its tracks across the continent and reached the pacific in  the problem was that the railway was not profitable and the government continued to pump large sums of money into it to keep it running as the controversy raged meighen and bennett emerged in the conservative party to take opposite sides of the debate bennett argued the company should be let go and meighen argued for another  million from the government to help the great northern see its way to survival meighen won the debate but lost a lot of support from the conservative party     borden went to europe to visit the troops and consult with the british government about the war and constitutional issue he visited the wounded in the hospitals meet with troops on the front and reviewed the overall progress of the war he was dispirited and depressed by what he saw the war had been going on for more then a year when borden approached the liberals about forming a union government or a government which would combine members of both parties in order to more effectively prosecute the war laurier refused this offer but did agree to extend the life of the sitting parliament for  year borden had to face the thorny issue of conscription the recruits were drying up and men were needed he had to work out how to get conscription in place without ripping the country apart the english canadians were all in favour of continued support of britain and the war while french canadians were quickly becoming disillusioned with the blood bath and asking what canada was fighting for laurier decided to make it an election issue regardless of warnings by a young colleague of his in the liberal party mackenzie king king was sure that if laurier fought the conscription issue he would loss the support of most of the country except quebec he was right borden also gave the vote to women calculating that the female vote would mainly support the husbands brothers and fathers who were fighting in the war the other tactic which arthur meighen arranged was to apply the votes of the soldiers to whichever riding the votes were needed in to win a conservative majority the final count in the election was  conservatives and  liberals laurier had won in quebec but lost the western liberals and the election the conscription bill was passed and quebec was passed to the liberals for  decades laurier had lost the election but borden and a the conscription bill turned quebec against him riots broke out in quebec and other parts of the country the enlistment numbers fell lower then before the bill was brought in an ugly gash had been made across the frenchenglish image of a united canada borden had been working hard to support the war and the empire but had been brushed off by british government officials whenever he request information he finally demanded a fuller position of participation within the commonwealth cabinet and more autonomy over questions effecting canada

canada – and leader of the conservative party – who played a decisive role—notably by insisting on separate canadian membership in the league of nations—in transforming the status of his country from

teaching career ended in  when he became articled to a halifax law firm admitted to the bar of nova scotia in  he rose to a commanding position in legal circles and after his marriage to laura bond  he founded a law firm that acquired one of the largest practices in the maritime provinces his friendship with sir charles hibbert tupper son of one of the original “fathers of confederation” led him to accept the conservative nomination for halifax in  borden’s entry into politics coincided with the victory of the liberal party under the leadership of sir wilfrid laurier though he remained an obscure backbench opposition member during his first term borden was invited by the caucus upon his reelection in  to assume temporarily the leadership of the party he accepted the post and despite repeated intrigues against his leadership and his own professions of distaste for it occupied it until  when the liberal decision to accept a reciprocal trade agreement with the united states led to laurier’s defeatas prime minister borden’s major interest was anglocanadian relations he had long argued for the establishment of a canadian voice in imperial policy his naval policy before world war i—which involved a grant of  million to britain for the construction of three battleships—was a mixture of opportunism and wishful thinking about the extension of canada’s influence in the councils of empire during the first two years of war borden frequently referred to the necessity of canadian participation in british decisions but it was not until the british prime minister david lloyd george created the imperial war cabinet iwc in  that borden was given a chance to express canada’s point of view at the meetings of the iwc in london and its subsequent sessions in paris during the negotiation of the treaty of versailles borden supported the fourteen points of us president woodrow wilson and argued that canada’s interests demanded the closest possible alliance between the british empire and the united states borden saw nothing incompatible between insisting on the right to participate in shaping imperial policy and canada’s independent membership in the league of nations he seemed to envisage the empirecommonwealth as an alliance in which smaller members might have to defer to the interests of the great power but only after a process of continuous consultation

him decreased his decision however to form a coalition government in order to implement conscription gave him the opportunity to reconstruct his cabinet and to surround himself with a group of able colleagues with arthur meighen his successor as prime minister to manage the house of commons and with two liberals newton rowell and alexander k maclean in charge of key cabinet committees borden was free to concentrate on the larger questions under discussion in london and paris he supported allied intervention in the russian civil war in which he was anxious to have canadian troops participate

appeals of loyalty to the british empire and ran on the slogan canadianism or continentalism in british columbia the party ran on the slogan a white canada playing to the fears of british columbians

precedence given to the prime minister of the much smaller newfoundland over him not only did bordens persistence allow him to represent canada in paris as a nation it also ensured that each of the

politician he served as the eighth prime minister of canada from october   to july   and was the third nova scotian to hold this office after retiring from public life he served as the chancellor of queens university early life and career robert laird borden was born and educated in grand pre nova scotia a farming community at the eastern end of the annapolis valley where his greatgrandfather perry borden sr of tiverton rhode island had taken up acadian land in  perry had accompanied his father samuel borden the chief surveyor chosen by the government of massachusetts to survey the former acadian land and draw up new lots for the planters in nova scotia robert borden was the last canadian prime minister born before confederation bordens father andrew borden was judged by his son to be a man of good ability and excellent judgement of a calm contemplative and philosophical turn of mind but he lacked energy and had no great aptitude for affairs his mother eunice jane laird was more driven possessing very strong character remarkable energy high ambition and unusual ability her ambition was transmitted to her firstborn child who applied himself to his studies while assisting his parents with the farm work he found so disagreeable his cousin was sir frederick borden a prominent liberal politician from  to  he worked as a teacher in grand pré and matawan new jersey seeing no future in teaching he returned to nova scotia in  to article for four years at a halifax law firm without a formal university education and was called to the nova scotia bar in august  placing first in the bar examinations borden went to kentville nova scotia as the junior partner of the conservative lawyer john p chipman in  he was inducted into the freemasons  st andrews lodge  and in  he was asked by wallace graham to move to halifax and join the conservative law firm headed by graham and charles hibbert tupper borden became the senior partner in fall  when he was only  following the departure of graham and tupper for the bench and politics his financial future guaranteed on september   he married laura bond – the daughter of a halifax hardware merchant they would have no children borden does have descendants namely jean borden and her son robert borden ii in  he bought a large property and home on the south side of quinpool road which the couple called pinehurst in  borden successfully argued the first of two cases which he took to the judicial committee of the privy council he represented many of the important halifax businesses and sat on the boards of nova scotian companies including the bank of nova scotia and the crown life insurance company president of the nova scotia barristers society in  he took the initiative in organizing the founding meetings of the canadian bar association in  in montreal by the time he was prevailed upon to enter politics borden had what some judged to be the largest legal practice in the maritime provinces and had become a wealthy man conservative party in opposition borden was a liberal until he broke with the party in  over the issue of reciprocity he was elected to parliament in the  federal election as a conservative and in  was selected by the conservative caucus to succeed sir charles tupper as leader of the conservative party over the next decade he worked to rebuild the party and establish a reform policy the halifax platform of  which he described as the most advanced and progressive policy ever put forward in federal affairs it called for reform of the senate and the civil service a more selective immigration policy free rural mail delivery and government regulation of telegraphs telephones and railways and eventually national ownership of telegraphs and telephones despite his efforts his party lost the  federal election to wilfrid lauriers liberals his partys fortunes turned around in the  federal election however when the conservatives successfully campaigned against lauriers proposals for a reciprocity free trade agreement with the united states borden countered with a revised version of john a macdonalds national policy and appeals of loyalty to the british empire and ran on the slogan canadianism or continentalism in british columbia the party ran on the slogan a white canada playing to the racist fears of white british columbians that resented the increasing presence of asian immigrants in quebec concurrently henri bourassa led a campaign against what he saw as lauriers capitulation to british imperialism playing a part in the defeat of lauriers government and the election of bordens tories prime minister  first world war as prime minister of canada during the first world war he transformed his government to a wartime administration passing the war measures act in  borden committed canada to provide half a million soldiers for the war effort however volunteers had quickly dried up when canadians realized there would be no quick end to the war bordens determination to meet that huge commitment led to the military service act and the conscription crisis of  which split the country on linguistic lines in  borden recruited members of the liberals with the notable exception of leader wilfrid laurier to create a unionist government the  election saw the government candidates including a number of liberalunionists crush the opposition laurier liberals in english canada resulting in a large parliamentary majority for borden the war effort also enabled canada to assert itself as an independent power borden wanted to create a single canadian army rather than have canadian soldiers split up and assigned to british divisions as had happened during the boer war sam hughes the minister of militia generally ensured that canadians were welltrained and prepared to fight in their own divisions although with mixed results such as the ross rifle arthur currie provided sensible leadership for the canadian divisions in europe although they were still under overall british command nevertheless canadian troops proved themselves to be among the best in the world fighting at the somme ypres passchendaele and especially at the battle of vimy ridge during bordens first term as prime minister the national research council of canada was established in  borden and the treaty of versailles in world affairs borden played a crucial role in transforming the british empire into a partnership of equal states the commonwealth of nations a term that was first discussed at an imperial conference in london during the war borden also introduced the first canadian income tax which at the time was meant to be temporary but was never repealed convinced that canada had become a nation on the battlefields of europe borden demanded that it have a separate seat at the paris peace conference this was initially opposed not only by britain but also by the united states who perceived such a delegation as an extra british vote borden responded by pointing out that since canada had lost more men than the us in the war she at least had the right to the representation of a minor power british prime minister david lloyd george eventually relented and convinced the reluctant americans to accept the presence of separate canadian indian australian newfoundland new zealand and south african delegations despite this borden boycotted the opening ceremony protesting at the precedence given to the prime minister of the much smaller newfoundland over him not only did bordens persistence allow him to represent canada in paris as a nation it also ensured that each of the dominions could sign the treaty of versailles in its own right and receive a separate membership in the league of nations during the conference borden tried to act as an intermediary between the united states and other members of the british empire delegation particularly australia and new zealand over the issue of mandates borden also discussed with lloyd george the possibility of canada taking over the administration of belize and the west indies but no agreement was reached at bordens insistence the treaty was ratified by the canadian parliament borden was the last prime minister to be knighted after the house of commons indicated its desire for the discontinuation of the granting of any future titles to canadians in  with the adoption of the nickle resolution postwar government that same year borden approved the use of troops to put down the winnipeg general strike which was feared to be the result of bolshevik agitation from the soviet union postpolitical career sir robert borden retired from office in  he was the chancellor of queens university from  to  and also was chancellor of mcgill university from
