assurance liquidmetal technologies is committed to providing the highest quality parts to customers which means careful attention and regulation of the endtoend materials and fabrication processes as a recent breakthrough in engineered materials technology bulk metallic glass alloys require extremely high quality standards to ensure reliability and repeatability in part performance many of the analysis tools that are used in traditional metallurgy can be used to assess the quality of liquidmetal processes but often in ways as unique as the alloy itself liquidmetal technologies uses a wide variety of tools to track the quality of its products from initial alloy production to final part performance examples of amorphous and crystalline materials under a high power microscope chemistry since the material properties of liquidmetal alloys are inseparably linked to its glassy structure the alloy composition which dictates its glass forming ability is of crucial importance liquidmetal alloys have incredibly precise compositions and extremely low levels of contaminants such as oxygen differential scanning calorimetry dsc a technique for studying the heat release associated with material phase transitions which can be used to extract information about volumetric amorphous content of ascast parts optical microscopy high quality bulk metallic glass parts can be identified by their uniquely featureless surfaces when an ultrahigh polished is applied to a specimen mechanical strength ascast mechanical properties can also be used to determine the consistency and

executives contact contact us finishing there are multiple finishing options that are available to liquidmetal® parts degating upon ejection from the mold liquidmetal parts are attached to a tree that must be removed the tree includes the sprue runner and gate as excess features the simplest means of removing this material is to use a waterjet system where the tree is clamped into a fixture and quickly cut leaving only the parts with a noncosmetic quality surface where the gate was removed in some cases this surface quality may be sufficient for the application however if not the surface will need to be processed further cnc machining at the manufacturing center of excellence in rancho santa margarita liquidmetal technologies operates a cnc machining center liquidmetal alloys are a very hard and strong material draft angles are required on all surfaces to ensure that the mold can eject the part without causing damage to either the part or the mold holes with tolerances in the ±mm ±” range can be machined along with grinding operations performed on surfaces and outer diameters that can hold the same tolerance in some cases parts will be molded as close to tolerance as possible and cleaned up with minimal stock removal from the part in a secondary operation surface treatment near optical surface finish featured on two asmolded liquidmetal parts most customers chose to utilize the asmolded finish of liquidmetal parts this allows us to do a minimal amount of post processing on the surface and leaves the customer with a finish that matches the surface roughness of the mold if a polished mold is specified it is typical to see liquidmetal parts come out of the tool with a surface roughness of µm µin the best corrosion resistance also occurs with an asmolded product in some cases customers may determine that a blasted finish is optimal for aesthetic reasons a variety of blasting media can be used for this including zirconia alumina silica etc this can be discussed further with liquidmetal engineers other options for part finishes include painting and even pvd physical vapor deposition liquidmetal vs cnc machining liquidmetal compared to common

device would buy next new samsung device i hate samsung anyway i am an iphone guy now i am going for google pixel phoneview results loading  share tweet reddit whatsapp emaila lot of rumors had been doing their rounds regarding apple’s upcoming iphone some of these claimed that apple will be using a rather new material called liquid metal in its next iphone the liquid was to be furnished by liquidmetal technology the company headed by tom steipp as its ceo now steipp has confirmed that apple has future plans with liquid metal liquid metal is a material with a metallic glasslike composition a material that can look really really cool on a tech gadget moreover it shows promising durability and strength and it is precisely for this reason that many analysts had speculated that apple may use it in iphone however now steipp has come forth and announced that apple has indeed license liquid metal for use in its future products he didn’t clearly confirm or rebuff the rumor that apple will use it in its next iphone too according to steipp “apple along with us are commercializing liquidmetal in the consumer electronic space” he also revealed that apple has licensed the material from his company as far back as  naturally apple hasn’t revealed the tiniest bit of this deal or its plans regarding a liquid metal futurethe greatest advantage apple will have in using liquid metal is that of looks as well as strength and space saving apple can construct casing for iphone and ipad that are twice as strong as titanium the metal that is often hailed for its strength moreover liquid metal casing can allow apple to trim down on the thickness of its devices furtherfinally with apple having the exclusive license to liquid metal use its products may stand out in the market with the other vendors forced to not copy it which in itself is going to be a very difficult task according to steipp steipp’s talk is posted belowsource redmondpiebuy cheapest related product

developer of bulk amorphous alloys amorphous alloys are unique materials that are distinguished by their ability to be injection molded and die cast into high performance applications for a broad range of markets the company recently announced that it has received two hot crucible amorphous metal molding machines from the company’s licensing partner eontec ltd lqmt’s hotcrucible machines provide the benefits of amorphous alloy technology to pricesensitive applications that were previously beyond its reach management is bullish about the synergistic benefits accruing due to merger of eontec’s technology and expertise within liquidmetal as per management the company’s business risk profile is on a rapid growth trajectory and it’s making excellent progress on its plans to significantly expand market reach and the scale of operations previously the company announced that it has passed additional prescreening biocompatibility tests for use in medical implants and is now pursuing collaborations with medical implant companies the results of these tests strategically position the company to engage medical device customers in a broad range of implantable device applications including cardiac rhythm cochlear spinal and orthopedic implants among others liquidmetal will now focus on collaborating with medical implant manufacturers to identify specific applications to further explore the use of liquidmetal in  the company generated  thousand  thousand in  in revenue as it continued to focus on development and manufacturing of prototype and commercial parts for its customers and collaborating with licensees on the development of the company’s technology and production processes notwithstanding its revenue growth liquidmetal continues to struggle with subdued profitability and high debt amongst other challenges the new addition of these systems along with the abovementioned strategic developments could potentially benefit the company’s earnings and revenues and consequently this could drive lqmt shares the company’s stock has witnessed significant strength in the recent past liquidmetal reported an increase in share price backed by its aboveexpected performance and robust guidance laying foundation for revenue visibility and business growth description  about the company californiabased liquidmetal technologies inc is the leading developer of bulk alloys and composites that utilize the performance advantages offered by amorphous alloy technology amorphous alloys are unique materials that are distinguished by their ability to retain a random structure when they solidify in contrast to the crystalline atomic structure that forms in ordinary metals and alloys liquidmetal technologies is the first company to produce amorphous alloys in commercially viable bulk form enabling significant improvements in products across a wide array of industries about eontec eontec “eon” provides onestop solutions in aluminum  magnesium diecasting it is also an innovator in amorphous metals with substantive ip in alloys molds machines and manufacturing processes advanced amorphous metal molding systems liquidmetal received two hot crucible amorphous metal molding machines from the company’s licensing partner eontec ltd these machines allow the production of amorphous alloy parts that are up to three times larger and onethird the cost of established technologies this technology complements liquidmetal’s well established coldcrucible systems which are capable of producing parts that meet requirements for the most demanding medical and automotive applications the machines are in the company’s new  squarefoot manufacturing facility in lake forest ca where operations are planned to commence in the second half of this year liquidmetal’s hotcrucible machines provide the benefits of amorphous alloy technology to pricesensitive applications that were previously beyond company’s reach implant study liquidmetal has passed additional prescreening biocompatibility tests for use in medical implants and is now pursuing collaborations with medical implant companies in february  lqmt received longterm implantation results from parts    and  of the iso  biological evaluation of medical devices suite of tests which include evaluation of genotoxicity subchronic systemic toxicity and pyrogenicity lqmt alloy lm passed all of these tests well within the allowable limits these results combined with previously completed tests from iso  parts    and  which cover sensitization irritation acute systemic toxicity hemocompatibility and cytotoxicity indicate that the liquidmetal process is compatible with a wide range of medical device requirements including long term implants the results of these tests are very exciting and it positions lqmt well to engage medical device customers in a broad range of implantable device applications including cardiac rhythm cochlear spinal and orthopedic implants among others with the abovementioned developments along with purchase of a new larger manufacturing facility as well as sourcing alternatives manufacturing platforms and materials from chinabased eontec liquidmetal is actively moving towards increasing manufacturing capabilities expanding the range of products it will be able to manufacture and providing lower cost solutions to customers management believes that these investments when combined with an improved capital structure and future strategies will allow lqmt to accomplish goal of expanding the liquidmetal brand and future profitability key stock influences  risk factors limited track record  competitive landscape liquidmetal competes against companies that have relatively more established products longer operating histories and greater resources which may prevent it from achieving rapid market penetration or increased operating results also lqmt has a limited history of developing and selling products therefore if the company cannot ramp up its business as envisioned it may not achieve the anticipated market penetration revenue targets or profitability liquidity  financial flexibility liquidmetal’s business is not currently profitable and it may not be able to achieve profitability even if it continues to record significant growth in revenue the operating loss for the fiscal years ended december    and  were  million  million and  million respectively it had an accumulated deficit of approximately  million at december   therefore its ability to maintain liquidity and financial flexibility to fund its incremental capital requirements will remain key financial sensitivity factor for the company earnings review total revenue increased by  thousand to  thousand for the year ended december   from  thousand for the year ended december   the increase for the period was attributable to a higher mix of smallscale preproduction orders during  as a result of continued growth of onsite manufacturing capabilities profitability gross profit loss increased by  thousand from  thousand as of december   to  thousand as of december   operating loss increased by  thousand from  million for the year ended december   to  million for the year ended december   fluctuations in operating loss are primarily attributable to variations in operating expenses also annual net losses of  million as of december   and  million as of december   are reflective of operating expenses associated with ongoing business as well as nonoperational expenses cash flow  balance sheet cash and restricted cash totaled  million at december   as compared to  million at december   the company anticipates that its current capital resources when considering expected losses from operations will be sufficient to fund the company’s operations for the foreseeable future stock performance on wednesday april th  lqmt shares surged by  to  on an average volume of  million shares exchanging hands market capitalization is m

february  this article needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed october  learn how and when to remove this template message liquidmetal and vitreloy are commercial names of a series of amorphous metal alloys developed by a california institute of technology caltech research team and marketed by liquidmetal technologies liquidmetal alloys combine a number of desirable material features including high tensile strength excellent corrosion resistance very high coefficient of restitution and excellent antiwearing characteristics while also being able to be heatformed in processes similar to thermoplastics despite the name they are not liquid at room temperature liquidmetal was introduced for commercial applications in  it is used for among other things golf clubs watches and covers of cell phones the alloy was the end result of a research program into amorphous metals carried out at caltech it was the first of a series of experimental alloys that could achieve an amorphous structure at relatively slow cooling ratescitation needed amorphous metals had been made before but only in small batches because cooling rates needed to be in the millions of degrees per second for example amorphous wires could be fabricated by splat quenching a stream of molten metal on a spinning disk because vitreloy allowed such slow cooling rates production of larger batch sizes was possible more recently a number of additional alloys have been added to the liquidmetal portfolio these alloys also retain their amorphous structure after repeated reheating allowing them to be used in a wide variety of traditional machining processes contents  characteristics  uses  commercial alloys  see also  licensed uses  references  external links characteristicsedit liquidmetal created by dr atakan peker contain atoms of significantly different sizes they form a dense mix with low free volume unlike crystalline metals there is no obvious melting point at which viscosity drops suddenly vitreloy behaves more like other glasses in that its viscosity drops gradually with increased temperature at high temperature it behaves in a plastic manner allowing the mechanical properties to be controlled relatively easily during casting the viscosity prevents the atoms moving enough to form an ordered lattice so the material retains its amorphous properties even after being heatformed the alloys have relatively low softening temperatures allowing casting of complicated shapes without need for finishing the material properties immediately after casting are much better than those of conventional metals usually cast metals have worse properties than forged or wrought ones the alloys are also malleable at low temperatures  °c or  °f for the earliest formulation and can be molded the low free volume also results in low shrinkage during cooling for all of these reasons liquidmetal can be formed into complex shapes using processes similar to thermoplastics which makes liquidmetal a potential replacement for many applications where plastics would normally be used due to their noncrystalline amorphous structures liquidmetals are harder than alloys of titanium or aluminum of similar composition the zirconium and titanium based liquidmetal alloys achieved yield strength of over  mpa nearly twice the strength of conventional crystalline titanium alloys tialv is  mpa and about the strength of highstrength steels and some highly engineered bulk composite materials see tensile strength for a list of common materials however the early casting methods introduced microscopic flaws that were excellent sites for crack propagation which led to vitreloy being fragile like glass although strong these early batches shattered easily when struck newer casting methods adjustments of the alloy mixtures and other changes have improved thiscitation needed the lack of grain boundaries contributes to the high yield strength and thereby resilience exhibited in a demonstration a metal sphere dropped on amorphous steel bounced significantly longer than the same metal sphere dropped on crystalline steel the lack of grain boundaries in a metallic glass eliminates grainboundary corrosion—a common problem in highstrength alloys produced by precipitation hardening and sensitized stainless steels liquidmetal alloys are therefore generally more corrosion resistant both due to the mechanical structure as well as the elements used in its alloy the combination of mechanical hardness high elasticity and corrosion resistance makes liquidmetal wear resistant although at high temperatures plastic deformation occurs easily almost none occurs at room temperature before the onset of catastrophic failure this limits the materials applicability in reliabilitycritical applications as the impending failure is not evident the material is also susceptible to metal fatigue with crack growth a twophase composite structure with amorphous matrix and a ductile dendritic crystallinephase reinforcement or a metal matrix composite reinforced with fibers of other material can reduce or eliminate this disadvantage usesedit liquidmetal combines a number of features that are normally not found in any one material this makes them useful in a wide variety of applications one of the first commercial uses of liquidmetal was in golf clubs made by the company where the highly elastic metal was used in portions of the club face these were highly rated by users but the product was later dropped in part because the prototypes shattered after fewer than  hits since then liquidmetal has appeared in other sports equipment including the cores of golf balls skis baseball and softball bats and tennis racquets the ability to be cast and molded combined with high wear resistance has also led to liquidmetal being used as a replacement for plastics in some applications it has been used on the casing of latemodel sandisk cruzer titanium usb flash drives as well as their sansa line of flashbased mp player and casings of some mobile phones like the luxury vertu products and other toughened consumer electronicscitation needed liquidmetal was used in the biolase dental laser ilase and the socketmobile ring bar code scanner liquidmetal has

end result of a research program into amorphous metals carried out at caltech it was the first of a series of experimental alloys that could achieve an amorphous structure at relatively slow cooling ratescitation needed amorphous metals had been made before but only in small batches because cooling rates needed to be in the millions of degrees per second for example amorphous wires could be fabricated by splat quenching a stream of molten metal on a spinning disk because vitreloy allowed such slow cooling rates production of larger batch sizes was possible more recently a number of

glasses in that its viscosity drops gradually with increased temperature at high temperature it behaves in a plastic manner allowing the mechanical properties to be controlled relatively easily during casting the viscosity prevents the atoms moving enough to form an ordered lattice so the material retains its amorphous properties even after being heatformed the alloys have relatively low softening temperatures allowing casting of complicated shapes without need for finishing the material properties immediately after casting are much better than those of conventional metals usually cast metals have worse properties than forged or wrought ones the alloys are also malleable at low temperatures  °c or  °f for the earliest formulation and can be molded the low free volume also results in low
