accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business however the company does not have significant cash or other current assets nor does it have an established source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and to allow it to continue as a going concern under the going concern assumption an entity is ordinarily viewed as continuing in business for the foreseeable future with neither the intention nor the necessity of liquidation ceasing trading or seeking protection from creditors pursuant to laws or regulations accordingly assets and liabilities are recorded on the basis that the entity will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plan described in the preceding paragraph and eventually attain profitable operations the accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that may be necessary if the company is unable to continue as a going concern   in the coming year the company ’ s foreseeable cash requirements will relate to continual development of the operations of its business maintaining its good standing and making the requisite filings with the securities and exchange commission and the payment of expenses associated with operations and business developments the company may experience a cash shortfall and be required to raise additional capital historically as the company has no business revenues it has mostly relied upon funds contributed by shareholders and associated companies to finance its overheads and research management may raise additional capital by retaining net earnings or through future public or private offerings of the company ’ s stock or through loans from private investors although there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain such financing the company ’ s failure to do so could have a material and adverse effect upon it and its shareholders      note c –

control over financial reporting as of september   in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in internal controlintegrated framework  our management has concluded that as of september   our internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on these criteria in its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of september    we determined that the following deficiencies constituted a materia l weakness as described below  certain entity level controls establishing a “ tone at the top ” were considered material weaknesses the company has no audit committee there is no policy on fraud and no code of ethics at this time  a whistleblower policy is not necessary given the small size of the organization  management override of existing controls is possible given the small size of the organization and lack of personnel  there is no system in place to review and monitor internal control over financial reporting the company maintains an insufficient complement of personnel to carry out ongoing monitoring responsibilities and ensure effective internal control over financial reporting management is currently evaluating remediation plans for the above control deficiencies   accordingly the company concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the company

intends to work more closely with our auditors to correct this ineffectiveness b managements report on internal control over financial reporting our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule aifunder the exchange act our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december   in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in internal controlintegrated framework  our management has concluded that as of december   our internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on these criteria in its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of december     we determined that the following deficiencies constituted a material weakness as described below  certain entity level controls establishing a “ tone at the top ” were considered material weaknesses the company has no audit committee there is no policy on fraud and no code of ethics at this time  a whistleblower policy is not necessary given the small size of the organization  management override of existing controls is possible given the small size of the organization and lack of personnel  there is no system in place to review and monitor internal control over financial reporting the company maintains an insufficient complement of personnel to carry out ongoing monitoring responsibilities and ensure effective internal control over financial reporting management is currently evaluating remediation plans for the above control deficiencies   accordingly the company concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the company ’ s internal controls however as the company currently has no business operations of any kind all controls would be theoretical at best there is no chance of a material misstatement when all the company does is pay audit fees this annual report

statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business however the company does not have significant cash or other current assets nor does it have an established source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and to allow it to continue as a going concern under the going concern assumption an entity is ordinarily viewed as continuing in business for the foreseeable future with neither the intention nor the necessity of liquidation ceasing trading or seeking protection from creditors pursuant to laws or regulations accordingly assets and liabilities are recorded on the basis that the entity will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to

accurate as possible to lead to the highest percentage of successful western lucrative purchases   we intend to focus only on items which can be designed without travel to the location our competition

discussion on the intellectual property issues we face in our business our research and development we are not currently conducting any research and development activities for all lines of products we will offer we intend to rely on concepts and other intellectual property developed by randall a baker our sole officer and director mr baker is under no contractual obligation to the company to continue to develop new lines of websites nor is he under any contractual obligation to assign his rights in any new lines of websites to the company we do not intend to use any other person other

activities employees as ofmarch   we have no employees other than our sole officer and director we anticipate that we will not hire any employees in the next twelve months unless we generate significant revenues we believe our future success depends in large part upon the continued service of our sole officer and director randall a baker        item a risk factors because our auditors have issued a going concern opinion there is substantial uncertainty we will continue operations in which case you could lose your investment                                                                                                 our auditors have issued a going concern opinion this means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next  months the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the uncertainty about our ability to continue in business as such we may have to cease operations and you could lose your investment we lack an operating history and have losses that we expect to continue into the future there is no assurance our future operations will result in profitable revenues if we cannot generate sufficient revenues to operate profitably we will cease operations and you will lose your investment we were incorporated on july   and we have not started our proposed business operations or realized any revenues we have no operating history upon which an evaluation of our future success or failure can be made our ability to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow is dependent upon ·      our ability to develop and continually update a functional userfriendly website ·      our ability to procure and maintain on commercially reasonable terms relationships with third parties to develop and maintain ·      our website network infrastructure and transaction processing systems ·      our ability to identify and pursue mediums through which we will be able to market our products ·      our ability to attract customers to our website ·      our ability to generate revenues through sales on our website and ·      our ability to manage growth by managing administrative overhead based upon current plans we expect to incur operating losses in future periods because we will be incurring expenses and not generating revenues we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in generating revenues in the future we may be unable to protect the intellectual property rights that we have randall a baker our sole officer and director developed the concepts behind the business plan mr baker assigned any intellectual property rights that he may have had in that line to us while mr baker did not believe that website plan infringed on the intellectual property rights of third parties mr baker did not take any steps such as copyright or trademark protection to protect his intellectual property rights nor did he conduct any investigation to see if the website plan infringed on the intellectual property rights of third parties we have not conducted any investigation to see if the website plan infringes on the intellectual property rights of others we have also not taken any further steps to protect our intellectual property rights in the website designer do we intend to do so until after we receive the proceeds from the offering and start our operations mr baker is under no contractual obligation to western lucrative to continue to develop new web products nor is he under any contractual obligation to assign his intellectual property rights in any new lines to western lucrative we do not intend to use any person other than mr baker as a source of concepts for new lines to offer on our website we intend to rely on a combination of copyright trademark and trade secret protection and nondisclosure agreements with employees and thirdparty service providers to establish and protect the intellectual property rights that we have in the products we manufacture and distribute there can be no assurance that our competitors will not independently develop products that are substantially equivalent or superior to ours there also can be no assurance that the measures we adopt to protect our intellectual property rights will be adequate to do so the ability of our competitors to develop products or other intellectual property rights equivalent or superior to ours or that our inability to enforce our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse affect our results of operation though we do not believe that any of the products will infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties in any material respect there can be no assurance that third parties will not claim infringement by us with respect to the products any such claim with or without merit could be timeconsuming result in costly litigation cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements such royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition    changing consumer preferences will require periodic product introduction as a result of changing consumer preferences many websites are successfully marketed for a limited period of time there can be no assurance that any of our food and bakery products continue to be popular for a period of time our success will be dependent upon our ability to develop new and improved product lines our failure to introduce new sites and product lines and to achieve and sustain market acceptance and to produce acceptable margins could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations we face intense competition and our inability to successfully compete with our competitors will have a material adverse effect on our results of operation the landscape design industry is highly competitive  many of our competitors have longer operating histories greater brand recognition broader product lines and greater financial resources and advertising budgets than we do many of our competitors offer similar products or alternatives to our products we intend to rely solely on concepts and other intellectual property developed by randall a baker our sole officer and director there can be no assurance that we will procure an online retail market that will be available to support the sites we will offer or allow us to seek expansion there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively in this marketplace intellectual property claims against us can be costly and could impair our business other parties may assert infringement or unfair competition claims against us we cannot predict whether third parties will assert claims of infringement against us or whether any future assertions or prosecutions will harm our business if we are forced to defend against any such claims whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor then we may face costly litigation diversion of technical and management personnel or product shipment delays as a result of such a dispute we may have to develop noninfringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements such royalty or licensing agreements if required may be unavailable on terms acceptable to us or at all if there is a successful claim of product infringement against us and we are unable to develop noninfringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology on a timely basis it could impair our business if we do not attract customers to our website on costeffective terms we will not make a profit which ultimately will result in a cessation of operations our success depends on our ability to attract retail customers to our website on costeffective terms our strategy to attract customers to our website which has not been formalized or implemented includes viral marketing the practice of generating buzz among internet users in our products through the developing and maintaining weblogs or blogs online journals that are updated frequently and available to the public postings on online communities such as yahoor groups and amateur websites such as youtubecom and other methods of getting internet users to refer others to our website by email or word of mouth search engine optimization marketing our website via search engines by purchasing sponsored placement in search results and entering into affiliate marketing relationships with website providers to increase our access to internet consumers we expect to rely on viral marketing as the primary source of traffic to our website with search engine optimization

business operations if we need additional funds and cant raise the money we will have to cease operations if we do not make a profit we may have to suspend or cease operations because we are small and do not have much capital we must limit the marketing of our website the website is how we will generate revenue because we will be limiting our marketing activities we may not be able to attract enough suppliers and customers to operate profitably if we cannot operate profitably we may have to suspend or cease operations because our sole officer and director will only be devoting limited time

customers and result in a lack of revenues that may cause us to suspend or cease operations our sole officer and director randall a baker will only be devoting limited time to our operations mr baker will be devoting approximately  hours per week of his time to our operations because our sole officer and director will only be devoting limited time to our operations our operations may be sporadic and occur at times which are convenient to him as a result operations may be periodically interrupted or suspended which could result in a lack of revenues and a possible cessation of operations because our sole officer and director does not have prior experience in online marketing we may have to hire individuals or suspend or cease operations because our sole officer and director does not have prior experience in online marketing we may have to hire additional experienced personnel to assist us with our operations if we need the additional experienced personnel and we do not hire them we could fail in our plan of operations and have to suspend operations or cease operations because our sole officer and director does not have prior experience in financial accounting and the preparation of reports under the securities exchange act of  we may have to hire individuals which could result in an expense we are unable to pay because our sole officer and director does not have

investment because we have only one officer and director who is responsible for our managerial and organizational structure in the future there may not be effective disclosure and accounting controls to comply with applicable laws and regulations which could result in fines penalties and assessments against us we have only one officer and director he is responsible for our managerial and organizational structure which will include preparation of disclosure and accounting controls under the sarbanes oxley act of  when theses controls are implemented he will be responsible for the administration of the controls should he not have sufficient experience he may be incapable of creating and implementing the controls which may cause us to be subject to sanctions and fines by the securities and exchange commission we are completely dependent on our sole officer and director to guide our initial operations initiate our plan of operations and provide financial support if we lose

limited amount of time to our operations    risks relating to the internet industry our success is tied to the continued use of the internet and the adequacy of the internet infrastructure our future revenues and profits if any substantially depend upon the continued widespread use of the internet as an effective medium of business and communication factors which could reduce the widespread use of the internet include       actual or perceived lack of security of information or privacy protection       possible disruptions computer viruses or other damage to the internet servers or to users computers and       excessive governmental regulation       customers may be unwilling to use the internet to purchase dating services our future depends heavily upon the general publics willingness to use the internet as a means to purchase dating services the demand for and acceptance of dating services sold over the internet are highly uncertain and most ecommerce businesses have a short track record if consumers are unwilling to use the internet to conduct business our business may not develop profitably our relationships with our customers may be adversely affected if the security measures that we use to protect their personal information such as credit card numbers are ineffective any breach in our website security could expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability we anticipate that we will rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to provide secure transmission of confidential information as a result of advances in computer capabilities new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments a compromise or breach of our security precautions may occur a compromise in our proposed security could severely harm our business a party who is able to circumvent our proposed security measures could misappropriate proprietary information including customer credit card information or cause interruptions in the operation of our website we may be required to spend significant funds and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these breaches however protection may not be available at a reasonable price or at all concerns regarding the security of ecommerce and the privacy of users may also inhibit the growth of the internet as a means of conducting commercial transactions because we will rely primarily on online credit card payment for our services we will risk fraudulent credit card transactions a failure to adequately control such transactions would harm our net sales and results of operations because we do not intend to carry insurance against this risk we intend to utilize technology to help us detect the fraudulent use of credit card information nonetheless we may suffer losses as a result of orders placed with fraudulent credit card data even though the associated financial institution approved payment of the orders under current credit card practices we will be liable for fraudulent credit card transactions because we do not intend to obtain a cardholders signature because we have no operating history we cannot predict our future levels of baddebt expense if one or more states successfully assert that we should collect sales or other taxes on the sale of the merchandise that we offer for sale on our website our business could be harmed we do not intend to collect sales or other similar taxes for physical shipments of goods into states other than texas one or more local state or foreign jurisdictions may seek to impose sales tax collection obligations on us and other outofstate companies that engage in online commerce our business could be adversely affected if one or more states or any foreign country successfully asserts that we should collect sales or other taxes on the sale of our merchandise                                                                                   existing or future government regulation could harm our business we are subject to the same federal state and local laws as other companies conducting business on the internet today there are relatively few laws specifically directed towards conducting business on the internet however due to the increasing popularity and use of the internet many laws and regulations relating to the internet are being debated at the state and federal levels these laws and regulations could cover issues such as user privacy freedom of expression pricing fraud quality of products and services taxation advertising intellectual property rights and information security applicability to the internet of existing laws governing issues such as property ownership copyrights and other intellectual property issues taxation libel obscenity and personal privacy could also harm our business current and future laws and regulations could harm our business results of operation and financial condition laws or regulations relating to privacy and data protection may adversely affect the growth of our internet business or our marketing efforts we are subject to increasing regulation at the federal state and international levels relating to privacy and the use of personal user information these data protection regulations and enforcement efforts may restrict our ability to collect demographic and personal information from users which could be costly or harm our marketing efforts      item b unresolved staff
