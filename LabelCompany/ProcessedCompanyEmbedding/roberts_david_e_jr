state of missouri respondent          wd opinion filed july   appeal from the circuit court of lafayette county missouri the honorable dennis a rolf judge before division two edward r ardini jr presiding judge karen king mitchell judge and anthony rex gabbert judge david e rice jr appeals the judgment of the circuit court of lafayette county denying his amended rule  motion for postconviction relief on appeal rice argues that three ineffective assistance of counsel claims raised in his amended motion were not refuted by the record and therefore he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on those claims we find that rice was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on his claim that he was misinformed by his counsel regarding the amount of his sentence that would have to be served before being eligible for parole the judgment is reversed and remanded for an evidentiary hearing on that claim  all references are to missouri supreme court rules  unless otherwise noted factual background and procedural history rice was charged as a prior and persistent offender with felony resisting a lawful stop felony driving with a revoked license and misdemeanor possession of a controlled substance rice entered an open guilty plea on september   during the plea colloquy rice admitted that on or about november   he resisted a lawful stop by fleeing from an officer who he knew was attempting a lawful stop and created a substantial risk of serious physical injury or death to other persons by operating his motor vehicle off of the road and through residential yards he further admitted that his driver’s license was revoked and he possessed marijuana at the time rice understood that the driving while revoked charge was enhanced to a felony because he had three prior convictions for driving while his license was revoked rice also admitted to other prior felony convictions rice affirmatively acknowledged his rights and that he was waiving those rights in order to bring the matter to a conclusion and was examined regarding the performance of his counsel the judge accepted his plea finding that “rice voluntarily intelligently and knowingly entered his guilty plea and that his plea of guilty was not the result of threats or promises apart from plea negotiations with the state” on october   the parties appeared for sentencing rice was sentenced to seven years for resisting a lawful stop seven years for felony driving with a revoked license and six months for misdemeanor possession of a controlled substance all to run concurrent to each other and to rice’s previously imposed sentences each sentence fell within the applicable range of punishment the court determined that probable cause did not exist to find that rice had received ineffective assistance of counsel “resisting an arrest    by fleeing in such a manner that the person fleeing creates a substantial risk of serious physical injury or death to any person is a class d felony” and “any person    convicted a third or subsequent time of driving while revoked    is guilty of a class d felony” §  resisting an arrest §  driving while revoked the maximum term of imprisonment for a class d felony is four years §    on january   rice filed a pro se  motion to vacate set aside or correct the judgment and sentence an amended motion was filed on june   alleging ineffective assistance of counsel and that the sentencing court lacked jurisdiction on march   the state made an oral motion to deny the amended motion without a hearing which was granted on may   the motion court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law denying all claims this appeal follows standard of review our review of a trial court’s decision on a rule  motion is “limited to a determination of whether the findings and conclusions of the trial court are clearly erroneous” ie whether the reviewing “court is left with the definite and firm impression that a mistake has been made” sabatucci v state  swd   mo app ed  quoting rule k roberts v state  swd   mo banc  the movant bears the burden of showing “by a preponderance of the evidence that the motion court clearly erred in its ruling” sabatucci  swd at  quoting roberts  swd at  discussion on appeal rice alleges that the trial court erred in denying his amended motion without an evidentiary hearing arguing that he pleaded factual allegations relating to three of his ineffective assistance of counsel claims that were not refuted by the record and would warrant relief if proven a movant who seeks relief under rule  is entitled to an evidentiary hearing if however rice was found to be a persistent offender increasing the authorized term of imprisonment to the maximum term allowed for a class c felony seven years §  possession of less than thirtyfive grams of marijuana is a class a misdemeanor §  the authorized term of imprisonment for a class a misdemeanor is one year §  all statutory citations are to the revised statutes of missouri  as supplemented through december     he alleged facts not conclusions warranting relief  the facts alleged raise matters not refuted by the files and record of his case and  the matters complained of resulted in prejudice to him roberts  swd at  citation omitted “an evidentiary hearing may only be denied when the record conclusively shows that the movant is not entitled to relief” id citation omitted “when the requested evidentiary hearing involves a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel the movant must allege facts unrefuted by the record that  trial counsel’s performance did not conform to the degree of skill care and diligence of a reasonably competent attorney and  he was thereby prejudiced” webb v state  swd   mo banc  however where the movant pleaded guilty “any claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is immaterial except to the extent that it impinges the voluntariness and knowledge with which the plea was made” sabatucci  swd at  quoting cooper v state  swd   mo banc  the burden is on the movant “to demonstrate that his guilty pleas were not knowingly and voluntarily entered” felton v state  sw   mo app sd  citing walker v state  swd   mo app wd  the movant “must show but for the conduct of his plea counsel about which he complains he would not have pleaded guilty but would have insisted on going to trial” roberts  swd at  citation omitted see also stanley v state  swd   mo banc  webb  swd at  “a plea of guilty is not made voluntarily if the defendant is misled or is induced to plead guilty by fraud or mistake by misapprehension fear persuasion or the holding out of hopes which prove to be false or ill founded” roberts  swd at  citation omitted if there are no allegations showing prejudice then no hearing is required stanley  swd at  citation omitted  i failure of counsel to inform rice of court date in his first point on appeal rice argues that he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on his claim that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his counsel failed to notify him of a change in court dates he asserts that the missed court date and the length of time before his next court appearance resulted in him being denied an opportunity to seek a change of judge as a matter of right as a consequence he argues that his guilty pleas were not voluntary knowing and intelligent according to the record rice’s arraignment in circuit court was held on june   although rice’s argument is founded on a failure of counsel to notify him of a “change in a court hearing date” the arraignment appears to have been held on the date originally set and there is nothing in the record to suggest that it was ever changed rice’s alleged confusion regarding the court dates seems to stem from the fact that he had initially been charged by felony complaint in the associate division of the circuit court before the case was transferred to the circuit court upon rice’s indictment a determination of the precise factual basis for rice’s confusion is not necessary however because his claim is otherwise refuted by the record as previously stated rice’s arraignment was scheduled for june   although rice failed to appear at his arraignment his counsel entered a plea of not guilty on his behalf pursuant to rule  rice then had ten days to request a change of judge as a matter of right rice argues that his counsel’s failure to inform him of the arraignment date denied him this opportunity because the next court date was scheduled for june   more than ten days after his initial plea was entered and thus after his right to obtain a judge as a matter of right expired contrary to his “a change of judge shall be ordered in any criminal proceeding upon the timely filing of a written application therefor be any party    the application must be filed not later than ten days after the initial plea is entered” rule    assertion the docket sheet shows that rice appeared before the trial judge on june   within the ten day window to request a change of judge as a matter of right refuting his claim that his first appearance in front of the trial judge after arraignment was outside the time to obtain a change of judge as a matter of right under rule  because this claim was refuted by the record rice was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing point i is denied ii failure of counsel to request change of judge for cause rice claims in his second point on appeal that he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on his claim that his counsel was ineffective by failing to request a change of judge for cause rice’s rule  motion alleges that the plea judge held a personal bias against him the record is thin on the precise basis of this asserted bias other than an allegation that the judge presiding over the plea hearing “had a family member living at the care facility in waverly missouri where count i of resisting arrest occurred in part” rice argues that his counsel’s failure to move for a change of judge for cause rendered his plea involuntary unknowing and unintelligent this claim was also denied by the motion court without an evidentiary hearing and similar to point i is refuted by the record in direct contradiction to rice’s assertions the docket sheet reflects that on july   his counsel made an oral request for a change of judge which was denied although it is not clear from the record before us whether the request was for a change of judge as a matter of right or for cause it is undisputable that the request was made after the time permitted under rule  to request a change of judge as a matter of right and thus is presumed to have been premised on a “for cause” theory moreover aside from the factual inaccuracy noted above rice fails to explain how his counsel’s alleged failure to inform him of the june   arraignment date precluded the filing of a motion for a change of judge in a timely fashion as rule  merely requires that any party or any attorney for any party file a written application for change of judge filing such an application does not require that a party appear before the trial court   in addition apart from the fact that the factual predicate for his claim is directly refuted by the record rice fails to plead facts demonstrating how he was prejudiced by the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel no explanation is proffered as to how his counsel’s purported failure to request a change of judge for cause resulted in his later guilty plea not being voluntary or knowing see sabatucci  swd at  “any claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is immaterial except to the extent that it impinges the voluntariness and knowledge with which the plea was made” rice was aware of the identity of the judge presiding over his case as well as the alleged familial connection to a resident at the care center at the time of the plea and sentencing hearings and he provides no basis other than a bare conclusory allegation to find that he entered his guilty plea because he was “misled or   induced to plead guilty by fraud or mistake by misapprehension fear persuasion or the holding out of hopes which prove to be false or ill founded” roberts  swd at  because rice’s claim is refuted by the record and he has failed to plead facts demonstrating he was prejudiced no evidentiary hearing on this claim was required see stanley  swd at  if there are no allegations showing prejudice then no hearing is required point ii is denied iii misinformation regarding parole rice’s final point on appeal alleges that he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on his claim that his counsel was ineffective for misinforming him that he would not have to serve eighty percent of any sentence imposed he argues that he would not have pleaded guilty if he had known that he would be required to serve eighty percent of his sentence and as a result his guilty pleas were not voluntary knowing and intelligent  the motion court denied this claim without an evidentiary hearing stating that “rice was told no one could guarantee when he would be released and that he might have to serve his entire sentence” however a review of the plea hearing transcript reveals that rice was only advised that he could receive a cumulative sentence of up to fifteen years the state argues that rice’s claim is otherwise refuted by the record because rice represented to the court during the plea and sentencing hearings that he was pleading guilty only out of hope that the court would order him into a treatment program never referenced parole eligibility as a basis of his decision to plead guilty and acknowledged there had been no other promises made regarding the final disposition of this case however the state’s argument was specifically rejected by the missouri supreme court in webb the movant in webb alleged that he had been misinformed by his plea counsel concerning his parole eligibility and argued that he was prejudiced because “but for his attorney’s misrepresentation he would have rejected pleading guilty and instead would have insisted on proceeding to trial”  swd at  the missouri supreme court held “that where counsel misinforms the client as to the effects of the client’s plea the counsel has rendered ineffective representation” id at  the court specifically explained a defendant can say correctly that he was promised nothing but this does not mean he was given correct advice as to the effects of his plea moreover the defendant’s response   that he was satisfied with his attorney’s services obviously was not made with knowledge that his plea attorney’s alleged advice had been incorrect   a negative response to a routine inquiry has not been considered sufficient to refute the record id at  citation omitted accordingly “the motion court’s finding that the record refuted the defendant’s claim was clearly erroneous” and the defendant was entitled to an evidentiary hearing id at   the webb court further noted that the movant would be entitled to relief  if at the evidentiary hearing he proved the facts alleged in his motion and “established that he was prejudiced by relying on that information” id at  rice’s allegation is factually indistinguishable from webb and the motion court’s finding that his claim was refuted by the record was clearly erroneous see id at  as in webb rice is entitled to an evidentiary hearing on this claim and “may be entitled to relief if he proves the facts he has alleged and establishes that he was prejudiced by relying on misinformation” see id at  point iii is granted conclusion the motion court’s judgment is affirmed in part reversed in part and the case is remanded for an evidentiary hearing on rice’s claim raised in point iii  edward r ardini jr judge all concur  search this case google scholar google books legal blogs google web bing web google news google news archive yahoo
