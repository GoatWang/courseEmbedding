last  months weve sold  hotels at attractive prices weve redeemed  preferred shares and weve built upon our longstanding track record of bestinclass asset management with our  hotel ebitda margin we will come back to the highlights of our transactions and operational performance in a few minutes we will start this morning with an update on recent industry performance when we look at the broader lodging industry we continue to see mixed signals on a high level industry revpar has been encouraging with modest growth continuing well into the eighth year of the cycle the second quarter industry revpar was up  bringing the first half of the year to  growth even after a move in january due to the boost from inauguration the year will still be up to close to  for the period of february through june however when we look at a few segments that make up the industry namely urban and upper upscale we start to see a very different picture for both segments second quarter revpar was up  despite the slow growth in q the yeartodate performance is notably stronger which is largely due to the recordbreaking january in dc over the inauguration if we look at just february through june results for urban and upper upscale the growth in both cases would be just over  this trend has continued in july where the industry is up close to  monthtodate where urban and upper upscale segments are below  for the same period when we spoke on our first quarter call we knew that the april month results for urban were going to be hurt by the easter shift for the urban segment april revpar ultimately decreased by   by  may rebounded a bit and finished up  june was another disappointing month with revpar up  with elevated supply in these urban markets were not surprised to see the trend of industry underperformance continue this quarter having recapped the industrys performance in some of its more relevant component parts lets now walk through our monthly results which were not materially different than the urban segment especially given our higher exposure to san francisco our revpar declined each month with april down  may down  and june down  excluding san francisco which was negatively impacted by the construction of the moscone convention center our revpar in april was flat may was up nearly  points and june was basically flat in total our second quarter revpar declined  driven primarily by occupancy excluding san francisco our second quarter revpar was up nearly  later in the call ken will provide more color on some of the markets specific performance focusing on the group and transient mix for q  of our demand was transient and  was group which is consistent with our recent history our transient revpar was flat with a slight increase in occupancy and a decrease in rate our group revpar was a tougher comparison with fewer citywides and revpar was down  with rate up  and volume down  its important to note that approximately half of this group revpar decline for the portfolio was in san francisco now lets examine a few other components within the transient segment in the second quarter we saw our corporatenegotiated room nights increase by  which is a second quarter in a row volume growth in this segment our corporate adr was also up  this quarter in addition we experienced a modest shift out of the ota channels and into lower cost property websites both of these trends in our transient business are positive for the profitability of our rooms department moving on to our international business our volume decreased by  during the quarter which is entirely a result of less international business to park central new york including that  hotel our international demand was actually up  we mention this distinction as a reminder of how sensitive this data can be to small swings given that international volume represents less than  of our total demand our teams laserfocus on expense management is evident in the total portfolio results as well our asset managers and teams across the portfolio continue to relentlessly pursue opportunities to operate efficiently in each department while delivering a great product experience for the guests of the hotels these efforts are reflective in our standout margin of  our total expenses actually dropped by  during the quarter which allowed our margins to remain about  despite a moderate revpar decline now that weve recapped the quarter lets look at the key drivers for industry performance going forward in  regarding supply not much has changed since the beginning of the year industry supply grew by  in the second quarter as expected  supply growth for the industry is still expected to be approximately  looking at our markets specifically were predicting a  weighted average supply this year which is similar to stars urban segment yeartodate supply increase of  as is our custom well now discuss the components of demand and the economic landscape as we see it today lets start with group as mentioned previously citywides are down in many of our markets since  the bright spot for citywide for the remainder of the year are boston and dc for the balance of the year our overall group pace is now up by  which is down in q and up in q the next piece of demand is corporate for the sp  profits are estimated to increase in q for the fourth straight quarter which will be encouraging although we suspect it may take another few quarters of corporate profit improvement before we see it translate into additional sustained demand into our markets in addition to corporate profits the other economic indicators we track have all remained relatively stable this year gdp is estimated to grow by  in  consumer confidence which reached a year high in march retreated slightly during the second quarter but the index still sits in an elevated level which is a good sign unemployment dropped even lower to  and employment have been steady since the beginning of the year with modest capacity increases planned for many of the airline carriers as a whole the facts we have today about increasing supply growth and softer overall demand keep us cautious on the industry fundamentals going forward the recent improvements and general strength in the macroeconomic environment are positive signs that they have not yet translated to the urban and upper upscale lodging performance before handing the call over to ken i want to touch on the westin philadelphia sale for  million or nearly  per key which represented an approximate  trailing noi cap rate after normalizing for the dnc impact last july while this is a fine investment over  years we saw a good opportunity to take advantage of the sellers market two of the central reasons for our timing in addition to buyers interest was the upcoming hotel supply growth and the weakening citywide demand in philadelphia on a particular note within the supply which is expected to grow by over  over the next  years is that nearly  of the new rooms will be in the marriott distribution system which will have an outsized impact on the westin in total the  asset sales that are completed this year provided approximately  million of proceeds while we did redeem the  seriesa preferred shares for  million were not in a rush to allocate the remaining capital from these sales whether that as a future acquisition buying back stock or otherwise were in an excellent position to pivot in either direction depending on how the year unfolds first and foremost we make decisions that we think are in the best interest of the shareholders now ken will provide some details about our second quarter performance as well as an update on our balance sheet ken kenneth fuller thank you mike and good morning everyone ill start by providing more color on our second quarter results our best performing markets during the quarter in terms of revpar were boston philadelphia san diego and new york with growth of    and  respectively boston performance was strong across all  of our hotels and the market as a whole benefited from good citywides the citywide calendar for the balance of the year in boston continues to be strong similarly philadelphia had a great citywide quarter and the embassy suites began its rent out of renovation looking forward we note q will be a tough comparison with the dnc in july  and a very strong citywide quarter last year san diego downtown has been a steady performer this year and some of our resorts outside of the cbd had a second  a strong second quarter as well new york also experienced modest growth during the quarter however this growth was entirely from a great april the last  months have been tougher which we suspect will be the norm for the short term our toughest market this quarter was san francisco chicago key west and la san francisco citywide story is wellknown and as a result our hotels there are in a more challenging operating environment the second quarter was expected to have the most significant impact from the moscone expansion but q will also be difficult citywide pace does start to look more encouraging at the end of this year and heading into  while the chicago market had a decent citywide quarter our hotel did not feel as much compression from the smaller event that dominated the calendar our key west hotels experienced a rare win quarter on the top line after consistently beating the market each quarter for the last  years regarding la we benefited last year from the porter ranch gas leak and the supply reduction which contributed to  revpar growth in q so we were facing a tough comparison this year that said we were only down  in q with respect to our bottom line performance our asset management team and our operators have continued to do an outstanding job our hotels delivered solid results overall driven by another excellent quarter of limiting expenses which actually decreased by just over  in the quarter and our ebitda margin held up at an impressive level above  we did have another quarter of fb revenue decline and that led to a corresponding  drop in fb expenses the fb revenue decrease was partially due to the restaurant closure at villa florence as we described in april and it was also a result of less group banquets at our larger hotels turning to capital we invested approximately  million in our portfolio during the quarter partially for the renovations well be starting during q  the  largest projects we have upcoming are lifecycle room renovations at westin copley in boston and paradise point in san diego finally ill provide a brief update on our balance sheet which was further strengthened following the  asset sales in the quarter and the preferred share redemption in may we redeemed a  series h preferred shares for  million which will save the company  million of expense annually as of june  we had total debt outstanding of  billion the total debt to trailing month corporate ebitda including  million of cash on hand was x additionally we finished the quarter with fixed charge coverage of nearly x we continue to have substantial flexibility with  of our  hotels unencumbered by debt and nearly  million of capacity available on our lines of credit we have a highly liquid balance sheet and remain extremely well capitalized so that completes our prepared remarks and mike and i would now be happy to answer any questions you may have ryan questionandanswer session operator operator instructions and well go first to shaun kelley with bank of america shaun kelley mike i sort of have a just a high level kind of theoretical question for you but just as we look at the overall operating environment weve seen like you said i think now  quarters of corporate profit growth is there a period in your career where we just  weve seen something similar in terms of this kind of lack of translation of a fairly positive macro backdrop into whether itd be pricing or just overall  ultimately that translating to overall revpar is there a period in time that this reminds you of or do you think were sort of in a little bit of a new area given whats going on with urban supply at the moment michael barnello i think theres a couple of pieces to that question we think about it  we look at corporate strength corporate america got beat up for about  quarters and then they started to improve and what youve seen are earnings increases starting in q last year which has continued and hopefully continues in q moving forward now recall a lot of those bids are on the bottom so you are seeing bids in the top  but there is a lot of bids in the bottom which would effectively hurt us because some of those folks are actually have been restraining travel including a lot of the bankers that we deal whether its limiting the cost of the travel or limiting the amount of people who are traveling so you are seeing a little bit of that and then when you think back in history to answer the other part of your question no its an unusual period of time right if you look back for about a year period where smith travel existed and tracked a lot of these segments really the urban and upper upscale particularly the urban had outperformed really in every year that was a nonrecessionary year so throughout   but when  in  but wait but in kind of the normalized years the markets have done a much much better starting in  what you saw  you saw that reversed where industry beat urban upper upscale and thats continued and thats been one of the focuses of our discussions for the last couple of years a couple of things to that you mentioned one of them yes the supply in those markets in the top  particularly our markets has been elevated people have gotten it right in terms of where theyre building theyre building where the demand is so from that perspective it make sense but thats obviously tougher competition for us the other thing is that when you look at who was done better when you slice and dice these segments the lowerpriced segments have done better over the last couple of years theres no perfect way to get an answer for that one of our suspicions is that as unemployment has recovered going from what was  in  and  to now down to the low s a lot of folks whose jobs have recovered it has been attracted more to the lowerpriced segment which would make sense that they have done better obviously theres also been a proliferation of the short term rentals throughout the country that obviously has an impact as well which is really kind of embedded in the supply discussion so we think thats it i dont think theres a perfect correlation in the past couple of decades that suggests were mimicking another period i do think that at some point well ultimately recover these are markets that have a ton of demand generators the demand has been elevated in these markets and so people are building for reasons people keep coming so i dont think its a situation where the urban and upper upscale are bad places to be i just think that theyre a tougher place to be at this moment shaun kelley and then just a quick followup you called out in your prepared remarks that i think we excelled in san francisco june was flat april was flat i think april we all would have anticipated around the shifts but any color on sort of why kind of the summertime softness here it seems like that  like to your point that might also be continuing into july so just any insight onto what exactly is going on in june michael barnello we think its a lot of the same shaun i mean these markets have been doing okay because i dont think that running  is a train wreck by any means but its not exciting its not the levels that were looking for of  or  or more growth and were not really surprised by it i do think that when we look out what we see is a number of things that would suggest this will continue for a while i mean you do see the supply thats not going away anytime soon what youre also seeing is that citywides are not as strong particularly in q and i guess ill look at this as the rest of the year from more of a macro perspective but in q the citywides in our markets are overall down about  what youre seeing is now you have a couple of jewish holidays that will hurt september and when we think about it from our perspective for q our pacing right now is down about  thats group and transient when you think about q moving to the next quarter you see why pace is better its up by  our pace is down slightly but you do have the jewish holidays that actually will help october because there will be  less this year however from our perspective well see some additional impact from renovations we have a little more renovations going on in the q than we did last year and obviously we look for  were very interested to see how q plays out because we all got a huge run up last november because of the election i think that was a surprise to everybody and everybody will be curious to see how that laps so when we look out to the future we see a lot of things that are concerning so we dont see things changing anytime very quickly operator and well go next to smedes rose with citi abhishek kastiya this is abhishek for smedes could you guys just provide a little more color on san francisco and what your expectations are for the balance of the year and i think on prior calls youve shared your citywide group numbers so could you just give us an update for this year and next couple of years michael barnello so i guess id say a couple of things when we look at san francisco overall san francisco in the next couple of quarters these are citywide numbers citywides are down a little over  in q so a reminder q is the worst q was down about  in citywides from a moscone perspective q down  q it gets much better still down but only down slightly to down  so that brings the full year total to down about  for the year good news is that thats the worst of it and then when you look out into  and  what you see is that  is actually up about  and that  is actually up not quite  so were not surprised by that those have been pretty consistent numbers that we get now for a while if you think about it moscone did a renovation and an expansion so theyre bringing in more capacity to have additional shows theyre taking advantage of that just to give you some phenomenal color on that just to make a finer point of it when you think about it the prior peak for citywide business was  with  rooms were going down to  rooms this year we come back up to about  again these are moscone numbers but then look into  theres  rooms in the books so thats eyeballing it  more than the prior peak on the books so really should be in very good shape for  a little bit of supply coming in san francisco over the next couple of years but not really significant one of the better markets overall they have just under  this year a little bit of increase next year  but then very muted thereafter so this should be an excellent position to take advantage of that abhishek kastiya got it and then just management fees are a little higher yearoveryear while revenues and profits were slightly down so was there anything in particular that led to that increase or michael barnello a big reason for that is the westin michigan avenue they have a good calculation for profit sharing but a tricky calculation for a public company the managed fee is actually  fluctuates based on the capital we put in so when we did a renovation what happens is the management the incentive fee is reduced for the buyback so that  what that happened is the prior year and so the incentive fee went down as a result this year theres no renovation and the incentive fee goes back to normal but it makes that comparisons look like theres a big increase operator and well go next to patrick scholes with suntrust patrick scholes a couple of questions i have first you mentioned in the prepared remarks on the park central experiencing  the park central new york experienced some weakness from international travelers can you give a little more color on that michael barnello i dont know that i would actually necessarily call it weakness from international they just got less international business the park central did okay in the quarter i mean our new york was a little better than new york overall nothing to scream about we were up just over  new york was down slightly in the quarter so i really just think it was just different channels patrick more than it was that youre not coming in one particular channel especially when we look into the rest of our  look at the rest of our portfolio to note that international was up about  so  quarter im not so sure i thought too many conclusions about that but while this is  well continue to track and then keep you guys informed but its  i wouldnt look too much into it patrick scholes okay great second question concerns group pace you noted in the prepared remarks its for the rest of the year up  versus  in your prior earnings call it was down  i imagine thats just because q is now out of the picture you had also given at that time a group pace for  is negative  would you have a comparable number where the full year  is versus the previous negative  kenneth fuller sure so lets give both to make sure its right youre right weve gone through the q which is the toughest quarter to digest and as weve said q now let me give you about whats right this is group and transient i assume thats what were looking for we mentioned in the prepared remarks combo q down about  q down  at this point the balance of the year yes is up  actually the balance of the year for both group and transient were down about  for the full year right now id put this down to  patrick scholes okay so a slight slippage but measured in basis points as opposed to percentage points michael barnello right i mean obviously theres   theres many takeaways from this one of the things to think about is transient obviously is short term and the numbers are the numbers but its short term booking the second thing is group which is definitely is accurate for our portfolio but i remind folks to keep in mind were  group of which half is  hotels so its definitely not a read through for the industry its really more of a read through for us patrick scholes okay one last question sort of a bigger picture question how do you think about the trajectory of labor cost going forward in relation to what seems to be an increasingly tighter labor market and also what appears to be a bit of crackdown on undocumented workers michael barnello an excellent and timely question i mean youre definitely seeing the cost labor continue to rise as a reminder close to  of our costs are labor benefit related so its very important to us when we look across the portfolio because were in the biggest cities weve seen obviously huge movements mostly west to east to bring minimum wage up and obviously that not just increases the wages but the benefits et cetera the overall cost and we have been experiencing that for the last couple of years the good news for us we dont have a lot of people making minimum wage so the impact has actually not been as dramatic as it could be for much smaller businesses but patrick weve been carrying probably and depending in the year and the markets and how the minimum wage rollouts have happened  to  million increase cost just due to that when we think about the future we have  that run rate will continue pretty much to  or  thats the year most of the minimum wages have to get to the  depending on the city there is a different movement in california the calculation that nonminimum wage workers managers have to make x the minimum wage obviously that could have impact on our hotels again not a big impact where people get  generally get paid a lot more than that properties you also touched on the tiding market yes i mean at some point people worked in the low s on employment for the country and people are talking about going to the mids some of our markets are already in the   the ish percent unemployment thats a tough labor market for us so the only way to think about that as the labor market tighten is that we suspect that getting talented people will continue to be a struggle and ultimately will cost more so thats definitely on our radar for the next couple of years that well have to pay up for talent thats okay but its going to be harder and harder to contain that line item operator well go next to floris van dijkum with boenning floris van dijkum i wanted to get your sense on your fb decline in revenue you mentioned the villa florence and a couple of other renovations that youre  when do you expect to bounce back and whats the magnitude of a potential bounce back in revenue on  in food and beverage michael barnello the fb is one of the trickier line items for us to predict quarterto quarter there is some volatility of  levels one caused by us and one thats not but caused by us i mean the villa florence we purposely closed down kuletos at the end of the year were rebuilding the lobby were going to be putting in an ugg retail store which will be opening up in the next couple of months so the profit story will be greatly enhanced but obviously the food and beverage revenues are diminished during this period and they will be for the rest of the year that will continue at the villa florence we had a similar situation at the marker last year when we leased that out that anniversaryed in the first quarter this year the other big components are a function of the bigbox hotels and how theyve done either with or without inhouse group and sometimes the citywides have an opposite effect on our food and beverage business to the extent that there are additional citywides at some of the hotels sometimes that hurts their ability to capture inhouse fb and there is obviously an effect on our revenues there but if you think about big picture yes were down about  million in fb a big chunk of that is villa florence but really a couple of hotels make up the rest of it westin michigan avenue the copley park central and a couple of smaller hotels really make up all of it and it is a function of what they had whether it was citywides or inhouse so its not a function of a trend this will be going down anywhere near this magnitude continuously its really more a function of what kind of business theyre willing to take with these groups so well the only trend that we know will continue is  things obviously the villa florence will be continued for the rest of the year and the san francisco assets particularly the park central san francisco as a result of it the lack of citywides and taking in more transient business i suspect our fb will continue to be tougher this year and then it will recover the next couple of years as the citywide pace continues to grow floris van dijkum great thanks mike one followup question i had for you as well which is clearly youve got a  the strongest balance sheet in the hotel space you got a tremendous amount of liquidity we believe your shares are undervalued i presume you do as well when will you be looking to buyback stock or what are the trigger points or are we off in terms of where we value the nav for your company michael barnello its a great question the trigger points i know weve discussed this in the past from our perspective when we look at the  our capital allocation what weve been thinking about is were taking advantage of a disconnect in the markets with these sales so weve mentioned what we sold this year we sold a couple of assets last year weve gotten good pricing for all of them and theres been that disconnect where cap rates and the private markets have been generally very low and then the public company valuations havent been as well at the same time were not just looking at the moment in terms of what either our stock is valued at or what a particular hotel is trading at its whats happening in the rest of this year and whats happening in the next couple of years so as we look out into the future some of the things that were faced with right now the increase in supply the demand that has been okay but not as strong as we want to overcome the supply is going to continue in our markets we mentioned on our call that  in our prepared remarks that our weighted average supply story is  up for this year that continues for the next  years so what were worrying about is when will the urban and upper upscale segments which is not just us but most of the reit peers will come out of it of this funk and were hopeful that some of the things were seeing in a more macroeconomic basis will ultimately translate to that but it hasnt yet so far as we discussed earlier in the qa so were waiting for that so waiting for that and that really will be the most important thing for us to look at and then subsequently turn to what is in the market for pricing  pricingwise or our stock so its impossible to give you kind of a nominal answer like the stock will be x before we buy it because it will be a combination of where were at the pricing at the moment as well as what our outlook is for the short and medium term and  because if things soften either way we could take advantage of maybe their pricing disconnects in our stock or if were able to find better buys on the acquisition side then we can take advantage of those as well but its  quite frankly its tbd floris van dijkum so are we then to presume that potentially you think theres a chance that your nav could go down because of the supply growth is that one way to interpret that michael barnello well everybody has a different perspective on nav we dont publish a calculation of our nav so i suppose since everybody has their own nav number i suppose that that number could fluctuate based on their own interpretation of the supply or the performance of the markets floris van dijkum great and could you just remind me how many  how much you have left outstanding on your share buyback authority michael barnello well we authorized  million in april and we thought about rough just  million left so from authorization about  million operator well go next to michael bellisario with baird michael bellisario i just wanted to touch on kind of your broad motivations to sell hotels i guess what gets you to sell a hotel is it really just thinking about that public and private market disconnect and then in the context of you selling more hotels lately particularly this year are you marketing more hotels for sale or better is just hitting your offer price more often today than they were  year or  ago michael barnello i think its more complicated than just looking at the bid ask difference between public and private the specifics of any particular hotel in the market do matter if you think back at what we have sold and ill rewind to about last july we sold our loan in the casashutters thats noncore we sold the indianapolis marriott noncore got a great price we needed  million of capex moving forward we sold hotels in seattle not just because of  we got great pricing on both hotels but hotels one of them at least is in need of grand capex theres a ton of supply coming on seattle and theres some laws that have passed that could if actually they go through the laws if  that have been  have popped up could make operating in seattle very very expensive much more so than they have in the last couple of years you move forward you look at what else we sold lansdowne very specific golf resort those are  resorts are something that we will obviously have and we would buy more of but the details of the resort are important golf not a very big winner for us quite frankly and as golfs declined its been harder and harder to see us making money investing in a golf course and then the other one was the triton and the triton was a short term ground lease that was a in need of significant renovation and b about to unionized which would obviously increase the cost so we think about those very different stories for really almost each of them and so it seems simplistic to say well i can sell it for a  im trading it at whatever lets just get out we do look at whats going on in the short term medium term et cetera when we think about the westin in philadelphia the hotel had done well by us we got a very  a decent cap rate for philadelphia a good price per room but when we look out at the landscape in the last couple of years we see over  supply growth for the next three years and basically half of that is marriott starwood related so thats obviously going to have an enhanced effect on any other marriott starwood product so we just thought that that would be a good time to take advantage of that and so as we look at our portfolio i cant answer your question or else were marketing we wouldnt talk about it until its actually been announced but the details of every single hotel are the most important thing to look at not just the immediate price michael bellisario got it thats fair and then as you sell more hotels do you guys have an incrementally higher threshold for each subsequent sale especially today if you dont have a good use of proceeds then michael barnello thats an interesting question but really no i mean if its the right time to sell a hotel for any of the reasons that i talked about relative to the specifics of the ones that we did sell and its still the right time it doesnt become the wrong time because you sold another hotel  months ago so does it mean that at any point in time your cash balance could be higher i suppose it does but if its right thing to do to get out of a property its the right thing to do no different than if somebody offered us a price for an asset that they had to have we  our job is to evaluate it but it would be hard to say we would turn it down because we had just sold another hotel in the market michael bellisario understood and then just lastly on the dividend because if you do keep selling hotels it sounds like thats kind of the path youre pursuing and whats the likelihood of a special dividend towards the end of the year and at what point do you maybe think about rightsizing the payout ratio if you continue to sell hotels michael barnello well the dividend is obviously something thats super important to us super important to the board and obviously shareholders so moving that takes some serious decision making but a lot goes into that mike we still have  months left in the year we have to figure out what happens we have gains about  million between the assets we still have a bunch of runway left in terms of the operating performance of the portfolio for the rest of the year and then anything else we might do in a transactional basis so its still too early to say what we would do what i would tell you is that remind everybody that over the last  years weve just paid out the requirement im not saying thats our goal but between the way we can move the dividend to or from a prior or future year weve paid out what weve had to pay out relative to the calculation of  from a reit perspective and again thats not our philosophy but we will take all that in consideration when we get to the end of the year so its what well do for this year as far as going forward its our obligation to evaluate what the dividend is what properties we have for the moment and what the short term or medium term will look like before making any changes to the dividend so i cant possibly tell you therell be a change all i can tell you is that thats our job to do it and any maneuvering on that is super important to us so it wouldnt be done lightly operator and well go next to chris woronka with deutsche bank chris woronka mike i want to ask you if you think theres been any impact thus far from kind of the retail malaise and if thats a noticeable percentage of your room demand maybe on the transient side i would guess not but maybe if you do have any color michael barnello no we have not seen anything i mean obviously were reading the same things you guys are reading about where the retail world is going but no were not seeing any difference in terms of the business pattern were seeing and were not seeing anything different in terms of the what ill say very limited amount of retail space we actually have you heard us mention earlier that were about to open an ugg store a retail store as part of the villa florence its in union square san francisco its a fantastic location you can imagine the rents are quite nice thats going in in the next couple of months as soon as theyre ready so we dont have a ton of retail so  and it doesnt come up a lot but when it does well obviously be out in the market looking to release that and we may have better color next year but right now were not seeing anything that is impacting us chris woronka okay great and then i just want to follow up on the marriott starwood i guess integration at this point are you seeing any of the benefits you thought or hoped on the kind of the back end and then on the flip side i know there might have been a few folks who thought this might help at the margin pricing power in some of the bigger markets but certainly it doesnt seem like thats the case it any color on those two michael barnello well first of all marriotts been very wellintentioned about integrating i know theyve had a lot of meetings with all their stakeholders really across their spectrum to work through how integrations going to work and then i can imagine its pretty daunting from our perspective weve been very informed from what theyre trying to do in terms of bringing both companies together but as far as real impact daytoday not much i mean the things  some things have been fairly small and i say small in a couple thousand dollars here or there range but as far as big picture no nothing yet none  our sales organization havent been put together theyre talking about doing those things some time hopefully in  i know they still talk about getting the rewards program loyalty programs merged ive heard different time frames on that there are probably better guys to ask but i know theyre working diligently on doing that but as far as drilling down to an owner level or a property level we have not seen anything meaningful at all to talk about chris woronka okay fair enough and then just finally for me you mentioned a little bit of a shift in the ota mix in your favor towards property direct do you think thats  is it too early to call that as sustainable trend or do you think there is something to that michael barnello it was  chris i mean it was  its good id like to see it continue to go in that direction but it would be too early to see the trend and it wasnt  if it was some huge number i might have gotten more excited about that but no and well keep you guys informed if we see that moving in that direction over the next couple of quarters then obviously its something that we can talk more about but right now its probably just a quarterly issue operator well go next to steven grambling with goldman sachs stephen grambling just a couple of quick followups first when you look at the primary buyers and the cap rates in the private market are you sensing any change needed in the type of buyers that are out there or the sensitivity to valuation michael barnello its interesting because when you think about the buyers for our properties then no were not the entire universe of hotel deals were very different from casashutters was to a high net worth individual a family bought the indianapolis marriott weve had a couple of reits a couple of private equities so no i mean theres no one universal fit and then a land that was sold to an offshore wealthy companyindividual so no i mean its  theres been a variety of folks when i think that theres looking for stuff that fits their eye whether its in terms of what they want to do at the property and yield is not important or if its for some guys maybe just looking for some yield stephen grambling thats helpful and then second i guess maybe you alluded to this a little bit but what are you seeing in terms of corporate related group as you delineate between longer term bookings versus the in the quarter for the quarter and related spend thinking maybe you could provide any kind of color on corporate behavior michael barnello i mean we trust the corporate i dont know that we have any corporate outlook for our corporate transient for the next couple of quarters we dont break it down that way at the same time i gave you the group numbers a bunch of the group would be corporate a bunch of it would be citywides but right now mostly  its mostly corporate of the ones that we have for the second half of the year and then we get into next year that would be predominantly citywides and beyond so if you look at  if you think about it from an  perspective just fyi i mean  we have a strong pace were up about  it is mostly san francisco outside of san francisco were only up  and the reason is that san francisco got hit so hard in  and its bouncing back in  but that  again thats mostly citywides so probably theres some corporate thats already booked but at this point that would be too far out from a lot of those guys stephen grambling got you and then i guess changing gears a little bit as you think about outside supply growth in some of these urban markets are you seeing any delays or change to projects entering some of these markets as youve seen some softening in revpar michael barnello cancellations no we havent heard of a lot of that really im blanking out thinking of any of it slowing down yes but i dont think any of the slowdown is what youre thinking its not tied into revpar its tied into everything just takes longer theres a hotel next door to us the old sunset millenium project next to the grafton on sunset boulevard in la i mean its supposed to be open ages ago and its finally going to open sometime later this year so  but that is not a function of the mark  theyre waiting on the market theyre just  everything is just taking longer and that is true in many many cases construction and timing more than theyre looking at the performance of the hotel market stephen grambling do you get the sense that even from a construction cost labor cost standpoint people are becoming more hesitant to start additional projects michael barnello thats a good question for the projects that are really out id say the  and year range and i think were tbd on that when we look at our supply story for   probably the most at  at this point a lot of those projects  theyre largely cooked i dont mean they couldnt be canceled but the moneys been raised they either started or starting soon and those are big numbers i mean we mentioned  for  for whatever supply growth in  its  and  its  and so what were seeing is we obviously have some guestimates we take the announcements are done in  we attach a level of probability of that could that move it could in  could people change their minds about their projects absolutely those are the harder ones to predict because if you havent started now you certainly could start and get done in  but if you change your mind you  it wouldnt be so crazy the unfortunate thing is that when people do cancel projects that far out they dont put out a press release and so we never get to hear about that until it just drags on and its  and nothings starting we do monitor that our guys in the markets go around town to look at whats happening physically but that you wont know until were closer in on anything opening up that far out so the things youre saying makes sense constructions gotten more expensive people ask about labor labor obviously in the construction world continues to increase as well as product cost more money as were seeing in our renovations but so far that has not been the headwind that wed like it to be to slow down supply operator and well go next to lukas hartwich with green street advisors lukas hartwich mike you touched on this a little bit already but are you seeing any change in the body language of your corporate customers michael barnello it will be a good question for the next quarter lukas and the reason i said that is because were just starting to think about corporatenegotiated rates as we go into the season unfortunately the season lasts too long i mean these guys make a month event of corporatenegotiated rate contracting because theres no rush on the buyers part quite frankly so  but well get to some indication by the october call to know where our people are going are they looking at trying to get the best deal are they trying to limit hotels are they trying to put any kind of mandates in the people i dont know so far were pleased with the last couple of quarters weve seen an increase in room rates the rates havent been as strong if i look back over this cycle we saw a very big rate increases in corporatenegotiated really from  to  and  and then the rates have become more of an issue now as well as the volumes so were hoping for an uptick without people losing their purse strings but its tbd lukas hartwich thats helpful and then the cmbs market seem to improve quite a bit over the last couple of months are you seeing any impact in that in terms of the transaction market are prices changing are more buyers coming more into the pool michael barnello as far as more bidders i think what youve seen is id say modestly robust acquisition market why do i say that because theres not a ton of hot properties in the market i mean theres still our properties in the market and so for good properties which we think weve been selling there is a crowd right the crowd may differ depending on what youre selling but there is a crowd and part of it is the reason youre talking about i mean yes thats gone up a little bit as the rates have increased but theres still plenty of availability for wellintentioned buyers and certainly anybody whos lowleveraged so we have not seen that or heard that as an impediment to anybodys potential acquisition kenneth fuller and lukas thats not just for cmbs thats true for bank debt its true for insurance companies who are lending just in general the debt markets are strong and clearly that has some impact on the overall transaction market operator and well go next to ryan meliker with canaccord genuity ryan meliker i wanted to ask a little bit more about the westin philadelphia if i recall correctly you guys bought it for  million back in  put roughly what was it i think  million or  million in in capex a few years ago and then just sold it for  million and mike you referred to it as a fine investment something im missing michael barnello so when we think about it we bought the  those  the philadelphia assets were combined it was that and the embassy suites you were right about the allocation it was  million this turned out to be about a  irr so yes theres no highfiving going on around town for a  at the same time its not worthy of splitting risks so if youre picking apart our acquisition these are the ones that weve sold this wouldnt be the finest one at the same time we did what we could do with this asset and it was time for us to unload it and we talked about that earlier in terms of the pressures implied but we thought it made sense to move on if you do i mean the reality is that the truth wont be told on the investments in philadelphia until  and it may never happen we ultimately sell the embassy suites you guys can see the numbers in embassy suites in our release in february the embassy is done better on a cashoncash basis we just renovated that hotel and in fact its done better and that was going through renovation from november through february so we obviously continue to own that and we feel that will continue to have a long runway but part of it is a question of what the allocation was youre right about the allocation but it just easily could have been something different ryan meliker okay no that makes sense thats helpful and i guess along those lines look you guys have done a great job selling assets that were bought in the prior cycle obviously youve put together some pretty good returns on a lot of those transactions but if we look at the  to  time frame at the bottom of this cycle then you look at this philadelphia asset which as you just said is nothing to write home about and the park central which combined total for about  of your investment dollars at the trough of the cycle it doesnt look like those returns are going to be nearly as compelling maybe im wrong is there something im missing are there other assets where you feel really really good and its going to more than offset that michael barnello well i think that the interesting thing about any kind of buying program is youre going to buy assets that are going to be phenomenal maybe some that are going to be medium and some that you wont do as well on so we like to think that people are looking at the sum total of the company and not just any particular asset if you  were looking at our investor presentation we do show all the acquisitions weve done we show we bought them out we show the increase in cash on cash which has been pretty significant since that period youre referencing i think the ultimate judge for a company like ours is return on invested capital what weve done and when we compare ourselves to our peers is consistently outperformed with the shareholders capital that not only factors in the acquisitions you mentioned but the renovations all the capital that weve put into the assets so i suppose that there are  there are deals that arent going to hit on all cylinders relative to what we have suspected but for the most part i think were doing pretty darn good and when you look at that track record from  to  it would be  it appears oddly every single year so i understand you want to pick apart a couple of the assets that weve done we did whats in the shareholders best interest by shedding the westin philadelphia but thats  and were obviously looking to do the best things we can do for shareholders with whatever cash we have whether thats buybacks down the road or acquisitions but well maintain our discipline and with the goals that were going to invest in the right assets and knowing that every single one wont hit ryan meliker sure no  and i get that that makes a lot of sense i guess i would just hope that the ones that do hit are the larger ones where youve got higher conviction of bringing more capital to work but no thats really helpful i guess the other question i would have is the triton was obviously a good deal which is one that was bought during this cycle are you looking to potentially prove out some value or deploy any of the proceeds youve generated from asset sales or sell more assets that you bought in this cycle to kind of prove out the value creations since you became ceo michael barnello theres nothing that were doing with the assets of the shareholders to prove anything were doing something to  with assets because theyre not liquid if it makes the best sense for the shareholders at that time so if a hotel is worth selling for whatever reason then its our job to recognize that we talked about it a couple of questions ago so its probably not worth repeating but thats our job to evaluate each asset ryan meliker no it make sense all right and then just one other thing i have for you guys was you did a great job controlling costs in the quarter with samestore hotel expenses down a couple of million dollars how sustainable is that if we fast forward to a year from now and hypothetically revpar growth is flat to plus  like weve been seeing in the recent environment can you continue to be able to cut costs or are we more likely to see margins compressed at a greater level michael barnello to the extent that theres revpar struggles whether its flat or negative it obviously becomes harder and harder to maintain the expense controls and i say that from a couple of reasons i mean ill remind that the ish percent of our expenses are laborrelated at the same time our occupancy for the quarter was  so its not like were running empty were crazy full well likely be over  for the year if the last couple of years trends continue so it is harder and harder to run this efficiently from an expense perspective its easy when revpar is plus  its easier to make drastic changes if its negative  its very tough to operate in an environments of minus  to plus  range which weve been in the last couple of quarters right we were slightly positive q q i think our guys did a phenomenal job on asset management and operations controlling costs again in q with a slight dip in revpar but obviously the longer those trends continue the harder it is to maintain those costs so its a combination of time and severity that will really produce whatever our margins end up being so hopefully we can see outsized top line growth so we dont have to be in a situation where the expenses are more of a drag operator and well go next to felicia hendrix with barclays felicia hendrix mike i just have one here towards the end so just based on your prior comments in several of the questions that were already asked its clear that youre opportunistic with your asset sales but im just wondering now that youre below x leverage you have  million of cash in the balance sheet is there a limit to how many properties you will sell or how low youll go in terms of leverage in can you just talk about how youre thinking about earning a return on the cash without buying properties michael barnello so its a good question but just building on what were saying earlier were not looking at the threshold as we can only get to x in terms of the debttoebitda or we can not sell an asset because weve just sold a prior one were trying to be optimistic on both sides right were right now acting opportunistically on the sell side i know it feels like that weve been in this position for quite some time because of the month period where weve been selling and havent been buying but this is our th year as a public company and the vast majority of the years weve been not just net buyers gross buyers we really only bought and so were hopeful that those days return but were not going to force the issue felicia if we get offers or  on something that we should sell then we have to evaluate whether we should do it or not we dont have a hard limit on that as far as what to do with the cash youre right i mean were sitting on cash not the best investment at the same time were comfortable that whatever direction the world goes in the next couple of quarters couple of years well have ample opportunity to invest at some point either through buybacks or acquisitions its just hard to see those right this moment operator well go next to wes golladay with rbc capital markets wesley golladay quick one for you on key west how does supply and demand out in that market and what is your outlook for the balance of the year michael barnello key west key west has a rare struggle in the top line what youre seeing is a little bit of supply that has kicked into gear that we knew was coming online  well not online the last couple of years so the last couple of years have some funky supply comparisons less why what you saw is there was a pack of limited service hotels they actually shut down physically closed for a number of years and they got rebuilt and reopened again its a limited service hotel and they did it in pieces so what happened is the supply numbers have been increasing but its really just a reentry of supply that was in the market nonetheless this is a tiny tiny market youre talking about  rooms in the entire island so  rooms here or there is a big supply increase so we saw that and we saw a little bit of softening at the top we dont use anything else to  related it to its not like theres been other issues in key west and we think that that will probably continue a little bit into q but we still love the market not just this year we love it long term theres a market that if we would continue to look at acquisitions at that obviously and when we talk about supply theres really  once you get past this year like nothing on the horizon for the next couple of years so this and san francisco are the best supply markets we look at the next  years wesley golladay okay yes so i guess im just trying to look at consumers pretty strong so probably a relative outperforming market next year when the supply is absorbed is that a fair statement michael barnello one would think so but that is a  when you look at key west and you look at other markets other markets have broader demand generators whether its citywides convention corporate group et cetera us is a fairly singular market i mean you are talking about consumers like you mentioned and the leisure travelers so as that kind of part of the economy goes thats how they will go because we cant lean on any kind of bt corporate traveler or citywide or group but generally we feel very excited about key west if not just for next year for really the long long term on that wesley golladay okay and then lastly on that ugg store do you have the square footage that youre developing and would you look to monetize that asset michael barnello sell it no its part of  its where our lobby is i cant remember the exact square footage i think its a couple of thousand square feet wes its  square feet and no its a critical component to what we would have so obviously its a longer term lease but when that expires we obviously have to valuate what we do and we may do something else with the space because it is part of our building operator and we have no further questions in the queue michael barnello super thanks ryan i appreciate everybody taking the time to listen to our call and i wish everybody to enjoy the rest of the summer thanks so much appreciate it operator and that does conclude todays conference thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect copyright policy
