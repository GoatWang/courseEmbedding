capital raise george budwell tmfgbudwell nov   at am image source getty images  what happened shares of aclaris therapeutics inc nasdaqacrs a clinicalstage specialty pharmaceutical company fell by more than  in early morning trading on thursday this southward move was sparked by a  million public offering intended to fund the regulatory filing of aclaris lead product candidate a a topical solution for the treatment of a fairly common noncancerous skin growth known as seborrheic keratosis sk and to potentially raise a sales force upon its approval  so what aclaris recently announced positive topline results from as twin pivotal latestage trials where this topical solution effectively cleared a highly significant percentage of sk lesions in comparison to patients receiving placebo while this clinical development is certainly great news for shareholders going forward the fact of the matter is that the biotechs last stated cash position of  million simply wasnt enough for it to successfully transition into the commercial phase of its life cycle simply put this sizable secondary offering is a necessary evil right now  but one that could pay bigger dividends down the road now what aclaris is hoping to have as regulatory filing in the hands of the fda sometime in first quarter of  so if that line holds this prescription topical solution could reach the market by perhaps the fourth quarter of next year on the valuation side of the ledger a has the potential to be a particularly important catalyst for the company going forward after all  million americans are reportedly afflicted with noncancerous skin lesions meaning that this product candidate would only have to capture a small slice of this huge market to be a noteworthy revenue source for a company with a market cap of  million at preset all in all as fairly strong latestage results and its compelling market opportunity arguably merit a deeper look at this speculative biotech stock  even though investors
