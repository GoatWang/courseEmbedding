 plaintiff v nexstar broadcasting group inc  e john carpenter freeway suite  irving texas  mission broadcasting inc  detroit road westlake ohio  corporation of america  saint john street suite  lafayette louisiana  and silver point capital fund lp  greenwich plaza st floor greenwich connecticut  defendants case cv complaint the united states of america acting under the direction of the attorney general of the united states brings this civil action to enjoin the proposed acquisition of communications corporation of america cca a whollyowned subsidiary of silver point capital fund lp by nexstar broadcasting inc nexstar and mission broadcasting inc mission nexstar and mission are referred to collectively as the buyers and to obtain other equitable relief the transaction would likely lessen competition substantially in the sale of broadcast television spot advertising in the evansville indiana designated marketing area dma of the united states in violation of section  of the clayton act  usc  the united states alleges as follows i nature of the action  pursuant to a stock purchase agreement dated april   nexstar and mission will acquire all of the issued and outstanding voting securities of cca for  million both nexstar and cca own or operate many broadcast television stations in multiple television dmas across the united states through various local services agreements nexstar sells the advertising for all of the television stations owned by mission which nexstar effectively controls  in evansville indiana nexstar owns and operates weht an abc broadcast network affiliate as the owneroperator of that station nexstar sells wehts advertising pursuant to a local services agreement nexstar also sells the advertising of wtvw a cw broadcast network affiliate in evansville that is owned by mission accordingly weht and wtvw do not meaningfully compete with one another for advertisers  in evansville cca owns and operates wevv a cbs broadcast network affiliate wevv also operates a digital subchannel on which it runs television programming affiliated with the fox broadcast network although nexstar and mission intend to transfer ccas wevv license to a related third party the third party is expected to have nexstar sell its advertising pursuant to a local services or similar agreement nexstar would likely have effective control of this third party as it does of mission  currently nexstar on behalf of weht and wtvw and cca on behalf of wevv compete for the business of local and national advertisers that seek spot advertising on broadcast television stations in the evansville indiana dma advertisers benefit from this competition  if consummated nexstars acquisition of control of ccas advertising would result in nexstar controlling the sale of advertising for three out of four major broadcast network affiliates weht abc and wevv cbs  fox and a fourth network affiliation wtvw cw in the evansville indiana dma nexstars already high market share of spot advertising in the dma would increase from approximately  to  percent  the transaction would eliminate headtohead competition between nexstar and cca and all the benefits from this competition unless the transaction is blocked it will lead to higher prices for broadcast television spot advertising in the evansville indiana dma in violation of section  of the clayton act  usc  ii jurisdiction and venue  the united states brings this action pursuant to section  of the clayton act as amended  usc  to prevent and restrain defendants from violating section  of the clayton act  usc   nexstar and cca sell broadcast television spot advertising a commercial activity that substantially start printed page affects and is in the flow of interstate commerce the court has subjectmatter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to section  of the clayton act  usc  and  usc  a and   nexstar transacts business and is found in the district of columbia defendants have consented to venue and personal jurisdiction in this district therefore venue is proper in this district under section  of the clayton act  usc  and  usc c venue is also proper in the district of columbia for defendant nexstar under  usc d iii the defendants  nexstar a delaware corporation with headquarters in irving texas owns or operates  broadcast television stations located in  dmas in  states nexstar reported revenues of  million for   mission a delaware corporation with headquarters in westlake ohio owns  broadcast television stations nexstar receives substantially all of missions available cash and is deemed to have a controlling interest in mission under generally accepted accounting principles accordingly missions economic incentives are aligned with nexstars  cca a delaware corporation with headquarters in lafayette louisiana owns or operates  broadcast television stations in  dmas throughout louisiana texas and indiana cca reported revenues of  million for   silver point capital fund lp based in greenwich connecticut controls and is the ultimate parent entity of cca iv trade and commerce a broadcast television spot advertising is a relevant product market  broadcast television stations attract viewers through their programming which is delivered for free over the air or retransmitted to viewers mainly through wired cable or other terrestrial television systems and through satellite television systems broadcast television stations then sell advertising time to businesses that want to advertise their products to television viewers broadcast television “spot” advertising is sold directly by the station itself or through its national representative on a localized basis and is purchased by advertisers who want to target potential customers in specific geographic areas spot advertising differs from network and syndicated television advertising which are sold by the major television networks and producers of syndicated programs on a nationwide basis and broadcast in every geographic area where the network or syndicated program is aired  broadcast television spot advertising possesses a unique combination of attributes that sets it apart from advertising using other types of media television combines sight sound and motion thereby creating a more memorable advertisement moreover of all media broadcast television spot advertising reaches the largest percentage of all potential customers in a particular target geographic market and is therefore especially effective in introducing establishing and maintaining the image of a product or service for a significant number of advertisers broadcast television spot advertising because of its unique attributes is an advertising medium for which there is no close substitute advertisers generally do not consider other media such as radio newspapers or outdoor billboards to be desirable substitutes for broadcast television advertising none of these media can provide the important combination of sight sound and motion that makes television unique and impactful as a medium for advertising  like broadcast television subscription television channels such as those carried over cable or satellite television combine elements of sight sound and motion but they are not generally considered within the advertising industry as a desirable substitute for broadcast television spot advertising for two important reasons first satellite cable and other subscription content delivery systems do not generally have the “reach” of broadcast television typically in the united states broadcast television can reach well over  of homes in a dma while cable television often reaches fewer homes second because subscription services may offer more than  channels they fragment the audience into small demographic segments because broadcast television programming typically has higher rating points than subscription television programming broadcast television is generally viewed as providing a much easier and more efficient means for an advertiser to reach a high proportion of its target demographic generally in the industry media buyers purchase time on subscription television channels not so much as a substitute for broadcast television but rather to supplement a broadcast television message to reach a narrow demographic eg  year olds with greater frequency or to target narrow geographic areas within a dma  typically advertisers do not consider internetbased media to be a substitute for broadcast television spot advertising although online video distributors ovds such as netflix and hulu are important sources of video programming as with cable television advertising the local video advertising of ovds lacks the reach of broadcast television spot advertising and nonvideo internet advertising eg web site banner advertising lacks the important combination of sight sound and motion that gives television its impact consequently the typical local media advertiser purchases internetbased advertising primarily as a supplement to broadcast television spot advertising  consequently a small but significant increase in the price of broadcast television spot advertising is unlikely to cause a sufficient number of broadcast television spot advertising customers to switch enough of their advertising purchases to other media such that the price increase would be unprofitable  the sale of broadcast television spot advertising is a line of commerce under section  of the clayton act and a relevant product market for purposes of analyzing the proposed transaction under section  of the clayton act b the evansville indiana dma is the relevant geographic market  a designated marketing area or dma is a geographic unit defined by ac nielsen company a firm that surveys television viewers and furnishes broadcast television stations advertisers and advertising agencies in a particular area with data to aid in evaluating audience size and

number of viewers within the entire dma some of these advertisers are located in the evansville indiana dma and need to reach customers there others are regional or national businesses that want to target start printed page consumers in the evansville indiana dma advertising on television stations outside the evansville indiana dma is not an alternative for these advertisers because such stations cannot be viewed by the vast majority of potential customers within the dma thus if there were a small but significant increase in broadcast television spot advertising prices within the evansville indiana dma advertisers would not switch enough advertising purchases to television stations outside the evansville indiana dma to render the price increase unprofitable  the evansville indiana dma is a section of the country under section  of the clayton act and a relevant geographic market for the sale of broadcast television spot advertising for the purposes of analyzing the proposed transaction under section  of the clayton act c the transaction will lead to harm to competition in the evansville indiana dma  broadcast television stations compete for advertisers by offering programs that attract viewers to their stations broadcast television stations select programs that appeal to the greatest number of viewers and that differentiate their stations from other

volume of interstate commerce  after the transaction a significant number of evansville indiana dma advertisers would not be able to reach their desired audiences with equivalent efficacy unless they

acquire all of the issued and outstanding voting securities of communications corporation of america cca for  million both nexstar and cca own or operate many broadcast television stations in multiple television designated marketing areas dmas across the united states through various local services agreements nexstar sells the advertising for all of the television stations owned by mission which nexstar effectively controls in evansville indiana nexstar owns and operates weht an abc broadcast network affiliate as the owneroperator of that station nexstar sells wehts advertising pursuant to a local services agreement nexstar also sells the advertising of wtvw a cw broadcast network affiliate in evansville that is owned by mission accordingly weht and wtvw do not meaningfully compete with one another for advertisers in evansville cca owns and operates wevv a cbs broadcast network affiliate wevv also operates a digital subchannel on which it runs television programming affiliated with the fox broadcast network although nexstar and mission intend to transfer ccas wevv license to a related third party the third party is expected to have nexstar sell its advertising pursuant to a local services or similar agreement nexstar would likely have effective control of this third party as it does of mission currently nexstar on behalf of weht and wtvw and cca on behalf of wevv compete for the business of local and national advertisers that seek spot advertising on broadcast television stations in the evansville indiana dma advertisers benefit from this competition if consummated nexstars acquisition of control of ccas advertising would result in nexstar controlling the sale of advertising for three out of four major broadcast network affiliates weht abc and wevv cbs  fox and

agreed to by defendants would lessen competition substantially in broadcast television spot advertising in the evansville indiana dma as a result of nexstars acquisition of cca this transaction is the subject of the complaint and proposed final judgment filed by the united states on november   b anticompetitive consequences of the proposed transaction  the relevant product market the complaint alleges that the sale of broadcast television spot advertising constitutes a relevant product market for analyzing this transaction under section  of the clayton act broadcast television stations attract viewers through their programming which is delivered for free over the air or retransmitted to viewers mainly through wired cable or other terrestrial television systems and through satellite television systems broadcast television stations then sell advertising time to businesses that want to advertise their products to television viewers broadcast television “spot” advertising is sold directly by the station itself or through its national representative on a localized basis and is purchased by advertisers who want to target potential customers in specific geographic areas spot advertising differs from network and syndicated television advertising which are sold by the major television networks and producers of syndicated programs on a nationwide basis and broadcast in every geographic area where the network or syndicated program is aired broadcast television spot advertising possesses a unique combination of attributes that sets it apart from advertising using other start printed page types of media television combines sight sound and motion thereby creating a more memorable advertisement moreover of all media broadcast television spot advertising reaches the largest percentage of all potential customers in a particular target geographic market and is therefore especially effective in introducing establishing and maintaining the image of a product or service for a significant number of advertisers broadcast television spot advertising because of its unique attributes is an advertising medium for which there is no close substitute advertisers generally do not consider other media such as radio newspapers or outdoor billboards to be desirable substitutes for broadcast television advertising none of these media can provide the important combination of sight sound and motion that makes television unique and impactful as a medium for advertising like broadcast television subscription television channels such as those carried over cable or satellite television combine elements of sight sound and motion but they are not generally considered within the advertising industry as a desirable substitute for broadcast television spot advertising for two important reasons first satellite cable and other subscription content delivery systems do not generally have the “reach” of broadcast television typically in the united states broadcast television can reach well over  of homes in a dma while cable television often reaches fewer homes second because subscription services may offer more than  channels they fragment the audience into small demographic segments because broadcast television programming typically has higher rating points than subscription television programming broadcast television is generally viewed as providing a much easier and more efficient means for an advertiser to reach a high proportion of its target demographic generally in the industry media buyers purchase time on subscription television channels not so much as a substitute for broadcast television but rather to supplement a broadcast television message to reach a narrow demographic eg  year olds with greater frequency or to target narrow geographic areas within a dma typically advertisers do not consider internetbased media to be a substitute for broadcast television spot advertising although online video distributors ovds such as netflix and hulu are important sources of video programming as with cable television advertising the local video advertising of ovds lacks the reach of broadcast television spot advertising and nonvideo internet advertising eg web site banner advertising lacks the important combination of sight sound and motion that gives television its impact consequently the typical local media advertiser purchases internetbased advertising primarily as a supplement to broadcast television spot advertising consequently a small but significant price increase in broadcast television spot advertising is unlikely to cause enough advertising customers to switch advertising purchases to other media to make the price increase unprofitable  the relevant geographic market the complaint alleges that the evansville indiana dma constitutes a relevant geographic market for purposes of analyzing this acquisition under section  of the clayton act a designated marketing area or dma is a

nexstar by leaving advertisers with only one alternative broadcast channel the transaction will enable nexstar unilaterally to raise prices given the structure of the evansville indiana dma the

there are no mergerspecific efficiencies that would alleviate the harm from the transactionstart printed page  iii explanation of the proposed final judgment the divestiture requirement of the proposed final judgment will eliminate the anticompetitive effects of the transaction in the evansville indiana dma by establishing a new independent and economically viable competitor which will maintain the status quo in the dma the proposed final judgment requires defendants to divest the divestiture assets to bayou city broadcasting evansville inc bayou city an acquirer selected by defendants and approved by the united states in a manner consistent with the final judgment and the hold separate order in this case if bayou city is unable to complete the purchase the defendants would be required to divest the divestiture assets to another buyer approved by the united states in its sole discretion defendants are required to use their best efforts to accomplish the divestitures ordered by this final judgment as expeditiously as possible and in such a way as to satisfy the united states in its sole discretion that the operations can and will be operated by the purchaser as a viable ongoing business that can compete effectively in the relevant market because the transfer of the divestiture assets to bayou city requires federal communications commission fcc approval defendants are specifically required to use their best efforts to obtain all necessary fcc approvals as expeditiously as possible the divestiture pursuant to this section shall take place within five  calendar days of entry of the final judgment or within  days of the filing of the complaint whichever is later defendants must take all reasonable steps necessary to accomplish the divestiture quickly and shall cooperate with prospective purchasers in the event that defendants do not accomplish the divestiture within the periods prescribed in the proposed final judgment or it becomes apparent that bayou city is unwilling or unable to complete its purchase of the divestiture assets the final judgment provides that the court will appoint a trustee selected by the united states to effect the divestiture the united states may after three months determine not to seek appointment of a trustee if it believes the circumstances warrant allowing the defendants more time under such circumstances however the united states may at any time exercise its right to select a trustee for the court to appoint if a trustee is appointed the proposed final judgment provides that defendants will pay all costs and expenses of the trustee the trustees commission will be structured so as to provide an incentive for the trustee based on the price obtained and the speed with which the divestiture is accomplished after his or her appointment becomes effective the trustee will file monthly reports with the court and the united states setting forth his or her efforts to accomplish the divestiture at the end of six  months if the divestiture has not been accomplished the trustee and the united states will make recommendations to the court which shall enter such orders as appropriate in order to carry out the purpose of the trust including extending the trust or the term of the trustees appointment the divestiture provisions of the proposed final judgment will eliminate the anticompetitive effects of the transaction in broadcast television spot advertising in the evansville indiana dma the proposed final judgment also bars nexstar from reacquiring the divestiture assets for the tenyear period of the decree nexstar can only affiliate with either fox or cbs wevvs current network affiliates a year or more from the filing of the complaint contingent on the united states approval in its sole discretion iv remedies available to potential private litigants section  of the clayton act  usc  provides that any person who has been injured as a result of conduct prohibited by the antitrust laws may bring suit in federal court to recover three times the damages the person has suffered as well as costs and reasonable attorneys fees entry of the proposed final judgment will neither impair nor assist the bringing of any private antitrust damage action under the provisions of section a of the clayton act  usc a the proposed final judgment has no prima facie effect in any subsequent private lawsuit that may be brought against defendants v procedures available for modification of the proposed final judgment the united states and defendants have stipulated that the proposed final judgment may be entered by the court after compliance with the provisions of the appa provided that the united states has not withdrawn its consent the appa conditions entry upon the courts determination that the proposed final judgment is in the public interest the appa provides a period of at least sixty  days preceding the effective date of the proposed final judgment within which any person may submit to the united states written comments regarding the proposed final judgment any person who wishes to comment should do so within sixty  days of the date of publication of this competitive impact statement in the federal register or the last date of publication in a newspaper of the summary of this competitive impact statement whichever is later all comments received during this period will be considered by the united states department of justice which remains free to withdraw its consent to the proposed final judgment at any time prior to the courts entry of judgment the comments and the response of the united states will be filed with the court in addition comments will be posted on the us department of justice antitrust divisions internet web site and under certain circumstances published in the federal register written comments should be submitted to scott a scheele chief telecom  media enforcement section antitrust division us department of justice  th street nw suite  washington dc  the proposed final judgment provides that the court retains jurisdiction over this action and the parties may apply to the court for any order necessary or appropriate for the modification interpretation or enforcement of the final judgment vi alternatives to the proposed final judgment the united states considered as an alternative to the proposed final judgment a full trial on the merits against defendants the united states could have continued the litigation and sought preliminary and permanent injunctions against the contemplated transaction the united states is satisfied however that the divestiture of assets described in the proposed final judgment will preserve competition for the sale of broadcast television spot advertising in the evansville indiana dma thus the proposed final judgment would achieve all or substantially all of the relief the united states would have obtained through litigation but avoids the time expense and uncertainty of a full trial on the merits of the complaint vii standard of review under the appa for the proposed final judgment the clayton act as amended by the appa requires that proposed consent judgments in antitrust cases brought by the united states be subject to a sixtyday comment period after which the court shall determine whether entry of the proposed final judgment “is in the public interest”  usc e in making that determination the court in accordance with the statute as amended in  is required to consider a the competitive impact of such judgment including termination of alleged violations provisions for enforcement and modification duration of relief sought anticipated effects of alternative remedies actually considered whether its terms are ambiguous and any other competitive considerations bearing upon the adequacy of such judgment that the court deems necessary to a determination of whether the consent judgment is in the public interest and b the impact of entry of such judgment upon competition in the relevant market or markets upon the public generally and individuals alleging specific injury from the violations set forth in the complaint including consideration of the public benefit if any to be derived from a determination of the issues at trial  usc ea  b in considering these statutory factors the courts inquiry is
