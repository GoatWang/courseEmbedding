peers our competition is made up of a wide range of financial institutions including credit unions local regional and national commercial banks mortgage companies insurance companies and other nontraditional providers of financial services there were  fdicinsured financial institutions serving tallahassee three of them including prime meridian bank are headquartered in leon county according to the summary of deposits prime meridian bank had a  share of the fdicinsured deposits in the tallahassee msa some of our competitors are not subject to the same level of regulation and oversight that is required of banks and bank holding companies as a result some of our competitors may have lower cost structures by emphasizing our exceptional client service knowledge of local trends and conditions and local decisionmaking process we believe the bank has developed an effective competitive advantage in its market thus maintaining a strong level of growth we also are actively engaged in small business administration guaranteed financing to support local borrowers who might not otherwise qualify for conventional financing which helps mitigate our credit risk and results in fee income if we sell the guaranteed portion some of our competitors are much larger financial institutions with greater financial resources it is not our goal to compete on all products and services but to support the product mix that best suits our strategic plan this strategy has yielded solid growth for our bank thus far other important competitive factors that have contributed to our success in our market area include convenient office hours electronic banking products community reputation quality of our banking team capacity and willingness to extend credit and our ability to offer cash management and other commercial banking services many of our competitors’ approaches and processes may appear to be more efficient however these efficiencies may not allow for the same level of personal service we provide to our clients although offering competitive rates is important we believe that our greatest competitive advantages are our experienced management team client relationship

consolidated financial statements unaudited continued    loans continued   the company has divided the loan portfolio into three portfolio segments and five portfolio classes each with different risk characteristics and methodologies for assessing risk all loans are underwritten based upon standards set forth in the policies approved by the companys board of directors the company identifies the portfolio segments and classes as follows real estate mortgage loans real estate mortgage loans are typically divided into three classes commercial residential and home equity and construction loans commercial loans of this type are typically our more complex loans this category of real estate loans is comprised of loans secured by mortgages on commercial property that are typically owneroccupied but also includes nonowner occupied investment properties commercial loans that are secured by owneroccupied commercial real estate are repaid through operating cash flows of the borrower the maturity for this type of loan is generally limited to three to five years however payments may be structured on a longer amortization basis typically interest rates on our commercial real estate loans are fixed for five years or less after which they adjust based upon a predetermined spread over a market index rate at times a rate may be fixed for longer than five years as part of our credit underwriting standards the company typically requires personal guarantees from the principal owners of the business supported by a review of the principal owners personal financial statements and tax returns as part of the enterprise risk management process it is understood that risks associated with commercial real estate loans include fluctuations in real estate values the overall strength of the borrower and the economy new job creation trends tenant vacancy rates environmental contamination and the quality of the borrowers management in order to mitigate and limit these risks we analyze the borrowers cash flows and evaluate collateral value currently the collateral securing our commercial real estate loans includes a variety of property types such as office warehouse and retail facilities other types include multifamily properties hotels mixeduse residential and commercial properties generally commercial real estate loans present a higher risk profile than our consumer real estate loan portfolio residential and home equity the company offers first and second onetofour family mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit the collateral for these loans is generally the clients owneroccupied residences although these types of loans present lower levels of risk than commercial real estate loans risks do still exist because of possible fluctuations in the value of the real estate collateral securing the loan as well as changes in the borrowers financial condition the nonowneroccupied investment properties are more similar in risk to commercial real estate loans and therefore are underwritten by assessing the propertys income potential and appraised value in both cases we underwrite the borrowers financial condition and evaluate his or her global cash flow position borrowers may be affected by numerous factors including job loss illness or other personal hardship as part of our product mix the bank offers both portfolio and secondary market mortgages portfolio loans generally are based on a year year year or year adjustable rate mortgage while year or year fixedrate loans are generally sold in the secondary market   continued  table of contents prime meridian holding company and subsidiary notes to condensed consolidated financial statements unaudited continued    loans continued   construction typically these loans have a construction period of one to two years and the interest is paid monthly once the construction period terminates some of these loans convert to a term loan with a maturity of one to ten years this portion of our loan portfolio includes loans to small and midsized businesses to construct owneruser properties loans to developers of commercial real estate investment properties and residential developments this type of loan is also made to individual clients for construction of single family homes in our market area an independent appraisal is used to determine the value of the collateral and confirm that the ratio of the loan principal to the value of the collateral will not exceed policies of the bank as the construction project progresses loan proceeds are requested by the borrower to complete phases of construction and funding is only disbursed after the project has been inspected by a thirdparty inspector or experienced construction lender risks associated with construction loans include fluctuations in the value of real estate project completion risk and changes in market trends the ability of the construction loan borrower to finance the loan or sell the property upon completion of the project is another risk factor that also may be affected by changes in market trends since the initial funding of the loan commercial loans the bank offers a wide range of commercial loans including business term loans equipment financing lines of credit and us small business administration sba loans to small and midsized businesses smalltomedium sized businesses retail and professional establishments make up our target market for commercial loans our relationship managers primarily underwrite these loans based on the borrowers ability to service the loan from cash flow lines of credit and loans secured by accounts receivable andor inventory are monitored periodically by our staff loans secured by all business assets or a blanket lien are typically only made to highly qualified borrowers due to the nonspecific nature of the collateral and do not require a formal valuation of the business collateral when commercial loans are secured by specifically identified collateral then the valuation of the collateral is generally supported by an appraisal purchase order or third party physical inspection personal guarantees of the principals of business borrowers are usually required equipment loans generally have a term of five years or less and may have a fixed or variable rate we use conservative margins when pricing these loans working capital loans generally do not exceed one year and typically they are secured by accounts receivable inventory and personal guarantees of the principals of the business the bank currently offers sba  and sba a loans sba  loans provide financing for major fixed assets such as real estate and equipment while sba a loans are generally used to establish a new business or assist in the acquisition operation or expansion of an existing business with both sba loan programs there are set eligibility requirements and underwriting standards outlined by sba that can change as the government alters its fiscal policy significant factors affecting a commercial borrowers creditworthiness include the quality of management and the ability both to evaluate changes in the supply and demand characteristics affecting the business markets for products and services and to respond effectively to such changes these loans may be made unsecured or secured but most are made on a secured basis risks associated with our commercial loan portfolio include local regional and national market conditions   continued  table of contents prime meridian holding company and subsidiary notes to condensed consolidated financial statements unaudited continued    loans continued   other factors of risk could include changes in the borrowers management and fluctuations in collateral value additionally there may be refinancing risk if a commercial loan includes a balloon payment which must be refinanced or paid off at loan maturity in reference to our risk management process our commercial loan portfolio presents a higher risk profile than our consumer real estate and consumer loan portfolios therefore we require that all loans to businesses must have a clearly stated and reasonable payment plan to allow for timely retirement of debt unless secured by liquid collateral or as otherwise justified consumer and other loans these loans are made for various consumer purposes such as the financing of automobiles boats and recreational vehicles the payment structure of these loans is normally on an installment basis the risk associated with this category of loans stems from the reduced collateral value for a defaulted loan the collateral may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the principal the underwriting on these loans is primarily based on the borrowers financial condition in many cases these are unsecured credits that subject us to risk when the borrowers financial condition declines or deteriorates based upon our current trend in consumer loans management does not anticipate consumer loans will become a substantial component of our loan portfolio at any time in the foreseeable future consumer loans are made at fixed and variable interest rates and are based on the

information and current economic trends among other factors the company analyzes loans individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk loans classified as substandard or special mention are reviewed quarterly by the company for further deterioration or improvement to determine if they are appropriately classified and whether there is any impairment all loans are graded upon initial issuance furthermore construction loans nonowner occupied commercial real estate loans and commercial loan relationships in excess of  are reviewed at least annually the company determines the appropriate loan grade during the renewal process and reevaluates the loan grade in situations when a loan becomes past due loans excluded from the review process above are generally classified as pass credits until a they become past due b management becomes aware of deterioration in the credit worthiness of the borrower or c the client contacts the company for a modification in these circumstances the loan is specifically evaluated for potential classification as to special mention substandard or even chargedoff the company uses the following definitions for risk ratings pass  a pass loans primary source of loan repayment is satisfactory with secondary sources very likely to be realized if necessary special mention  a special mention loan has potential weaknesses that deserve managements close attention if left uncorrected these potential weaknesses may result in the deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or the companys credit position at some future date special mention loans are not adversely classified and do not expose an institution to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification substandard  a substandard loan is inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged if any loans so classified must have a welldefined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt they are characterized by the distinct possibility that the company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected doubtful  a loan classified doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in one classified substandard with the added characteristics that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts conditions and values highly questionable and improbable loss  a loan classified loss is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as a bankable asset is not warranted this classification does not necessarily preclude the potential for recovery but rather signifies it is no longer practical to defer writing off the asset at march   there were four nonaccrual loans totaling    continued

is to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level sufficient to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date the allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses and decreased by chargeoffs net of recoveries management believes that the allowance for loan losses which was  million or  of total loans at march   is adequate to cover losses inherent

majority of growth coming from noninterestbearing accounts the average balance of noninterestbearing deposits accounted for  of the average balance of total deposits for the three months ended march   compared to  for the three months ended march   borrowings the bank has an agreement with the federal home loan bank of atlanta fhlb and pledges its qualified loans as collateral which would allow

any of these lines at march   results of operations net interest income constitutes the principal source of income for the bank and results from the excess of interest income on interestearning assets over interest expense on interestbearing liabilities the principal interestearning assets are investment securities and loans receivable interestbearing liabilities primarily consist of time deposits interestbearing checking accounts savings deposits moneymarket accounts and other borrowings funds attracted by these interestbearing liabilities are invested in interestearning assets accordingly net interest income depends upon the volume of average interestearning assets and average interestbearing liabilities as well as the interest rates earned or paid on these assets and liabilities the

amount of interest expense on interestbearing liabilities and the resultant average costs iii net interest income iv interestrate spread v net interest margin and vi weightedaverage yields and rates yields and costs were derived by dividing annualized income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities the yields and costs depicted in the table include the amortization of fees which are considered to constitute adjustments to yields as shown in the following table lower yields on loans combined with higher funding costs led to a decrease in the interestrate spread and net

between interest and dividend income on interestearning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense on interestbearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings net interest income was  million for the three months ended march   compared to  million for the three months ended march   interest income interest income increased to  million for the three months ended march   a  or

expense interest expense was  for the three months ended march   compared to  for the three months ended march   the yearoveryear increase resulted primarily from a  or  million increase in the average balance of interestbearing deposits from the first quarter of  to the first quarter of  net interest margin the net interest margin was  for the quarter ended march   compared to  for the same period in  our net interest margin continues to be compressed due primarily to declining loan yields despite the decrease in net interest margin net interest income rose  to  million due to a higher volume of interestearning assets provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses is charged to earnings to increase the total loan loss allowance to a level deemed appropriate by management the provision is based upon the volume and type of lending conducted by the bank industry standards general economic conditions particularly as they relate to our market area and other factors related to the collectability of the loan portfolio the provision for loan losses for the three months ended march   was  compared to  for the three months ended march   the higher provision in  was due to higher loan growth in that quarter management believes that the allowance for loan losses which was  million or  of total loans at march   is adequate to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio based on the assessment of the abovementioned factors affecting the loan portfolio while management believes the estimates and assumptions used in its determination of the adequacy of the allowance are reasonable there can be no assurance that such estimates and assumptions will not be proven incorrect in the future or that the actual amount of future losses will not exceed the amount of the established allowance for loan losses or that any increased allowance for loan losses that may be required will not adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations in addition the determination of the amount of our allowance for loan losses is subject to review by bank regulators as part of the routine examination process which may result in additions to our provision for loan losses based upon their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination noninterest income noninterest income consists of revenues generated from a broad range of financial services and activities primarily service charges and fees on deposit accounts mortgage banking revenue income from bankowned life insurance and any gains on the sale of securities available for sale noninterest income for the three months ended march   totaled  an increase of  or  from the three months ended march   the increase was    table of contents primarily driven by a  or  increase in mortgage banking revenue increased service charges and fees on deposit accounts and gains in other income from higher merchant card services and credit card fee income also contributed to growth in noninterest income for the first quarter of  when compared to same period a year ago noninterest expense noninterest expense increased  or  to  million for the three months ended march   compared to the same period a year ago the majority of the increase occurred in overall bank salaries and employee benefits as fulltime equivalent employees increased from  at march   to  at march   the increase in personnel and the banks new branch building in crawfordville also led to a  increase in occupancy and equipment which further contributed to higher noninterest expense income taxes income tax expense is based on amounts reported in the statements of earnings after adjustments for nontaxable income and nondeductible expenses and consists of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes on temporary differences in the recognition of income and expense for tax and financial statement purposes income tax expense was  for the three months ended march   compared to income tax expense of

including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected    table of contents part
