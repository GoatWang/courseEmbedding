customers drive our business so it’s no surprise that customers are significant and valued contributors throughout product ideation development and production software products move through three distinct phases during development beta bronto labs and general availability ga here’s a quick guide to what happens during each stage and how customers participate in that process beta limited release to a specific group of users at this stage we offer small groups of deeply engaged bronto customers early access to experience an emerging product as part of its preproduction testing group before the beta process begins all aspects of the feature have successfully passed our rigorous quality assurance qa testing process however this stage is highly iterative we frequently add or change functionality based on the customer feedback we receive and we will discontinue development if necessary typically a small number of customers participate in a beta group participants receive personalized training and attention from a bronto product manager who stays in close touch to answer questions and gather feedback some beta customers are also members of bronto’s customer advisory board cab where our product management team gathers ideas and feedback for improvements to the bronto marketing platform bronto labs general release available to all customers after a thorough qa process and before making the feature globally available all customers have access to the feature in labs this is the time to test how the new functionality will improve your business this stage is also iterative so features improve on design and functionality over time and users can expect to see frequent enhancements we will pull features from bronto labs if we find they don’t deliver benefit to customers only software features not apps can be introduced in labs so bronto customers can visit labs in the bronto marketing platform to enable or disable these features look for the green beaker at the top right of your account screen in bronto labs one of our product managers gathers customer questions and feedback and tracks specific customers’ success over time with the feature in the last two months we’ve launched new reports and campaigns in bronto labs general availability ga at this stage the feature is complete and is no longer undergoing iterative design and has been provisioned for all users in the bronto marketing platform or made available via the bronto appcenter of course we constantly make improvements to all features in the bronto marketing platform customers often suggest changes via bronto ideas support or professional services those suggested changes also go through a development and testing process that includes our qa process and gathering feedback from customers if you’re a bronto user who would like to get more involved in our product development process contact your bronto account manager contact us to learn more about bronto’s products and
