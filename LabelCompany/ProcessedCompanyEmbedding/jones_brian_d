marketing visual merchandising new media v t e the term marketing comes from the latin mercatus meaning a marketplace pictured la boqueria barcelona spain the moorish bazaar the study of the history of marketing as a discipline is meaningful because it helps to define the baselines upon which change can be recognized and understand how the discipline evolves in response to those changes the practice of marketing has been known for millennia but the term marketing used to describe commercial activities buying and selling a products or services came into popular use in the late nineteenth century the study of the history of marketing as an academic field emerged in the early twentieth century marketers tend to distinguish between the history of marketing practice and the history of marketing thought a the history of marketing practice refers to an investigation into the ways that marketing has been practiced and how those practices have evolved over time as they respond to changing socioeconomic conditions b the history of marketing thought refers to an examination of the ways that marketing has been studied and taught although the history of marketing thought and the history of marketing practice are distinct fields of study they intersect at different junctures marketing practitioners engage in innovative practices that capture the attention of marketing scholars who codify and disseminate such practices at the same time marketing academics often develop new research methods or theories that are subsequently adopted by practitioners thus developments in marketing theory inform marketing practice and vice versa the history of marketing will remain incomplete if one disassociates academia from practitioners the publication in  of robert keiths article the marketing revolution was a pioneering work in the study of the history of marketing practice and in  the publication of robert bartels book the history of marketing thought marked a turningpoint

overviewedit in preliterate societies the distinctive shape of amphora served some of the functions of a label communicating information about region of origin the name of the producer and may have carried product quality claims according to etymologists the term marketing first appeared in dictionaries in the sixteenth century where it referred to the process of buying and selling at a market the contemporary definition of marketing as a process of moving goods from producer to consumer with an emphasis on sales and advertising first appeared in dictionaries in  the term marketing is a derivation of the latin word mercatus meaning market or merchant historians of marketing tend to fall into two distinct branches of marketing history  the history of marketing practice and the history of marketing thought these branches are often deeply divided these branches have very different roots the history of marketing practice is based in management and marketing studies while the history of marketing thought is based in economic and cultural history this means that they ask very different types of research questions and employ different research tools and frameworks historians of marketing have undertaken considerable investigation into the emergence of marketing yet there is little agreement about when marketing first began some researchers argue that marketing practices can be found in antiquity  while others suggest that marketing in its modern form emerged in conjunction with the rise of consumer culture in seventeenth and eighteenth century europe  while yet other researchers suggest that modern marketing was only fully realised in the decades following the industrial revolution in britain from where it subsequently spread to europe and north america hollander and others have suggested that the different dates for the emergence of marketing can be explained by problems surrounding the way that marketing has been defined  whether reference to modern marketing as a planned programmed repertoire of professional practice including activities such as segmentation product differentiation positioning and marketing communications versus marketing as a simple form distribution and exchange marketing in antiquityedit mosaic showing garum container from the house of umbricius scaurus of pompeii the inscription which reads gari flos scombri scauri ex officina scauri has been translated as the flower of garum made of the mackerel a product of scaurus from the shop of scaurus a number of studies have found evidence of advertising branding packaging and labelling in antiquity umbricius scauras for example was a manufacturer of fish sauce also known as garum in pompeii circa  ce mosaic patterns in the atrium of his house were decorated with images of amphora bearing his personal brand and quality claims the mosaic comprises four different amphora one at each corner of the atrium and bearing labels as follows  gari flos scom scauri ex officina scauri translated as the flower of garum made of the mackerel a product of scaurus from the shop of scaurus  liquminis flos translated as the flower of liquamen  gari flos scombri scauri translated as the flower of garum made of the mackerel a product of scaurus  liquamen optimum ex officina scauri translated as the best liquamen from the shop of scaurus the reputation of scauras fish sauce was known to be of very high quality across the mediterannean and its reputation travelled as far away as modern france curtis has described this mosaic as a an advertisement and a rare unequivocal example of a motif inspired by a patron rather than by the artist  in pompeii and nearby herculaneum archeaological evidence also points to evidence of branding and labelling in relatively common use wine jars for example were stamped with names such as lassius and l eumachius probably references to the name of the producer carbonized loaves of bread found at herculaneum indicate that some bakers stamped their bread with the producers name david wengrow has argued that branding became necessary following the urban revolution in ancient mesopotamia in the th century bce when largescale economies started massproducing commodities such as alcoholic drinks cosmetics and textiles these ancient societies imposed strict forms of quality control over commodities and also needed to convey value to the consumer through branding producers began by attaching simple stone seals to products which over time were transformed into clay seals bearing impressed images often associated with the producers personal identity thus giving the product a personality diana twede has argued that the consumer packaging functions of protection utility and communication have been necessary whenever packages were the object of transactions pÂ  she has shown that amphoras used in mediterranean trade between  and  bce exhibited a wide variety of shapes and markings which provided information for transactions systematic use of stamped labels dates from around the fourth century bce in a largely preliterate society the shape of the amphora and its pictorial markings conveyed information about the contents region of origin and even the identity of the producer which were understood to convey information about product quality not all historians agree that these markings can be compared with modern brands or labels moore and reid for example have argued that the distinctive shapes and markings in ancient containers should be termed protobrands rather than modern brands marketing in the middle agesedit market scene by pieter aertsen c in england and europe during the middle ages market towns sprang up some analysts have suggested that the term marketing may have first been used in the context of market towns where the term marketing may have been used by producers to describe the process of carting and selling their produce and wares in market towns blintiff has investigated the early medieval networks of market towns and suggests that by the th century there was an upsurge in the number of market towns and the emergence of merchant circuits as traders bulked up surpluses from smaller regional different day markets and resold them at the larger centralised market towns braudel and reynold have made a systematic study of these european market towns between the thirteenth and fifteenth century their investigation shows that in regional districts markets were held once or twice a week while daily markets were more common in the larger cities and towns over time permanent shops began to open daily and gradually supplanted the periodic markets peddlers filled in the gaps in distribution by travelling doortodoor selling produce and wares the physical market was characterised by transactional exchange and the economy was characterised by local trading braudel reports that in  goods travelled relatively short distances  grain â miles cattle â miles wool and wollen cloth â miles however following the european age of discovery goods were imported from afar  calico cloth from india porcelain silk and tea from china spices from india and southeast asia and tobacco sugar rum and coffee from the new world bronze plate for printing an advertisement for the liu family needle shop at jinan song dynasty china it is considered the worlds earliest identified printed advertising medium although the rise of consumer culture and marketing in britain and europe have been studied extensively less is known about developments elsewhere nevertheless recent research suggests that china exhibited a rich history of early marketing practices including branding packaging advertising and retail signage from as early as  bce chinese packaging and branding was used to signal family place names and product quality and the use of government imposed product branding was used between  and  ad eckhart and bengtsson have argued that during the song dynasty â chinese society developed a consumerist culture where a high level of consumption was attainable for a wide variety of ordinary consumers rather than just the elite pÂ  the rise of a consumer culture led to the commercial investment in carefully managed company image retail signage symbolic brands trademark protection and the brand concepts of baoji hao lei gongpin piazi and pinpai which roughly equate with western concepts of family status quality grading and upholding traditional chinese values pÂ  eckhardt and bengtssons analysis suggests that brands emerged in china as a result of the social needs and tensions implicit in consumer culture in which brands provide social status and stratification thus the evolution of brands in china stands in sharp contrast to the west where manufacturers pushed brands onto the market in order to differentiate increase market share and ultimately profits pp â marketing in seventeenth and eighteenth century europeedit josiah wedgewoods th century techniques exhibited many of the characteristics of modern marketing scholars have identified specific instances of marketing practices in england and europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries as trade between countries or regions grew companies required information on which to base business decisions individuals and companies carried out formal and informal research on trade conditions in  johann fugger travelled from augsburg to graben in order to gather information on the international textile industry he exchanged detailed letters on trade conditions in relevant areas in the early s british industrial houses were demanding information that could be used for business decisions during this period daniel defoe a london merchant published information on trade and economic resources of england and scotland defoe was a prolific publisher and among his many publications are titles devoted to trade including trade of britain stated  trade of scotland with france  and the trade to india critically and calmly considered  all books that were highly popular with merchants and business houses of the period while such activities might now be recognised as marketing research at that time they were known as commercial research or commercial intelligence and not seen as part of the repertoire of activities that make up contemporary marketing practice in a major review of consumer society mckendrick brewer and plumb found extensive evidence of eighteenth century english entrepreneurs using modern marketing techniques including product differentiation sales promotion and loss leader pricing english industrialists josiah wedgewood and matthew boulton are often portrayed as pioneers of modern mass marketing methods wedgewood was known to have used marketing techniques such as direct mail travelling salesmen and catalogues in the eighteenth century wedgewood also carried out serious investigations into the fixed and variable costs of production and recognised that increased production would lead to lower unit costs he also inferred that selling at lower prices would lead to higher demand and recognised the value of achieving scale economies in production by cutting costs and lowering prices wedgewood was able to generate higher overall profits similarly one of wedgewoods contemporaries matthew boulton pioneered early mass production techniques and product differentiation at his soho manufactory in the s he also practiced planned obsolescence and understood the importance of celebrity marketing  that is supplying the nobility often at prices below cost and of obtaining royal patronage for the sake of the publicity and cudos generated fullerton argues that the practice of market segmentation emerged well before marketers used the notion formally  certain strands of evidence suggest that simple examples of market segmentation were evident prior to the s the business historian richard s tedlow argues that any attempt to segment markets prior to  was highly fragmented since the economy was characterised by small regional suppliers who mostly sold goods on a local or regional basis  when retail shops began to appear from the th century retailers needed to separate the riff raff from wealthier customers outside the major metropolitan cities few stores could afford to serve one type of clientele exclusively however gradually retail shops introduced innovations that would allow them to separate wealthier customers from the riff raff one technique was to have a window opening out onto the street from which customers could be served this allowed the sale of goods to the common people without encouraging them to come inside another solution that came into vogue from the late sixteenth century was to invite favoured customers into a backroom of the store where goods were permanently on display yet another technique that emerged around the same time was to hold a showcase of goods in the shopkeepers private home for the benefit of wealthier clients samuel pepys for example writing in  describes being invited to the home of a retailer to view a wooden jack the eighteenth century english entrepreneurs josiah wedgewood and matthew boulton both staged expansive showcases of their wares in their private residences or in rented halls evidence of early marketing segmentation have also been noted across europe a study of the german book trade found examples of both product differentiation and market segmentation in the s marketing in the nineteenth and twentieth centuriesedit henry ford began manufacturing the massproduced model t in  ford famously said that customers could own a car in any colour as long as it was black until the nineteenth century western economies were characterised by small regional suppliers who sold goods on a local or regional basis however as transportation systems improved from the mid nineteenth century the economy became more unified allowing companies to distribute standardised branded goods a national level this gave rise to a much broader mass marketing mindset manufacturers tended to insist on strict standardisation in order to achieve scale economies with a view to keeping production costs down and also to achieving market penetration in the early stages of a products life cycle the model t ford was an example of a product being manufactured at a price that was affordable for the burgeoning middle classes havenmason hall at the university of michigan where the first academic course in marketing was taught in the early twentieth century as market size increased it became more commonplace for manufacturers to produce a variety of models pitched at different quality points designed to meet the needs of various demographic and lifestyle market segments giving rise to the widespread practice of market segmentation and product differentation between   george b waldron working at mahins advertising agency used tax registers city directories and census data to show advertisers the proportion of educated versus illiterate consumers and the earning capacity of different occupations in what is believed to be the first example of demographic segmentation of a population within little more than a decade paul cherington had developed the abcd household typology  the first sociodemographic segmentation tool when wendell r smith published his now classic article product differentiation and market segmentation as alternative marketing strategies in  he noted that he was simply documenting marketing practices that had been observed for some time and which he described as a natural force other theorists agree that smith was simply codifying implicit knowledge that had been used in marketing and brand management from the early twentieth century as industry grew the demand for skilled business professionals also grew to meet this demand universities began offering courses in commerce economics and marketing marketing as a discipline was first taught in universities in the very early twentieth century however researchers only became interested in investigating the history of marketing in the mid twentieth century from the outset researchers tended to identify two strands of historical research the history of marketing practice  and the history of marketing thought which was fundamentally concerned with the rise of marketing education and dissecting the way that marketing was taught and studied early historical studies were primarily descriptive history of marketing practiceedit the practice of marketing may have been carried out for millennia but the modern concept of marketing as a professional practice appears to have emerged the post industrial corporate world in addition to the studies of specific cultures or time periods discussed in the preceding section some historians of marketing have sought to write more general histories of marketings evolution in the modern era to do this historians often turn to a method known as periodisation periodisation refers to the process or study of categorizing the past into discrete quantified named units for the purpose of analysis or study a key question that has preoccupied researchers is whether specific orientations or mindsets that inform key periods of marketings evolution can be identified marketers disagree about the precise periods that outline marketing practice and describe the way that marketing practice has evolved over time orientations or philosophies that inform marketing practiceedit in the marketing literature continuing debate surrounds the orientations or philosophies that might have informed marketing practice at different periods of time an orientation may be defind as the type of activity or subject that an organization seems most interested in and gives most attention to  in relation to marketing orientations the term has been defined as a philosophy of business management  or a corporate state of mind  or as an organisational culture  hollander et al have identified fourteen different stage theories or short periodisations as well as a total of nineteen long periodisations that have been carried out since  of these the contributions of robert keith  and ronald fullerton  are the most frequently cited keiths periodisationedit robert keiths marketing eras production âselling âmarketing were based entirely on his experience at the pillsbury company in  robert keith the then vice president of pillsbury set the stage for decades of controversy when he published an article entitled the marketing revolution in which he set out the way that the pillsbury company had shifted from a focus on production in the s through to a consumer focus in the s he traced three distinct eras in pillsburys evolution the production oriented era from  s  characterised by a focus on production processes the sales oriented era from the s to the s  characterised by investment in research to develop new products and advertising to persuade markets of product benefits the marketing oriented era from the beginning of the s  characterised by a focus on the customers latent and existing needs in addition keith hypothesised that a marketing control era was about to emerge although keiths article explicitly documented pillsburys evolution the article appears to suggest that the stages observed at pillsbury constitute a standard or normal evolutionary path productionâsalesâmarketing for most large organisations keiths notion of distinct eras in the evolution of marketing practice has been widely criticised and his periodisation described as hopelessly flawed specific criticisms of keiths tripartite periodisation include that it ignores historical facts about business conditions  it misstates the nature of supply and demand  it slights the growth of marketing institutions  the article which is entirely based on keiths personal recollections and did not use a single reference is best described as anecdotal systematic studies carried out since keiths work have failed to replicate keiths periodisation instead other studies suggest that many companies exhibited a marketing orientation in the nineteenth century and that the business schools were teaching marketing decades before pillsbury adopted a marketing oriented approach jones and richardson also investigated historical accounts of marketing practice and found evidence for both the sales and marketing era during the socalled production era and concluded that there was no marketing revolution  a detailed study of the chocolate manufacturer rowntree found that this company had shifted from a production orientation through to a marketing orientation by the s without having transitioned through the socalled sales orientation other critiques of keiths work have pointed out that the socalled production era fails to align with historical facts and have suggested that it is a myth keiths eras have become known somewhat cynically as the standard chronology fullertons periodisationedit the english industrial revolution is often seen as a trigger for the rise of modern marketing in  fullerton developed a more subtle and nuanced periodisation for the socalled marketing eras fullertons eras were the era of antecedents    a long gestational period in which people were largely selfsufficient and rural economy characterised by low levels of consumption commerce was seen as suspicious the era of origins   precipitated by the dislocations of the english industrial revolution and the rise of a more urban population this era is characterised by more attention to persuasive tactics designed to stimulate demand the era of institutional development   many of the large institutions and modern marketing practices emerged during this period the era of refinement and formalisation âpresent   further development and refinement of principles and practices developed in the preceding period in spite of the intense criticism levelled at keiths eras of marketing practice his periodisation is the most frequently cited in textbooks  and has become the accepted wisdom one content analysis of  introductory and advanced texts found that keiths eras were reproduced in all but four another study which examined  of the top selling marketing texts found that the although the incidence of repeating keiths eras was waning it had not been replaced by fullertons periodisation nor any other more meaningful framework other periodisationsedit for all the controversies surrounding the socalled marketing stages or periods keith and others appear to have contributed a lasting legacy a study by grundey  suggests that many contemporary textbooks begin with keiths eras and expand on it by including newer concepts such as the societal marketing concept the relationship marketing concept and the interfunctional concept as shown in the table below more recently kotler and keller added the holistic marketing concept to the list of eras in marketing marketing theorists continue to debate whether the holistic era represents a genuine new orientation or whether it is an extension of the marketing concept grundey summarised five different periodisations in the history of marketing as shown in the following table

commerce and tourism vol  no   pÂ  brief description of the most commonly cited periodsedit the general lack of agreement amongst scholars as to what constitutes clearly identifiable periods and the orientation that characterised each distinct period has spawned a lengthy list of orientations space prevents an exhaustive description of all periods or eras however the most commonly cited periods appear in the following section production orientationedit the production orientation is one of the oldest philosophies that guides sellers a production orientation is often proposed as the first of the socalled orientations that dominated business thought keith dated the production era from the s to the s but other theorists argue that evidence of the production orientation can still be found in some companies or industries specifically kotler and armstrong note that the production philosophy is one of the oldest philosophies that guides sellers and is still useful in some situations  the production orientation is characterised by a focus on production manufacturing and efficiency attainment of economies of scale economies of scope experience effects or all three an assumption that demand exceeds supply a mindset that is encapsulated by says law supply creates its own demand or if somebody makes a product somebody else will want to buy it limited research  and largely limited to technicalproduct research rather than customer research this orientation rose to prominence in an environment which had a shortage of manufactured goods relative to demand so goods sold easily minimal promotion and advertising marketing communications limited to raising awareness of the products existence selling orientationedit the sales orientation often characterised by doortodoor selling is thought to have begun during the great depression of the s and continues to this day pictured a rawleighs salesman in  the selling orientation is thought to have begun during the great depression and continued well into the s although examples of this orientation can still be found today kotler et al note that the selling concept is typically practised with unsought goods  the selling orientation is characterised by aggressive selling to push products often involving doortodoor selling accepting every possible sale or booking regardless of its suitability for the business has a strongly transactional focus ignores potential relationships the marketing orientationedit the marketing orientation or the marketing concept emerged in the s characteristics of the marketing orientation a thorough understanding of the customers needs wants and behaviours should be the focal point of all marketing decisions marketing efforts sales advertising product management pricing should be integrated and in tune with the customer new product concepts should flow from extensive market analysis and product testing the societal marketing conceptedit main article societal marketing societal marketing orientation or societal marketing concept was first proposed in the s  by phillip kotler in an article published in the harvard business review the societal marketing concept adopts the position that marketers have a greater social responsibility than simply satisfying customers and providing them with superior value instead marketing activities should strive to benefit societys overall wellbeing marketing organisations that have embraced the societal marketing concept typically identify key stakeholder groups including employees customers local communities the wider public and government they ensure that marketing activities do not damage the environment and are not hazardous to broader society societal marketing developed into sustainable marketing characteristics of societal marketing an attempt to balance corporate commitments to groups and individuals in its environment including customers other businesses employees and investors companies must include social and ethical considerations into their marketing practices consideration is given to the environment includes problems such as air water and land pollution consideration is given to consumer rights unfair pricing and ethics in advertising relationship orientationedit main article relationship marketing starting in the s a new stage of marketing emerged called relationship marketing the focus of relationship marketing is on a longterm relationship that benefits both the company and the customer the relationship is based on trust and commitment and both companies tend to shift their operating activities to be able to work more efficiently together one of the most prominent reasons for relationship marketing comes from kotlers idea that it costs about five times more to obtain a new customer than to maintain the relationship with an existing customer a relationship marketing approach seeks to maximise the value of all the potential exchanges an organisation could have into the future the characteristics of relationship marketing include a focus on the relationship between seller and buyer an investment in the lifetime of relationships customer lifetime value rather than single transactions an orientation on product benefits andor customer value high customer service high customer commitment high customer contact quality is the concern of all all activities are coordinated with the customer interface including the customers involvement in the firmâs processes customised offerings where practical empirical support for relationship marketing as a distinct paradigm is very weak one study suggests that relationship marketing is really a subcomponent of large scale movements of the valueadded process rather than a separate era or framework some theorists suggest that marketing is moving from a relationship marketing paradigm and towards a social media paradigm where marketers have access to a more controlled environment and are able to customise offers and communications messages history of marketing thoughtedit university of pennsylvania was among the first universities to offer courses in marketing dating the history of marketing thought is just as problematic as the history of markting practice marketing historians cannot agree on how to date the beginnings of marketing thought eric shaw for instance suggests that a period of preacademic marketing thought can be identified prior to  other historians on the other hand suggest that the theory of marketing only emerged in the th century when the discipline began to offer courses at universities nevertheless the birth of marketing as a discipline is usually designated to the first decade of the twentieth century when marketing courses appeared in universities in  the university of michigan offered what many believe to be the very first course in marketing in the academic year  the university of pennsylvania commenced teaching marketing other universities soon followed including the harvard business school prior to the emergence of marketing courses marketing was treated as a branch of economics and was often called applied economics early marketing theories were described as modifications or adaptations of economic theories a periodisation approachedit several scholars have attempted to describe the evolution of marketing thought chronologically and to connect it with broader intellectual and academic trends bartels  sketched an account of marketings formative periods and shah and gardner  briefly considered the development of the six dominant schools in contemporary marketing however these initial attempts have been described as descriptive savitt  one of the first theorists to consider the stages in the development of marketing thought was robert bartels who in the the history of marketing thought  used a periodisation approach he categorised the development of marketing theory decade by decade from the beginning of the th century s discovery of basic concepts and their exploration s conceptualisation classification and definition of terms s integration on the basis of principles s development of specialisation and variation in theory s reappraisal in the light of new demands and a more scientific approach s reconceptualisation in the light of managerialism social development and quantitative approaches s differentiation on bases such as managerialism holism environmentalism systems and internationalism s socialisation the adaptation of marketing to social change a schools of thought approachedit other marketing historians have eschewed the periodisation approach and instead considered whether distinct schools within marketing reflect different facets of common theory and whether a more unifying intellectual structure has emerged these approaches tend to identify distinct schools of thought a school of thought refers to an intellectual tradition or a group of scholars who share a common philosophy or set of ideas marketing historians shaw and jones define a school of thought as one that has a substantial body of knowledge developed by a number of scholars and describing at least one aspect of the what how who why when and where of performing marketing activities  of those who identify schools there is no real agreement about which schools were dominant at different stages in marketings development it should be noted that two or more schools of thought can coexist at the same time in the following section a brief overview of the contributions of key thinkers will be outlined with respect to the prevailing schools that have dominated marketing thought to a certain extent there is some agreement that in early marketing thought three socalled traditional schools namely the commodity school the functional school and the institutional school coexisted marketing historians such as eric shaw and barton a weitz point to the publication of wroe aldersons book marketing behavior and executive action  as a breakpoint in the history of marketing thought moving from the macro functionsinstitutionscommodities approach to a micromarketing management paradigm following on from alderson marketing began to incorporate other fields of knowledge besides economics notably behavioral science becoming a multidisciplinary field for some scholars aldersons book marks the beginning of the marketing management era hunt and goolsby identified four schools of thought that have dominated marketing namely the commodity school the institutional school the functional school and the managerial school the commodity school a focus on different types of goods in the marketplace and how they are marketed the institutional school emphasised the functions of middlemen or intermediaries similar to the functional school but with a focus on channel flows the functional school a focus on the characteristics of marketing identifying the functions and systems of marketing adopts a systems approach the managerial school a focus on the problems faced by marketing managers focuses on the perspective of the seller some marketing historians like jagdish sheth have identified the modern marketing schools as the managerial school emerged during the late s and became arguably the predominant and most influential school of thought in the field the consumerbuyer behavior school which dominated the academic field in the second half of the twentieth century apart from the managerial school features theories emerging from behavioral science the social exchange school which focuses on exchange as the fundamental concept of marketing yet other commentators identify a broader range of schools omalley and lichrou for example document the schools as functional what activities does marketing perform focus on intermediaries and value adding commodities how are goods classified focus on classification of goods trade flows marketing institutions who performs marketing functions on commodities focus on retailers wholesalers intermediaries distribution channels marketing management how should marketers and managers market products and services

practice brief description of the dominant schools of thoughtedit the following sections briefly outlines the schools of thought as conceptualised by key thinkers in the discipline marketing managementedit the marketing management school which emerged as the dominant school in  following the publication of basic marketing a managerial approach written by e jerome mccarthy replaced the socalled functional school which had been the dominant for the first part of the twentieth century in the words of hunt and goolsby the publication of mccarthys text sounded the beginning of the end for the functional school  however hunt and goolsby note that the s was a transitional period in which both the functional school and the managerial school coexisted shaw and jones have described the emergence of the managerial school in the mid twentieth century as a paradigm shift  key works in the marketing management tradition include wroe aldersons marketing behavior and executive action

marketplace pictured la boqueria barcelona spain the moorish bazaar the study of the history of marketing as a discipline is meaningful because it helps to define the baselines upon which change can be recognized and understand how the discipline evolves in response to those changes the practice of marketing has been known for millennia but the term marketing used to describe commercial activities buying and selling a products or services came into popular use in the late nineteenth century the study of the history of marketing as an academic field emerged in the early twentieth century marketers tend to distinguish between the history of marketing practice and the history of marketing thought a the history of marketing practice refers to an investigation into the ways that marketing has been practiced and how those practices have evolved over time as they respond to changing socioeconomic conditions b the history of marketing thought refers to an examination of the ways that marketing has been studied and taught although the history of marketing thought and the history of marketing practice are distinct fields of study they intersect at different junctures marketing practitioners engage in innovative practices that capture the attention of marketing scholars who codify and disseminate such practices at the same time marketing academics often develop new research methods or theories that are subsequently adopted by practitioners thus developments in marketing theory inform marketing practice and vice versa the history of marketing will remain incomplete if one disassociates academia from practitioners the publication in  of robert keiths article the marketing revolution was a pioneering work in the study of the history of marketing practice and in  the publication of robert bartels book the history of marketing thought marked a turningpoint in the understanding of how marketing theory evolved since it first emerged as a separate discipline around

label communicating information about region of origin the name of the producer and may have carried product quality claims according to etymologists the term marketing first appeared in dictionaries in the sixteenth century where it referred to the process of buying and selling at a market the contemporary definition of marketing as a process of moving goods from producer to consumer with an emphasis on sales and advertising first appeared in dictionaries in  the term marketing is a derivation of the latin word mercatus meaning market or merchant historians of marketing tend to fall into two distinct branches of marketing history  the history of marketing practice and the history of marketing thought these branches are often deeply divided these branches have very different roots the history of marketing practice is based in management and marketing studies while the history of marketing thought is based in economic and cultural history this means that they ask very different types of research questions and employ different research tools and frameworks historians of marketing have undertaken considerable investigation into the emergence of marketing yet there is little agreement about when marketing first began some researchers argue that marketing practices can be found in antiquity  while others suggest that marketing in its modern form emerged in conjunction with the rise of consumer culture in seventeenth and eighteenth century europe  while yet other researchers suggest that modern marketing was only fully realised in the decades following the industrial revolution in britain from where it subsequently spread to europe and north america hollander and others have suggested that the different dates for the emergence of marketing can be explained by problems surrounding the way that marketing has been defined  whether reference to modern marketing as a planned programmed repertoire of professional practice including activities such as segmentation product differentiation positioning and marketing communications versus marketing as a simple form distribution and exchange marketing in antiquityedit mosaic showing garum container from the house of umbricius scaurus of pompeii the inscription which reads gari flos scombri scauri ex officina scauri has been translated as the flower of garum made of the mackerel a product of scaurus from the shop of scaurus a number of studies have found evidence of advertising branding packaging and labelling in antiquity umbricius scauras for example was a manufacturer of fish sauce also known as garum in pompeii circa  ce mosaic patterns in the atrium of his house were decorated with images of amphora bearing his personal brand and quality claims the mosaic comprises four different amphora one at each corner of the atrium and bearing labels as follows  gari flos scom scauri ex officina scauri translated as the flower of garum made of the mackerel a product of scaurus from the shop of scaurus  liquminis flos translated as the flower of liquamen  gari flos scombri scauri translated as the flower of garum made of the mackerel a product of scaurus  liquamen optimum ex officina scauri translated as the best liquamen from the shop of scaurus the reputation of scauras fish sauce was known to be of very high quality across the mediterannean and its reputation travelled as far away as modern france curtis has described this mosaic as a an advertisement and a rare unequivocal example of a motif inspired by a patron rather than by the artist  in pompeii and nearby herculaneum archeaological evidence also points to evidence of branding and labelling in relatively common use wine jars for example were stamped with names such as lassius and l eumachius probably references to the name of the producer carbonized loaves of bread found at herculaneum indicate that some bakers stamped their bread with the producers name david wengrow has argued that branding became necessary following the urban revolution in ancient mesopotamia in the th century bce when largescale economies started massproducing commodities such as alcoholic drinks cosmetics and textiles these ancient societies imposed strict forms of quality control over commodities and also needed to convey value to the consumer through branding producers began by attaching simple stone seals to products which over time were transformed into clay seals bearing impressed images often associated with the producers personal identity thus giving the product a personality diana twede has argued that the consumer packaging functions of protection utility and communication have been necessary whenever packages were the object of transactions pÂ  she has shown that amphoras used in mediterranean trade between  and  bce exhibited a wide variety of shapes and markings which provided information for transactions systematic use of stamped labels dates from around the fourth century bce in a largely preliterate society the shape of the amphora and its pictorial markings conveyed information about the contents region of origin and even the identity of the producer which were understood to convey information about product quality not all historians agree that these markings can be compared with modern brands or labels moore and reid for example have argued that the distinctive shapes and markings in ancient containers should be termed protobrands rather than modern brands marketing in the middle agesedit market scene by pieter aertsen c in england and europe during the middle ages market towns sprang up some analysts have suggested that the term marketing may have first been used in the context of market towns where the term marketing may have been used by producers to describe the process of carting and selling their produce and wares in market towns blintiff has investigated the early medieval networks of market towns and suggests that by the th century there was an upsurge in the number of market towns and the emergence of merchant circuits as traders bulked up surpluses from smaller regional different day markets and resold them at the larger centralised market towns braudel and reynold have made a systematic study of these european market towns between the thirteenth and fifteenth century their investigation shows that in regional districts markets were held once or twice a week while daily markets were more common in the larger cities and towns over time permanent shops began to open daily and gradually supplanted the periodic markets peddlers filled in the gaps in distribution by travelling doortodoor selling produce and wares the physical market was characterised by transactional exchange and the economy was characterised by local trading braudel reports that in  goods travelled relatively short distances  grain â miles cattle â miles wool and wollen cloth â miles however following the european age of discovery goods were imported from afar  calico cloth from india porcelain silk and tea from china spices from india and southeast asia and tobacco sugar rum and coffee from the new world bronze plate for printing an advertisement for the liu family needle shop at jinan song dynasty china it is considered the worlds earliest identified printed advertising medium although the rise of consumer culture and marketing in britain and europe have been studied extensively less is known about developments elsewhere nevertheless recent research suggests that china exhibited a rich history of early marketing practices including branding packaging advertising and retail signage from as early as  bce chinese packaging and branding was used to signal family place names and product quality and the use of government imposed product branding was used between  and  ad eckhart and bengtsson have argued that during the song dynasty â chinese society developed a consumerist culture where a high level of consumption was attainable for a wide variety of ordinary consumers rather than just the elite pÂ  the rise of a consumer culture led to the commercial investment in carefully managed company image retail signage symbolic brands trademark protection and the brand concepts of baoji hao lei gongpin piazi and pinpai which roughly equate with western concepts of family status quality grading and upholding traditional chinese values pÂ  eckhardt and bengtssons analysis suggests that brands emerged in china as a result of the social needs and tensions implicit in consumer culture in which brands provide social status and stratification thus the evolution of brands in china stands in sharp contrast to the west where manufacturers pushed brands onto the market in order to differentiate increase market share and ultimately profits pp â marketing in seventeenth and eighteenth century europeedit josiah wedgewoods th century techniques exhibited many of the characteristics of modern marketing scholars have identified specific instances of marketing practices in england and europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries as trade between countries or regions grew companies required information on which to base business decisions individuals and companies carried out formal and informal research on trade conditions in  johann fugger travelled from augsburg to graben in order to gather information on the international textile industry he exchanged detailed letters on trade conditions in relevant areas in the early s british industrial houses were demanding information that could be used for business decisions during this period daniel defoe a london merchant published information on trade and economic resources of england and scotland defoe was a prolific publisher and among his many publications are titles devoted to trade including trade of britain stated  trade of scotland with france  and the trade to india critically and calmly considered  all books that were highly popular with merchants and business houses of the period while such activities might now be recognised as marketing research at that time they were known as commercial research or commercial intelligence and not seen as part of the repertoire of activities that make up contemporary marketing practice in a major review of consumer society mckendrick brewer and plumb found extensive evidence of eighteenth century english entrepreneurs using modern marketing techniques including product differentiation sales promotion and loss leader pricing english industrialists josiah wedgewood and matthew boulton are often portrayed as pioneers of modern mass marketing methods wedgewood was known to have used marketing techniques such as direct mail travelling salesmen and catalogues in the eighteenth century wedgewood also carried out serious investigations into the fixed and variable costs of production and recognised that increased production would lead to lower unit costs he also inferred that selling at lower prices would lead to higher demand and recognised the value of achieving scale economies in production by cutting costs and lowering prices wedgewood was able to generate higher overall profits similarly one of wedgewoods contemporaries matthew boulton pioneered early mass production techniques and product differentiation at his soho manufactory in the s he also practiced planned obsolescence and understood the importance of celebrity marketing  that is supplying the nobility often at prices below cost and of obtaining royal patronage for the sake of the publicity and cudos generated fullerton argues that the practice of market segmentation emerged well before marketers used the notion formally  certain strands of evidence suggest that simple examples of market segmentation were evident prior to the s the business historian richard s tedlow argues that any attempt to segment markets prior to  was highly fragmented since the economy was characterised by small regional suppliers who mostly sold goods on a local or regional basis  when retail shops began to appear from the th century retailers needed to separate the riff raff from wealthier customers outside the major metropolitan cities few stores could afford to serve one type of clientele exclusively however gradually retail shops introduced innovations that would allow them to separate wealthier customers from the riff raff one technique was to have a window opening out onto the street from which customers could be served this allowed the sale of goods to the common people without encouraging them to come inside another solution that came into vogue from the late sixteenth century was to invite favoured customers into a backroom of the store where goods were permanently on display yet another technique that emerged around the same time was to hold a showcase of goods in the shopkeepers private home for the benefit of wealthier clients samuel pepys for example writing in  describes being invited to the home of a retailer to view a wooden jack the eighteenth century english entrepreneurs josiah wedgewood and matthew boulton both staged expansive showcases of their wares in their private residences or in rented halls evidence of early marketing segmentation have also been noted across europe a study of the german book trade found examples of both product differentiation and market segmentation in the s marketing in the nineteenth and twentieth centuriesedit henry ford began manufacturing the massproduced model t in  ford famously said that customers could own a car in any colour as long as it was black until the nineteenth century western economies were characterised by small regional suppliers who sold goods on a local or regional basis however as transportation systems improved from the mid nineteenth century the economy became more unified allowing companies to distribute standardised branded goods a national level this gave rise to a much broader mass marketing mindset manufacturers tended to insist on strict standardisation in order to achieve scale economies with a view to keeping production costs down and also to achieving market penetration in the early stages of a products life cycle the model t ford was an example of a product being manufactured at a price that was affordable for the burgeoning middle classes havenmason hall at the university of michigan where the first academic course in marketing was taught in the early twentieth century as market size increased it became more commonplace for manufacturers to produce a variety of models pitched at different quality points designed to meet the needs of various demographic and lifestyle market segments giving rise to the widespread practice of market segmentation and product differentation between   george b waldron working at mahins advertising agency used tax registers city directories and census data to show advertisers the proportion of educated versus illiterate consumers and the earning capacity of different occupations in what is believed to be the first example of demographic segmentation of a population within little more than a decade paul cherington had developed the abcd household typology  the first sociodemographic segmentation tool when wendell r smith published his now classic article product differentiation and market segmentation as alternative marketing strategies in  he noted that he was simply documenting marketing practices that had been observed for some time and which he described as a natural force other theorists agree that smith was simply codifying implicit knowledge that had been used in marketing and brand management from the early twentieth century as industry grew the demand for skilled business professionals also grew to meet this demand universities began offering courses in commerce economics and marketing marketing as a discipline was first taught in universities in the very early twentieth century however researchers only became interested in investigating the history of marketing in the mid twentieth century from the outset researchers tended to identify two strands of historical research the history of marketing practice  and the history of marketing thought which was fundamentally concerned with the rise of marketing education and dissecting the way that marketing was taught and studied early historical studies were primarily descriptive history of marketing practiceedit the practice of marketing may have been carried out for millennia but the modern concept of marketing as a professional practice appears to have emerged the post industrial corporate world in addition to the studies of specific cultures or time periods discussed in the preceding section some historians of marketing have sought to write more general histories of marketings evolution in the modern era to do this historians often turn to a method known as periodisation periodisation refers to the process or study of categorizing the past into discrete quantified named units for the purpose of analysis or study a key question that has preoccupied researchers is whether specific orientations or mindsets that inform key periods of marketings evolution can be identified marketers disagree about the precise periods that outline marketing practice and describe the way that marketing practice has evolved over time orientations or philosophies that inform marketing practiceedit in the marketing literature continuing debate surrounds the orientations or philosophies that might have informed marketing practice at different periods of time an orientation may be defind as the type of activity or subject that an organization seems most interested in and gives most attention to  in relation to marketing orientations the term has been defined as a philosophy of business management  or a corporate state of mind  or as an organisational culture  hollander et al have identified fourteen different stage theories or short periodisations as well as a total of nineteen long periodisations that have been carried out since  of these the contributions of robert keith  and ronald fullerton  are the most frequently cited keiths periodisationedit robert keiths marketing eras production âselling âmarketing were based entirely on his experience at the pillsbury company in  robert keith the then vice president of pillsbury set the stage for decades of controversy when he published an article entitled the marketing revolution in which he set out the way that the pillsbury company had shifted from a focus on production in the s through to a consumer focus in the s he traced three distinct eras in pillsburys evolution the production oriented era from  s  characterised by a focus on production processes the sales oriented era from the s to the s  characterised by investment in research to develop new products and advertising to persuade markets of product benefits the marketing oriented era from the beginning of the s  characterised by a focus on the customers latent and existing needs in addition keith hypothesised that a marketing control era was about to emerge although keiths article explicitly documented pillsburys evolution the article appears to suggest that the stages observed at pillsbury constitute a standard or normal evolutionary path productionâsalesâmarketing for most large organisations keiths notion of distinct eras in the evolution of marketing practice has been widely criticised and his periodisation described as hopelessly flawed specific criticisms of keiths tripartite periodisation include that it ignores historical facts about business conditions  it misstates the nature of supply and demand  it slights the growth of marketing institutions  the article which is entirely based on keiths personal recollections and did not use a single reference is best described as anecdotal systematic studies carried out since keiths work have failed to replicate keiths periodisation instead other studies suggest that many companies exhibited a marketing orientation in the nineteenth century and that the business schools were teaching marketing decades before pillsbury adopted a marketing oriented approach jones and richardson also investigated historical accounts of marketing practice and found evidence for both the sales and marketing era during the socalled production era and concluded that there was no marketing revolution  a detailed study of the chocolate manufacturer rowntree found that this company had shifted from a production orientation through to a marketing orientation by the s without having transitioned through the socalled sales orientation other critiques of keiths work have pointed out that the socalled production era fails to align with historical facts and have suggested that it is a myth keiths eras have become known somewhat cynically as the standard chronology fullertons periodisationedit the english industrial revolution is often seen as a trigger for the rise of modern marketing in  fullerton developed a more subtle and nuanced periodisation for the socalled marketing eras fullertons eras were the era of antecedents    a long gestational period in which people were largely selfsufficient and rural economy characterised by low levels of consumption commerce was seen as suspicious the era of origins   precipitated by the dislocations of the english industrial revolution and the rise of a more urban population this era is characterised by more attention to persuasive tactics designed to stimulate demand the era of institutional development   many of the large institutions and modern marketing practices emerged during this period the era of refinement and formalisation âpresent   further development and refinement of principles and practices developed in the preceding period in spite of the intense criticism levelled at keiths eras of marketing practice his periodisation is the most frequently cited in textbooks  and has become the accepted wisdom one content analysis of  introductory and advanced texts found that keiths eras were reproduced in all but four another study which examined  of the top selling marketing texts found that the although the incidence of repeating keiths eras was waning it had not been replaced by fullertons periodisation nor any other more meaningful framework other periodisationsedit for all the controversies surrounding the socalled marketing stages or periods keith and others appear to have contributed a lasting legacy a study by grundey  suggests that many contemporary textbooks begin with keiths eras and expand on it by including newer concepts such as the societal marketing concept the relationship marketing concept and the interfunctional concept as shown in the table below more recently kotler and keller added the holistic marketing concept to the list of eras in marketing marketing theorists continue to debate whether the holistic era represents a genuine new orientation or whether it is an extension of the marketing concept grundey summarised five different periodisations in the history of marketing as shown in the following table as a means of highlighting the general lack of agreement among scholars marketing philosophies or orientations cited in

millennium scientific bulletin â economic sciences marketing commerce and tourism vol  no   pÂ  brief description of the most commonly cited periodsedit the general lack of agreement amongst scholars as to what constitutes clearly identifiable periods and the orientation that characterised each distinct period has spawned a lengthy list of orientations space prevents an exhaustive description of all periods or eras however the most commonly cited periods appear in the following section production orientationedit the production orientation is one of the oldest philosophies that guides sellers a production orientation is often proposed as the first of the socalled orientations that dominated business thought keith dated the production era from the s to the s but other theorists argue that evidence of the production orientation can still be found in some companies or industries specifically kotler and armstrong note that the production philosophy is one of the oldest philosophies that guides sellers and is still useful in some situations  the production orientation is characterised by a focus on production manufacturing and efficiency attainment of economies of scale economies of scope experience effects or all three an assumption that demand exceeds supply a mindset that is encapsulated by says law supply creates its own demand or if somebody makes a product somebody else will want to buy it limited research  and largely limited to technicalproduct research rather than customer research this orientation rose to prominence in an environment which had a shortage of manufactured goods relative to demand so goods sold easily minimal promotion and advertising marketing communications limited to raising awareness of the products existence selling orientationedit the sales orientation often characterised by doortodoor selling is thought to have begun during the great depression of the s and continues to this day pictured a rawleighs salesman in  the selling orientation is thought to have begun during the great depression and continued well into the s although examples of this orientation can still be found today kotler et al note that the selling concept is typically practised with unsought goods  the selling orientation is characterised by aggressive selling to push products often involving doortodoor selling accepting every possible sale or booking regardless of its suitability for the business has a strongly transactional focus ignores potential relationships the marketing orientationedit the marketing orientation or the marketing concept emerged in the s characteristics of the marketing orientation a thorough understanding of the customers needs wants and behaviours should be the focal point of all marketing decisions marketing efforts sales advertising product management pricing should be integrated and in tune with the customer new product concepts should flow from extensive market analysis and product testing the societal marketing conceptedit main article societal marketing societal marketing orientation or societal marketing concept was first proposed in the s  by phillip kotler in an article published in the harvard business review the societal marketing concept adopts the position that marketers have a greater social responsibility than simply satisfying customers and providing them with superior value instead marketing activities should strive to benefit societys overall wellbeing marketing organisations that have embraced the societal marketing concept typically identify key stakeholder groups including employees customers local communities the wider public and government they ensure that marketing activities do not damage the environment and are not hazardous to broader society societal marketing developed into sustainable marketing characteristics of societal marketing an attempt to balance corporate commitments to groups and individuals in its environment including customers other businesses employees and investors companies must include social and ethical considerations into their marketing practices consideration is given to the environment includes problems such as air water and land pollution consideration is given to consumer rights unfair pricing and ethics in advertising relationship orientationedit main article relationship marketing starting in the s a new stage of marketing emerged called relationship marketing the focus of relationship marketing is on a longterm relationship that benefits both the company and the customer the relationship is based on trust and commitment and both companies tend to shift their operating activities to be able to work more efficiently together one of the most prominent reasons for relationship marketing comes from kotlers idea that it costs about five times more to obtain a new customer than to maintain the relationship with an existing customer a relationship marketing approach seeks to maximise the value of all the potential exchanges an organisation could have into the future the characteristics of relationship marketing include a focus on the relationship between seller and buyer an investment in the lifetime of relationships customer lifetime value rather than single transactions an orientation on product benefits andor customer value high customer service high customer commitment high customer contact quality is the concern of all all activities are coordinated with the customer interface including the customers involvement in the firmâs processes customised offerings where practical empirical support for relationship marketing as a distinct paradigm is very weak one study suggests that relationship marketing is really a subcomponent of large scale movements of the valueadded process rather than a separate era or framework some theorists suggest that marketing is moving from a relationship marketing paradigm and towards a social media paradigm where marketers have access to a more controlled environment and are able to customise offers and communications messages history of marketing thoughtedit university of pennsylvania was among the first universities to offer courses in marketing dating the history of marketing thought is just as problematic as the history of markting practice marketing historians cannot agree on how to date the beginnings of marketing thought eric shaw for instance suggests that a period of preacademic marketing thought can be identified prior to  other historians on the other hand suggest that the theory of marketing only emerged in the th century when the discipline began to offer courses at universities nevertheless the birth of marketing as a discipline is usually designated to the first decade of the twentieth century when marketing courses appeared in universities in  the university of michigan offered what many believe to be the very first course in marketing in the academic year  the university of pennsylvania commenced teaching marketing other universities soon followed including the harvard business school prior to the emergence of marketing courses marketing was treated as a branch of economics and was often called applied economics early marketing theories were described as modifications or adaptations of economic theories a periodisation approachedit several scholars have attempted to describe the evolution of marketing thought chronologically and to connect it with broader intellectual and academic trends bartels  sketched an account of marketings formative periods and shah and gardner  briefly considered the development of the six dominant schools in contemporary marketing however these initial attempts have been described as descriptive savitt  one of the first theorists to consider the stages in the development of marketing thought was robert bartels who in the the history of marketing thought  used a periodisation approach he categorised the development of marketing theory decade by decade from the beginning of the th century s discovery of basic concepts and their exploration s conceptualisation classification and definition of terms s integration on the basis of principles s development of specialisation and variation in theory s reappraisal in the light of new demands and a more scientific approach s reconceptualisation in the light of managerialism social development and quantitative approaches s differentiation on bases such as managerialism holism environmentalism systems and internationalism s socialisation the adaptation of marketing to social change a schools of thought approachedit other marketing historians have eschewed the periodisation approach and instead considered whether distinct schools within marketing reflect different facets of common theory and whether a more unifying intellectual structure has emerged these approaches tend to identify distinct schools of thought a school of thought refers to an intellectual tradition or a group of scholars who share a common philosophy or set of ideas marketing historians shaw and jones define a school of thought as one that has a substantial body of knowledge developed by a number of scholars and describing at least one aspect of the what how who why when and where of performing marketing activities  of those who identify schools there is no real agreement about which schools were dominant at different stages in marketings development it should be noted that two or more schools of thought can coexist at the same time in the following section a brief overview of the contributions of key thinkers will be outlined with respect to the prevailing schools that have dominated marketing thought to a certain extent there is some agreement that in early marketing thought three socalled traditional schools namely the commodity school the functional school and the institutional school coexisted marketing historians such as eric shaw and barton a weitz point to the publication of wroe aldersons book marketing behavior and executive action  as a breakpoint in the history of marketing thought moving from the macro functionsinstitutionscommodities approach to a micromarketing management paradigm following on from alderson marketing began to incorporate other fields of knowledge besides economics notably behavioral science becoming a multidisciplinary field for some scholars aldersons book marks the beginning of the marketing management era hunt and goolsby identified four schools of thought that have dominated marketing namely the commodity school the institutional school the functional school and the managerial school the commodity school a focus on different types of goods in the marketplace and how they are marketed the institutional school emphasised the functions of middlemen or intermediaries similar to the functional school but with a focus on channel flows the functional school a focus on the characteristics of marketing identifying the functions and systems of marketing adopts a systems approach the managerial school a focus on the problems faced by marketing managers focuses on the perspective of the seller some marketing historians like jagdish sheth have identified the modern marketing schools as the managerial school emerged during the late s and became arguably the predominant and most influential school of thought in the field the consumerbuyer behavior school which dominated the academic field in the second half of the twentieth century apart from the managerial school features theories emerging from behavioral science the social exchange school which focuses on exchange as the fundamental concept of marketing yet other commentators identify a broader range of schools omalley and lichrou for example document the schools as functional what activities does marketing perform focus on intermediaries and value adding commodities how are goods classified focus on classification of goods trade flows marketing institutions who performs marketing functions on commodities focus on retailers wholesalers intermediaries distribution channels marketing management how should marketers and managers market products and services to consumers business firm as seller supplier marketing systems what is a marketing system and how does it work channels of distribution and aggregate systems consumer behaviour how and why do consumers buy organisational buyer and consumer buyer macromarketing how do marketing systems impact on society industries channels consumer movement environmentalism exchange what are the forms of exchange who are the parties to the exchange process aggregations of buyers and sellers marketing history when did marketing practice and ideas emerge and evolve marketing thought and marketing practice brief description of the dominant schools of thoughtedit the following sections briefly outlines the schools of thought as conceptualised by key thinkers in the discipline marketing managementedit the marketing management school which emerged as the dominant school in  following the publication of basic marketing a managerial approach written by e jerome mccarthy replaced the socalled functional school which had been the dominant for the first part of the twentieth century in the words of hunt and goolsby the publication of mccarthys text sounded the beginning of the end for the functional school  however hunt and goolsby note that the s was a transitional period in which both the functional school and the managerial school coexisted shaw and jones have described the emergence of the managerial school in the mid twentieth century as a paradigm shift  key works in the marketing management

marketplace pictured la boqueria barcelona spain the moorish bazaar the study of the history of marketing as a discipline is meaningful because it helps to define the baselines upon which change can be recognized and understand how the discipline evolves in response to those changes the practice of marketing has been known for millennia but the term marketing used to describe commercial activities buying and selling a products or services came into popular use in the late nineteenth century the study of the history of marketing as an academic field emerged in the early twentieth century marketers tend to distinguish between the history of marketing practice and the history of marketing thought a the history of marketing practice refers to an investigation into the ways that marketing has been practiced and how those practices have evolved over time as they respond to changing socioeconomic conditions b the history of marketing thought refers to an examination of the ways that marketing has been studied and taught although the history of marketing thought and the history of marketing practice are distinct fields of study they intersect at different junctures marketing practitioners engage in innovative practices that capture the attention of marketing scholars who codify and disseminate such practices at the same time marketing academics often develop new research methods or theories that are subsequently adopted by practitioners thus developments in marketing theory inform marketing practice and vice versa the history of marketing will remain incomplete if one disassociates academia from practitioners the publication in  of robert keiths article the marketing revolution was a pioneering work in the study of the history of marketing practice and in  the publication of robert bartels book the history of marketing thought marked a turningpoint in the understanding of how marketing theory evolved since it first emerged as a separate discipline around

label communicating information about region of origin the name of the producer and may have carried product quality claims according to etymologists the term marketing first appeared in dictionaries in the sixteenth century where it referred to the process of buying and selling at a market the contemporary definition of marketing as a process of moving goods from producer to consumer with an emphasis on sales and advertising first appeared in dictionaries in  the term marketing is a derivation of the latin word mercatus meaning market or merchant historians of marketing tend to fall into two distinct branches of marketing history  the history of marketing practice and the history of marketing thought these branches are often deeply divided these branches have very different roots the history of marketing practice is based in management and marketing studies while the history of marketing thought is based in economic and cultural history this means that they ask very different types of research questions and employ different research tools and frameworks historians of marketing have undertaken considerable investigation into the emergence of marketing yet there is little agreement about when marketing first began some researchers argue that marketing practices can be found in antiquity  while others suggest that marketing in its modern form emerged in conjunction with the rise of consumer culture in seventeenth and eighteenth century europe  while yet other researchers suggest that modern marketing was only fully realised in the decades following the industrial revolution in britain from where it subsequently spread to europe and north america hollander and others have suggested that the different dates for the emergence of marketing can be explained by problems surrounding the way that marketing has been defined  whether reference to modern marketing as a planned programmed repertoire of professional practice including activities such as segmentation product differentiation positioning and marketing communications versus marketing as a simple form distribution and exchange marketing in antiquityedit mosaic showing garum container from the house of umbricius scaurus of pompeii the inscription which reads gari flos scombri scauri ex officina scauri has been translated as the flower of garum made of the mackerel a product of scaurus from the shop of scaurus a number of studies have found evidence of advertising branding packaging and labelling in antiquity umbricius scauras for example was a manufacturer of fish sauce also known as garum in pompeii circa  ce mosaic patterns in the atrium of his house were decorated with images of amphora bearing his personal brand and quality claims the mosaic comprises four different amphora one at each corner of the atrium and bearing labels as follows  gari flos scom scauri ex officina scauri translated as the flower of garum made of the mackerel a product of scaurus from the shop of scaurus  liquminis flos translated as the flower of liquamen  gari flos scombri scauri translated as the flower of garum made of the mackerel a product of scaurus  liquamen optimum ex officina scauri translated as the best liquamen from the shop of scaurus the reputation of scauras fish sauce was known to be of very high quality across the mediterannean and its reputation travelled as far away as modern france curtis has described this mosaic as a an advertisement and a rare unequivocal example of a motif inspired by a patron rather than by the artist  in pompeii and nearby herculaneum archeaological evidence also points to evidence of branding and labelling in relatively common use wine jars for example were stamped with names such as lassius and l eumachius probably references to the name of the producer carbonized loaves of bread found at herculaneum indicate that some bakers stamped their bread with the producers name david wengrow has argued that branding became necessary following the urban revolution in ancient mesopotamia in the th century bce when largescale economies started massproducing commodities such as alcoholic drinks cosmetics and textiles these ancient societies imposed strict forms of quality control over commodities and also needed to convey value to the consumer through branding producers began by attaching simple stone seals to products which over time were transformed into clay seals bearing impressed images often associated with the producers personal identity thus giving the product a personality diana twede has argued that the consumer packaging functions of protection utility and communication have been necessary whenever packages were the object of transactions pÂ  she has shown that amphoras used in mediterranean trade between  and  bce exhibited a wide variety of shapes and markings which provided information for transactions systematic use of stamped labels dates from around the fourth century bce in a largely preliterate society the shape of the amphora and its pictorial markings conveyed information about the contents region of origin and even the identity of the producer which were understood to convey information about product quality not all historians agree that these markings can be compared with modern brands or labels moore and reid for example have argued that the distinctive shapes and markings in ancient containers should be termed protobrands rather than modern brands marketing in the middle agesedit market scene by pieter aertsen c in england and europe during the middle ages market towns sprang up some analysts have suggested that the term marketing may have first been used in the context of market towns where the term marketing may have been used by producers to describe the process of carting and selling their produce and wares in market towns blintiff has investigated the early medieval networks of market towns and suggests that by the th century there was an upsurge in the number of market towns and the emergence of merchant circuits as traders bulked up surpluses from smaller regional different day markets and resold them at the larger centralised market towns braudel and reynold have made a systematic study of these european market towns between the thirteenth and fifteenth century their investigation shows that in regional districts markets were held once or twice a week while daily markets were more common in the larger cities and towns over time permanent shops began to open daily and gradually supplanted the periodic markets peddlers filled in the gaps in distribution by travelling doortodoor selling produce and wares the physical market was characterised by transactional exchange and the economy was characterised by local trading braudel reports that in  goods travelled relatively short distances  grain â miles cattle â miles wool and wollen cloth â miles however following the european age of discovery goods were imported from afar  calico cloth from india porcelain silk and tea from china spices from india and southeast asia and tobacco sugar rum and coffee from the new world bronze plate for printing an advertisement for the liu family needle shop at jinan song dynasty china it is considered the worlds earliest identified printed advertising medium although the rise of consumer culture and marketing in britain and europe have been studied extensively less is known about developments elsewhere nevertheless recent research suggests that china exhibited a rich history of early marketing practices including branding packaging advertising and retail signage from as early as  bce chinese packaging and branding was used to signal family place names and product quality and the use of government imposed product branding was used between  and  ad eckhart and bengtsson have argued that during the song dynasty â chinese society developed a consumerist culture where a high level of consumption was attainable for a wide variety of ordinary consumers rather than just the elite pÂ  the rise of a consumer culture led to the commercial investment in carefully managed company image retail signage symbolic brands trademark protection and the brand concepts of baoji hao lei gongpin piazi and pinpai which roughly equate with western concepts of family status quality grading and upholding traditional chinese values pÂ  eckhardt and bengtssons analysis suggests that brands emerged in china as a result of the social needs and tensions implicit in consumer culture in which brands provide social status and stratification thus the evolution of brands in china stands in sharp contrast to the west where manufacturers pushed brands onto the market in order to differentiate increase market share and ultimately profits pp â marketing in seventeenth and eighteenth century europeedit josiah wedgewoods th century techniques exhibited many of the characteristics of modern marketing scholars have identified specific instances of marketing practices in england and europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries as trade between countries or regions grew companies required information on which to base business decisions individuals and companies carried out formal and informal research on trade conditions in  johann fugger travelled from augsburg to graben in order to gather information on the international textile industry he exchanged detailed letters on trade conditions in relevant areas in the early s british industrial houses were demanding information that could be used for business decisions during this period daniel defoe a london merchant published information on trade and economic resources of england and scotland defoe was a prolific publisher and among his many publications are titles devoted to trade including trade of britain stated  trade of scotland with france  and the trade to india critically and calmly considered  all books that were highly popular with merchants and business houses of the period while such activities might now be recognised as marketing research at that time they were known as commercial research or commercial intelligence and not seen as part of the repertoire of activities that make up contemporary marketing practice in a major review of consumer society mckendrick brewer and plumb found extensive evidence of eighteenth century english entrepreneurs using modern marketing techniques including product differentiation sales promotion and loss leader pricing english industrialists josiah wedgewood and matthew boulton are often portrayed as pioneers of modern mass marketing methods wedgewood was known to have used marketing techniques such as direct mail travelling salesmen and catalogues in the eighteenth century wedgewood also carried out serious investigations into the fixed and variable costs of production and recognised that increased production would lead to lower unit costs he also inferred that selling at lower prices would lead to higher demand and recognised the value of achieving scale economies in production by cutting costs and lowering prices wedgewood was able to generate higher overall profits similarly one of wedgewoods contemporaries matthew boulton pioneered early mass production techniques and product differentiation at his soho manufactory in the s he also practiced planned obsolescence and understood the importance of celebrity marketing  that is supplying the nobility often at prices below cost and of obtaining royal patronage for the sake of the publicity and cudos generated fullerton argues that the practice of market segmentation emerged well before marketers used the notion formally  certain strands of evidence suggest that simple examples of market segmentation were evident prior to the s the business historian richard s tedlow argues that any attempt to segment markets prior to  was highly fragmented since the economy was characterised by small regional suppliers who mostly sold goods on a local or regional basis  when retail shops began to appear from the th century retailers needed to separate the riff raff from wealthier customers outside the major metropolitan cities few stores could afford to serve one type of clientele exclusively however gradually retail shops introduced innovations that would allow them to separate wealthier customers from the riff raff one technique was to have a window opening out onto the street from which customers could be served this allowed the sale of goods to the common people without encouraging them to come inside another solution that came into vogue from the late sixteenth century was to invite favoured customers into a backroom of the store where goods were permanently on display yet another technique that emerged around the same time was to hold a showcase of goods in the shopkeepers private home for the benefit of wealthier clients samuel pepys for example writing in  describes being invited to the home of a retailer to view a wooden jack the eighteenth century english entrepreneurs josiah wedgewood and matthew boulton both staged expansive showcases of their wares in their private residences or in rented halls evidence of early marketing segmentation have also been noted across europe a study of the german book trade found examples of both product differentiation and market segmentation in the s marketing in the nineteenth and twentieth centuriesedit henry ford began manufacturing the massproduced model t in  ford famously said that customers could own a car in any colour as long as it was black until the nineteenth century western economies were characterised by small regional suppliers who sold goods on a local or regional basis however as transportation systems improved from the mid nineteenth century the economy became more unified allowing companies to distribute standardised branded goods a national level this gave rise to a much broader mass marketing mindset manufacturers tended to insist on strict standardisation in order to achieve scale economies with a view to keeping production costs down and also to achieving market penetration in the early stages of a products life cycle the model t ford was an example of a product being manufactured at a price that was affordable for the burgeoning middle classes havenmason hall at the university of michigan where the first academic course in marketing was taught in the early twentieth century as market size increased it became more commonplace for manufacturers to produce a variety of models pitched at different quality points designed to meet the needs of various demographic and lifestyle market segments giving rise to the widespread practice of market segmentation and product differentation between   george b waldron working at mahins advertising agency used tax registers city directories and census data to show advertisers the proportion of educated versus illiterate consumers and the earning capacity of different occupations in what is believed to be the first example of demographic segmentation of a population within little more than a decade paul cherington had developed the abcd household typology  the first sociodemographic segmentation tool when wendell r smith published his now classic article product differentiation and market segmentation as alternative marketing strategies in  he noted that he was simply documenting marketing practices that had been observed for some time and which he described as a natural force other theorists agree that smith was simply codifying implicit knowledge that had been used in marketing and brand management from the early twentieth century as industry grew the demand for skilled business professionals also grew to meet this demand universities began offering courses in commerce economics and marketing marketing as a discipline was first taught in universities in the very early twentieth century however researchers only became interested in investigating the history of marketing in the mid twentieth century from the outset researchers tended to identify two strands of historical research the history of marketing practice  and the history of marketing thought which was fundamentally concerned with the rise of marketing education and dissecting the way that marketing was taught and studied early historical studies were primarily descriptive history of marketing practiceedit the practice of marketing may have been carried out for millennia but the modern concept of marketing as a professional practice appears to have emerged the post industrial corporate world in addition to the studies of specific cultures or time periods discussed in the preceding section some historians of marketing have sought to write more general histories of marketings evolution in the modern era to do this historians often turn to a method known as periodisation periodisation refers to the process or study of categorizing the past into discrete quantified named units for the purpose of analysis or study a key question that has preoccupied researchers is whether specific orientations or mindsets that inform key periods of marketings evolution can be identified marketers disagree about the precise periods that outline marketing practice and describe the way that marketing practice has evolved over time orientations or philosophies that inform marketing practiceedit in the marketing literature continuing debate surrounds the orientations or philosophies that might have informed marketing practice at different periods of time an orientation may be defind as the type of activity or subject that an organization seems most interested in and gives most attention to  in relation to marketing orientations the term has been defined as a philosophy of business management  or a corporate state of mind  or as an organisational culture  hollander et al have identified fourteen different stage theories or short periodisations as well as a total of nineteen long periodisations that have been carried out since  of these the contributions of robert keith  and ronald fullerton  are the most frequently cited keiths periodisationedit robert keiths marketing eras production âselling âmarketing were based entirely on his experience at the pillsbury company in  robert keith the then vice president of pillsbury set the stage for decades of controversy when he published an article entitled the marketing revolution in which he set out the way that the pillsbury company had shifted from a focus on production in the s through to a consumer focus in the s he traced three distinct eras in pillsburys evolution the production oriented era from  s  characterised by a focus on production processes the sales oriented era from the s to the s  characterised by investment in research to develop new products and advertising to persuade markets of product benefits the marketing oriented era from the beginning of the s  characterised by a focus on the customers latent and existing needs in addition keith hypothesised that a marketing control era was about to emerge although keiths article explicitly documented pillsburys evolution the article appears to suggest that the stages observed at pillsbury constitute a standard or normal evolutionary path productionâsalesâmarketing for most large organisations keiths notion of distinct eras in the evolution of marketing practice has been widely criticised and his periodisation described as hopelessly flawed specific criticisms of keiths tripartite periodisation include that it ignores historical facts about business conditions  it misstates the nature of supply and demand  it slights the growth of marketing institutions  the article which is entirely based on keiths personal recollections and did not use a single reference is best described as anecdotal systematic studies carried out since keiths work have failed to replicate keiths periodisation instead other studies suggest that many companies exhibited a marketing orientation in the nineteenth century and that the business schools were teaching marketing decades before pillsbury adopted a marketing oriented approach jones and richardson also investigated historical accounts of marketing practice and found evidence for both the sales and marketing era during the socalled production era and concluded that there was no marketing revolution  a detailed study of the chocolate manufacturer rowntree found that this company had shifted from a production orientation through to a marketing orientation by the s without having transitioned through the socalled sales orientation other critiques of keiths work have pointed out that the socalled production era fails to align with historical facts and have suggested that it is a myth keiths eras have become known somewhat cynically as the standard chronology fullertons periodisationedit the english industrial revolution is often seen as a trigger for the rise of modern marketing in  fullerton developed a more subtle and nuanced periodisation for the socalled marketing eras fullertons eras were the era of antecedents    a long gestational period in which people were largely selfsufficient and rural economy characterised by low levels of consumption commerce was seen as suspicious the era of origins   precipitated by the dislocations of the english industrial revolution and the rise of a more urban population this era is characterised by more attention to persuasive tactics designed to stimulate demand the era of institutional development   many of the large institutions and modern marketing practices emerged during this period the era of refinement and formalisation âpresent   further development and refinement of principles and practices developed in the preceding period in spite of the intense criticism levelled at keiths eras of marketing practice his periodisation is the most frequently cited in textbooks  and has become the accepted wisdom one content analysis of  introductory and advanced texts found that keiths eras were reproduced in all but four another study which examined  of the top selling marketing texts found that the although the incidence of repeating keiths eras was waning it had not been replaced by fullertons periodisation nor any other more meaningful framework other periodisationsedit for all the controversies surrounding the socalled marketing stages or periods keith and others appear to have contributed a lasting legacy a study by grundey  suggests that many contemporary textbooks begin with keiths eras and expand on it by including newer concepts such as the societal marketing concept the relationship marketing concept and the interfunctional concept as shown in the table below more recently kotler and keller added the holistic marketing concept to the list of eras in marketing marketing theorists continue to debate whether the holistic era represents a genuine new orientation or whether it is an extension of the marketing concept grundey summarised five different periodisations in the history of marketing as shown in the following table as a means of highlighting the general lack of agreement among scholars marketing philosophies or orientations cited in

millennium scientific bulletin â economic sciences marketing commerce and tourism vol  no   pÂ  brief description of the most commonly cited periodsedit the general lack of agreement amongst scholars as to what constitutes clearly identifiable periods and the orientation that characterised each distinct period has spawned a lengthy list of orientations space prevents an exhaustive description of all periods or eras however the most commonly cited periods appear in the following section production orientationedit the production orientation is one of the oldest philosophies that guides sellers a production orientation is often proposed as the first of the socalled orientations that dominated business thought keith dated the production era from the s to the s but other theorists argue that evidence of the production orientation can still be found in some companies or industries specifically kotler and armstrong note that the production philosophy is one of the oldest philosophies that guides sellers and is still useful in some situations  the production orientation is characterised by a focus on production manufacturing and efficiency attainment of economies of scale economies of scope experience effects or all three an assumption that demand exceeds supply a mindset that is encapsulated by says law supply creates its own demand or if somebody makes a product somebody else will want to buy it limited research  and largely limited to technicalproduct research rather than customer research this orientation rose to prominence in an environment which had a shortage of manufactured goods relative to demand so goods sold easily minimal promotion and advertising marketing communications limited to raising awareness of the products existence selling orientationedit the sales orientation often characterised by doortodoor selling is thought to have begun during the great depression of the s and continues to this day pictured a rawleighs salesman in  the selling orientation is thought to have begun during the great depression and continued well into the s although examples of this orientation can still be found today kotler et al note that the selling concept is typically practised with unsought goods  the selling orientation is characterised by aggressive selling to push products often involving doortodoor selling accepting every possible sale or booking regardless of its suitability for the business has a strongly transactional focus ignores potential relationships the marketing orientationedit the marketing orientation or the marketing concept emerged in the s characteristics of the marketing orientation a thorough understanding of the customers needs wants and behaviours should be the focal point of all marketing decisions marketing efforts sales advertising product management pricing should be integrated and in tune with the customer new product concepts should flow from extensive market analysis and product testing the societal marketing conceptedit main article societal marketing societal marketing orientation or societal marketing concept was first proposed in the s  by phillip kotler in an article published in the harvard business review the societal marketing concept adopts the position that marketers have a greater social responsibility than simply satisfying customers and providing them with superior value instead marketing activities should strive to benefit societys overall wellbeing marketing organisations that have embraced the societal marketing concept typically identify key stakeholder groups including employees customers local communities the wider public and government they ensure that marketing activities do not damage the environment and are not hazardous to broader society societal marketing developed into sustainable marketing characteristics of societal marketing an attempt to balance corporate commitments to groups and individuals in its environment including customers other businesses employees and investors companies must include social and ethical considerations into their marketing practices consideration is given to the environment includes problems such as air water and land pollution consideration is given to consumer rights unfair pricing and ethics in advertising relationship orientationedit main article relationship marketing starting in the s a new stage of marketing emerged called relationship marketing the focus of relationship marketing is on a longterm relationship that benefits both the company and the customer the relationship is based on trust and commitment and both companies tend to shift their operating activities to be able to work more efficiently together one of the most prominent reasons for relationship marketing comes from kotlers idea that it costs about five times more to obtain a new customer than to maintain the relationship with an existing customer a relationship marketing approach seeks to maximise the value of all the potential exchanges an organisation could have into the future the characteristics of relationship marketing include a focus on the relationship between seller and buyer an investment in the lifetime of relationships customer lifetime value rather than single transactions an orientation on product benefits andor customer value high customer service high customer commitment high customer contact quality is the concern of all all activities are coordinated with the customer interface including the customers involvement in the firmâs processes customised offerings where practical empirical support for relationship marketing as a distinct paradigm is very weak one study suggests that relationship marketing is really a subcomponent of large scale movements of the valueadded process rather than a separate era or framework some theorists suggest that marketing is moving from a relationship marketing paradigm and towards a social media paradigm where marketers have access to a more controlled environment and are able to customise offers and communications messages history of marketing thoughtedit university of pennsylvania was among the first universities to offer courses in marketing dating the history of marketing thought is just as problematic as the history of markting practice marketing historians cannot agree on how to date the beginnings of marketing thought eric shaw for instance suggests that a period of preacademic marketing thought can be identified prior to  other historians on the other hand suggest that the theory of marketing only emerged in the th century when the discipline began to offer courses at universities nevertheless the birth of marketing as a discipline is usually designated to the first decade of the twentieth century when marketing courses appeared in universities in  the university of michigan offered what many believe to be the very first course in marketing in the academic year  the university of pennsylvania commenced teaching marketing other universities soon followed including the harvard business school prior to the emergence of marketing courses marketing was treated as a branch of economics and was often called applied economics early marketing theories were described as modifications or adaptations of economic theories a periodisation approachedit several scholars have attempted to describe the evolution of marketing thought chronologically and to connect it with broader intellectual and academic trends bartels  sketched an account of marketings formative periods and shah and gardner  briefly considered the development of the six dominant schools in contemporary marketing however these initial attempts have been described as descriptive savitt  one of the first theorists to consider the stages in the development of marketing thought was robert bartels who in the the history of marketing thought  used a periodisation approach he categorised the development of marketing theory decade by decade from the beginning of the th century s discovery of basic concepts and their exploration s conceptualisation classification and definition of terms s integration on the basis of principles s development of specialisation and variation in theory s reappraisal in the light of new demands and a more scientific approach s reconceptualisation in the light of managerialism social development and quantitative approaches s differentiation on bases such as managerialism holism environmentalism systems and internationalism s socialisation the adaptation of marketing to social change a schools of thought approachedit other marketing historians have eschewed the periodisation approach and instead considered whether distinct schools within marketing reflect different facets of common theory and whether a more unifying intellectual structure has emerged these approaches tend to identify distinct schools of thought a school of thought refers to an intellectual tradition or a group of scholars who share a common philosophy or set of ideas marketing historians shaw and jones define a school of thought as one that has a substantial body of knowledge developed by a number of scholars and describing at least one aspect of the what how who why when and where of performing marketing activities  of those who identify schools there is no real agreement about which schools were dominant at different stages in marketings development it should be noted that two or more schools of thought can coexist at the same time in the following section a brief overview of the contributions of key thinkers will be outlined with respect to the prevailing schools that have dominated marketing thought to a certain extent there is some agreement that in early marketing thought three socalled traditional schools namely the commodity school the functional school and the institutional school coexisted marketing historians such as eric shaw and barton a weitz point to the publication of wroe aldersons book marketing behavior and executive action  as a breakpoint in the history of marketing thought moving from the macro functionsinstitutionscommodities approach to a micromarketing management paradigm following on from alderson marketing began to incorporate other fields of knowledge besides economics notably behavioral science becoming a multidisciplinary field for some scholars aldersons book marks the beginning of the marketing management era hunt and goolsby identified four schools of thought that have dominated marketing namely the commodity school the institutional school the functional school and the managerial school the commodity school a focus on different types of goods in the marketplace and how they are marketed the institutional school emphasised the functions of middlemen or intermediaries similar to the functional school but with a focus on channel flows the functional school a focus on the characteristics of marketing identifying the functions and systems of marketing adopts a systems approach the managerial school a focus on the problems faced by marketing managers focuses on the perspective of the seller some marketing historians like jagdish sheth have identified the modern marketing schools as the managerial school emerged during the late s and became arguably the predominant and most influential school of thought in the field the consumerbuyer behavior school which dominated the academic field in the second half of the twentieth century apart from the

marketplace pictured la boqueria barcelona spain the moorish bazaar the study of the history of marketing as a discipline is meaningful because it helps to define the baselines upon which change can be recognized and understand how the discipline evolves in response to those changes the practice of marketing has been known for millennia but the term marketing used to describe commercial activities buying and selling a products or services came into popular use in the late nineteenth century the study of the history of marketing as an academic field emerged in the early twentieth century marketers tend to distinguish between the history of marketing practice and the history of marketing thought a the history of marketing practice refers to an investigation into the ways that marketing has been practiced and how those practices have evolved over time as they respond to changing socioeconomic conditions b the history of marketing thought refers to an examination of the ways that marketing has been studied and taught although the history of marketing thought and the history of marketing practice are distinct fields of study they intersect at different junctures marketing practitioners engage in innovative practices that capture the attention of marketing scholars who codify and disseminate such practices at the same time marketing academics often develop new research methods or theories that are subsequently adopted by practitioners thus developments in marketing theory inform marketing practice and vice versa the history of marketing will remain incomplete if one disassociates academia from practitioners the publication in  of robert keiths article the marketing revolution was a pioneering work in the study of the history of marketing practice and in  the publication of robert bartels book the history of marketing thought marked a turningpoint in the understanding of how marketing theory evolved since it first emerged as a separate discipline around

label communicating information about region of origin the name of the producer and may have carried product quality claims according to etymologists the term marketing first appeared in dictionaries in the sixteenth century where it referred to the process of buying and selling at a market the contemporary definition of marketing as a process of moving goods from producer to consumer with an emphasis on sales and advertising first appeared in dictionaries in  the term marketing is a derivation of the latin word mercatus meaning market or merchant historians of marketing tend to fall into two distinct branches of marketing history  the history of marketing practice and the history of marketing thought these branches are often deeply divided these branches have very different roots the history of marketing practice is based in management and marketing studies while the history of marketing thought is based in economic and cultural history this means that they ask very different types of research questions and employ different research tools and frameworks historians of marketing have undertaken considerable investigation into the emergence of marketing yet there is little agreement about when marketing first began some researchers argue that marketing practices can be found in antiquity  while others suggest that marketing in its modern form emerged in conjunction with the rise of consumer culture in seventeenth and eighteenth century europe  while yet other researchers suggest that modern marketing was only fully realised in the decades following the industrial revolution in britain from where it subsequently spread to europe and north america hollander and others have suggested that the different dates for the emergence of marketing can be explained by problems surrounding the way that marketing has been defined  whether reference to modern marketing as a planned programmed repertoire of professional practice including activities such as segmentation product differentiation positioning and marketing communications versus marketing as a simple form distribution and exchange marketing in antiquityedit mosaic showing garum container from the house of umbricius scaurus of pompeii the inscription which reads gari flos scombri scauri ex officina scauri has been translated as the flower of garum made of the mackerel a product of scaurus from the shop of scaurus a number of studies have found evidence of advertising branding packaging and labelling in antiquity umbricius scauras for example was a manufacturer of fish sauce also known as garum in pompeii circa  ce mosaic patterns in the atrium of his house were decorated with images of amphora bearing his personal brand and quality claims the mosaic comprises four different amphora one at each corner of the atrium and bearing labels as follows  gari flos scom scauri ex officina scauri translated as the flower of garum made of the mackerel a product of scaurus from the shop of scaurus  liquminis flos translated as the flower of liquamen  gari flos scombri scauri translated as the flower of garum made of the mackerel a product of scaurus  liquamen optimum ex officina scauri translated as the best liquamen from the shop of scaurus the reputation of scauras fish sauce was known to be of very high quality across the mediterannean and its reputation travelled as far away as modern france curtis has described this mosaic as a an advertisement and a rare unequivocal example of a motif inspired by a patron rather than by the artist  in pompeii and nearby herculaneum archeaological evidence also points to evidence of branding and labelling in relatively common use wine jars for example were stamped with names such as lassius and l eumachius probably references to the name of the producer carbonized loaves of bread found at herculaneum indicate that some bakers stamped their bread with the producers name david wengrow has argued that branding became necessary following the urban revolution in ancient mesopotamia in the th century bce when largescale economies started massproducing commodities such as alcoholic drinks cosmetics and textiles these ancient societies imposed strict forms of quality control over commodities and also needed to convey value to the consumer through branding producers began by attaching simple stone seals to products which over time were transformed into clay seals bearing impressed images often associated with the producers personal identity thus giving the product a personality diana twede has argued that the consumer packaging functions of protection utility and communication have been necessary whenever packages were the object of transactions pÂ  she has shown that amphoras used in mediterranean trade between  and  bce exhibited a wide variety of shapes and markings which provided information for transactions systematic use of stamped labels dates from around the fourth century bce in a largely preliterate society the shape of the amphora and its pictorial markings conveyed information about the contents region of origin and even the identity of the producer which were understood to convey information about product quality not all historians agree that these markings can be compared with modern brands or labels moore and reid for example have argued that the distinctive shapes and markings in ancient containers should be termed protobrands rather than modern brands marketing in the middle agesedit market scene by pieter aertsen c in england and europe during the middle ages market towns sprang up some analysts have suggested that the term marketing may have first been used in the context of market towns where the term marketing may have been used by producers to describe the process of carting and selling their produce and wares in market towns blintiff has investigated the early medieval networks of market towns and suggests that by the th century there was an upsurge in the number of market towns and the emergence of merchant circuits as traders bulked up surpluses from smaller regional different day markets and resold them at the larger centralised market towns braudel and reynold have made a systematic study of these european market towns between the thirteenth and fifteenth century their investigation shows that in regional districts markets were held once or twice a week while daily markets were more common in the larger cities and towns over time permanent shops began to open daily and gradually supplanted the periodic markets peddlers filled in the gaps in distribution by travelling doortodoor selling produce and wares the physical market was characterised by transactional exchange and the economy was characterised by local trading braudel reports that in  goods travelled relatively short distances  grain â miles cattle â miles wool and wollen cloth â miles however following the european age of discovery goods were imported from afar  calico cloth from india porcelain silk and tea from china spices from india and southeast asia and tobacco sugar rum and coffee from the new world bronze plate for printing an advertisement for the liu family needle shop at jinan song dynasty china it is considered the worlds earliest identified printed advertising medium although the rise of consumer culture and marketing in britain and europe have been studied extensively less is known about developments elsewhere nevertheless recent research suggests that china exhibited a rich history of early marketing practices including branding packaging advertising and retail signage from as early as  bce chinese packaging and branding was used to signal family place names and product quality and the use of government imposed product branding was used between  and  ad eckhart and bengtsson have argued that during the song dynasty â chinese society developed a consumerist culture where a high level of consumption was attainable for a wide variety of ordinary consumers rather than just the elite pÂ  the rise of a consumer culture led to the commercial investment in carefully managed company image retail signage symbolic brands trademark protection and the brand concepts of baoji hao lei gongpin piazi and pinpai which roughly equate with western concepts of family status quality grading and upholding traditional chinese values pÂ  eckhardt and bengtssons analysis suggests that brands emerged in china as a result of the social needs and tensions implicit in consumer culture in which brands provide social status and stratification thus the evolution of brands in china stands in sharp contrast to the west where manufacturers pushed brands onto the market in order to differentiate increase market share and ultimately profits pp â marketing in seventeenth and eighteenth century europeedit josiah wedgewoods th century techniques exhibited many of the characteristics of modern marketing scholars have identified specific instances of marketing practices in england and europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries as trade between countries or regions grew companies required information on which to base business decisions individuals and companies carried out formal and informal research on trade conditions in  johann fugger travelled from augsburg to graben in order to gather information on the international textile industry he exchanged detailed letters on trade conditions in relevant areas in the early s british industrial houses were demanding information that could be used for business decisions during this period daniel defoe a london merchant published information on trade and economic resources of england and scotland defoe was a prolific publisher and among his many publications are titles devoted to trade including trade of britain stated  trade of scotland with france  and the trade to india critically and calmly considered  all books that were highly popular with merchants and business houses of the period while such activities might now be recognised as marketing research at that time they were known as commercial research or commercial intelligence and not seen as part of the repertoire of activities that make up contemporary marketing practice in a major review of consumer society mckendrick brewer and plumb found extensive evidence of eighteenth century english entrepreneurs using modern marketing techniques including product differentiation sales promotion and loss leader pricing english industrialists josiah wedgewood and matthew boulton are often portrayed as pioneers of modern mass marketing methods wedgewood was known to have used marketing techniques such as direct mail travelling salesmen and catalogues in the eighteenth century wedgewood also carried out serious investigations into the fixed and variable costs of production and recognised that increased production would lead to lower unit costs he also inferred that selling at lower prices would lead to higher demand and recognised the value of achieving scale economies in production by cutting costs and lowering prices wedgewood was able to generate higher overall profits similarly one of wedgewoods contemporaries matthew boulton pioneered early mass production techniques and product differentiation at his soho manufactory in the s he also practiced planned obsolescence and understood the importance of celebrity marketing  that is supplying the nobility often at prices below cost and of obtaining royal patronage for the sake of the publicity and cudos generated fullerton argues that the practice of market segmentation emerged well before marketers used the notion formally  certain strands of evidence suggest that simple examples of market segmentation were evident prior to the s the business historian richard s tedlow argues that any attempt to segment markets prior to  was highly fragmented since the economy was characterised by small regional suppliers who mostly sold goods on a local or regional basis  when retail shops began to appear from the th century retailers needed to separate the riff raff from wealthier customers outside the major metropolitan cities few stores could afford to serve one type of clientele exclusively however gradually retail shops introduced innovations that would allow them to separate wealthier customers from the riff raff one technique was to have a window opening out onto the street from which customers could be served this allowed the sale of goods to the common people without encouraging them to come inside another solution that came into vogue from the late sixteenth century was to invite favoured customers into a backroom of the store where goods were permanently on display yet another technique that emerged around the same time was to hold a showcase of goods in the shopkeepers private home for the benefit of wealthier clients samuel pepys for example writing in  describes being invited to the home of a retailer to view a wooden jack the eighteenth century english entrepreneurs josiah wedgewood and matthew boulton both staged expansive showcases of their wares in their private residences or in rented halls evidence of early marketing segmentation have also been noted across europe a study of the german book trade found examples of both product differentiation and market segmentation in the s marketing in the nineteenth and twentieth centuriesedit henry ford began manufacturing the massproduced model t in  ford famously said that customers could own a car in any colour as long as it was black until the nineteenth century western economies were characterised by small regional suppliers who sold goods on a local or regional basis however as transportation systems improved from the mid nineteenth century the economy became more unified allowing companies to distribute standardised branded goods a national level this gave rise to a much broader mass marketing mindset manufacturers tended to insist on strict standardisation in order to achieve scale economies with a view to keeping production costs down and also to achieving market penetration in the early stages of a products life cycle the model t ford was an example of a product being manufactured at a price that was affordable for the burgeoning middle classes havenmason hall at the university of michigan where the first academic course in marketing was taught in the early twentieth century as market size increased it became more commonplace for manufacturers to produce a variety of models pitched at different quality points designed to meet the needs of various demographic and lifestyle market segments giving rise to the widespread practice of market segmentation and product differentation between   george b waldron working at mahins advertising agency used tax registers city directories and census data to show advertisers the proportion of educated versus illiterate consumers and the earning capacity of different occupations in what is believed to be the first example of demographic segmentation of a population within little more than a decade paul cherington had developed the abcd household typology  the first sociodemographic segmentation tool when wendell r smith published his now classic article product differentiation and market segmentation as alternative marketing strategies in  he noted that he was simply documenting marketing practices that had been observed for some time and which he described as a natural force other theorists agree that smith was simply codifying implicit knowledge that had been used in marketing and brand management from the early twentieth century as industry grew the demand for skilled business professionals also grew to meet this demand universities began offering courses in commerce economics and marketing marketing as a discipline was first taught in universities in the very early twentieth century however researchers only became interested in investigating the history of marketing in the mid twentieth century from the outset researchers tended to identify two strands of historical research the history of marketing practice  and the history of marketing thought which was fundamentally concerned with the rise of marketing education and dissecting the way that marketing was taught and studied early historical studies were primarily descriptive history of marketing practiceedit the practice of marketing may have been carried out for millennia but the modern concept of marketing as a professional practice appears to have emerged the post industrial corporate world in addition to the studies of specific cultures or time periods discussed in the preceding section some historians of marketing have sought to write more general histories of marketings evolution in the modern era to do this historians often turn to a method known as periodisation periodisation refers to the process or study of categorizing the past into discrete quantified named units for the purpose of analysis or study a key question that has preoccupied researchers is whether specific orientations or mindsets that inform key periods of marketings evolution can be identified marketers disagree about the precise periods that outline marketing practice and describe the way that marketing practice has evolved over time orientations or philosophies that inform marketing practiceedit in the marketing literature continuing debate surrounds the orientations or philosophies that might have informed marketing practice at different periods of time an orientation may be defind as the type of activity or subject that an organization seems most interested in and gives most attention to  in relation to marketing orientations the term has been defined as a philosophy of business management  or a corporate state of mind  or as an organisational culture  hollander et al have identified fourteen different stage theories or short periodisations as well as a total of nineteen long periodisations that have been carried out since  of these the contributions of robert keith  and ronald fullerton  are the most frequently cited keiths periodisationedit robert keiths marketing eras production âselling âmarketing were based entirely on his experience at the pillsbury company in  robert keith the then vice president of pillsbury set the stage for decades of controversy when he published an article entitled the marketing revolution in which he set out the way that the pillsbury company had shifted from a focus on production in the s through to a consumer focus in the s he traced three distinct eras in pillsburys evolution the production oriented era from  s  characterised by a focus on production processes the sales oriented era from the s to the s  characterised by investment in research to develop new products and advertising to persuade markets of product benefits the marketing oriented era from the beginning of the s  characterised by a focus on the customers latent and existing needs in addition keith hypothesised that a marketing control era was about to emerge although keiths article explicitly documented pillsburys evolution the article appears to suggest that the stages observed at pillsbury constitute a standard or normal evolutionary path productionâsalesâmarketing for most large organisations keiths notion of distinct eras in the evolution of marketing practice has been widely criticised and his periodisation described as hopelessly flawed specific criticisms of keiths tripartite periodisation include that it ignores historical facts about business conditions  it misstates the nature of supply and demand  it slights the growth of marketing institutions  the article which is entirely based on keiths personal recollections and did not use a single reference is best described as anecdotal systematic studies carried out since keiths work have failed to replicate keiths periodisation instead other studies suggest that many companies exhibited a marketing orientation in the nineteenth century and that the business schools were teaching marketing decades before pillsbury adopted a marketing oriented approach jones and richardson also investigated historical accounts of marketing practice and found evidence for both the sales and marketing era during the socalled production era and concluded that there was no marketing revolution  a detailed study of the chocolate manufacturer rowntree found that this company had shifted from a production orientation through to a marketing orientation by the s without having transitioned through the socalled sales orientation other critiques of keiths work have pointed out that the socalled production era fails to align with historical facts and have suggested that it is a myth keiths eras have become known somewhat cynically as the standard chronology fullertons periodisationedit the english industrial revolution is often seen as a trigger for the rise of modern marketing in  fullerton developed a more subtle and nuanced periodisation for the socalled marketing eras fullertons eras were the era of antecedents    a long gestational period in which people were largely selfsufficient and rural economy characterised by low levels of consumption commerce was seen as suspicious the era of origins   precipitated by the dislocations of the english industrial revolution and the rise of a more urban population this era is characterised by more attention to persuasive tactics designed to stimulate demand the era of institutional development   many of the large institutions and modern marketing practices emerged during this period the era of refinement and formalisation âpresent   further development and refinement of principles and practices developed in the preceding period in spite of the intense criticism levelled at keiths eras of marketing practice his periodisation is the most frequently cited in textbooks  and has become the accepted wisdom one content analysis of  introductory and advanced texts found that keiths eras were reproduced in all but four another study which examined  of the top selling marketing texts found that the although the incidence of repeating keiths eras was waning it had not been replaced by fullertons periodisation nor any other more meaningful framework other periodisationsedit for all the controversies surrounding the socalled marketing stages or periods keith and others appear to have contributed a lasting legacy a study by grundey  suggests that many contemporary textbooks begin with keiths eras and expand on it by including newer concepts such as the societal marketing concept the relationship marketing concept and the interfunctional concept as shown in the table below more recently kotler and keller added the holistic marketing concept to the list of eras in marketing marketing theorists continue to debate whether the holistic era represents a genuine new orientation or whether it is an extension of the marketing concept grundey summarised five different periodisations in the history of marketing as shown in the following table as a means of highlighting the general lack of agreement among scholars marketing philosophies or orientations cited in

millennium scientific bulletin â economic sciences marketing commerce and tourism vol  no   pÂ  brief description of the most commonly cited periodsedit the general lack of agreement amongst scholars as to what constitutes clearly identifiable periods and the orientation that characterised each distinct period has spawned a lengthy list of orientations space prevents an exhaustive description of all periods or eras however the most commonly cited periods appear in the following section production orientationedit the production orientation is one of the oldest philosophies that guides sellers a production orientation is often proposed as the first of the socalled orientations that dominated business thought keith dated the production era from the s to the s but other theorists argue that evidence of the production orientation can still be found in some companies or industries specifically kotler and armstrong note that the production philosophy is one of the oldest philosophies that guides sellers and is still useful in some situations  the production orientation is characterised by a focus on production manufacturing and efficiency attainment of economies of scale economies of scope experience effects or all three an assumption that demand exceeds supply a mindset that is encapsulated by says law supply creates its own demand or if somebody makes a product somebody else will want to buy it limited research  and largely limited to technicalproduct research rather than customer research this orientation rose to prominence in an environment which had a shortage of manufactured goods relative to demand so goods sold easily minimal promotion and advertising marketing communications limited to raising awareness of the products existence selling orientationedit the sales orientation often characterised by doortodoor selling is thought to have begun during the great depression of the s and continues to this day pictured a rawleighs salesman in  the selling orientation is thought to have begun during the great depression and continued well into the s although examples of this orientation can still be found today kotler et al note that the selling concept is typically practised with unsought goods  the selling orientation is characterised by aggressive selling to push products often involving doortodoor selling accepting every possible sale or booking regardless of its suitability for the business has a strongly transactional focus ignores potential relationships the marketing orientationedit the marketing orientation or the marketing concept emerged in the s characteristics of the marketing orientation a thorough understanding of the customers needs wants and behaviours should be the focal point of all marketing decisions marketing efforts sales advertising product management pricing should be integrated and in tune with the customer new product concepts should flow from extensive market analysis and product testing the societal marketing conceptedit main article societal marketing societal marketing orientation or societal marketing concept was first proposed in the s  by phillip kotler in an article published in the harvard business review the societal marketing concept adopts the position that marketers have a greater social responsibility than simply satisfying customers and providing them with superior value instead marketing activities should strive to benefit societys overall wellbeing marketing organisations that have embraced the societal marketing concept typically identify key stakeholder groups including employees customers local communities the wider public and government they ensure that marketing activities do not damage the environment and are not hazardous to broader society societal marketing developed into sustainable marketing characteristics of societal marketing an attempt to balance corporate commitments to groups and individuals in its environment including customers other businesses employees and investors companies must include social and ethical considerations into their marketing practices consideration is given to the environment includes problems such as air water and land pollution consideration is given to consumer rights unfair pricing and ethics in advertising relationship orientationedit main article relationship marketing starting in the s a new stage of marketing emerged called relationship marketing the focus of relationship marketing is on a longterm relationship that benefits both the company and the customer the relationship is based on trust and commitment and both companies tend to shift their operating activities to be able to work more efficiently together one of the most prominent reasons for relationship marketing comes from kotlers idea that it costs about five times more to obtain a new customer than to maintain the relationship with an existing customer a relationship marketing approach seeks to maximise the value of all the potential exchanges an organisation could have into the future the characteristics of relationship marketing include a focus on the relationship between seller and buyer an investment in the lifetime of relationships customer lifetime value rather than single transactions an orientation on product benefits andor customer value high customer service high customer commitment high customer contact quality is the concern of all all activities are coordinated with the customer interface including the customers involvement in the firmâs processes customised offerings where practical empirical support for relationship marketing as a distinct paradigm is very weak one study suggests that relationship marketing is really a subcomponent of large scale movements of the valueadded process rather than a separate era or framework some theorists suggest that marketing is moving from a relationship marketing paradigm and towards a social media paradigm where marketers have access to a more controlled environment and are able to customise offers and communications messages history of marketing thoughtedit university of pennsylvania was among the first universities to offer courses in marketing dating the history of marketing thought is just as problematic as the history of markting practice marketing historians cannot agree on how to date the beginnings of marketing thought eric shaw for instance suggests that a period of preacademic marketing thought can be identified prior to  other historians on the other hand suggest that the theory of marketing only emerged in the th century when the discipline began to offer courses at universities nevertheless the birth of marketing as a discipline is usually designated to the first decade of the twentieth century when marketing courses appeared in universities in  the university of michigan offered what many believe to be the very first course in marketing in the academic year  the university of pennsylvania commenced teaching marketing other universities soon followed including the harvard business school prior to the emergence of marketing courses marketing was treated as a branch of economics and was often called applied economics early marketing theories were described as modifications or adaptations of economic theories a periodisation approachedit several scholars have attempted to describe the evolution of marketing thought chronologically and to connect it with broader intellectual and academic trends bartels  sketched an account of marketings formative periods and shah and gardner  briefly considered the development of the six dominant schools in contemporary marketing however these initial attempts have been described as descriptive savitt  one of the first theorists to consider the stages in the development of marketing thought was robert bartels who in the the history of marketing thought  used a periodisation approach he categorised the development of marketing theory decade by decade from the beginning of the th century s discovery of basic concepts and their exploration s conceptualisation classification and definition of terms s integration on the basis of principles s development of specialisation and variation in theory s reappraisal in the light of new demands and a more scientific approach s reconceptualisation in the light of managerialism social development and quantitative approaches s differentiation on bases such as managerialism holism environmentalism systems and internationalism s socialisation the adaptation of marketing to social change a schools of thought approachedit other marketing historians have eschewed the periodisation approach and instead considered whether distinct schools within marketing reflect different facets of common theory and whether a more unifying intellectual structure has emerged these approaches tend to identify distinct schools of thought a school of thought refers to an intellectual tradition or a group of scholars who share a common philosophy or set of ideas marketing historians shaw and jones define a school of thought as one that has a substantial body of knowledge developed by a number of scholars and describing at least one aspect of the what how who why when and where of performing marketing activities  of those who identify schools there is no real agreement about which schools were dominant at different stages in marketings development it should be noted that two or more schools of thought can coexist at the same time in the following section a brief overview of the contributions of key thinkers will be outlined with respect to the prevailing schools that have dominated marketing thought to a certain extent there is some agreement that in early marketing thought three socalled traditional schools namely the commodity school the functional school and the institutional school coexisted marketing historians such as eric shaw and barton a weitz point to the publication of wroe aldersons book marketing behavior and executive action  as a breakpoint in the history of marketing thought moving from the macro functionsinstitutionscommodities approach to a micromarketing management paradigm following on from alderson marketing began to incorporate other fields of knowledge besides economics notably behavioral science becoming a multidisciplinary field for some scholars aldersons book marks the beginning of the marketing management era hunt and goolsby identified four schools of thought that have dominated marketing namely the commodity school the institutional school the functional school and the managerial school the commodity school a focus on different types of goods in the marketplace and how they are marketed the institutional school emphasised the functions of middlemen or intermediaries similar to the functional school but with a focus on channel flows the functional school a focus on the characteristics of marketing identifying the functions and systems of marketing adopts a systems approach the managerial school a focus on the problems faced by marketing managers focuses on the perspective of the seller some marketing historians like jagdish sheth have identified the modern marketing schools as the managerial school emerged during the late s and became arguably the predominant and most influential school of thought in the field the consumerbuyer behavior school which dominated the academic field in the second half of the twentieth century apart from the managerial school features theories emerging from behavioral science the social exchange school which focuses on exchange as the fundamental concept of marketing yet other commentators identify a broader range of schools omalley and lichrou for example document the schools as functional what activities does marketing perform focus on intermediaries and value adding commodities how are goods classified focus on classification of goods trade flows marketing institutions who performs marketing functions on commodities focus on retailers wholesalers intermediaries distribution channels

marketing practice and ideas emerge and evolve marketing thought and marketing practice brief description of the dominant schools of thoughtedit the following sections briefly outlines the schools of thought as conceptualised by key thinkers in the discipline marketing managementedit the marketing management school which emerged as the dominant school in  following the publication of basic marketing a managerial approach written by e jerome mccarthy replaced the socalled functional school which had been the dominant for the first part of the twentieth century in the words of hunt and goolsby the publication of mccarthys text sounded the beginning of the end for the functional school  however hunt and goolsby note that the s was a transitional period in which both the functional school and the managerial school coexisted shaw and jones have described the emergence of the managerial school in the mid twentieth century as a paradigm shift  key works in the marketing management
