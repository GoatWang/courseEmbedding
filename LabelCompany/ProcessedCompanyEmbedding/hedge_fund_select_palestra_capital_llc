marketing strategy starting a hedge fund  goldman sachs group inc is turning to the less risky business of providing capital for those who want to start their own hedge funds reports the wall street journal goldman has raised roughly  million from pension funds wealthy families and large institutions to invest in  new hedge funds each hedge fund startup is expected to receive between  million to  million to get off and running investors will earn returns based on the success of the funds themselves plus a slice of the hedge fund managers’ fees typically these seeder funds take a  to  cut of both the annual  management fee and  of profits earned by hedge fund managers the actual percentage promised to goldman investors was not revealed in the journal article goldman of course can gain from a slice of these fees plus the business generated by the hedge funds and sent through goldman’s trading unit the new fund has already invested roughly  million in a new yorkbased hedge fund called palestra capital management llc palestra is a longshort equity fund launched by jeremy schiffman and andrew immerman who previously worked for large hedge funds tpgaxon and sac capital this “seeding” approach marks a turnaround in strategy for goldman prior to the financial crisis goldman and a number of other big banks such as morgan stanley and jp morgan chase  co bought hedge funds directly or even set up their own inhouse funds but the financial meltdown hammered returns and resulted in large losses for many of these fledgling funds goldman’s global alpha fund lp for example which was a computerdriven trading fund that had grown as large as  billion in assets closed this past october after investors pulled out money and the fund suffered losses the business of seeding hedge funds has heated up this year however there are more money managers who have left large banks or other hedge funds looking to start their own funds and looking to raise capital an association with a brandname institution such as goldman sachs or blackstone provides a certain cache and helps with fundraising particularly from brokers who advise pensions and large institutions on how to allocate their money recently from the blog hedge funds are killing it in the first half of  two issues are looming large for hedge funds is the hedge fund industry in a battle for its life can hedge
