streetsphiladelphia pa telephone   warning letterphi may  delivered via united parcel service ms judy a hannan presidententrenet nutritionals inc nicholson drivecuddy pa  dear ms hannan this is to inform you that the us food and drug administration fda or we inspected your facility located at  nicholson drive cuddy pennsylvania from october   to november   the inspection revealed serious violations of the current good manufacturing practice cgmp regulations for manufacturing packaging labeling or holding operations for dietary supplements title  code of federal regulations part   cfr  these violations cause your dietary supplement products to be adulterated within the meaning of section g of the federal food drug and cosmetic act the act  united states code usc § g in that the products have been prepared packed or held under conditions that do not meet cgmp requirements for dietary supplements additionally we have reviewed your product labels collected at the inspection and we have determined that certain of your products identified below are in violation of sections  a andor f of the act  usc §§  a andor f andor the regulations implementing the food labeling requirements of the act which are found in title  code of federal regulations part   cfr  you may find the act and its implementing regulations through links on fda’s home page at wwwfdagov unapproved and misbranded new drugs your product labels for your products gone cardio rescue arthriattack and complete food supreme are promoted for conditions that cause the products to be drugs under section gb of the act  usc § gb the therapeutic claims on your product labels establish that the products are drugs because they are intended for use in the cure mitigation treatment or prevention of disease the marketing of these products with these claims violates the act gone“gone is an allnatural herbal supplement known to reduce pain and inflammation…” cardio rescue“it may help…arterial debris to be dissolved quickly”“this product is designed to melt down deposits” arthriattack“msm and glucosamine…while helping the body protect against inflammation and damage”“…to help you rid your body of joint pain and discomfort”  complete food supreme“…support for…people at high risk of cardiovascular disease and those with cardiovascular disease” gone cardio rescue arthriattack and complete food supreme are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and therefore the products are “new drugs” under section p of the act  usc § p a new drug may not be legally marketed in the united states without prior approval from fda as described in section a of the act  usc § a fda approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data submitted by a drug sponsor to demonstrate that the drug is safe and effective furthermore cardio rescue and complete food supreme are offered for conditions that are not amenable to selfdiagnosis and treatment by individuals who are not medical practitioners therefore adequate directions for use cannot be written so that a layperson can use these products safely for their intended uses thus the labels fail to bear adequate directions for the products’ intended uses causing the products to be misbranded under section f of the act  usc § f the introduction of misbranded drugs into interstate commerce is a violation of section a of the act  usc § a dietary supplement cgmp violations the inspection revealed the following significant violations of the cgmp requirements for dietary supplements these violations cause your dietary supplement products to be adulterated under section g of the act  usc § g in that they have been prepared packed or held under conditions which do not meet the cgmp regulations for dietary supplements additionally even if your gone cardio rescue arthriattack and complete food supreme did not contain disease claims in their labeling that cause the product to be an unapproved new drug under section a of the act  usc § a they would still be adulterated dietary supplements within the meaning of section g of the act because they have been prepared packed or held under conditions which do not meet the cgmp regulations for dietary supplements  during the inspection you stated that you b your products as a distributor that contracts with other manufacturers to b dietary supplements that your firm releases for distribution under your firm’s name your firm has an obligation to know what and how these activities are performed so that you can make decisions related to whether the product conforms to established specifications and whether to approve and release the product for distribution  fed reg   june   your firm introduces or delivers or causes the introduction or delivery of dietary supplements into interstate commerce for distribution to consumers as such your firm has an overarching and ultimate responsibility to ensure that all phases of the production of that product are in compliance with dietary supplement cgmp requirements although your firm may b certain dietary supplement manufacturing operations it cannot by the same token contract out its ultimate responsibility to ensure that the dietary supplement it places into commerce or causes to be placed into commerce is not adulterated for failure to comply with dietary supplement cgmp requirements see united states v dotterweich  us    explaining that an offense can be committed under the act by anyone who has “a responsible share in the furtherance of the transaction which the statute outlaws” united states v park  us    holding that criminal liability under the act does not turn on awareness of wrongdoing and that “agents vested with the responsibility and power commensurate with that responsibility to devise whatever measures are necessary to ensure compliance with the act” can be held accountable for violations of the act in particular the act prohibits a person from introducing or delivering for introduction or causing the delivery or introduction into interstate commerce a dietary supplement that is adulterated under section g for failure to comply with dietary supplement cgmp requirements see  usc §§ g and a thus a firm that contracts with other firms to conduct certain dietary supplement manufacturing packaging and labeling operations for it is responsible for ensuring that the product is not adulterated for failure to comply with dietary supplement cgmp requirements regardless of who actually performs the dietary supplement cgmp operations your firm’s processes violate dietary supplement cgmp requirements in the following ways     you failed to establish and follow written procedures for the responsibilities of the quality control operations including written procedures for conducting a material review and making a disposition decision as required by  cfr  and  cfr b furthermore your quality control personnel failed to ensure that your manufacturing labeling and holding operations ensure the quality of the dietary supplement as required by  cfr  specifically you stated that you have not established quality control procedures for conducting a material review and making a disposition decision and you do not conduct quality control operations to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement you receive from your contract manufacturers and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the master manufacturing record we have reviewed your response dated november   and find it inadequate because you failed to provide any written procedures for your quality control operations or documentation of the quality control operations performed which we could evaluate for compliance with the regulations     your quality control personnel failed to approve for release or reject packaged and labeled dietary supplement for distribution as required by  cfr h specifically you had no documentation of quality control operations related to approving for release or rejecting packaged and labeled gone product for distribution from march   through june   you distributed gone which was not identified with a lot number you obtained this product from a firm that you identified as a “private labeler of reumofan” but you have no information about this firm or the product you stated that the firm from whom you received the product received the product from a separate manufacturer but you had no records about the identity of the manufacturer how the manufacturing process was conducted or any other records about the product you failed to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the master manufacturing record you had no information on which to conduct quality control operations to approve the packaged and labeled product for release or reject the product for distribution see  cfr   h and   we have reviewed your response dated november   and find it inadequate because you failed to outline the specific steps you will take to become compliant with the requirements related to quality control     you failed to establish and follow written procedures relating to the review and investigation of product complaints as required by  cfr  specifically you confirmed to our investigator that you have no formal system in place to address product complaints once you have established the necessary written procedures you must make and keep all related records as required by  cfr    additionally you failed to make and keep a complete written record of every product complaint that is related to good manufacturing practice as required by  cfr bii specifically you were notified by the fda’s center for food safety and applied nutrition cfsan on september   that an adverse event had been reported associated with your product gone this adverse event reported on fda’s medwatch form described that the complainant experienced severe stomach discomfort your reply dated october   referenced a telephone call with a customer however there is no record of your investigation of this adverse event including documentation detailing this telephone conversation with the complainant or results of the investigation we have reviewed your response dated november   and find it inadequate because you failed to outline the specific steps you will take to become compliant with the regulation     you failed to make and keep written procedures for holding and distributing operations as required by  cfr b specifically your firm does not have written standard operating procedures for storage and distribution of your dietary supplement products     you failed to establish and follow written procedures to fulfill the requirements of  cfr part  subpart n for handling returned dietary supplements as required by  cfr  specifically you have not established written procedures to ensure the proper disposition of returned dietary supplements additionally you confirmed to our investigator that products have been returned to your facility but that there were no records available which document the final disposition of these returned dietary supplements as required by  cfr b    dietary supplement misbranding violations in addition even if gone cardio rescue arthriattack and complete food supreme did not contain claims that cause them to be unapproved new andor misbranded drugs they would still be misbranded dietary supplements under section  of the act  usc §  as are your natural

a plant classified within the genus panax     your arthriattack big mo momentum grande cardio repair gone pro plus gold and purifying cleanse i products are misbranded within the meaning of section sc of the act  usc sc because the labels fail to identify the part of the plant from which the dietary ingredients are derived for example your pro plus gold label does not list the parts of the plants from which all of your botanical dietary ingredients are derived in accordance with  cfr h     your harmony plus immune force and seven flowers bp products are misbranded within the meaning of section qa of the act  usc qa because the serving size is incorrect or is not present on the label the terms serving or serving size for a dietary supplement are defined in  cfr b and  table  as the maximum amount recommended on the label for consumption per eating occasion for example the label for harmony plus recommends  capsule before each meal and therefore the serving size should be
