and business leaders about mistakes that have shaped their business philosophy eric christopher ceo zylo inc by chris omalley small businessstartupstech background   indianapolisbased zylo inc helps organizations manage and optimize their softwareasaservice subscriptions the mistake it was something i was pushing for throughout my career that i’m kind of glad didn’t happen when i came out of college i joined exacttarget now salesforcecom i was one of the younger sales reps on the team i had some entrepreneurial experience that gave me a way to get in the door i had some initial success as a rep part of it was because we had this great product and they trained me well in the early days i was always someone who wanted to move up careerwise quickly i was in my early s i did inside sales i moved quickly up to outside sales and i started envisioning myself becoming a manager and moving up really quickly i went through year after year i was an individual contributor for eight years and i was always expressing at the end of every sales year that i wanted to jump into a management opportunity i wanted to take on a different role maybe move over to account management or something different some of my mentors at the time kind of were coaching me my longterm vision was to become ceo of a company i started envisioning myself becoming a manager and moving up really quickly the lesson scott dorsey who was ceo of exacttarget told me one good attribute of a ceo was to be really really good at sales now being a manager i’ve coached people similarly as well learning a specific skill set and doing it long enough can exponentially enable you to do other things faster i spent eight years as a sales producer i had a lot of experience in sales – much longer than i thought i would i think that prepared me better to be a vp of sales and actually skip the traditional “move up the ranks” path because in the startup world i don’t know it actually works that way i think after eight years i was actually in a better place to have learned enough and had enough experiences that i could be a better vp of sales to grow a team and hire really good reps that’s because i knew what it was like firsthand i would sit in meetings and say “it feels almost like my gut is telling me this or that” to make certain decisions someone told me your gut instinct is actually a collection of experiences that you’ve had so your gut generally is factual datadriven that’s what your gut is it’s really your experiences so i think if i had done a year of account management a year of sales and a year of management – i don’t know if that would have been a better path for me i was thinking through how many times i was told “no” in my career to something i wanted early i’m not saying you should not want to move up but just appreciate and really try to master a role because if you do that i think it creates a lot of bigger open doors later today you never really get a chance to master a skill

0 organizational department heads have a new task building their saas stacks amy condle left back to blog share organizational department heads or leaders over specific teams have more and more demands on their shoulders their responsibilities have scaled over the past decade and especially the past several years to now include additional tasks above and beyond hiring setting and tracking goals leading teams and specific departmental demands now department heads are being asked to evaluate purchase and maintain their saas tech stacks—a responsibility that used to live solely the it and procurement teams the saas buying experience has changed according to a recent article on topo blog the software buying experience has improved in recent years the article explains “…the emergence of the saas model has had a profound impact on the buyer experience while saas started out as a movement to deliver better products many of its core principles have crept into the world of marketing and sales and impacted the experience that a buyer has with the company for example free trials are now common in the software industry—something that was extremely rare before the emergence of saas there’s also been a major shift in power from software vendor to software buyer much of this is due to the internet of course buyers have access to more information online are able to more easily connect with their peers and can identify and evaluate different options for example pricing information is now readily available for most software products—again something that was uncommon a few years ago” as author scott albro points out saas has completely altered the software experience no longer does a saas sales cycle take months or even years of evaluation and testing by it and procurement teams no longer do organizations have to submit rfps to multiple vendors in hopes they get straight answers in return no longer do organizations have to commit to buying a software solution and hope that it works before trying it out in their unique infrastructure environment this incredible shift in the way software is purchased has changed the buying and selling process forever now organizational department heads can evaluate software that their team needs make decisions on how it fits into the budget maintain user licenses or choose to increase or decrease users purchase services and even work with vendors on integrations and ultimately be responsible for the success or failure or saas in their own departments and usually this process happens in weeks or months no longer in months or years what does departmental saas buying look like the zylo team recently interviewed several executives at fast growing saas organizations to see how they delegate subscriptionbased software purchasing decisions below are two real life use cases of departmental saas buying amanda lannert ceo jellyvision explained “decisions about software purchases are made by individual teams and are based on that team’s goals i like to say that we’re scrappy but not cheap we want to stay lean and fast and if we can use software to get stuff done then that’s great if we want to optimize the lead nurturing process for instance we look at the people processes and tools associated departments who need to hit specific goals make the final decisions for us our prioritization is business strategy first software second and it consolidation third” andy macmillan ceo acton software shared “we’ve moved towards an entirely saasbased model and we intend most decisions to be made at the departmental level for example sales applications are evaluated and purchased by the sales function and the same holds true across all departments for us it’s less about managing pure costs and more about ensuring our business processes span across all applications used across the business it’s imperative that all of our systems work together so data can easily move between departments and systems so we have complete insight into what’s happening at each level of the business but the other piece for us is the collaboration concept how should the internal team collaborate around those processes and applications it’s imperative that we tie visibility across all applications our it function has become less about managing cost and more about building processes across applications and ensuring collaboration” the challenge of saas visibility any executive in today’s digital world can tell you that the world of saas is continuing to shift and pivot the way companies conduct business—and most of the time for the better but as decisions to move forward with renewals and upsells of saas subscriptions are often made at the department level within their respective budgets this creates a disparate view at the top level add on to that the challenge of tracking employees software subscriptions when individuals or teams use their company or personal credit card for the sake of simplicity and avoiding red tape those “small” annual subscriptions add up quickly—especially when multiple employees or teams across the organization may be charging their credit cards for the same subscription because buying decisions have shifted mainly to departments executives must also consider the possibility of redundant subscriptions across the organization it can be very costly and time consuming to track down whether multiple individuals or teams are using subscription software if they are simply charging it to their company or personal credit card how can the finance department gain visibility to determine if subscription redundancies are occurring in your organization support departmental buying by gaining executive visibility if you were to gain insight into tracking how many employees or teams are using any given saas application along with how much they’re utilizing or aren’t utilizing the applications wouldn’t you have your finance team work out an enterprise or group discount or better yet roll all of those subscriptions into a single master agreement without realtime data to track and monitor saas subscriptions across your
