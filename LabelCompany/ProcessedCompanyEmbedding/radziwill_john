radziwiłł family lines the radziwiłł family divided by branch the goniądzmeteliai line the biržaidubingiai line the nesvizhkletskolyka line the goniądzmeteliai line became extinct by the next generation as mikołajs descendants consisted of one male heir mikołaj iii who entered the priesthood and became the bishop of samogitia thus bearing no known offspring to extend the line the biržaidubingiai line was moderately more successful and produced some very notable state officials and politicians but also became extinct after the death of ludwika karolina radziwiłł in  mikołaj the black radziwiłł perhaps the most influential member of the family he rallied opposition to the lublin union between lithuania and poland the nesvizhkletskolyka line was the most successful and was further divided into smaller family lines in order to maintain clarity and specificity of descent and the passing of titles since the th century all radziwiłł family members have been descendants of this line three sons of mikołaj the black mikołaj krzysztof sierotka albrycht and stanisław the pious are said to be the progenitors of the three smaller branches the branches are as follows the nesvizh line the older kletsk line the olyka line possibly both the olyka and older kletsk lines became extinct the former in  and the latter in  but there are a lot of descendents in europe who had fled of the battles russiapoland polandsweden the direct descendant of the nesvizh line dominik hieronims son aleksander dominik was born before the marriage of his parents and formed the socalled galician branch which became extinct in  the younger kletsk line descends from michał hieronim continued through his son ludwik mikolaj the descendants of his other son antoni henryk formed the

meteliai after the jagiellonianhabsburg congress at vienna mikołaj radziwiłł also received an expanded more solemn coat of arms as princes of the holy roman empire the radziwiłłs bore a black eagle on

emperor religionedit the radziwiłł family also branched regarding religion following the protestant and polish reformation two branches converted to calvinism one branch the nesvizh–kletskolyka line remained as calvinists for two generations until the children of mikołaj the black converted to catholicism before the end of the century the biržaidubingiai line remained in the protestant faith until the extinction of their line one century later both mikołaj the black and mikołaj the red were zealous promoters and active participants of the protestant religion within the gdl mikołaj the black funded the printing of a second version and first completed polish translation of a protestant bible titled the radziwiłł bible also known as biblia brzeska which was published in the town of

foreign political arenas they took an active part in the political life of the grand duchy of lithuania and its importance is manifested by family relations with such famous nobility dynasties in belarus ukraine poland the great duchy of lithuania samogitia and rus like zaslawski rohatinski lukomski and olshanskidobrowicki the radziwiłł family joined the rest of the nobility as the elite of the state after the signing the union of krewo in  the significance of the radziwiłł family is proved by the marriage of anna to konrad iii rudy duke of masovia who owned the largest polish principality in  a member of the radziwiłł family was married to sigismund ii augustus thus becoming the queen of poland later the radziwiłłs established family relations not only with the most

michał gedeon was the commanderinchief of the november uprising and his cousin stanislaw radziwiłł was the aidedecamp to the commanderinchief józef piłsudski the radziwiłłs also gained international importance manifested in family relations with german princely dynasties first established by albrecht radziwiłł from olyka who married anna princess of courland such conjugal unions continued in th and th centuries after the three partitions of the polish–lithuanian commonwealth in the late th century towns and estates owned by the radziwiłłs became parts of territories belonged to russia

high civil and military posts they had family ties with king of prussia ferdinand the castellan dukes and the aldringen and wittgenstein princes the significance of the radziwiłł family is proved by

influence from the thth century until the beginning of the second world war in  the radziwiłł family reached the heights of its importance and power during the polish golden age however due to the activities of janusz radziwilłł during the deluge the family lost much of its wealth and power regarding their wealth the radziwiłłs were not inferior to the royal family in total the radziwiłł family

marriage of his parents and was thus denied the title and inheritance of his forefathers he and his descendants had their princely title confirmed by the austrian empire thus the ordynat of nesvizh and olyka fell into the hands of the younger kletsk line in this way all three radziwiłł ordynats ended up in the possession of one line represented by the sons of michal hieronim ludwik mikolaj of kletsk and antoni henryk of nesvizh and olyka the descendants of antoni henryk formed the beginning of the socalled ordynant branch out of the younger kletsk line in whose possession other than the

lublin union between lithuania and poland the nesvizhkletskolyka line was the most successful and was further divided into smaller family lines in order to maintain clarity and specificity of descent

and polish reformation two branches converted to calvinism one branch the nesvizh–kletskolyka line remained as calvinists for two generations until the children of mikołaj the black converted to catholicism before the end of the century the biržaidubingiai line remained in the protestant faith until the extinction of their line one century later both mikołaj the black and mikołaj the red were
