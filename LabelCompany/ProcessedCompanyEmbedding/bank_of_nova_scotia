advice on terminating berry prior to the investment industry regulatory organization of canada iiroc violation accusation and the results of questioning during the iiroc inquiries strongly suggest that the securities charges were part of a plan by scotiabank senior management to remove berry from his position and simultaneously prevent him from becoming their competitor in a ruling on january

mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a
