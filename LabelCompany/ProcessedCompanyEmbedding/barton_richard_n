interpretations translations books universalium interpretation barton richard n ▪        on feb   richard barton creator of the doityourself travel web site expediacom unveiled his newest brainchild zillowcom a national realestate information web site that made it possible for anyone with internet access to look up the value of a friends—or a celebritys—house zillowcom displayed the transaction history property description square footage and other details on tens of millions of homes in the us unlike competing sites that charged for access or required registering with a realestate agent however zillow provided the information with no strings attached—other than viewing web page advertisements       barton was born on june   as a youth in new canaan conn he spent summers selling frozen treats on an icecream truck route and caddying at a country club in the summers between academic years at stanford university where he studied industrial engineering bs  barton ran his own housepainting company he joined microsoft inc in and served as a product manager for msdos and later the windows operating system while working on a microsoft travelguide project barton was inspired to provide consumers with direct access to flight information rather than leave them dependent on airlines and travel agencies which effectively monopolized the travelbooking business microsoft launched bartons idea as expediacom in  it was spun off as a public company in  and under bartons guidance expedia became one of the most popular—and financially successful—travelbooking web sites he remained as the firms president and ceo until march  when he left to travel abroad and spend time with his family he founded zillow inc incorporated in  with lloyd frink a former expedia executive       barton drew parallels between expedia and zillow both of which were designed to put information directly in the hands of customers the model for zillow however had limits the company which was based in seattle prioritized its coverage of west coast cities with data for other parts of the country far less complete unlike expedia there was no transaction such as a ticket sale on which to earn a commission zillows main source of revenue was expected to come from ads furthermore real estate is difficult to commodify accordingly zillow provided such services as “zindex” a value index with which to compare a homes historic value with similar homes in the area and “zestimate” a sophisticated price estimate calculated by running public data through zillows proprietary algorithm barton initially released zillow as a beta introductory version with the idea of refining the site in the ensuing months if zillows ability to make money on ad clicks remained an open question it was nonetheless likely that bartons latest creation would put pressure on realestate agents to lower their commissions since zillow provided a good deal of realtors research for free sarah forbes orwig    ▪ american entrepreneur born june   new canaan conn us       american creator of the doityourself web sites expediacom and zillowcom       barton graduated from stanford university in  with a degree

successful—travelbooking web sites he remained the firms president and ceo until  three years later barton and lloyd frink a former expedia executive created zillowcom a selfservice real estate web site that looked to duplicate the success of expedia zillow was instantly popular due in large part to a feature called the zestimate which provided users with an estimated value for any of the tens of millions of homes in the sites database    universalium  bartoli cecilia barton sir derek harold richard look at other dictionaries richard de clare lord de clare — richard de clare ou de
