investments commentaries contact us commentaries archives april  january  october  july  economic  investment outlook april  what a difference a year makes it has been a profitable and comfortable start to  compared to a volatile first quarter last year the first five days week month and quarter were all up so the odds favor another doubledigit return this year furthermore the often discussed “great rotation” may be starting inflows into equities surpassed  billion since the election and were four times the size of inflows into bonds this is a small offset to bond inflows that dwarfed equities by  billion since march  but highlights the power if these trends were reversed given the healthy start to the year is there anything to worry about there are always worries but the markets thrive on healthy skepticism fortunately politics and valuation top the list not the growth outlook investors remain concerned that bipartisan politics will derail progress and the market may be overbought following a  gain since the election a healthy correction  could occur anytime but we focus longer term and believe equities are attractive based on moderate growth low interest rates and
