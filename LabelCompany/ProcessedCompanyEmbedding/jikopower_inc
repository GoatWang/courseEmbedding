interesting new projectsproducts and help fund them by preordering or pledging money to their creators their pledge supports making that product possible the project must reach its funding goal with in a limited time period usually  days credit cards are not charged until a project reaches its funding goal and manufacturing begins if the goal is not met nobody is charged and the creators do not get any funding in most cases this means the project dies but many try againour how to use kickstarter video httpsyoutubedfcjldxgq how does the spark workthermoelectric generators or tegs rely on thermoelectric chips that convert heat into electricity  the thermoelectric chips generate the most electricity when the disparity between the temperatures on either side of the chip is the greatest our generator gathers heat through the arm on one side of the chip and the water in the reservoir keeps the other side cool  the water can be boiling and still be considered cool relative to the side with the metal armq why thermoelectricour device uses heat that is otherwise wasted when people are cooking it is used while cooking or enjoying a fire so it can’t be easily stolen  it is very durable perfect for rural lifestyles or camping it also doesnt rely on the weather or time of day to functionq where did you get this ideamarilyn our founder ryan’s mom was working as an aid worker in haiti after the earthquake and tsunami while she was there she was treating a young boy about ryan’s age he was injured in the earthquake and needed medical supplies that were roughly  miles away  marilyn rushed around to see if anyone could call for the supplies  although almost everyone had a cellphone no one had a charge  the little boy didn’t make it and his death had a lasting impression on marilyn and ryan  they learned that this scenario happens all over the world all the time now ryan is all grown up and has a son of his own his mission is to make sure that something as simple as charging a cell phone never again leads to the pain his mother felt or a child’s entirely preventable deathjikopower inc c street northeast auburn wa  contact us contact name  name first name last
