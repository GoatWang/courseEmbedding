thinners like coumadin or have fragile skin stop bleeding quickly without any sting reduces bruising too it is a heavy beeswax cream which will literally plug the hole it is so heavy the blood cant push through just wipe the wound to dry it and quickly apply a heavy band of beeswax bandage over the area after  or  minutes you will have coagulated under the cream just wipe it off and unless you need stitches you are done it does not sting and usually soothes any discomfort that is present if you leave a little on the wound it will heal much more rapidly if you bruise easily rub beeswax bandage into the bruise it will disappear much more rapidly than it would normally keep a pocket size in your purse or pocket so you are ready for that next unexpected bump and bleed great for shaving mishaps too great for outdoors  work  its like having a box of bandages in your pocket and its waterproof my jar of beeswax bandage has blisters and froth on top beeswax bandage is a very heavy

repellants most repellants dont actually repel insects rather they mask the scent or pheromones insects are looking for so they cant find their target most repellants even the most highly effective one deet does not do the job perfectly for everybody people give off many different pheromones most of which human noses cannot detect  but insects and animals can many repellants use chemicals to mask those pheromones chemicals which may be worse for ones health than the biting insects honey guy ® bite free® skin cream and bite free® spray use safe ingredients even for babies and small animals it has been our experience that honey guy® repellants work well for most people most of the time yet we occasionally hear of an individual for whom our repellants did not work or did not work consistently this is usually because the insects are sensing a pheromone that our product cannot mask well everyone is different and a few individuals may find honey guy ® repellants to be less than satisfactory the honey guy® is dedicated to making his customers happy the honey guy unconditional guarantee insures that anyone who is dissatisfied with a honey guy® product for any reason will at least not have wasted his or her money for trying the product return the product to honey guy ® with a copy of the receipt and receive a full refund including the cost of shipping this guarantee extends to customers of our many retailers nationwide no matter where you bought the honey guy ® product you are protected by the honey guy unconditional guarantee one more thing  people can be allergic to just about anything a few folks are allergic to citronella and a few others cannot tolerate the scent so before you use honey guy repellents especially on babies try a little on a very small area of skin if any redness or swelling occurs within a few minutes dont use the product if when they catch the scent they look at you like you are the wicked witch of the west they would probably rather you didnt use it on them but what about chiggers chiggers red bugs are the meanest toughest most irritating little varmints you will ever come acrossbut honey guy® repellents are up to the challenge we recommendfrom experiencethat you put bite free® cream liberally from the top of your foot up to your knee including the crease behind the knee where those nasty jokers like to dig inthen spray your shoes boots are really recommended and pants legs liberally with honey guy® flea and tick spray doesnt hurt to put some spray around the belt line too if you have already been bitten use honey guy® waterblockerô skin cream or beeswax bandage liberally over the bite this will stop the itch and smother the little devil to death about us toggle navigation thehoneyguycom my account

beekeeper don johnson and grandson samson grunwald working the bees at johnsons bee farm in east texas our story by don johnson the story began when my father ralph johnson was a young boy in missouri he learned to keep bees with his father in the 9s actually they did more robbing than keeping as they would follow bees from their water source into the forest and find their hives then with little more protection than a thin veil they would proceed to rob these wild bees sometimes they would capture the hives and put them in makeshift boxes they could more easily work with with time and circumstance my father stopped beekeeping but never forgot the fun and entertainment the bees afforded him in  at age  he decided to start keeping bees again at first he just had a few hives but then in  my brother jim joined him in a big way jim bought over  hive boxes and stocked them with new bees the two of them were instantly overwhelmed by the size of the operation it was at this time that i joined them in their new hobby together we worked our hives during a time when it seems pandoras box was opened and every possible problem bees could have was poured out upon our bees of course we were not the only beekeepers affected  the entire united states beekeeping industry suffered during the midlate nineties in fact the entire wild honeybee population in the us was virtually wiped out by the varroa mite only the domesticated honeybee survived with much effort on the part of professional and hobbyist beekeepers but survive we and our bees did and we produced a lot of honey selling most of it wholesale to local health food stores and roadside vegetable stands under the name johnsons honey our east texas wildflower honey is among the best for health purposes because of its high pollen content and because we do not destroy its healthful qualities by heating using only coarse filtering our honey is the next best thing to having your own beehive in your backyard now it should be mentioned that selling honey at wholesale prices is a losing proposition unless you have very large numbers of hives  say a minimum of  by year  it was clear to me that retailing was the only way to make a profit with our honeybees and not only honey but also another product i had been experimenting with for several years  beeswax skin cream i had heard that in frontier days beekeepers used beeswax for a myriad of purposes including making an effective skin cream on one occasion i observed another beekeeper making a beeswax cream and i became interested in the process working in my basement i experimented with ageold methods of making beeswax cream the basic steps were simple but there are literally an infinite number of variations i wanted a cream that was enjoyable to feel silky smooth healthful to wear and completely natural i settled on a light weight version of beeswax cream with enough beeswax to produced the desired effects on the skin but not too heavy that it would not absorb readily the light weight version is silky smooth absorbs quickly seals the skin from water and any other exterior antagonist it helps to moisturize the skin and promotes healing of rough dry skin  hands heals face etc it lasts much longer when exposed to water the regular skin creams because it is not water soluble  one application is usually enough for all day it protects the skin and lips from chapping and cracking in cold and wet winter conditions as a bonus it has the ability to relieve the discomfort of most irritated skin conditions  mosquito bites fire ant bites eczema psoriasis hives poison ivy oak and sumac even bee stings as mentioned earlier retailing is the best way for a small beekeeping operation to make a profit having a regular full time job i began searching for a way to sell our products on the weekends in june of  i began to sell locally at the market at cedar creek lake an open air farmers market and outlet for handmade goods in seven points texas which was operated by ms ardy stuart the beeswax skin cream instantly became the best seller at the market with customers coming back for more and even with repeat orders coming in by phone and fax often visitors would come to the market after being referred by friends they would ask where is the honey guy that has that wonderful beeswax skin cream and that was the start of honey guy customers would tell us they found our cream useful for dry itchy skin rashes insect bites diaper rash and persistent dry skin conditions they called it a miracle cream i dont make any medical claims concerning beeswax skin cream however science is proving that beeswax and most other products of the hive do have many healthful qualities and being completely natural my new waterblocker skin cream had none of the preservative chemicals that cause painful reactions to the skin of so many people the immediate success of our waterblocker skin cream in particular and the repeat business it brought convinced us of the need to set up a website to make our products available to the world wide market and to facilitate those customers who wanted to be able to quickly order and reorder our products to that end i retained ms ardy stuart a lady of many talents to design my first website as a result honey guy has shipped many products  waterblocker skin cream in particular  all over the usa and to many different countries including ecuador ireland spain and mexico england and canada with the aid of ardys marketing expertise our honey guy line of products has expanded from the initial two  east texas honey and beeswax skin cream  to include flavored honeys creamed honey honeybutter fruit n honey oldtime beeswax furniture polish bars of pure beeswax and unique gift baskets which include various combinations of my products but waterblocker skin cream remains the kingpin of our products ms stuart  now my queen bee mrs johnson  and i teamed up in the summer of  to operate a joint booth at the world famous canton first monday trade days in canton texas we attended this event monthly and participated in dozens of other shows all over the united states until december  when we decided we would no longer participate in road shows of any kind but would instead concentrate on producing and shipping our products to our many wholesale and retail customers to contact ushoney guy products

care for men explainedskin care advice and product reviews for menthe best hand lotion for men – our top  no matter what you do as a guy your hands are always going to be front and centre so what better reason to take as good a care of them as you can with the best hand lotion for men although guys are generally known for their rough and tough hands using mens hand lotion does not mean you have to end up with “girly hands” keep your hands looking manly in fact taking care of the skin on your hands with an appropriate mens hand cream may actually mean that your hands continue to look like “man hands” free of cracks redness and other irritations that aren’t necessarily particularly manly avoid ‘dirty looking’ hands people also often dissociate rough and damaged hands with being ‘dirty’ and although this is quite often not the case why take the risk on even letting people subconsciously think this about you and your hands hand lotion keeps your hands in healthy condition the best hand lotion for men will work with the natural oils and texture of your skin to repair damaged skin cells and hydrate your hands while not leaving them overly greasy this can help to heal cracked and dry skin while also evening out the skin tone of your hands and let’s face it healthy looking hands are a lot more appealing than ones covered in red blotchy and possibly even flaky skin picking the best hand moisturizer for men although using a more general man’s moisturizer on your hands is better than using nothing you’re going to see far greater results if you use a specific mens hand lotion this is because the skin on the hands tends to be tougher than the skin on other parts of your body also as your hands are more exposed to general use they are perhaps more likely to also suffer the effects of this this means they are likely going to need something a bit more intense to keep them in their best condition pick a hand lotion suited to your skin by choosing a really good hand lotion for men rather than a general moisturiser you will also give yourself the opportunity to pick something that is particularly suited to the skin type of your hands you will also be able to pick a lotion that will help deal with any specific skin issues that you may suffer from on just your hands eg over dryness blotchy skin tone etc the daily effects of hand washing even if you don’t spend a lot of your time outside for work or recreation your hands can still take a pounding just from the daily effects of hand washing although some of the standard hand soaps you find these days are definitely getting better unless you use a specifc soap formulated for men for we all know the drying and irritating effect the ordinary hand soaps can still have on your hands over the course of the day even if for nothing else using a mens hand lotion to provide your hands some relief from these effects of washing is well worth it and if this is a particular concern for you there are even some hand lotions you can find that will be particularly more resistant to lot of ongoing contact with water guard against sun damage if you think about it your hands are probably the one part of your body even more than your face that is the most exposed on a daily basis to the damaging effects of the sun this is another area where hand lotion for men can also be of benefit you can in fact get mens hand lotion that will provide some protection against the sun’s harmful rays not only will this help to guard against skin cancer but can also work to combat the harsh drying effects that prolonged exposure to the sun can have on your hands product reviews jack black industrial strength hand healer as the name suggests this powerful product from jack black is particularly great at looking after hands that have taken a beating whether it’s from the effects of your job or your hobbies or even if you just suffer from particularly dry skin this mens hand cream could be the extra help you’ve been looking for with some great ingredients like macadamia oil this product gets rave reviews from users for its healing and moisturising abilities while not leaving your hands over greasy  vaseline for men hand lotion extra strength vaseline has got a great pedigree for turning out very skin friendly and dependable products sitting at a very reasonable price point in the market this particular mens hand lotion certainly doesn’t disappoint with great skin repair and moisturising properties as well as a masculine but not overbearing smell this is definitely up there if you’re looking for the best hand moisturizer for men o’keeffe’s working hands cream this supercharged mens hand cream is particularly formulated for those guys who really give their hands a thrashing this handcream prides its self on repairing and looking after hands that take a beating day in and day out designed to be odourless this handcream is perhaps one of the best choices for men who work a lot with their hands and just want to look after them without any unnecessary bells and whistles  nivea for men maximum hydration nourishing lotion for dry skin although this product from nivea is billed as a three in one product hands body and face it will still do a fantastic job of just looking after hands particularly if your hands are otherwise generally in pretty good shape if however you have particularly dry or damaged skin you might want to consider a hand lotion more specifically formulated for just the hands   burt’s bees hand salve burt’s bees hand slave is definitely aimed at those guys who have more damaged or harder to repair skin on their hands and although it does a great job at this it’s perhaps not going to be best if you’re after something a bit more subtle users note that it does have quite a pronounced eucalyptus aroma which although definitely manly may not suit those of us guys who prefer less scented skin care products because of its bees wax base some users do note it can also be a bit greasy after use however what is particularly great about this product is its focus on more natural ingredients so if you are someone who tries to find more organic or herbal based products for your skin this could be just what you’re after best hand lotion for men hand lotion definitely deserves a place in every man’s skin care regime alongside other staples such as daily body wash and top quality face wash if you’re not using it already you should definitely consider adding the best hand lotion for men to your daily skin care routine related posts the best
