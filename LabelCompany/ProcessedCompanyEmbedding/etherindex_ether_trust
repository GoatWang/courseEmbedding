approximately seven hundred  other digital assets have been developed since the inception of bitcoin currently the most developed digital asset because of the length of time it has been in existence while ether has enjoyed success in its limited history the aggregate value of outstanding ether is much smaller than that of bitcoin and may be eclipsed by the more rapid development of other digital assets company description ether is a digital asset “digital asset” similar to bitcoin that is not issued by any government bank or central organization ether has a value based on the value token of the blockchain of the peertopeer ethereum computer network the “ethereum network” that hosts the decentralized public transaction ledger known as the “blockchain” on which all ether is recorded ether can be transferred among parties via the internet without the use of a central administrator or clearing agency the ethereum network software governs the creation of ether and secures and verifies ether transactions the ethereum network software can interpret the blockchain to determine the exact ether balance if any of any public ether address listed in the blockchain which has taken part in a transaction on the ethereum network an ether private key controls the transfer or “spending” of ether from its associated public ether address an ether “wallet” is a collection of private keys and their associated public ether addresses the ethereum network is a recent technological innovation and the ether that is created transferred used and stored by entities and individuals have certain features associated with several types of assets most notably commodities and currencies unlike bitcoin ether was not designed to function purely as a store of value instead it was meant to pay for specific actions on the ethereum network with users receiving it for using their computing power to validate transactions and for contributing to its development however ether’s market is currently supported by many of the same exchanges and the same infrastructure that has developed around the bitcoin network users who have historically purchased bitcoin and other digital currencies on exchange platforms can now buy ether on these websites ether can be converted to fiat currencies such as the us dollar or to bitcoin at rates determined on ether exchanges or in individual endusertoenduser transactions under a barter system both the ethereum network and bitcoin network run on a blockchain which is a distributed database run by nodes or “miners” who are rewarded with the respective value token ie ether or bitcoin for securing the network while the bitcoin network permits users primarily to execute value transfers the ethereum network allows users to program any arbitrary code and execute it including value transfers accordingly the ethereum network may be viewed as a global decentralized computer in comparison to the bitcoin network which is more similar to a global decentralized payment network the term “smart contract” refers to any code running on a blockchain that is more complex than a simple value transfer or supplemental feature of value transfers although ether may be used to perform value transfers or serve as a store of value ether’s primary function is as a “fuel” for the ethereum network each programmatic operation that can be performed on the network costs “gas” to execute and “gas” is payable only in ether the sponsor believes the trust to be the first exchangetraded product in the united states that seeks to track the price of ether the trust is a delaware statutory trust organized on november   under the delaware statutory trust act “dsta” and operates pursuant to the declaration of trust and trust agreement dated   between the sponsor as grantor and the trustee the “trust agreement” which sets forth the respective rights and duties of the sponsor and the trustee and authorizes the sponsor on behalf of the trust to enter into a custody agreement for the trust’s cash the “cash custody agreement” with the cash custodian and a custody agreement for the trust’s ether the “ether custody agreement” and collectively with the cash custody agreement the “custody agreements” with the ether custodian collectively with the cash custodian the “custodians” the custodians serve as custodians to the trust under the custody agreements which establish the segregated custody accounts of the trust that will be used to control the ether the “trust ether custody account” and to control the cash of the trust on behalf of the trust the “trust cash custody account” and collectively with the trust ether custody account the “trust custody accounts” the trust will issue common units of beneficial interest or “shares” which represent units of fractional undivided beneficial interest in the net assets of the trust the trust’s assets will consist of ether the trust will occasionally hold cash for short periods in connection with the basket creation and redemption process and to pay the sponsor’s management fee and any trust expenses and liabilities not assumed by the sponsor the trust is not a registered investment company under the investment company act of  as amended and is not required to register as an investment company the shares provide investors with an opportunity to access the ether market through a traditional brokerage account shares are issued only in one or more blocks of  shares called “baskets” principally in exchange for cash from certain registered brokerdealers or other securities market participants “authorized participants” the trust will issue and redeem the shares in baskets only to certain authorized participants on an ongoing basis baskets will be redeemed by the trust principally in exchange for the amount of cash corresponding to their redemption value baskets may also be created or redeemed partially or wholly in exchange for ether at the discretion of the sponsor if the authorized participant can convey or receive ether directly to the trust on each business day the value of each basket accepted by the administrator in a creation or redemption transaction will be the same ie each basket will consist of  shares and the value of the basket will be equal to the value of  shares at their net asset value per share on that day the investment objective of the trust is for the shares to track the price of ether as measured by the price of ether in us dollars as reported by the global digital asset exchange “gdax” as of  pm eastern time on

funds by jeremy nation april th  ethnewscom the securities and exchange commission is currently mulling over a decision to greenlight etherindex ether trusts exchangetraded fund sec acceptance of an etf based in ether would signal a victory for players in the industry seeking acknowledgement from central banking corporations and legislative bodies both of which have a strong influence over the policies and regulation of the virtual currency ecosystem on friday the sec released a statement indicating that the commission had published proposed rule changes that would allow such a listing for comment in february but had received none the statement went on to delineate ether from bitcoins the exchange represents that unlike bitcoin ether was not designed to function purely as a store of value instead ether was meant to pay for specific actions on the ethereum network however according to the exchange ether’s market is currently supported by many of the same online exchanges and the same infrastructure that has developed around the bitcoin network currently under a separate review is a proposal that the sec previously rejected in march as reported by ethnews gemini exchange founders cameron and tyler winklevoss sought approval to trade bitcoin as a security on the batz bzx exchange inc and filed for a review of the rejection following the sec ruling on monday the sec opened the forum for statements for or against or the action until may  the decisions will either herald overarching policy changes in the united states as virtual currencies are widely adapted to suit many purposes or will force those pushing approval to go back to the drawing board jeremy nation jeremy nation is a writer living in los angeles with interests in technology human rights and

first etherbased etf etherindex llc filed a registration statement and prospectus with the sec to offer an exchange traded fund based solely on the price of ether actions like this continue to cement ether’s standing in the virtual currency community by jeffrey berns july th  ethnewscom etherindex llc filed paperwork with the securities and exchange commission sec seeking registration under the securities act of  for an exchange traded fund etf based on ether the cryptocurrency used in the ethereum network this filing is a sign of the growing confidence and support for ether and the ethereum network if it is approved for trading this etf will broaden ethereum’s exposure to investors globally and potentially legitimize the cryptocurrency as a worthy asset class that allows for additional portfolio diversification  this etf filing is the third for a cryptocurrency with the sec gemini and solidx each filed for a bitcoin etf earlier this year an etf is a marketable security that tracks an index a commodity bonds or a basket of assets like an index fund unlike mutual funds an etf trades like a common stock on a stock exchange etfs experience price changes throughout the day as they are bought and sold etfs typically have higher daily liquidity and lower fees than mutual fund shares making them an attractive alternative for individual investors it is important to note that when investing with an etf the investor does not own any of the underlying assets rather the investor owns shares of the etf the shares in the etf represent units of fractional undivided beneficial interest in the net assets of the trust this etf if approved will allow individual investors to invest in the performance of ether without having to go through the administrative steps necessary to purchase and own ether directly  according to the prospectus the etf’s purpose is to “provide shareholders with exposure to the daily change in the us dollar price of ether before expenses and liabilities of the trust and as a result the value of the shares is directly related to the value of ether held by the trust… the trust is authorized solely to take immediate delivery of actual ether and is designed for investors seeking a costeffective and convenient means of gaining investment exposure to ether similar to a direct investment in ether” the approval of any virtual currencybased etf is far from assured as the sec has not formally asserted regulatory authority over cryptocurrencies however the sec has indicated a willingness to pursue action against persons or entities who misuse bitcoin in connection with fraudulent schemes inaccurate and inadequate publicly disseminated information and the offering of unregistered securities this filing with the sec is further evidence of the continued legitimization of virtual currencies moreover the fact that the sponsors of this etf have chosen ether as an investment vehicle even after the recent dao issues demonstrates their view that ether and the ethereum network have longterm staying power and are poised for continued growth jeffrey berns jeffrey k berns is the managing partner and head of the los angeles office

agreement are collectively referred to herein as the “trust documents”   the regulatory environment   the ethereum network is a recent technological innovation and the ether that is created transferred used and stored by entities and individuals have certain features associated with several types of assets most notably commodities and currencies apart from the us commodity futures trading commission “cftc” the financial crimes enforcement network of the us department of the treasury “fincen” and the us internal revenue service “irs” most major us regulators such as the sec have yet to make official pronouncements or adopt rules providing guidance with respect to the classification and treatment of ether and other digital assets including bitcoin for purposes of commodities tax and securities laws although the sec has not opined on the legal characterization of ether as a security it has taken various actions against persons or entities misusing cryptocurrency similar to ether in connection with fraudulent schemes ie ponzi scheme inaccurate and inadequate publicly disseminated information and the offering of unregistered securities commissioners of the cftc initially expressed the belief that bitcoin a digital asset similar to ether meets the definition of a commodity and that the cftc has regulatory authority over futures and other derivatives based on digital assets subject to facts and circumstances the cftc also espoused the view that on balance the important features of bitcoin and other digital assets are those that are characteristics of commodities and therefore has referred to and discussed these assets as such on september   when the cftc instituted and settled administrative proceedings that involved a bitcoin derivatives trading platform and its chief executive officer the “coinflip case” the order in the coinflip case found that the respondents i conducted activity related to commodity options transactions without complying with the provisions of the commodity exchange act of  as amended “cea” and cftc regulations and ii operated a facility for the trading of swaps without registering the facility as a swap execution facility “sef” or designated contract market “dcm” the coinflip order was significant as it is the first time the cftc determined that bitcoin is properly defined as a commodity under the cea based on this determination the cftc applied cea provisions and cftc regulations that apply to transactions in commodity options and swaps to the conduct of the bitcoin derivatives trading platform significantly the cftc appears to have taken the position that digital assets are not encompassed by the definition of currency under the cea and cftc regulations the cftc defined “virtual currencies” also known as digital assets as “a digital representation of value that functions as a medium of exchange a unit of account andor a store of value but does not have legal tender status in any jurisdiction ether and other virtual currencies are distinct from ‘real’ currencies which are the coin and paper money of the united states or another country that are designated as legal tender circulate and are customarily used and accepted as a medium of exchange in the country of issuance”        table of contents   it is not known whether all us or foreign regulators will share this view adopt a single different view or espouse a variety of differing views to date a us magistrate judge in the us district court for the eastern district of texas and the german ministry of finance have ruled that bitcoin a digitial asset is a “form of money” and a “unit of account” respectively and the irs has classified bitcoin as property that is not currency for us federal income tax purposes although the degree to which such interpretations will become the norm is unknown the new york state department of taxation and finance citing the irs classification defined digital assets as “intangible property” and a number of other states have issued their own guidance regarding the tax treatment of bitcoin for state income or sales tax purposes   in july  the nysdfs proposed the first us regulatory framework for licensing participants in “virtual currency business activity” the proposed regulations known as the “bitlicense” are intended to focus on consumer protection and after the closure of an initial comment period that yielded  formal public comments and a reproposal the nysdfs issued its final “bitlicense” regulatory framework in june  the “bitlicense” regulates the conduct of businesses that are involved in “virtual currencies” in new york or with new york customers and prohibits any person or entity involved in such activity to conduct activities without a license   in march  the newyork state department of financial services “nysdfs” issued a public order initiating a process for accepting charter applications for virtual currency exchanges under the existing new york banking law   ether has only recently been created as a digital asset ether is created transferred and stored on the ethereum network a network of computers all running the ethereum blockchain a beta version of its live blockchain was publicly launched in july  and the production version was launched in march  as a consequence of its recent emergence as a digital asset ether has not been the subject of any known regulatory action however ether is similar to bitcoin a digital asset that has been in existence for a greater period of time and has received regulatory attention the sponsor believes that ether will be treated by regulatory authorities in the same manner as they treat bitcoin   bitcon has been characterized as a virtual commodity digital asset digital currency and virtual currency by other international regulatory bodies since december  regulators in jurisdictions including the united states the united kingdom and switzerland have provided greater regulatory clarity while chinese russian icelandic and vietnamese government officials have taken steps to limit the participation of their respective financial services sectors from directly interacting with the bitcoin ecosystem creating additional regulatory uncertainty in those countries in may  the central bank of bolivia banned the use of digital assets as currency while the government of ecuador took steps to limit the use of bitcoin in advance of the issuance of a proposed statebacked digital asset in april  the japanese cabinet approved proposed legal changes that would reportedly treat digital assets as included in the definition of currency these regulations would among other things require market participants including exchanges to meet certain compliance requirements and be subject to oversight by the financial services agency a japanese regulator these changes were approved by the japanese diet in may  and are expected to be effective beginning in  the regulatory uncertainty surrounding the treatment of ether creates risks for the trust and its shares see “risk factors—risk factors related to the regulation of the trust and the shares”   the sponsor believes the trust to be the first exchangetraded product “etp” in the united states that seeks to track the price of ether   the shares are speculative and investing in them involves a high degree of risk see “risk factors”

subject to a number of risk factors set forth below   risk factors related to the ethereum network and ether   the ethereum network has only recently been deployed   the ethereum network and the ethereum network software are in their early stages the production version of the blockchain on the ethereum network was only recently launched in march  as a result the ethereum network has had fewer attacks and has undergone less testing the the older more established bitcoin network   because of its infancy as a digital asset ether has experienced sharp fluctuations in value since its initial trading ether has experienced oneday onemonth and sinceinception changes of   and  respectively if such volatility continues it may have an adverse affect on the willingness of parties other than speculators or those that need ether to use the ethereum network to receive ether in a transaction   the ethereum network is also in a state of evolution ether is currently awarded to miners based upon “proof of work” but there are plans for it to change awards to to a “proof of stake” model in         table of contents   vitalik buterin  a founder and leading proponent of the ethereum network has been quoted as acknowledging that there is always a chance that the ethereum project will fail     the loss or destruction of a private key required to transfer the trust’s ether holdings may be irreversible and would adversely affect an investment in the shares   ether can only be transferred with the private key associated with the ethereum network public address in which the ether is held the trust safeguards and securely stores the private keys associated with the trust’s ethereum network public addresses by engaging the custodian to the extent a private key is lost destroyed exfiltrated or otherwise compromised and no backup of the private key is accessible the custodian will be unable to transfer the trust’s ether held in the public addresses associated with that private key consequently the ether associated with that public address will effectively be lost which would adversely affect an investment in the shares   the limit on the supply of ether is uncertain   unlike bitcoin which has a fixed limit of  bitcoin no limit has been established on the total supply of ether the initial creation of ether was in connection with a crowd funding transaction in  in which  ether were pre sold another  ether were created to the development fund most of it going to early contributors and developers and the remaining to the ethereum foundation all additional ether have been and will be created through the mining process it has been reported that approximately  million ether have been created to date through the mining process according to the terms of the  presale the issuance of ether from mining is capped at  ether per year however it is expected that in  the ethereum nework will switched from proof of work to a new consensus algorithm under development called casper that is expected to be more efficient and require less mining subsidy while the ethereum foundation has stated that it is expected that the current maximum is considered a ceiling and the new issuance under casper will not exceed it and is expected to be much less there is no assurance that will be the case   the creation and exchange of ether are not the sole puposes of the ethereum network   the ethereum network is an alternative decentralized ledger protocol with an ideological lineage that contains as much bittorrent java and freenet as it does bitcoin it is a generalpurpose global blockchain that can govern both financial and nonfinancial types of application states in its essence the ethereum network enables decentralized business logic also known as “smart contracts” represented as cryptographic “boxes” that contain value and only unlock it if certain conditions are met smart contracts are capable of automatically enforcing the terms of a given agreement among a number of parties this code can define strict rules and consequences in the same way that a traditional legal document would stating the obligations benefits and penalties which may be due to either party in various different circumstances but unlike a traditional contract it can also take information as an input process that information through the rules set out in the contract and take any actions required of it as a result   given this alternate focus of the ethereum network it does not have the same single focus as the bitcoin network   acceptance of the ethereum network and other digital asset systems are subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate could affect the price of the shares   the adoption of ether will require growth in its usage and an accommodating regulatory environment the trust is not actively managed and will not have any strategy relating to the development of the ethereum network and changes in the regulatory environment furthermore the sponsor cannot be certain as to the impact of the listing of the trust and the expansion of its ether holdings on the digital asset industry and the ethereum network a decline in the popularity or acceptance of the ethereum network may harm the price of the shares there is no assurance that the ethereum network or the service providers necessary to accommodate it will continue in existence or grow furthermore there is no assurance that the availability of and access to digital asset service providers will not be negatively affected by government regulation or supply and demand of ether        table of contents   currently there is little or no use of ether in the retail and commercial marketplace in comparison to relatively extensive use by speculators and miners thus contributing to price volatility that could adversely affect an investment in the shares   as a relatively new product and technology ether and the ethereum network have not yet been accepted as a means of payment for goods and services by major retail and commercial outlets banks and other established financial institutions may refuse to process funds for ether transactions process wire transfers to or from ether exchanges etherrelated companies or service providers or maintain accounts for persons or entities transacting in ether conversely a significant portion of ether demand is generated by speculators and investors seeking to profit from the short or longterm holding of ether and those that mine ether on the ethereum network price volatility undermines ether’s role as a medium of exchange as retailers are much less likely to accept it as a form of payment market capitalization for ether as a medium of exchange and payment method may always be low a lack of expansion by ether into retail and commercial markets or a contraction of such use may result in increased volatility or a reduction in the value of ether either of which could adversely impact an investment in the shares   a disruption of the internet would affect the ethereum network and the ability to transfer ether   the ethereum network’s functionality depends on the internet a significant disruption in internet connectivity could disrupt the ethereum network’s operations until the disruption is resolved and have an adverse effect on the price of the shares   intellectual property rights claims may adversely affect the operation of the ethereum network   third parties may assert intellectual property claims relating to the holding and transfer of digital assets and their source code regardless of the merit of any intellectual property or other legal action any threatened action that reduces confidence in the ethereum network’s longterm viability or the ability of endusers to hold and transfer ether may adversely affect an investment in the shares additionally a meritorious intellectual property claim could prevent the trust and other endusers from accessing the ethereum network or holding or transferring their ether which could force the termination of the trust and the liquidation of the trust’s ether if such liquidation of the trust’s ether is possible as a result an intellectual property claim against the trust or other large ethereum network participants could adversely affect an investment in the shares   risk factors related to the ethereum exchange market     the value of the shares relates directly to the value of the ether held by the trust and fluctuations in the price of ether could adversely affect an investment in the shares   the trust’s purpose is to provide shareholders with exposure to the daily change in the us dollar price of ether before expenses and liabilities of the trust as measured by the etherindex price as a result the value of the shares is directly related to the value of ether held by the trust the price of ether has fluctuated widely since trading commenced in  several factors may affect the market price of ether including but not limited to   ● global ether supply       ● the adoption of and demand for ether which will be influenced by retail merchants’ and commercial businesses’ acceptance of ether as payment for goods and services if it occurs the security of online ether exchanges and public ether addresses that hold ether the perception that the use and holding of ether is safe and secure and an accommodating regulatory environment       ● investors’ expectations with respect to the rate of inflation       ● interest rates       ● currency exchange rates including the rates at which ether may be exchanged for fiat currencies       ● fiat currency withdrawal and deposit policies of the ether exchanges and liquidity on the ether exchanges       ● interruptions in service from or failures of the ether exchanges       ● investment and trading activities of large investors including private and registered funds that may directly or indirectly invest in ether       ● monetary policies of governments trade restrictions currency devaluations and revaluations        table of contents   ● regulatory measures if any that restrict the use of ether as a form of payment or the purchase of ether on the ether market       ● the maintenance and development of the opensource software protocol of the ethereum network       ● global or regional political economic or financial events and situations and       ● expectations among ether economy participants that the value of ether will soon change   in addition investors should be aware that there is no assurance that ether will maintain its value in the long or intermediate term in the event that the price of ether declines the sponsor expects the value of an investment in the shares to decline proportionately   pricing on the ether exchanges may continue to be volatile and can adversely affect an investment in the shares   the price of ether on the public ether exchanges has a limited one year history during such history ether prices on the ether exchanges have been volatile since its initial trading ether has experienced oneday onemonth and sinceinception changes of   and  respectively   the trust will transact ether on a limited number of ether exchanges either because of actual or perceived counterparty or other risks related to a particular ether exchange trading on a limited number of ether exchanges may result in less favorable prices and decreased liquidity for the trust and therefore could have an adverse effect on the trust and shareholders   the ether exchanges on which ether trades are relatively new and in most cases largely unregulated and therefore may be more exposed to fraud and failure than established regulated exchanges for other products any fraud security failure or operational issues experienced by the ether exchanges could result in a reduction in the value of ether and adversely affect an investment in the shares   the ether exchanges on which ether trades are new and in most cases largely unregulated furthermore many ether exchanges do not provide the public with significant information regarding their ownership structure management teams corporate practices or regulatory compliance as a result the marketplace may lose confidence in or may experience problems relating to ether exchanges including prominent exchanges handling a significant portion of the volume of ether trading ether exchanges may impose daily weekly monthly or customerspecific transaction or distribution limits or suspend withdrawals entirely rendering the exchange of virtual currency for fiat currency difficult or impossible the participation in ether exchanges requires users to take on credit risk by transferring ether from a personal account to a third party’s account   over the past four  years a number of digital asset exchanges have been closed due to fraud failure or security breaches in many of these instances the customers of such digital asset exchanges were not compensated or made whole for the partial or complete losses of their account balances in such digital asset exchanges while smaller digital asset exchanges are less likely to have the infrastructure and capitalization that make larger digital asset exchanges more stable larger digital asset exchanges are more likely to be appealing targets for hackers and “malware” ie software used or programmed by attackers to disrupt computer operation gather sensitive information or gain access to private computer systems in  the largest bitcoin exchange at the time mt gox filed for bankruptcy in japan amid reports the exchange lost up to  bitcoin valued then at over  million   a lack of stability in the ether exchange market and the closure or temporary shutdown of ether exchanges due to fraud business failure hackers or malware or governmentmandated regulation may reduce confidence in the ethereum network and result in greater volatility in the market price of ether these potential consequences of an ether exchange’s failure could adversely affect an investment in the shares        table of contents   the shares may trade at a discount or premium in the trading price relative to the nav as a result of nonconcurrent trading hours between exchange and the ether exchanges   the value of the shares may be influenced by nonconcurrent trading hours between exchange and various ether exchanges while exchange is open for trading in the shares for a limited period each day the ether exchanges are a hour marketplace in addition trading volume and liquidity on the ether exchanges is not consistent throughout the day and exchanges for digital assets including the largervolume markets have been known to shut down temporarily or permanently due to security concerns directed denial of service attack and other reasons as a result during periods when exchange is open but large ether exchanges or a substantial number of smaller ether exchanges are either lightly traded or are closed trading spreads and the resulting premium or discount on the shares may widen and therefore increase the difference between the price of the shares and the nav premiums or discounts may have an adverse effect on an investment in the shares if a shareholder sells or acquires its shares during a period of discount or premium respectively   to the extent that ether prices on the ether exchanges move negatively during hours when us equity markets are closed trading prices of the shares may “gap” down at market open   the value of a share may be influenced by nonconcurrent trading hours between us equity markets and various ether exchanges while us equity markets are open for trading in the shares for a limited period each day the ether exchanges are a hour marketplace during periods when us equity markets are closed but ether exchanges are open significant changes in the price of ether in the ether exchange market could result in a difference in performance between the price of ether and the most recent share price to the extent that the price of ether in the ether exchanges moves significantly in a negative direction after the close of us equity markets the trading price of the shares may “gap” down to the full extent of such negative price shift when us equity markets reopen to the extent that the price of ether in the ether exchange market drops significantly during hours in which us equity markets are closed investors may not be able to sell their shares until after the “gap” down has been fully realized resulting in an inability to mitigate losses in a rapidly negative market   a possible “short squeeze” due to a sudden increase in demand for the shares that largely exceeds supply may lead to price volatility in the shares   investors may purchase shares to hedge existing ether or other digital assets commodity or currency exposure or to speculate on the price of ether speculation on the price of ether may involve long and short exposures to the extent that aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of shares available for purchase for example in the event that large redemption requests by authorized participants dramatically affect share liquidity investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase shares for delivery to share lenders those repurchases may in turn dramatically increase the price of the shares until additional shares are created through the creation process this is often referred to as a “short squeeze” a short squeeze could lead to volatile price movements in the shares that are not directly correlated to the price of ether   purchasing activity in the ether exchanges associated with basket creation or selling activity following basket redemption may affect the price of ether and share trading prices these price changes may adversely affect an investment in the shares   purchasing activity associated with acquiring ether required for delivery to the trust in connection with the creation of baskets may increase the market price of ether on the ether exchanges which will result in higher prices for the shares increases in the market price of ether may also occur as a result of the purchasing activity of other market participants other market participants may attempt to benefit from an increase in the market price of ether that may result from increased purchasing activity of ether connected with the issuance of baskets consequently the market price of ether may decline immediately after baskets are created if the market price of ether declines the trading price of the shares will generally also decline   selling activity associated with sales of ether distributed by the trust in connection with the redemption of baskets may decrease the market price of ether on the ether exchanges which will result in lower prices for the shares decreases in the market price of ether may also occur as a result of the selling activity of other market participants if the market price of ether declines the trading price of the shares will generally also decline   an investment in the shares may be adversely affected by competition from other methods of investing in ether or from other digital assets   the trust will compete with direct investments in ether bitcoin and other potential financial vehicles possibly including other securities backed by or linked to ether and digital asset etps that are similar to the trust or that focus on other digital assets market and financial conditions and other conditions beyond the sponsor’s control may make it more attractive to invest in other financial vehicles including vehicles that focus on other digital assets or to invest in ether directly which could limit the market for the shares and reduce the liquidity of the shares        table of contents   the market price of ether may be affected by the sale of other digital asset etps or other financial instruments tracking the price of ether   to the extent digital asset etps other than the trust or other financial instruments such as futures contracts track the price of ether are formed or offered and represent a significant proportion of demand for ether large redemptions of the securities of these digital asset etps or other financial instruments or private funds holding ether could negatively affect the market price of ether and the nav   political or economic crises may motivate largescale sales of ether which could result in a reduction in the market price of ether and adversely affect an investment in the shares   the availability of other digital assets could have a negative impact on the price of ether and adversely affect an investment in the shares   ether is the second largets digial asset using a proof of work mining structure behind bitcoin as of may  there were approximately seven hundred  alternate digital assets or altcoins tracked by coinmarketcapcom having a total market capitalization including the market capitalization of ether of approximately  billion using market prices and total available supply of each digital asset this included digital assets using a “proof of work” mining structure similar to ether and those using a “proof of stake” transaction verification system that is different than ether’s mining system eg peercoin bitshares and nxt the emergence or growth alternative digital assets could have a negative impact on the demand for and price of ether and thereby adversely affect an investment in the shares   risk factors related to the trust and the shares    the sponsor and its management have no history of operating an investment vehicle like the trust and their experience may be inadequate or unsuitable to manage the trust   the sponsor was formed to be the sponsor of the trust and has no history of past performance in managing investment vehicles like the trust the past performance of the sponsor’s management in other positions including their experience in the commodities industry is no indication of their ability to manage an investment vehicle such as the trust if the sponsor is unable to manage an investment vehicle such as the trust the operations of the trust may be adversely affected   the trust invests solely in ether   other than cash held for working capital purposes the trust will invest solely in ether which is a new and highly speculative asset the ether held by the trust is commingled and investors have no specific rights to any specific ether in the event of the trust’s insolvency its assets may be inadequate to satisfy a claim by an investor the trust is not actively “managed” by traditional methods and it will not take any steps to minimize volatility or manage risk there is no assurance that this investment program will be successful ether is volatile and investment results may vary substantially over time the sponsor will not wind down the trust based solely on a drop in the trading price of ether regardless of how significant no assurance can be made that profits will be achieved or that substantial or complete losses will not be incurred   the value of the shares could decrease if unanticipated operational or trading problems arise    there may be unanticipated problems or issues with respect to the mechanics of the trust’s operations and the trading of the shares that could have an adverse effect on an investment in the shares in addition although the trust is not actively “managed” by traditional methods to the extent that unanticipated operational or trading problems or issues arise the sponsor’s past experience and qualifications may not be suitable for solving these problems or issues        table of contents   the lack of an active trading market for the shares may result in a loss on an investment in the shares when they are sold   although the shares will be listed on exchange there is no assurance that an active trading market will develop or be maintained for the shares even if an active trading market does develop it may not provide sufficient liquidity and the shaers may not trade at prices advantageous to investors if an investor wants to sell shares at a time when no active trading market exists for the shares the price received for the shares will likely be lower than the price an investor would receive if an active trading market did exist and accordingly the investor may experience a loss on the sale of the shares   the shares may trade at a price which is at above or below the nav and any discount or premium in the trading price relative to the nav may widen as a result of nonconcurrent trading hours   the shares may trade on exchange at above or below the nav the nav will fluctuate with changes in the market value of the trust’s assets the trading price of the shares will fluctuate in accordance with changes in the nav as well as market supply and demand which will be driven in large part by the price of ether the price difference may be due in large part to the fact that supply and demand forces at work in the secondary trading market for the shares are closely related but not identical to the same forces influencing the market price of ether consequently an authorized participant may be able to create or redeem a basket of shares at a discount or a premium to the public trading price per share   authorized participants or their clients or customers may have an opportunity to realize a riskless profit if they can create a basket at a discount to the public trading price of the shares or can redeem a basket at a premium over the public trading price of the shares the sponsor expects that the exploitation of such arbitrage opportunities by authorized participants and their clients and customers will tend to cause the public trading price to track the nav closely over time such arbitrage opportunities will not be available to shareholders who are not authorized participants   if authorized participants are able to purchase or sell large amounts of ether in the open market at prices that are different than the etherindex price the arbitrage mechanism intended to keep the price of the shares closely linked to the etherindex price may not function properly and the shares may trade at a discount or premium to the nav   the arbitrage mechanism on which the trust relies to keep the price of the shares closely linked to the etherindex price may not function properly if authorized participants are able to purchase or sell large amounts of ether in the open market at prices that are materially higher or lower than the etherindex price although the etherindex price is designed to accurately capture the market price of ether authorized participants may purchase ether for creation units or sell ether from creation unit redemptions on public or private markets or from ether exchanges not included in the etherindex and such transactions may take place at prices materially higher or lower than the etherindex price under either such circumstance the arbitrage mechanism will function to link the price of the shares to the prices at which authorized participants are able to purchase or sell large amounts of ether to the extent such prices differ materially from the etherindex price the price of the shares may no longer track whether temporarily or over time the etherindex price which could adversely impact an investment in the trust by reducing investors’ confidence in the shares’ ability to track the market price of ether and the etherindex price if the trust accepts cash from authorized participants for creations or agrees to provide cash to redeeming authorized participants there is no guarantee that the trust will be able to achieve a better than average market price for ether or will purchase ether at the most favorable price available the price of ether achieved by the trust may be affected generally by a wide variety of complex and difficult to predict factors such as ether supply and demand rewards and transaction fees for the recording of transactions on the blockchain availability and access to virtual currency service providers such as payment processors exchanges miners or other ether users and market participants perceived or actual ethereum network or ether security vulnerability inflation levels fiscal policy interest rates and political natural and economic events   if the processes of creation and redemption of baskets encounter any unanticipated difficulties the opportunities for arbitrage transactions intended to keep the price of the shares closely linked to the etherindex price may not exist and as a result the price of the shares may fall   if the processes of creation and redemption of the baskets which depend on timely transfers of ether to and from the custody accounts maintained by the custodian encounter any unanticipated difficulties including but not limited to the trust’s inability in the future to obtain regulatory approvals for the offer and sale of additional shares after the present offering is completed potential market participants who would otherwise be willing to purchase or redeem baskets to take advantage of any arbitrage opportunity arising from discrepancies between the price of the shares and the price of the underlying ether may not take the risk that as a result of those difficulties they may not be able to realize the profit they expect if this is the case the liquidity of the shares may decline and the price of the shares may fluctuate independently of the etherindex price and may fall        table of contents   the postponement suspension or rejection of creation basket orders or redemption basket orders as permitted in certain circumstances under the trust servicing agreement may adversely affect an investment in the shares   under the trust servicing agreement the administrator or sponsor may postpone suspend or reject creation basket orders or redemption basket orders as applicable for a variety of permitted reasons under certain circumstances to the extent such orders are postponed suspended or rejected the arbitrage mechanism resulting from the process through which authorized participants create and redeem shares directly with the trust may fail to closely link the price of the shares to the value of the underlying ether if this is the case the liquidity of the shares may decline and the price of the shares may fluctuate independently of the market price of ether and may fall   ether transactions are irrevocable and stolen or incorrectly transferred ether may be irretrievable as a result any incorrectly executed ether transactions by the trust could adversely affect an investment in the shares   ether transactions are not from an administrative perspective reversible without the consent and active participation of the recipient of the transaction once a transaction has been verified and recorded in a block that is added to the blockchain an incorrect transfer of ether or a theft of ether generally will not be reversible and the trust may not be capable of seeking compensation for any such transfer or theft although the trust’s transfers of ether will regularly be made to or from the authorized participants and to or from the sponsor custody account and the trust expense account each of which are custodied and administered by the custodian it is possible that through computer or human error or through theft or criminal action the trust’s ether could be transferred from the trust custody account in incorrect amounts or to unauthorized third parties to the extent that the trust is unable to seek a corrective transaction with such third party or is incapable of identifying the third party which has received the trust’s ether through error or theft the trust will be unable to revert or otherwise recover incorrectly transferred trust ether to the extent that the trust is unable to seek redress for such error or theft such loss could adversely affect an investment in the shares   the dao a decentralized autonomous organization created using the “smart contract” feature of the ethereum network recently had  million ether stolen by a hacker due to developer errors   the trust’s ether may be subject to loss damage theft or restriction on access   there is a risk that part or all of the trust’s ether could be lost stolen or destroyed potentially by the loss or theft of the private keys held by the custodian associated with the public ether addresses that hold the trust’s ether the sponsor believes that the trust’s ether held in the trust custody account will be an appealing target to hackers or malware distributors seeking to destroy damage or steal the trust’s ether or private keys neither the custodian nor the sponsor can guarantee that such loss damage or theft will not occur whether caused intentionally accidentally or by act of god access to the trust’s ether could also be restricted by natural events such as an earthquake or flood or human actions such as a terrorist attack any of these events may adversely affect the operations of the trust and consequently an investment in the shares   shareholders’ limited rights of legal recourse against the trust trustee sponsor administrator trust agency service provider and custodian and the trust’s lack of insurance protection expose the trust and the holders of the shares to the risk of loss of the trust’s ether for which no person is liable   the trust will not insure its ether the custodian will maintain insurance with regard to its custodial business on such terms and conditions as it considers appropriate in connection with its custodial obligations and will be responsible for all costs fees and expenses arising from the insurance policy or policies the trust will not be a beneficiary of any such insurance and does not have the ability to dictate the existence nature or amount of coverage therefore holders of the shares cannot be assured that the custodian will maintain adequate insurance or any insurance with respect to the ether held by the custodian on behalf of the trust furthermore shareholders’ recourse against the trust custodian and sponsor under new york law governing their custody operations is limited similarly shareholders’ recourse against the administrator and trust agency service provider for the services they provide to the trust including those relating to the provision of instructions relating to the movement of ether is limited consequently a loss may be suffered with respect to the trust’s ether which is not covered by insurance and for which no person is liable in damages        table of contents   ether held by the trust is not subject to fdic or sipc protections   the trust is not a banking institution or otherwise a member of the federal deposit insurance corporation “fdic” or securities investor protection corporation “sipc” and therefore deposits held with or assets held by the trust are not subject to the protections enjoyed by depositors with fdic or sipc member institutions the undivided interests in the trust’s ether represented by the shares in the trust are not insured   risks of uninsured losses   it may not be possible either because of a lack of available policies or because of prohibitive cost for the trust to obtain insurance of any type that would cover losses associated with ether in general the trust anticipates that any losses related to its activities and operations will be uninsurable or the cost of insuring against these losses may not be economically justifiable if an uninsured loss occurs or a loss exceeds policy limits the trust could lose all of its assets   risks relating to reliance on third party service providers   due to audit and operational needs there will be individuals who have information regarding the trust’s or the custodian’s operations financials or security measures any of those individuals may purposely or inadvertently leak such information which could adversely affect an investment in the shares   the trust may not have adequate sources of recovery if its ether is lost stolen or destroyed   if the trust’s ether is lost stolen or destroyed under circumstances rendering a party liable to the trust the responsible party may not have the financial resources sufficient to satisfy the trust’s claim for example as to a particular event of loss the only source of recovery for the trust might be limited to the custodian or to the extent identifiable other responsible third parties eg a thief or terrorist any of which may not have the financial resources including liability insurance coverage to satisfy a valid claim of the trust furthermore to our knowledge at this time there is no us or foreign governmental regulatory investigative or prosecutorial authority or mechanism through which to bring an action or complaint regarding missing or stolen ether consequently the trust may be unable to replace missing ether or seek reimbursement for any erroneous transfer or theft of ether to the extent that the trust is unable to seek redress for such action error or theft such loss could adversely affect an investment in the shares   the liquidity of the shares may also be affected by the withdrawal from participation of one or more authorized participants   in the event that one or more authorized participants having substantial interests in shares or otherwise responsible for a significant portion of the shares’ daily trading volume on exchange withdraw from participation the liquidity of the shares will likely decrease which could adversely affect the market price of the shares and adversely affect an investment in the shares   as a new fund there is no guarantee that an active trading market for the shares will develop to the extent that no active trading market develops on exchange and the assets of the trust do not reach a viable size the liquidity of the shares may be limited or the trust may be terminated at the option of the sponsor    as a new fund there can be no assurance that the trust will grow to or maintain an economically viable size in which case the sponsor may elect to terminate the trust which could result in the liquidation of the trust’s ether at a time that is disadvantageous to an investor in the shares additionally there is no guarantee that an active trading market will develop and that the shares will be liquid on exchange a reduction in the liquidity of the shares on exchange could adversely affect an investment in the shares        table of contents   the lack of a market for the shares may limit the ability of holders to sell their shares   there has been no market for the shares and there can be no assurance that an active trading market for the shares will be developed or maintained if an active trading market for the shares does not exist or continue to exist the market prices and liquidity of the shares may be adversely affected   the trust may be required to terminate and liquidate at a time that is disadvantageous to the holders of the shares    if the trust is required to terminate and liquidate such termination and liquidation could occur at a time that is disadvantageous to shareholders such as when the price of ether is lower than it was at the time when shareholders purchased their shares in such a case when the trust’s ether is sold as part of the trust’s liquidation the resulting proceeds distributed to shareholders will be less than if the price of ether were higher at the time of sale see “description of the trust agreement—termination of the trust” for more information about the termination of the trust including when the termination of the trust may be triggered by events outside the direct control of the sponsor the trustee or shareholders   holders of the shares will not have the rights enjoyed by investors in certain other vehicles   as interests in an investment trust the shares have none of the statutory rights normally associated with the ownership of shares of a corporation including for example the right to bring “oppression” or “derivative” actions in addition the shares have limited voting and distribution rights for example shareholders do not have the right to elect directors and will not receive dividends see “description of the shares” for a description of the limited rights of shareholders   the administrator is solely responsible for determining the price of ether and any errors discontinuance or changes in such valuation calculations may have an adverse effect on the value of the shares   the administrator will calculate the nav using the etherindex price on each business day to the extent that such price of ether and the resulting nav is incorrectly calculated the administrator will not be liable for any error and such misreporting of valuation data could adversely affect an investment in the shares   extraordinary expenses resulting from unanticipated events may become payable by the trust adversely affecting an investment in the shares   in consideration for the sponsor’s fee the sponsor has contractually assumed certain operational and periodic expenses of the trust see “business of the trust—trust expenses” extraordinary expenses of the trust eg expenses relating to litigation and any other expenses that are not assumed by the sponsor under the terms of the trust agreement are borne by the trust and paid through the sale of the trust’s ether any incurring of extraordinary expenses by the trust could adversely affect an investment in the shares   the trust’s transfer or sale of ether to pay expenses or other operations of the trust could result in holders of the shares incurring tax liability without an associated distribution from the trust   each delivery transfer or sale of ether by the trust to pay the sponsor’s fee or other expenses will be a taxable event for the holders of the shares this or other operations of the trust could result holders of the shares incurring tax liability without an associated distribution from the trust any tax liability could adversely impact an investment in the shares and may cause holders of the shares to be required to prepare and file additional tax documents see “united states federal income tax consequences—taxation of us holders”   the sale of the trust’s ether to pay expenses not assumed by the sponsor at a time of low ether prices could adversely affect the value of the shares   the administrator will transfer ether held by the trust to the trust expense account to pay trust expenses not assumed by the sponsor on an asneeded basis irrespective of thencurrent ether prices on the ether exchanges the trust is not actively managed and no attempt will be made to buy or sell ether to protect against or to take advantage of fluctuations in the price of ether consequently the trust’s ether may be sold at a time when the prices of ether on the ether exchange market are low resulting in a negative impact on the value of the shares        table of contents   the value of the shares will be adversely affected if the trust is required to indemnify the sponsor the trustee the administrator the trust agency service provider or the custodian under the trust documents   under the trust documents each of the sponsor the trustee the administrator the trust agency service provider and the custodian has a right to be indemnified by the trust for any liability or expense it incurs without gross negligence bad faith or willful misconduct on its part therefore the sponsor trustee administrator trust agency service provider or custodian may require that the assets of the trust be sold in order to cover losses or liability suffered by it any sale of that kind would reduce the net asset value of the trust and the nav   intellectual property rights claims may adversely affect the trust and an investment in the shares   the sponsor is not aware of any intellectual property claims that may prevent the trust from operating and holding ether however third parties may assert intellectual property claims relating to the operation of the trust and the mechanics instituted for the investment in holding of and transfer of ether regardless of the merit of an intellectual property or other legal action any legal expenses to defend or payments to settle such claims would be extraordinary expenses and be borne by the trust through the sale of the trust’s ether additionally a meritorious intellectual property claim could prevent the trust from operating and force the administrator to terminate the trust and liquidate the trust’s ether as a result an intellectual property claim against the trust could adversely affect an investment in the shares   risk factors related to the regulation of the trust and the shares    holders of the shares will not have the protections associated with ownership of shares in an investment company registered under the investment company act or the protections afforded by the cea   the trust is not registered as an investment company under the investment company act and the sponsor believes that the trust is not required to register under such act consequently holders of the shares will not have the regulatory protections provided to investors in investment companies   the trust will not hold or trade in commodity futures contracts regulated by the cea as administered by the cftc furthermore the sponsor believes that the trust is not a commodity pool for purposes of the cea and that neither the sponsor nor the trustee is subject to regulation by the cftc as a commodity pool operator or a commodity trading advisor in connection with the operation of the trust consequently holders of the shares will not have the regulatory protections provided to investors in cearegulated instruments or commodity pools   regulatory changes or actions may alter the nature of an investment in the shares or restrict the use of ether or the operation of the ethereum network in a manner that adversely affects an investment in the shares    until recently little or no regulatory attention has been directed toward digital assets by us federal and state governments foreign governments and selfregulatory agencies as digital assets including bitcoin and ether have grown in popularity and in market size the federal reserve board us congress and certain us agencies eg the cftc fincen and the federal bureau of investigation have begun to examine the nature of digital assets and the markets on which they are traded   the sec has not formally asserted regulatory authority over digital assets although it has taken various actions against persons or entities misusing bitcoin in connection with fraudulent schemes ie ponzi scheme inaccurate and inadequate publicly disseminated information and the offering of unregistered securities commissioners of the cftc have expressed the belief that bitcoin meets the definition of a commodity and that the cftc has regulatory authority over futures and other derivatives based on digital assets subject to facts and circumstances on september   the cftc instituted and settled an action against coinflip a bitcoin derivatives trading platform the coinflip order found that the respondents i conducted activity related to commodity options transactions without complying with the provisions of the cea and cftc regulations and ii operated a facility for the trading of swaps without registering the facility as a sef or dcm the coinflip order was significant as it is the first time the cftc determined that virtual currencies are properly defined as commodities under the cea based on this determination the cftc applied cea provisions and cftc regulations that apply to transactions in commodity options and swaps to the conduct of the bitcoin derivatives trading platform significantly the cftc appears to have taken the position that virtual currencies are not encompassed by the definition of currency under the cea and cftc regulations the cftc defined “virtual currencies” as “a digital representation of value that functions as a medium of exchange a unit of account andor a store of value but does not have legal tender status in any jurisdiction bitcoin and other virtual currencies are distinct from ‘real’ currencies which are the coin and paper money of the united states or another country that are designated as legal tender circulate and are customarily used and accepted as a medium of exchange in the country of issuance” to the extent that ether itself is determined to be a security commodity future or other regulated asset or to the extent that a us or foreign government or quasigovernmental agency exerts regulatory authority over the ethereum network or ether trading and ownership trading or ownership in ether or the shares may be adversely affected        table of contents   the cftc affirmed its approach to the regulation of digital assets and virtual currencyrelated enterprises on june   when the cftc settled charges against bitfinex a bitcoin exchange based in hong kong in its order the cftc found that bitfinex engaged in “illegal offexchange commodity transactions and failed to register as a futures commission merchant” when it facilitated borrowing transactions among its users to permit the trading of bitcoin on a “leveraged margined or financed basis” without first registering with the cftc    local state regulators such as the nysdfs have also considered virtual currencies and the regulation thereof in july  the nysdfs proposed the first us regulatory framework for licensing participants in “virtual currency business activity” the proposed regulations known as the “bitlicense” are intended to focus on consumer protection and after the closure of an initial comment period that yielded  formal public comments and a reproposal the nysdfs issued its final “bitlicense” regulatory framework in june  the “bitlicense” regulates the conduct of businesses that are involved in “virtual currencies” in new york or with new york customers and prohibits any person or entity involved in such activity to conduct activities without a license   the irs has released guidance treating bitcoin as property that is not currency for us federal income tax purposes taxing authorities of a number of us states have also issued their own guidance regarding the tax treatment of bitcoin for state income or sales tax purposes   on june   california repealed a provision of its corporations code that prohibited corporations from using alternative forms of currency or value the bill indirectly authorizes bitcoin’s use as an alternative form of money in the state   to the extent that future regulatory actions or policies limit the ability to exchange ether or utilize ether for payments the demand for ether will be reduced and authorized participants may not seek to redeem baskets in exchange for redemption proceeds in ether furthermore regulatory actions may limit the ability of endusers to convert ether into fiat currency eg us dollars or use ether to pay for goods and services such regulatory actions or policies would result in a reduction of the value of ether and the price of the shares   digital assets currently face an uncertain regulatory landscape in not only the united states but also in many foreign jurisdictions such as the european union china and russia while certain governments such as germany—where the ministry of finance has declared bitcoin to be “rechnungseinheiten” a form of private money that is recognized as a unit of account but not recognized in the same manner as fiat currency—have issued guidance as to how to treat bitcoin most regulatory bodies have not yet issued official statements regarding intention to regulate or determinations on regulation of digital assets among those for which preliminary guidance has been issued in some form canada and taiwan have labeled bitcoin as a digital or virtual currency distinct from fiat currency while sweden and norway are among those to categorize bitcoin as a form of virtual asset or commodity in china a recent government notice classified bitcoin as legal and “virtual commodities” however the same notice restricted the banking and payment industries from using bitcoin creating uncertainty and limiting the ability of bitcoin exchanges to operate in the thensecond largest bitcoin market since december  china iceland vietnam and russia have taken a more restrictive stance toward bitcoin and thereby have reduced the rate of expansion of bitcoin use in each country in may  the central bank of bolivia banned the use of bitcoin as a means of payment in the summer and fall of  ecuador announced plans for its own statebacked electronic money while passing legislation that prohibits the use of decentralized digital assets such as bitcoin in january  the people’s bank of china china’s central bank disclosed that it has been studying a statebacked electronic monetary system and potentially had plans for its own statebacked electronic money in april  it was reported that the russian finance ministry is considering proposing regulations that would prohibit the issuance of all digital assets or their use in exchange for goods or services in russia conversely regulatory bodies in some countries such as india and switzerland have declined to exercise regulatory authority when afforded the opportunity in april  the japanese cabinet approved proposed legal changes that would reportedly treat bitcoin and other digital assets as included in the definition of currency these regulations would among other things require market participants including exchanges to meet certain compliance requirements and be subject to oversight by the financial services agency a japanese regulator these changes were approved by the japanese diet in may  and are expected to be effective beginning in  various foreign jurisdictions may in the near future adopt laws regulations or directives that affect the ethereum network and its users particularly ether exchanges and service providers that fall within such jurisdictions’ regulatory scope such laws regulations or directives may conflict with those of the united states and may negatively impact the acceptance of ether by users merchants and service providers outside of the united states and may therefore impede the growth of the ether economy        table of contents   the effect of any future change in the regulation of digital assets is impossible to predict but such change could be substantial and adverse to the trust or the value of the shares   it may be illegal now or in the future to acquire own hold sell or use ether in one or more countries and ownership of holding or trading in the shares may also be considered illegal and subject to sanction   although currently ether is not regulated or are lightly regulated in most countries including the united states one or more countries such as china iceland vietnam and russia may take regulatory actions in the future that severely restricts the right to acquire own hold sell or use ether or to exchange ether for fiat currency such an action may also result in the restriction of ownership holding or trading in the shares such a restriction could result in the termination and liquidation of the trust at a time that is disadvantageous to the holders of shares or may adversely affect an investment in the shares   if regulatory changes or interpretations of the trust’s activities require the registration of the trust as a msb under the regulations promulgated by fincen under the authority of the us bank secrecy act or licensing or other registration of the trust as a money transmitter or equivalent designation under state law in any state in which the trust operates compliance with these requirements would result in extraordinary expenses to the trust or the termination of the trust   to the extent that the activities of the trust cause it to be deemed a msb under the regulations promulgated by fincen under the authority of the us bank secrecy act the trust may be required to comply with fincen regulations including those that would mandate the trust to implement antimoney laundering programs make certain reports to fincen and maintain certain records   to the extent that the activities of the trust cause it to be deemed a “money transmitter” or equivalent designation under state law in any state in which the trust operates the trust may be required to seek a license or otherwise register with a state regulator and comply with state regulations that may including the implementation of antimoney laundering programs maintenance of certain records and other operational requirements currently the nysdfs has finalized its “bitlicense” framework for businesses that conduct “virtual currency business activity” the conference of state bank supervisors has proposed a model form of state level “virtual currency” regulation and additional state regulators including those from california idaho virginia and washington have made public statements indicating that virtual currency businesses may be required to seek licenses as money transmitters in numerous other states including connecticut north carolina new hampshire and new jersey legislation is being proposed or has been introduced regarding the treatment of digital assets   such additional federal or state regulatory obligations may cause the trust to incur extraordinary expenses possibly affecting an investment in the shares in a material and adverse manner furthermore the trust and its service providers may not be capable of complying with certain federal or state regulatory obligations applicable to msbs and mts if the sponsor is deemed to be subject to and determines not to comply with such additional regulatory and registration requirements the sponsor will act to dissolve and liquidate the trust any such termination could result in the liquidation of the trust’s ether at a time that is disadvantageous to a holder of the shares   if regulatory changes or interpretations require the regulation of ether under the cea by the cftc andor under the securities act and investment company act by the sec compliance with these requirements would result in extraordinary expenses to the trust or the terminatation of the trust   current and future legislation cftc and sec rulemaking and other regulatory developments including interpretations released by a regulatory authority may impact the manner in which ether is treated for classification and clearing purposes as of the date of this prospectus the sponsor is not aware of any proposals to regulate ether as commodity futures or securities the sponsor and the trust cannot be certain as to how future regulatory developments will impact the treatment of ether under the law        table of contents   to the extent that ether is deemed to fall within the definition of a commodity future pursuant to subsequent rulemaking by the cftc the trust and the sponsor may be required to register and comply with additional regulation under the cea including additional periodic report and disclosure standards and requirements moreover the sponsor may be required to register as a commodity pool operator and to register the trust as a commodity pool with the cftc through the national futures association such additional registrations may result in extraordinary expenses of the trust and adversely impact the value of the shares if the sponsor determined not to comply with such additional regulatory and registration requirements the sponsor would dissolve and liquidate the trust any such termination could result in the liquidation of the trust’s ether at a time that is disadvantageous to a holder of the shares   to the extent that ether is deemed to fall within the definition of a security pursuant to subsequent rulemaking by the sec the trust and the sponsor may be required to register and comply with additional regulation under the investment company act including additional periodic reporting and disclosure standards and requirements and the registration of the trust as an investment company moreover the sponsor may be required to register as an investment adviser under the investment advisers act of  such additional registrations may result in extraordinary expenses of the trust and adversely impact the value of the shares if the sponsor determined not to comply with such additional regulatory and registration requirements the sponsor would dissolve and liquidate the trust any such termination could result in the liquidation of the trust’s ether at a time that is disadvantageous to a holder of the shares   if federal or state legislatures or agencies initiate or release tax determinations that change the classification of ether as property for tax purposes in the context of when such ether is held as an investment such determination could have negative tax consequences for the trust or the holders of the shares   current irs guidance treats and taxes digital assets such as ether as property and treats transactions involving the payment of digital assets for goods and services as barter transactions while this treatment creates a potential tax reporting requirement in any circumstance where the ownership of ether passes from one person to another usually by means of ether transactions including offblockchain transactions as defined in “overview of the ether industry and market—introduction to ether and the ethereum network” it allows for the possibility of capital gains treatment   a number of states have issued their own guidance regarding the tax treatment of digital assets for state income or sales tax purposes the nysdtf for example has issued guidance regarding the application of state tax law to digital assets such as ether the agency determined that new york state would follow irs guidance with respect to the treatment of digital assets such as ether for state income tax purposes furthermore the nysdtf concluded that digital assets such as ether are a form of “intangible property” meaning that transactions using ether to purchase goods or services may be subject to state sales tax under barter transaction treatment if a state adopts a different treatment such treatment may have negative consequences for investors in ether including the potential imposition of a greater tax burden on investors in ether or the potential imposition of greater costs on the acquisition and disposition of ether in either case such different tax treatment may potentially have a negative effect on prices in the ether exchange market and a negative impact on the value of the shares   foreign jurisdictions may also elect to treat digital assets such as ether differently for tax purposes than the irs or the nysdtf to the extent a foreign jurisdiction with a significant share of the market of ether users imposes onerous tax burdens on ether users or imposes sales or value added tax on purchases and sales of ether for fiat currency such actions could result in decreased demand for ether in such jurisdiction which could impact the price of ether and negatively impact an investment in the shares accounting standards may also change creating an obligation to accrue for a tax liability that was not previously required to be accrued for or in situations where it is not expected that will directly or indirectly be ultimately subject to such tax liability        table of contents   risk factors related to potential conflicts of interest    potential conflicts of interest may arise among the sponsor or its affiliates and the trust the sponsor and its affiliates have no fiduciary duties to the trust and its shareholders which may permit them to favor their own interests to the detriment of the trust and its shareholders   the sponsor will manage the business and affairs of the trust conflicts of interest may arise among the sponsor and its affiliates  on the one hand and the trust and holders of the shares on the other hand as a result of these conflicts the sponsor may favor its own interests and the interests of its affiliates over the trust and its shareholders these potential conflicts include among others the following   ● the sponsor has no fiduciary duties to and is allowed to take into account the interests of parties other than the trust and the holders of the shares in resolving conflicts of interest       ● the trust has agreed to indemnify the sponsor and its affiliates pursuant to the terms of the trust agreement       ● the trust’s ether is valued using the etherindex price which will also be used to calculate the amount of the sponsor fee due to the sponsor       ● the sponsor its affiliates and their officers and employees are not prohibited from engaging in other businesses or activities including those that might be in direct competition with the trust and       ● the sponsor decides whether to retain separate counsel accountants or others to perform services for the trust   although the trust has taken steps to mitigate these conflicts of interest including having the administrator calculate the trust’s nav and determine the amount of the sponsor’s fee it may not be possible to entirely eliminate these conflicts of interest by investing in the shares investors agree and consent to the provisions set forth in the trust agreement see “description of the trust agreement”   holders of shares cannot be assured of the sponsor’s continued services the discontinuance of which may be detrimental to the trust   shareholders cannot be assured that the sponsor will be willing or able to continue to serve as sponsor to the trust for any length of time if the sponsor discontinues its activities on behalf of the trust and a substitute sponsor has not been appointed the administrator would terminate the trust and liquidate the ether held by the trust   appointment of a substitute sponsor will not guarantee the trust’s continued operation successful or otherwise because a substitute sponsor may have no experience managing a digital asset etp a substitute sponsor may not have the experience knowledge or expertise required to ensure that the trust will operate successfully or to continue to operate at all therefore the appointment of a substitute sponsor may not necessarily be beneficial to the trust or an investment in the shares and the administrator may determine to terminate the trust   holders of shares may be adversely affected by the lack of independent advisers representing investors in the trust   the sponsor has consulted with counsel accountants and other advisers regarding the formation and operation of the trust no counsel has been appointed to represent an investor in connection with the offering of the shares accordingly an investor should consult his her or its own legal tax and financial advisers regarding the desirability of an investment in the shares lack of such consultation may lead to an undesirable investment decision with respect to investment in the shares   holders of shares have no voting rights   under the trust agreement shareholders have no voting rights and the trust will not have regular shareholder meetings shareholders only vote on such matters and at such times as determined by the sponsor accordingly shareholders do not have the right to authorize actions appoint service providers or take other actions as may be taken by shareholders of other trusts or companies where shares carry such rights shareholders’ lack of voting rights gives all control under the trust agreement to the sponsor and the trustee the sponsor may take actions in the operation of the trust that may be adverse to the interests of shareholders the sponsor’s operation of the trust could adversely affect an investment in the shares   use of proceeds   deposits delivered to the trust in connection with the creation of baskets including the seed baskets will consist only of ether pursuant to the trust agreement during the life of the trust such delivery of ether will only be i held by the trust ii distributed to authorized participants in connection with the redemption of baskets or iii disbursed to pay the sponsor’s fee or sold as needed to pay the trust’s expenses not assumed by the sponsor        table of contents   overview of the ether industry and market    introduction to ether and the ethereum network   ether is a digital asset that is issued by and transmitted through the decentralized open source protocol of the peertopeer ethereum network the ethereum network is a network of computers all running the ethereum network’s blockchain the blockchain allows people to exchange tokens of value called ether the ethereum network also allows people to write and put on the network smart contracts  – generalpurpose code that executes on every computer in the network currently over  computers operations are executed automatically on the blockchain and cost ether the ethereum network is one of a number of projects intended to expand blockchain use beyond the bitcoin network’s peertopeer money system   the ethereum network was created by vitalik buterin and initially developed by the ethereum foundation a beta version of its live blockchain was publicly launched in july  and the production version was launched in march     ether were presold to contributors in a crowd funding transaction in  and  ether were created for the benefit of a development fund for the benefit of early contributors and developers and the ethereum foundation ethers are also created for the miners of a block in the blockchain  ether is also used to pay for transaction fees and computational services on the ethereum network clients of the platform use ether to pay for the use of the machines executing the requested operations it is an incentive designed to ensure that developers write quality applications because wasteful code costs more and that the network remains healthy by compensating people for their contributed resources   the ethereum network hosts the decentralized public transaction ledger known as the blockchain on which all ether is recorded no single entity owns or operates the ethereum network the infrastructure of which is collectively maintained by a decentralized user base ether can be used to pay for goods and services or can be converted to fiat currencies such as the us dollar at rates determined on crypto currency exchanges or in individual endusertoenduser transactions under a barter system see “uses of ether–ether exchange market” below   ether is “stored” or reflected on the digital transaction ledger known as the “blockchain” which is a digital file stored in a decentralized manner on the computers of each ethereum network user the ethereum network software source code includes the protocols that govern the creation of ether and the cryptographic system that secures and verifies ether transactions the blockchain records every ether ether balances and every ether address associated with a quantity of ether the ethereum network and its software programs determine the exact ether balance if any of any public ether address listed in the blockchain as having taken part in a transaction on the ethereum network the ethereum network utilizes the blockchain to evidence the existence of ether in any public ether address a private key controls the transfer or “spending” of ether from its associated public ether address an ether wallet is a collection of private keys and their associated public ether addresses   the blockchain is comprised of a digital file downloaded and stored in whole or in part on all ethereum network users’ software programs mining is the act of using a computer to run computations designed to help build the next block in the ethereum blockchain as a computer solves a complex computational calculation related to the building of a block its owner rewarded with ether tokens the file includes all blocks that have been solved by miners and is updated to include new blocks as they are solved see “overview of the ether industry and market—ether mining  creation of new ether” as each newly solved block refers back to and “connects” with the immediately prior solved block the addition of a new block adds to the blockchain in a manner similar to a new link being added to a chain each new block records outstanding ether transactions and outstanding transactions are settled and validated through such recording the blockchain represents a complete transparent and unbroken history of all transactions of the ethereum network each ether transaction is broadcast to the ethereum network and recorded in the blockchain    the ethereum network is decentralized and does not rely on either governmental authorities or financial institutions to create transmit or determine the value of ether rather ether is created and allocated by the ethereum network protocol through a “mining” process subject to a strict wellknown issuance schedule the value of ether is determined by the supply of and demand for ether in the crypto currency exchange markets or in private endusertoenduser transactions        table of contents   overview of the ethereum network’s operations   in order to own transfer or use ether a person generally must have internet access to connect to the ethereum network ether transactions may be made directly between endusers without the need for a thirdparty intermediary to prevent the possibility of doublespending ether a user must notify the ethereum network of the transaction by broadcasting the transaction data to its network peers the etherium network provides confirmation against doublespending by memorializing every transaction in the blockchain which is publicly accessible and transparent this memorialization and verification against doublespending is accomplished through the ethereum network mining process which adds “blocks” of data including recent transaction information to the blockchain see “cryptographic security used in the ethereum network—doublespending and the ethereum network confirmation system” below   brief description of ether transfers   prior to engaging in ether transactions a user generally must first install on its computer or mobile device an ethereum network software program that will allow the user to generate a private and public key pair associated with a ether address analogous to an ether account the ethereum network software program and the ether address also enable the user to connect to the ethereum network and engage in the transfer of ether with other users the computer of a user that downloads a version of the ethereum network software program will become a “node” on the etherium network that assists in validating and relaying transactions from other users each ethereum network address consists of a “public key” and a “private key” see “cryptographic security used in the ethereum network—public and private keys” below   in an ether transaction the ether recipient must provide its public address which serves as a routing number for the recipient on the blockchain to the party initiating the transfer this activity is analogous to a recipient for a transaction in a fiat currency providing a routing address in wire instructions to the payor so that cash may be wired to the recipient’s account the recipient however does not make public or provide to the sender its related private key the payor or “spending” party does reveal its public key in verifying its transaction to the blockchain   neither the recipient nor the sender reveal their public addresses’ private key in a transaction because the private key authorizes access to and transfer of the funds in that address to other users therefore if a user loses his private key the user permanently loses access to the ether contained in the associated address likewise ether is irretrievably lost if the private key associated with them is deleted and no backup has been made when sending ether a user’s ethereum network software program must validate the transaction with the associated private key the resulting digitally validated transaction is sent by the user’s ethereum network software program to the ethereum network to allow transaction confirmation the private key serves as validation that the transaction has been authorized by the holder of the ethereum network’s public address   summary of an ether transaction   in an ether transaction between two parties the following circumstances must be in place i the party seeking to send ether must have a ethereum network public address and the ethereum network must recognize that public address as having sufficient ether for the transaction ii the receiving party must have a ethereum network public address and iii the spending party must have internet access with which to send its spending transaction   next the receiving party must provide the spending party with its public address and allow the blockchain to record the sending of ether to that public address   after the provision of a recipient’s ethereum network public address the spending party must enter the address into its ethereum network software program along with the number of ether to be sent the number of ether to be sent will typically be agreed upon between the two parties based on a set number of ether or an agreed upon conversion of the value of fiat currency to ether since every computation on the ethereum network requires the payment of ether there is a transaction fee involved with the transfer which is based on computation complexity and not on the value of the transfer   after the entry of the ethereum network address the number of ether to be sent and the transaction fees if any to be paid the spending party will transmit the transfer the transmission of the spending transaction results in the creation of a data packet by the spending party’s ethereum network software program which is transmitted onto the decentralized ethereum network resulting in the distribution of the information among the software programs of users across the ethereum network for eventual inclusion in the blockchain        table of contents   as discussed in greater detail below in “overview of the ether industry and market—ether mining  creation of new ether” ethereum network miners record transactions when they solve for and add blocks of information to the blockchain when a miner solves for a block it creates that block which includes data relating to i the solution to the block ii a reference to the prior block in the blockchain to which the new block is being added and iii transactions that have occurred but have not yet been added to the blockchain the miner becomes aware of outstanding unrecorded transactions through the data packet transmission and distribution discussed above   upon the addition of a block included in the blockchain the ethereum network software program of both the spending party and the receiving party will show confirmation of the transaction on the blockchain and reflect an adjustment to the ether balance in each party’s ethereum network public address completing the ether transaction   creation of new ether   initial creation of ether   the initial creation of ether was in connection with a crowd funding transaction in  in which  million ether were pre sold another  million ether were created to the development fund most of it going to early contributors and developers and the remaining to the ethereum foundation all additional ether has been and will be created through the mining process   mining process   the ethereum network is kept running by computers all over the world in order to reward the computational costs of both processing the contracts and securing the network there is a reward that is given to the computer that was able to create the latest block on the chain every  seconds on average a new block is added to the blockchain with the latest transactions processed by the network and the computer that generated this block will be awarded  ether due to the nature of the algorithm for block generation this process generating a proof of work is guaranteed to be random and rewards are given in proportion to the computational power of each machine   the process by which ether is “mined” results in new blocks being added to the blockchain and new ether tokens being issued to the miners computers on the ethereum network engage in a set of prescribed complex mathematical calculations in order to add a block to the blockchain and thereby confirm ether transactions included in that block’s data to begin mining a user can download and run ethereum network mining software which like regular ethereum network software programs turns the user’s computer into a “node” on the ethereum network that validates blocks see “introduction to ether and the ethereum network—overview of the ethereum network’s operations” above    limits on ether supply   according to the terms of the  presale the issuance of ether is capped at  million ether per year however it is expected that in  the ethereum nework will switch from proof of work to a new consensus algorithm under development called casper that is expected to be more efficient and require less mining subsidy the exact method of issuance and which function it will serve is an area of active research but it is currently expected that  the current maximum is considered a ceiling and the new issuance under casper will not exceed it and is expected to be much less and  whatever method is ultimately picked to issue it will be a decentralized smart contract that will not give preferential treatment to any particular group of people and whose purpose is to benefit the overall health and security of the network   ether value   ether exchange valuation   the value of ether is determined by the value that various market participants place on ether through their transactions the most common means of determining the value of an ether is by surveying one or more ether exchanges where ether is traded publicly and transparently eg poloniex or kraken   ether exchange public market data   on each online ether exchange ether is traded with publicly disclosed valuations for each executed trade measured by one or more fiat currencies such as the us dollar or euro or by the widely used crypto currency bitcoin        table of contents   forms of attack against the ethereum network   exploitation of flaws in the ethereum network   all networked systems are vulnerable to various kinds of attacks as with any other computer network the ethereum network may contain certain flaws while there has been no exploitation of any existing flaws in the ethereum network itself a decentralized autonomous organization created using the ethereum network the dao was recently hacked the dao was formed as a smart contract using the ethereum network for the purpose of making investments based on direct voting from investors it raised over  million in ether from the sale of dao tokens to more than  members in a crowdfunding transaction  while the dao was in the process of addressing certain public identified vulnerabilities in its system an unknown hacker diverted  million of the ether the dao raised from the sale of its tokens   the ethereum network itself has not been hacked and is continuously executing many other smart contracts    market participants   miners   miners range from ether enthusiasts to professional mining operations that design and build dedicated machines and data centers including mining pools see “—ether mining  creation of new ether” above   investment and speculative sector   this sector includes the investment and trading activities of both private and professional investors and speculators historically larger financial services institutions are publicly reported to have limited involvement in investment and trading in digital assets   retail sector   while the use of bitcoin to purchase goods and services from commercial or service business is developing ether has not yet been accepted in the same manner presumably because of its infancy and because ether has a different purpose than bitcoin   service sector   this sector includes companies that provide a variety of services including the buying selling payment processing and storing of ether poloniex kraken and bitfinex are three  of the largest ether exchanges by volume traded coinbase is a multiservice financial institution that provides digital wallets that store ether for users and also serve as a retail gateway whereby users can purchase ether for fiat currency as the ethereum network continues to grow in acceptance it is anticipated that service providers will expand the currently available range of services and that additional parties will enter the service sector for the ethereum network    competition   approximately seven hundred  other digital assets have been developed since the inception of bitcoin currently the most developed digital asset because of the length of time it has been in existence while ether has enjoyed success in its limited history the aggregate value of outstanding ether is much smaller than that of bitcoin and may be eclipsed by the more rapid development of other digital assets   government oversight   until recently little or no regulatory attention has been directed toward digital assets by us federal and state governments foreign governments and selfregulatory agencies as digital assets including bitcoin and ether have grown in popularity and in market size the federal reserve board us congress and certain us agencies eg the cftc fincen and the federal bureau of investigation have begun to examine the nature of digital assets and the markets on which they are traded        table of contents   the sec has not formally asserted regulatory authority over digital assets although it has taken various actions against persons or entities misusing bitcoin in connection with fraudulent schemes ie ponzi scheme inaccurate and inadequate publicly disseminated information and the offering of unregistered securities commissioners of the cftc have expressed the belief that bitcoin meets the definition of a commodity and that the cftc has regulatory authority over futures and other derivatives based on digital assets subject to facts and circumstances on september   the cftc instituted and settled an action against coinflip a bitcoin derivatives trading platform the coinflip order found that the respondents i conducted activity related to commodity options transactions without complying with the provisions of the cea and cftc regulations and ii operated a facility for the trading of swaps without registering the facility as a sef or dcm the coinflip order was significant as it is the first time the cftc determined that virtual currencies are properly defined as commodities under the cea based on this determination the cftc applied cea provisions and cftc regulations that apply to transactions in commodity options and swaps to the conduct of the bitcoin derivatives trading platform significantly the cftc appears to have taken the position that virtual currencies are not encompassed by the definition of currency under the cea and cftc regulations the cftc defined “virtual currencies” as “a digital representation of value that functions as a medium of exchange a unit of account andor a store of value but does not have legal tender status in any jurisdiction bitcoin and other virtual currencies are distinct from ‘real’ currencies which are the coin and paper money of the united states or another country that are designated as legal tender circulate and are customarily used and accepted as a medium of exchange in the country of issuance” to the extent that ether itself is determined to be a security commodity future or other regulated asset or to the extent that a us or foreign government or quasigovernmental agency exerts regulatory authority over the ethereum network or ether trading and ownership trading or ownership in ether or the shares may be adversely affected   the cftc affirmed its approach to the regulation of digital assets and virtual currencyrelated enterprises on june   when the cftc settled charges against bitfinex a bitcoin exchange based in hong kong in its order the cftc found that bitfinex engaged in “illegal offexchange commodity transactions and failed to register as a futures commission merchant” when it facilitated borrowing transactions among its users to permit the trading of bitcoin on a “leveraged margined or financed basis” without first registering with the cftc    local state regulators such as the nysdfs have also considered virtual currencies and the regulation thereof in july  the nysdfs proposed the first us regulatory framework for licensing participants in “virtual currency business activity” the proposed regulations known as the “bitlicense” are intended to focus on consumer protection and after the closure of an initial comment period that yielded  formal public comments and a reproposal the nysdfs issued its final “bitlicense” regulatory framework in june  the “bitlicense” regulates the conduct of businesses that are involved in “virtual currencies” in new york or with new york customers and prohibits any person or entity involved in such activity to conduct activities without a license   the irs has released guidance treating bitcoin as property that is not currency for us federal income tax purposes taxing authorities of a number of us states have also issued their own guidance regarding the tax treatment of bitcoin for state income or sales tax purposes   on june   california repealed a provision of its corporations code that prohibited corporations from using alternative forms of currency or value the bill indirectly authorizes bitcoin’s use as an alternative form of money in the state   to the extent that future regulatory actions or policies limit the ability to exchange ether or utilize ether for payments the demand for ether will be reduced and authorized participants may not seek to redeem baskets in exchange for redemption proceeds in ether furthermore regulatory actions may limit the ability of endusers to convert ether into fiat currency eg us dollars or use ether to pay for goods and services such regulatory actions or policies would result in a reduction of the value of ether and the price of the shares        table of contents   digital assets currently face an uncertain regulatory landscape in not only the united states but also in many foreign jurisdictions such as the european union china and russia while certain governments such as germany—where the ministry of finance has declared bitcoin to be “rechnungseinheiten” a form of private money that is recognized as a unit of account but not recognized in the same manner as fiat currency—have issued guidance as to how to treat bitcoin most regulatory bodies have not yet issued official statements regarding intention to regulate or determinations on regulation of digital assets among those for which preliminary guidance has been issued in some form canada and taiwan have labeled bitcoin as a digital or virtual currency distinct from fiat currency while sweden and norway are among those to categorize bitcoin as a form of virtual asset or commodity in china a recent government notice classified bitcoin as legal and “virtual commodities” however the same notice restricted the banking and payment industries from using bitcoin creating uncertainty and limiting the ability of bitcoin exchanges to operate in the thensecond largest bitcoin market since december  china iceland vietnam and russia have taken a more restrictive stance toward bitcoin and thereby have reduced the rate of expansion of bitcoin use in each country in may  the central bank of bolivia banned the use of bitcoin as a means of payment in the summer and fall of  ecuador announced plans for its own statebacked electronic money while passing legislation that prohibits the use of decentralized digital assets such as bitcoin in january  the people’s bank of china china’s central bank disclosed that it has been studying a statebacked electronic monetary system and potentially had plans for its own statebacked electronic money in april  it was reported that the russian finance ministry is considering proposing regulations that would prohibit the issuance of all digital assets or their use in exchange for goods or services in russia conversely regulatory bodies in some countries such as india and switzerland have declined to exercise regulatory authority when afforded the opportunity in april  the japanese cabinet approved proposed legal changes that would reportedly treat bitcoin and other digital assets as included in the definition of currency these regulations would among other things require market participants including exchanges to meet certain compliance requirements and be subject to oversight by the financial services agency a japanese regulator these changes were approved by the japanese diet in may  and are expected to be effective beginning in  various foreign jurisdictions may in the near future adopt laws regulations or directives that affect the ethereum network and its users particularly ether exchanges and service providers that fall within such jurisdictions’ regulatory scope such laws regulations or directives may conflict with those of the united states and may negatively impact the acceptance of ether by users merchants and service providers outside of the united states and may therefore impede the growth of the ether economy   not a regulated commodity pool   the trust will not trade buy sell or hold ether derivatives including ether futures contracts on any futures exchange the trust is authorized solely to take immediate delivery of actual ether the sponsor does not believe the trust’s activities are required to be regulated by the cftc under the cea as a “commodity pool” under current law regulation and interpretation the trust will not be operated by a cftcregulated commodity pool operator because it will not trade buy sell or hold ether derivatives including ether futures contracts on any futures exchange investors in the trust will not receive the regulatory protections afforded to investors in regulated commodity pools nor may the comex division of the new york mercantile exchange or any futures exchange enforce its rules with respect to the trust’s activities in addition investors in the trust will not benefit from the protections afforded to investors in ether futures contracts on regulated futures exchanges   business of the trust    the activities of the trust will be limited to i issuing baskets in exchange for the actual ether deposited by the

activities designed to obtain a profit from or to ameliorate losses caused by changes in the market prices of ether   trust objective   the investment objective of the trust is for the shares to track the price of ether as measured at  pm eastern time using the etherindex price on each business day less the trust’s liabilities which include accrued but unpaid fees and expenses the shares are designed for investors seeking a costeffective and convenient means of gaining investment exposure to ether similar to a direct investment in ether a substantial direct investment in ether may require expensive and sometimes complicated arrangements in connection with the acquisition security and safekeeping of ether and may involve the payment of substantial fees to acquire such ether from thirdparty facilitators through cash payments of us dollars although the shares will not be the exact equivalent of a direct investment in ether they provide investors with an alternative that allows them to gain investment exposure to ether   strategy behind the shares   the shares are intended to offer investors an opportunity to participate in ether markets through an investment in securities on the first day of trading each share in the seed baskets will have a value equivalent to ● ether the logistics of accepting transferring and safekeeping of actual ether are dealt with by the custodian and the related expenses are built into the price of the shares therefore the investor does not have any additional tasks or costs over and above those associated with dealing in any other publicly traded security        table of contents   the shares are intended to provide investors with a costefficient and convenient means of gaining investment exposure to ether similar to a direct investment in ether the shares offer an investment that is     ● easily accessible and relatively cost efficient  investors in the shares can also directly access ether through the ether exchange market the sponsor believes that investors will be able to more effectively implement strategic and tactical asset allocation strategies that use ether by using the shares instead of directly purchasing and holding ether and for many investors transaction costs related to the shares will be lower than those associated with the direct purchase storage and safekeeping of ether     ● exchangetraded and transparent  the shares will be listed and trade on exchange providing investors with an efficient means to implement various investment strategies upon effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part the shares will be eligible for margin accounts and will be backed by the assets of the trust the trust will not hold or employ any derivative securities the value of the trust’s holdings will be reported each day on www ● com the trust’s website   secondary market trading   while the trust’s investment objective is for the shares to track the price of ether as measured at  pm eastern time using the etherindex price on each business day the shares may trade in the secondary market on exchange at prices that are lower or higher relative to the nav the amount of the discount or premium in the trading price relative to the nav may be influenced by nonconcurrent trading hours and liquidity between exchange and larger ether exchanges in the ether exchange market while the shares will be listed and trade on exchange from  am until  pm eastern time liquidity in the global ether markets may fluctuate depending upon the volume and availability of larger ether exchanges as a result during periods in which ether exchange market liquidity is limited or a major ether exchange is offline trading spreads and the resulting premium or discount on the shares may widen   trust expenses   the trust’s only ordinary recurring expense is expected to be equal to the sponsor’s fee in exchange for the sponsor’s fee the sponsor has agreed to

the sponsor’s fee at its discretion for a stated period of time presently the sponsor does not intend to waive any of its fees   the sponsor’s fee shall be calculated by the administrator and paid by transfer of ether from the trust custody account to the sponsor custody account monthly on the first business day of each month or as soon as practicable thereafter   upon the receipt of written instructions from the administrator the custodian will transfer ether from the trust custody account to the trust expense account to permit the payment of trust expenses not assumed by the sponsor the administrator will when directed by the sponsor and in the absence of such direction may in its own discretion instruct the custodian to the transfer the ether needed to pay extraordinary expenses to the trust expense account once such ether is in the trust expense account the administrator may sell or cause to be sold such number of ether at such times as may be necessary to permit payment in cash of trust expenses not assumed by the sponsor the custodian will transfer ether from the trust custody account to the trust expense account at such times and in the smallest amounts required to permit such payments as they become due accordingly the number of ether to be transferred out of the trust custody account will vary from time to time depending on the level of the trust’s expenses and the etherindex price        table of contents   if the administrator sells or causes to be sold ether in the trust expense account any cash received by the administrator pending payment of the trust’s expenses will not bear any interest to the extent the administrator transfers to the trust expense account ether in excess of the amount needed to pay the trust’s extraordinary expenses the administrator will promptly return such remaining ether by transfer to the trust custody account each delivery transfer or sale of ether by the trust to pay the sponsor’s fee or other trust expenses

administrator at the direction of the sponsor may liquidate the trust’s property from time to time as necessary to permit payment of the fees and expenses that the trust is required to pay   impact of trust expenses on the trust’s net asset value   the trust will transfer ether to the sponsor custody account in payment of the sponsor’s fee and transfer ether to the trust expense account and sell ether to raise the funds needed for the payment of all trust expenses not assumed by the sponsor the purchase price received as consideration for such sales will be the trust’s sole source of funds to cover its liabilities the trust will not engage in any activity designed to derive a profit from changes in the prices of ether all ether not needed to redeem baskets or to cover the sponsor’s fee and trust expenses not assumed by the sponsor will be held by the custodian in the trust custody account as a result of the recurring transfers of ether to pay the sponsor’s fee and the trust expenses not assumed by the sponsor the nav and correspondingly the ether represented by each share will decrease over the life of the trust new deposits of ether into the trust custody account received in exchange for additional new baskets issued by the trust will not reverse this trend   hypothetical expense example   the following table prepared by the sponsor illustrates the anticipated impact of the transfers of ether out of the trust custody account discussed above on the fractional number of ether represented by each outstanding share for three  years it assumes that the only transfers of ether will be those needed to pay the sponsor’s fee and that the price of ether and the number of the shares remain constant during the threeyear period covered the table does not show the impact of any expenses not assumed by the sponsor that the trust may incur any such extraordinary expenses if and when incurred will accelerate the decrease in the fractional number of ether represented by each

following is a general summary of certain material us federal income tax consequences that generally apply to the purchase ownership and disposition of the shares by a us holder as defined below and certain us federal income tax consequences that may apply to an investment in the shares by a nonusholder as defined below the discussion represents insofar as it describes conclusions as to us federal income tax law and subject to the limitations and qualifications described below and assuming full compliance with the terms of the trust agreement and other documents governing the trust the opinion of buchanan ingersoll  rooney pc counsel to the sponsor an opinion of counsel is not binding on the irs or on the courts and there can be no assurance that the irs will not take a different position concerning the matters discussed below or that any such position would not be sustained by a court of law no rulings have been or will be sought from the irs with respect to the matters discussed below   the discussion below is based on the code treasury regulations promulgated under the code judicial decisions and published rulings and administrative pronouncements of the irs all as in effect on the date of this prospectus these authorities are subject to change either prospectively or retroactively which may result in tax consequences different from those discussed below the tax treatment of shareholders may vary depending upon their own particular circumstances and this discussion does not purport to address all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to shareholders for example this discussion does not address tax consequences that may be relevant to certain investors subject to special rules under the code including brokerdealers traders banks and other financial institutions insurance companies regulated investment companies real estate investment trusts taxexempt entities holders liable for alternative minimum tax pension plans holders that hold shares in taxdeferred or taxadvantaged accounts “controlled foreign corporations” “passive foreign investment companies” and holders whose functional currency is not the us dollar in addition the following discussion applies only to investors who will hold shares as “capital assets” within the meaning of code section  and not as part of a straddle hedging transaction or a conversion or constructive sale or other integrated transaction this discussion further assumes that ether contributed to the trust was acquired for cash moreover the discussion below does not address any tax consequences arising under any state local or foreign tax law any other us federal tax laws including estate and gift tax laws or other transfer tax on an owner of shares purchasers of shares are urged to consult their own tax advisors with respect to all federal state local and foreign tax law or any estate gift or other transfer tax considerations potentially applicable to their investment in the shares   for purposes of this discussion a “us holder” is a beneficial owner of shares that is   ● an individual who is a citizen or resident of the united states       ● a corporation or other entity treated as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes created or organized in or under the laws of the united states or any political subdivision thereof       ● an estate the income of which is includible in gross income for us federal income tax purposes regardless of its source or       ● a trust if i a court within the united states is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more us persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or ii the trust has a valid election in effect under applicable treasury regulations to be treated as a united states person        table of contents   for purposes of this discussion a “nonus holder” is a beneficial owner of shares that for us federal income tax purposes is an individual corporation estate or trust and that is not a us holder   for us federal income tax purposes the treatment of any beneficial owner of an interest in an entity treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes will generally depend upon the status of the partner and upon the activities of the partnership partnerships and other entities that are treated as partnerships for us federal income tax purposes and beneficial owners of interests therein should consult their tax advisors about the us federal income tax consequences of purchasing owning and disposing of the shares   taxation of the trust   the trust will be classified as a “grantor trust” for us federal income tax purposes as such the trust itself will not be subject to us federal income tax instead the trust’s income and expenses will “flow through” to holders of the shares and the administrator will report the trust’s income gains losses and deductions to the irs on that basis however there is no direct authority governing the us federal income tax classification of the trust and there can be no assurance that the irs will not assert a contrary position or that a court would not sustain such assertion the balance of this discussion assumes that the trust will be treated as a “grantor trust” for us federal income tax purposes   characterization of ether   on march   the irs released guidance on the treatment of convertible virtual currencies such as ether for us federal income tax purposes the guidance classifies ether as “property” that is not currency for us federal income tax purposes and clarifies that ether can be held as capital assets the guidance further states that general tax principles applicable to property transactions apply to transactions using ether therefore a person that holds ether as capital assets and sells the ether or transfers ether in exchange for other property or services may recognize a capital gain or loss upon such sale or transfer   the treatment of ether for us federal income tax purposes remains unclear in several respects furthermore legislation has previously been introduced and may be introduced in the future that would change the tax considerations of an investment in ether and in the shares future legislation or guidance issued by the irs regarding the tax treatment of ether for us federal income tax purposes may result in tax consequences to shareholders that are materially different than those described herein   taxation of us shareholders   holders of the shares generally will be treated for us federal income tax purposes as if they directly owned a pro rata share of the underlying assets held by the trust holders also will be treated as if they directly received their respective pro rata shares of the trust’s income if any and as if they directly incurred their respective pro rata shares of the trust’s expenses in the case of a holder that purchases shares for cash its initial tax basis in its pro rata share of the assets held by the trust at the time it acquires its shares will be equal to its cost of acquiring the shares in the case of a holder that acquires its shares through the creation of a basket the delivery of ether to the trust in exchange for shares generally will not be a taxable event to the holder and the shareholder’s tax basis and holding period for the shares generally will be the same as its tax basis and holding period for the ether delivered in exchange therefor the balance of this discussion assumes that all of a holder’s shares are acquired on the same date and at the same price per share holders that hold multiple lots of shares or that are contemplating acquiring multiple lots of shares should consult their tax advisors   when the trust sells or transfers ether for example to pay expenses a holder of shares generally will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between i the holder’s pro rata share of the amount realized by the trust upon the sale or transfer of the ether and ii the holder’s tax basis in its pro rata share of the ether that was sold or transferred based on the irs guidance described above such gain or loss will generally be longterm or shortterm capital gain or loss depending upon whether the holder is treated as having held the ether that were sold or transferred for more than one year a holder’s tax basis for its share of any ether sold or transferred by the trust generally will be determined by multiplying the holder’s total basis for its share of the trust’s ether immediately prior to the sale or transfer by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of ether sold or transferred and the denominator of which is the total number of the ether held by the trust immediately prior to the sale or transfer after any such sale or transfer a holder’s tax basis for its pro rata share of the remaining ether held by the trust will be equal to its tax basis for its shares immediately prior to the sale or transfer less the portion of such basis allocable to its share of the ether sold or transferred        table of contents   upon a holder’s sale exchange or other taxable disposition of some or all of its shares the holder will be treated as having sold exchanged or disposed of a pro rata share of the ether held by the trust at the time of the sale exchange or other disposition accordingly the holder generally will recognize gain or loss on the sale exchange or other disposition in an amount equal to the difference between i the amount realized on the sale exchange or disposition of shares and ii the holder’s tax basis for the portion of its pro rata share of the ether held by the trust at such time that is attributable to the shares sold exchanged or disposed of   a redemption of some or all of a holder’s shares in exchange for the underlying ether represented by the shares redeemed generally will not be a taxable event to the holder the holder’s tax basis for the ether received in the redemption generally will be the same as the holder’s tax basis for the portion of its pro rata share of the ether held by the trust immediately prior to the redemption that is attributable to the shares redeemed the holder’s holding period with respect to the ether received should include the period during which the shareholder held the shares redeemed a subsequent sale or transfer of the ether received by the holder will be a taxable event   a holder’s ability to deduct its share of any capital losses of the trust is subject to certain limitations holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the deductibility of capital losses incurred with respect to an investment in the trust   the code generally imposes an additional  medicare contribution tax on the net investment income of certain individuals trusts and estates to the extent their income exceeds certain threshold amounts holders are advised to consult their tax advisors regarding the possible implications of this additional tax on their investment in the shares   brokerage fees and trust expenses   any brokerage or other transaction fee incurred by a holder in purchasing the shares will be treated as part of the holder’s tax basis in its pro rata share of the assets held by the trust similarly any brokerage fee incurred by a holder in selling shares will reduce the amount realized by the holder with respect to the sale   holders will be required to recognize gain or loss on a sale or transfer of ether by the trust as discussed above even though some or all of the proceeds of such sale are used or the ether is transferred by the administrator to pay trust expenses holders may deduct their respective pro rata shares of each expense incurred by the trust to the same extent as if they directly incurred the expense holders who are individuals estates or trusts will be required to treat expenses of the trust to the extent that such expenses may be deducted including as limited by applicable code provisions as miscellaneous itemized deductions individuals may deduct certain miscellaneous itemized deductions only to the extent they exceed two  percent of adjusted gross income in addition such deductions are not deductible at all for alternative minimum tax purposes   united states information reporting and backup withholding for us and nonus holders   the administrator trust agency service provider or the appropriate broker will file certain information returns with the irs and provide certain taxrelated information to holders in accordance with applicable treasury regulations each holder will be provided annually with information regarding its allocable portion of the trust’s income if any and expenses   a us holder may be subject to us backup withholding if such holder fails to provide to the trust his or her correct taxpayer identification number has underreported dividend or interest income or fails to certify that he or she is not subject to such withholding nonus hlders may have to comply with certification procedures to establish that they are not us persons in order to avoid backup withholding backup withholding is not an additional tax any amount withheld may be credited against a holder’s us federal income tax liability provided that the holder furnishes the appropriate information to the irs   us federal income taxation of nonus holders   the trust does not expect to generate taxable income except for gain if any upon the sale or transfer of ether a nonus holder generally will not be subject to us federal income tax with respect to gain recognized upon the sale or other disposition of the shares or upon the sale or transfer of ether by the trust unless i the nonus holder is an individual and is present in the united states for one hundred and eightythree  days or more during the taxable year of the sale transfer or other disposition and the gain is treated as being from us sources or ii the gain is or is treated as effectively connected with the conduct by the nonus shareholder of a trade or business in the united states        table of contents   taxation in jurisdictions other than the united states   prospective purchasers of the shares that are citizens or residents of based in or acting out of a jurisdiction other than the united states are advised to consult their own tax advisers as to the tax consequences under the laws of such jurisdiction of their purchase holding sale or redemption of or any other dealing in the shares and in particular as to whether any value added tax other consumption tax or transfer tax is payable in relation to such purchase holding sale redemption or other dealing   erisa and related considerations   the employee retirement income security act of  as amended “erisa” andor code section  impose certain requirements on employee benefit plans and certain other plans and arrangements including individual retirement accounts and annuities keogh plans and certain collective investment funds or insurance company general or separate accounts in which such plans or arrangements are invested that are subject to erisa andor the code collectively “plans” and on persons who are fiduciaries with respect to the investment of assets treated as “plan assets” of a plan government plans and some church plans are not subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of erisa or the provisions of section  of the code but may be subject to substantially similar rules under state or other federal law   in contemplating an investment of a portion of plan assets in the shares the plan fiduciary responsible for making such investment should carefully consider taking into account the facts and circumstances of the plan the “risk factors” discussed above and whether such investment is consistent with its fiduciary responsibilities including but not limited to i whether the fiduciary has the authority to make the investment under the appropriate governing plan instrument ii whether the investment would constitute a direct or indirect nonexempt prohibited transaction with a party in interest iii the plan’s funding objectives and iv whether under the general fiduciary standards of investment prudence and diversification such investment is appropriate for the plan taking into account the overall investment policy of the plan the composition of the plan’s investment portfolio and the plan’s need for sufficient liquidity to pay benefits when due   under the department of labor’s regulations at §  as amended by section  of erisa the “plan asset regulations” if a plan invests in an equity interest of an entity that is “a publiclyoffered security” the entity will not be deemed to hold “plan assets” subject to erisa and a party managing the assets of such entity will not be subject to the fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction rules of erisa and section  of the code a “publiclyoffered security” is a security that is freely transferable part of a class of securities that is widely held and is either i part of a class of securities registered under section b or g of the exchange act or ii sold to the plan as part of an offering of securities to the public pursuant to an effective registration statement under the securities act and the class of securities of which such security is a part is registered under the exchange act within one hundred and twenty  days or such later time as may be allowed by the securities and exchange commission after the end of the fiscal year of the issuer during which the offering of such securities to the public occurred whether a security is “freely transferable” is a factual question determined on the basis of facts and circumstances a class of securities is “widelyheld” if it is a class of securities that is owned by one hundred  or more investors independent of the issuer and of one another the issuer expects that the above requirements will be satisfied and the shares will be “publicly traded securities” within the meaning of the plan asset regulations   investment by certain retirement plans   individual retirement accounts iras and participantdirected accounts under taxqualified retirement plans are limited in the types of investments they may make under the code potential purchasers of the shares that are iras or participantdirected accounts under a code section a plan should consult with their own tax advisors as to the consequences of a purchase of the shares        table of contents   plan of distribution   in addition to and independent of the seed baskets purchased by the initial purchaser described below the trust will issue shares in baskets to authorized participants in exchange for delivery of ether on a continuous basis the trust will not issue or redeem fractions of a basket because new shares can be issued and sold on an ongoing basis at any point during the life of the trust a “distribution” as such term is used in the securities act will be occurring brokerdealers and other persons are cautioned that some of their activities will result in their being deemed participants in a distribution of shares in a manner which would render them statutory underwriters and subject them to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the securities act for example a brokerdealer firm or its client will be deemed a statutory underwriter if it purchases a basket from the trust breaks the basket down into its constituent shares and sells the shares directly to its customers or if it chooses to couple the creation of a new basket with an active selling effort involving solicitation of secondary market demand for the shares a determination of whether a particular market participant is an underwriter must take into account all the facts and circumstances pertaining to the activities of the brokerdealer or its client in the particular case and the examples mentioned above should not be considered a complete description of all the activities that could lead to designation as an underwriter   the initial purchaser intends to distribute the seed baskets of the shares by selling such shares on exchange as a result in the context of the distribution of the seed baskets of the shares the initial purchaser will be deemed to be an underwriter   investors that purchase the shares through a commissionfeebased brokerage account may pay commissionsfees charged by the brokerage account investors should review the terms of their brokerage accounts for details on applicable charges   dealers that are not “underwriters” but are participating in a distribution of shares as contrasted to ordinary secondary trading transactions and thus dealing with the shares that are part of an “unsold allotment” within the meaning of section c of the securities act would be unable to take advantage of the prospectus delivery exemption provided by section  of the securities act   the sponsor intends to qualify the shares in states selected by the sponsor and that sales be made through brokerdealers who are members of finra investors intending to create or redeem baskets through authorized participants in transactions not involving a brokerdealer registered in such investor’s state of domicile or residence should consult their legal advisor regarding applicable brokerdealer or securities regulatory requirements under the state securities laws prior to such creation or redemption   on ●  the initial purchaser purchased ● shares which comprised the seed baskets the initial purchaser intends to reoffer the seed baskets at a per share offering price that will vary depending on among other factors the etherindex price and the trading price of the

inducement from either the sponsor or the trust and no authorized participant or initial purchaser has any obligation or responsibility to the sponsor or the trust to effect any sale or resale of the shares accordingly there is and will be no payment of underwriting compensation in connection with any such offering of the shares in excess of ten  percent of the gross proceeds of the offering   the initial purchaser may be an authorized participant but will not act as an authorized participant with respect to the seed baskets and its activities with respect to the seed baskets will be distinct
