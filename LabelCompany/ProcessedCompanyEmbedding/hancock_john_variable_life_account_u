variable whole life policy a variable whole life p  policy and a variable whole life  policy the policies described in this prospectus are available only in new york the minimum death benefit that may be bought is  for the whole life policy  for the whole life p  policy and  for the whole life  policy for the whole life policy and the whole life p  policy all persons insured must meet certain health and other criteria called underwriting standards all persons insured under the whole life  policy must meet preferred risk and nonsmoking underwriting standards all policies may be issued on insured persons between ages of  and  discounts are available to insured persons meeting nonsmoking underwriting criteria the policys primary purpose is to provide lifetime protection against economic loss due to the death of the insured person the policy is unsuitable as a shortterm savings vehicle because of the substantial policylevel charges we are obligated to pay all amounts promised under the policy the value of the amount you have invested under the policy may increase or decrease daily based upon the investment results of the variable investment options that you choose the amount we pay to the policys beneficiary insured person we call this the death benefit may be similarly affected thats why the policy is referred to as a variable life insurance policy we call the investments you make in the policy premiums or premium payments summary of policy benefits death benefit in your application for the policy you will tell us how much life insurance coverage you want on the life of the insured person this is called the sum insured when the insured person dies we will pay the death benefit minus any indebtedness the death benefit will be an amount equal to the greater of the guaranteed minimum death benefit and the variable sum insured on the date of death of the insured person the variable sum insured is an amount equal to the initial sum insured at issue and thereafter varies as discussed under variable sum insured surrender of the policy you may surrender the policy in full at any time if you do we will pay you the account value of the policy less any outstanding policy plus any dividends and interest unpaid or unapplied and the cash value of any insurance purchased under any dividend option with an adjustment to reflect the difference between the gross premium and the net premium for the period beyond the date of surrender less any indebtedness this is called your surrender value you must return your policy when you request a surrender if you have not taken a loan on your policy the cash value of your policy assuming you take all dividend payments in cash will on any given date be equal to o the amount you invested o plus or minus the investment experience of the investment options youve chosen and o minus all charges we deduct if you take a loan on your policy your cash value will be computed somewhat differently this is discussed under policy loans policy loans you may borrow from your policy at any time after the first policy year by completing the appropriate form the minimum amount of each loan is  the maximum amount you can borrow is determined by a formula interest is charged on each loan you can pay the interest or allow it to become part of the outstanding loan balance you can repay all or part of a loan at any time if there is an outstanding loan when the insured person dies it will be deducted from the death benefit policy loans permanently affect the calculation of your cash value and may also result in adverse tax consequences  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th optional benefit riders when you apply for the policy you can request any of the optional benefit riders that we make available there are a number of such riders charges for most riders will be deducted monthly from the policys account value investment options the policy offers a number of investment options as listed on the cover of this prospectus they cover a broad spectrum of investment styles and strategies although the funds of the series funds that underlie those investment options operate like publicly traded mutual funds there are important differences between your investment options and publiclytraded mutual funds on the plus side you can transfer money from one investment option to another without tax liability moreover any dividends and capital gains distributed by each underlying fund are automatically reinvested and reflected in the funds value and create no taxable event for you on the negative side if and when policy earnings are distributed generally as a result of a surrender or partial withdrawal they will be treated as ordinary income instead of as capital gains also you must keep in mind that you are purchasing an insurance policy and you will be assessed charges at the policy level as well as at the fund level such policy level charges are significant and will reduce the investment performance of your investment options summary of policy risks lapse risk if you dont pay a premium when due you will have a  day grace period to make that payment if you dont pay the premium by the end of the grace period your policy will terminate ie lapse all coverage under the policy will then cease even if the policy terminates in this way you can still reactivate ie reinstate it within  years from the beginning of the grace period unless the surrender value has been paid or otherwise exhausted or the period of any extended term coverage discussed below has expired to reinstate the policy you must make the required premium payments and satisfying certain other conditions since withdrawals reduce your account value withdrawals increase the risk of lapse loans also increase the risk of lapse investment risk as mentioned above the investment performance of any variable investment option may be good or bad your account value will rise or fall based on the investment performance of the variable investment options youve chosen some variable investment options are riskier than others these risks and potential rewards are discussed in detail in the attached prospectuses of the series funds transfer risk there is a risk that you will not be able to transfer your account value from one investment option to another because of limitations on the frequency of transfers you can make the limitations on transfers out of the fixed account are more restrictive than those that apply to transfers out of investment accounts market timing risk variable investment options in variable life insurance products can be a prime target for abusive transfer activity because these products value their variable investment options on a daily basis and allow transfers among variable investment options without immediate tax consequences as a result some investors may seek to frequently transfer into and out of variable investment options in reaction to market news or to exploit a perceived pricing inefficiency whatever the reason longterm investors in a variable investment option can be harmed by frequent transfer activity since such activity may expose the investment options underlying fund to increased portfolio transaction costs andor disrupt the fund managers ability to effectively manage the funds investment portfolio in accordance with the funds investment objectives and policies both of which may result in dilution with respect to interests held for longterm investment to discourage disruptive frequent trading activity we impose restrictions on transfers see transfers of existing account value and reserve the right to change suspend or terminate telephone and facsimile transaction privileges see how you communicate with us in

time we are unable to purchase or redeem shares of the underlying fund while we seek to identify and prevent disruptive frequent trading activity it may not always be possible to do so therefore no assurance can be given that the restrictions we impose will be successful in preventing all disruptive frequent trading and avoiding harm to longterm investors tax risks in order for you to receive the tax benefits extended to life insurance under the internal revenue code your policy must comply with certain requirements of the code we will monitor your policy for compliance with these requirements but a policy might fail to qualify as life insurance in spite of our monitoring if this were to occur you would be subject to income tax on the income credited to your policy for the period of disqualification and all subsequent periods the tax laws also contain a socalled  pay limit that limits the amount of premium that can be paid in relation to the policys death benefit if the limit is violated the policy will be treated as a modified endowment contract which can have adverse tax consequences there are also certain treasury department rules referred to as the investor control rules that determine whether you would be treated as the owner of the assets underlying your policy if that were determined to be the case you would be taxed on any income or gains those assets generate in other words you would lose the value of the socalled inside buildup that is a major benefit of life insurance there is also a tax risk associated with policy loans although no part of a loan is treated as income to you when the loan is made surrender or lapse of the policy would result in the loan being treated as a distribution at the time of lapse or surrender this could result in a considerable tax bill under certain circumstances involving large amounts of outstanding loans and an insured person of advanced age you might find yourself having to choose between high premium requirements to keep your policy from lapsing and a significant tax burden if you allow the lapse to occur tax consequences of ownership or receipt of policy proceeds under federal state and local estate inheritance gift and other tax laws can vary greatly depending upon the circumstances of each owner or beneficiary there can also be unfavorable tax consequences on such things as the change of policy ownership or assignment of ownership interests for these and all the other reasons mentioned above we recommend you consult with a qualified tax adviser before buying the policy and before exercising certain rights under the policy  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th fee tables this section contains five tables that describe all of the fees and expenses that you will pay

level during the policy month following the determination changes in the variable sum insured for each policy month are computed by a formula filed with the insurance supervisory officials of the

limitations on payment of death benefit if the insured person commits suicide within certain time periods the amount of death benefit we pay will be limited as described in the policy also if an

the charges described under deductions from premium payments below we invest the rest your socalled net premium in the investment options youve elected we invest an amount equal to each net premium for your policy on the date of issue and on each premium due date thereafter even if we actually receive your corresponding premium payment before or after that date over time the amount youve invested in any variable investment option will increase or decrease the same as if you had invested the same amount directly in the corresponding fund of the series fund and had reinvested all fund dividends and distributions in additional fund shares except that we will deduct certain additional charges which will reduce your cash value we describe these charges under description of charges at the policy level annual dividends these policies are participating policies which except while in force as fixed extended term insurance are entitled to the share if any of the divisible surplus which we annually determine and apportion to them any share will be distributed as a dividend payable annually on the policy anniversary beginning not later than the end of the second policy year for the variable whole life  policy and not later than the end of the third policy year for the variable whole life policy and variable whole life p policy dividends under participating policies may be described as refunds of premiums which adjust the cost of a policy to the actual level of cost emerging over time after the policys issue thus participating policies generally have gross premiums which are higher than those for comparable nonparticipating policies if a policy is surrendered before dividends become payable you do not benefit from having a participating policy both federal and state law recognize that dividends are considered to be a refund of a portion of the premium paid and therefore are not treated as income for federal or state income tax purposes dividend illustrations published at the time of issue of a policy reflect the actual recent experience of the issuing insurance company with respect to factors such as interest mortality and expenses state law generally prohibits a company from projecting or estimating future results state law also requires that dividends must be based on surplus after setting aside certain necessary amounts and that such surplus must be apportioned equitably among participating policies in other words in principle and by statute dividends must be based on actual experience and cannot be guaranteed at issue of a policy each year our actuaries analyze the current and recent past experience and compare it to the assumptions used in determining the premium rates at the time of issue some of the more important data studied includes mortality and withdrawal rates investment yield in the general account and actual expenses incurred in administering the policies such data is then allocated to each dividend class eg by year of issue age smoking habits and plan the actuaries then determine what dividends can be equitably apportioned to each policy class and make a recommendation to our board of directors the board of directors which has the ultimate authority to ascertain dividends will vote the amount of surplus to be apportioned to each policy class thereby authorizing the distribution of each years dividend you may in general elect to have any dividend paid or applied under any one of the following options paid in cash applied to premium payments left to accumulate with interest of at least  a year purchase fixed paidup insurance purchase one year term insurance or purchase variable paidup insurance commencement of investment performance any premium payment processed prior to the twentieth day

to informally finance the liabilities created by an employee benefit plan and to this end the entity may aggregately manage the policies purchased to match its liabilities under the plan policies sold

unless it is at least  you may repay all or a portion of any indebtedness while the insured person is living and premiums are being duly paid any loan is charged against the variable investment options in proportion to the policy cash value allocated to the variable investment options and upon repayment the repayment is allocated to the variable investment options in proportion to the outstanding indebtedness in each variable investment option at such time we determine the variable loan interest rate annually the fixed loan interest rate is  for the life of the policy at the time of issue you can elect which loan interest rate will apply to any policy loan if permitted by the law of the state in which the policy is issued you may change a prior choice of loan interest rate if at the time of such request there is outstanding indebtedness the change will generally become effective on the next policy anniversary the variable loan interest rate determined annually for a policy will apply to all indebtedness outstanding during the policy year following the date of determination the rate will not exceed the higher of  or the published monthly average as defined below for the calendar month which is two months prior to the month in which the date of determination occurs the published monthly average means moodys corporate bond yield average as published by moodys investors service inc or any successor thereto the amount of the loan deducted from the investment options is placed in a special loan account this special loan account will earn interest at an effective annual rate that is not more than  below the interest rate we are then charging on the loan assuming no taxes repayment of policy loans if you want a payment to be used as a loan repayment you must include instructions to that effect otherwise all payments will be assumed to be premium payments we process loan repayments as of the day we receive the repayment effects of policy loans the cash value the net cash surrender value and the death benefit are permanently affected by any loan whether or not it is repaid in whole or in part this is because the amount of the loan is deducted from the investment options and placed in a special loan account the investment options and the special loan account will generally have different rates of investment return the amount of any outstanding indebtedness is subtracted from the amount otherwise payable when the policy proceeds become payable whenever the outstanding indebtedness equals or exceeds the policys cash value plus any cash values under a dividend option providing paidup insurance the policy will terminate  days after we have mailed notice of termination to you and to any assignee of record at such assignees last known address specifying the minimum amount that must be paid to avoid termination unless a repayment of at least the amount specified is made within that period also taking out a loan on the policy increases the risk that the policy may lapse because of the difference between the interest rate charged on the loan and the interest rate credited to the special loan account policy loans may also result in adverse tax consequences under certain circumstances see tax considerations  pst page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust st description of charges at the policy level deductions from premium payments o premium tax charge  a charge to cover expected state premium taxes we must pay on average this charge is  of each premium o adjustment for premium payment frequency  if you select a premium payment mode other than annual so that we receive your premiums over the course of the year rather than all at the beginning there will be less value in your policy to support it during the course of the year to compensate for the risk to us that this creates the rate we set for each non annual premium includes an additional amount that we retain rather than crediting it to your policy o annual administrative charge  a charge of  in each policy year to help defray our annual administrative expenses o charge for extra insurance risk  the amount of premiums we may require may include an additional component if the insured person presents particular mortality risks we retain these additional amounts to compensate us for that risk o optional benefits charge  the amount of premiums we require is increased by an additional component to cover any optional rider benefits you choose for your policy we retain such additional amounts to compensate us for the obligations we assume under the riders o premium sales charge  a charge not to exceed  of the basic annual premium during the period equal to the lesser of  years or the anticipated life expectancy of the insured person based on the  commissioners standard ordinary mortality table the basic annual premium is the annual premium less the premiums for any optional rider benefits additional charges for extra mortality risks and the  annual administrative charge the charge during the first two policy years shall not exceed  of the basic annual premium paid during the first policy year plus  of the basic annual premium paid for the second policy year charges of  or less are made for later policy year o additional first year administrative charge  a charge in the first policy year at the rate of  per  of the initial sum insured as shown in the policy for a variable whole life policy  per  for a variable whole life p policy and  per  for a variable whole life  policy or a pro rata portion thereof to cover administrative expenses in connection with the issuance of the policy o risk charge  a charge necessary to cover the risk we assumed that the variable sum insured will be less than the guaranteed minimum death benefit this charge will vary by age of the insured person but averages approximately  of the basic annual premium o deduction for dividends  a deduction for dividends to be paid or credited in accordance with the dividend scale in effect on the issue date of the policy this deduction will vary by age of the insured person and duration of the policy but is expected to average approximately  of the basic annual premium deductions from account assets o insurance charge  a monthly charge for the cost of insurance to determine the charge we multiply the amount of insurance for which we are at risk by a cost of insurance rate the rate is derived from an actuarial table the table in your policy will show the maximum cost of insurance rates the cost of insurance rates will never be more than those based on the  commissioners standard ordinary mortality tables cost of insurance rates generally increase each year that you own your policy as the insured persons attained age increases the insured persons attained age on any date is his or her age on the birthday nearest that date o m  e charge  a daily charge for mortality and expense risks we assume this charge is deducted from the variable investment options the current charge is at an effective annual rate of  of the value of the assets in each variable investment option we guarantee that this charge will never exceed an effective annual rate of  additional information about how certain policy charges work sales expenses and related charges the premium sales charges help to compensate us for the cost of selling our policies see description of charges at the policy level the amount of the charges in any policy year does not specifically correspond to sales expenses for that year we expect to recover our total sales expenses over the life of the policy to the extent that the sales charges do not cover total sales expenses the sales expenses may be recovered from other sources including gains from the charge for mortality and expense risks and other gains with respect to the policies or from our general assets similarly administrative expenses not  pnd page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust nd fully covered by the annual administrative charge and the additional first year administrative charge may also be recovered from such other sources method of deduction we deduct the monthly charges described in the section from your policys investment options in proportion to the amount of cash value you have in each other charges we could impose in the future we currently make no charge for our federal income taxes however if we incur or expect to incur additional income taxes attributable to any subaccount of the account or this class of policies in future years we reserve the right to make a charge for such taxes any such charge would reduce what you earn on any affected investment options however we expect that no such charge will be necessary under current laws we may incur state and local taxes in addition to premium taxes in several states at present these taxes are not significant if there is a material change in applicable state or local tax laws we may make charges for such taxes description of charges at the fund level the funds must pay investment management fees and other operating expenses these fees and expenses shown in the fee tables section are different for each fund and reduce the investment return of each fund therefore they also indirectly reduce the return you will earn on any variable investment options you select expenses of the funds are not fixed or specified under the terms of the policy and those expenses may vary from year to year other policy benefits rights and limitations optional benefit riders you can add when you apply for a policy you can request any of the optional benefit riders that we then make available availability of any rider the benefits it provides and the charges for it may vary by state our rules and procedures will govern eligibility for any rider and in some cases the configuration of the actual rider benefits each rider contains specific details that you should review before you decide to choose the rider we may change rider premiums or the rates that determine them but not above any applicable maximum amount stated in the policy specifications page

with your purchase of a policy tax considerations this description of federal income tax consequences is only a brief summary and is not intended as tax advice tax consequences will vary based on your own particular circumstances and for further information you should consult a qualified tax adviser federal state and local tax laws regulations and interpretations can change from time to time as a result the tax consequences to you and the beneficiary may be altered in some cases retroactively the policy may be used in various arrangements including nonqualified deferred compensation or salary continuation plans split dollar insurance plans executive bonus plans retiree medical benefit plans and others the tax consequences of such plans may vary depending on the particular facts and circumstances of each individual arrangement therefore if the use of the policy in any such arrangment the value of which depends in part on the tax consequences is contemplated a qualified tax adviser should be consulted for advise on the tax attributes of the particular arrangement general generally death benefits paid under policies such as yours are not subject to income tax earnings on your account value are ordinarily not subject to income tax as long as we dont pay them out to you if we do pay out any amount of your account value upon surrender or partial withdrawal all or part of that distribution would generally be treated as a return of the premiums youve paid and not subjected to income tax however certain distributions associated with a reduction in death benefit or other policy benefits within the first  years after issuance of the policy are ordinarily taxable in whole or in part see other policy distributions below amounts you borrow are generally not taxable to you see policy loans below however some of the tax rules change if your policy is found to be a modified endowment contract this can happen if youve paid premiums in excess of limits prescribed by the tax laws additional taxes and penalties may be payable for policy distributions of any kind see pay premium limit and modified endowment contract status below policy death benefit proceeds we expect the policy to receive the same federal income and estate tax treatment as fixed benefit life insurance policies section  of the internal revenue code the code defines a life insurance contract for federal tax purposes for a policy to be treated as a life insurance contract it must satisfy either the cash value accumulation test or the guideline premium test these tests limit the amount of premium that you may pay into the policy we will monitor compliance with these standards if we determine that a policy does not satisfy section  we may take whatever steps are appropriate and reasonable to bring it into compliance with section  if the policy complies with section  the death benefit proceeds under the policy should be excludable from the beneficiarys gross income under section  of the code other policy distributions increases in policy value as a result of interest or investment experience will not be subject to federal income tax unless and until values are received through actual or deemed distributions in general the owner will be taxed on the amount of distributions that exceed the premiums paid under the policy an exception to this general rule occurs in the case of a decrease in the policys death benefit or any other change that reduces benefits under the policy in the first  years after the policy is issued and that results in a cash distribution to the policy owner in order for the policy to continue to comply with the section  definitional limits changes that reduce benefits include partial withdrawals and death benefit option changes for purposes of this rule any distribution within the two years immediately before a reduction in benefits will also be treated as if it caused the reduction a cash distribution that reduces policy benefits will be taxed in whole or in part to the extent of any gain in the policy under rules prescribed in section  the taxable amount is subject to limits prescribed in section f any taxable distribution will be ordinary income to the owner rather than capital gain distributions for tax purposes include amounts received upon surrender or partial withdrawals you may also be deemed to have received a distribution for tax purposes if you assign all or part of your policy rights or change your policys ownership  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th it is possible that despite our monitoring a policy might fail to qualify as a life insurance contract under section  of the code this could happen for example if we inadvertently failed to return to you any premium payments that were in excess of permitted amounts or if any of the funds failed to meet certain investment diversification or other requirements of the code if this were to occur you would be subject to income tax on the income credited to the policy from the date of issue to the date of the disqualification and for subsequent periods tax consequences of ownership or receipt of policy proceeds under federal state and local estate inheritance gift and other tax laws will depend on the circumstances of each owner or beneficiary if the person insured by the policy is also its owner either directly or indirectly through an entity such as a revocabale trust the death benefit will be includible in his or her estate for purposes of the federal estate tax if the owner is not the person insured the value of the policy will be includible in the owners estate upon his or her death even if ownership has been transferred the death proceeds or the account value may be includible in the former owners estate if the transfer occurred less than three years before the former owners death or if the former owner retained certain kinds of control over the policy you should consult your tax adviser regarding these possible tax consequences because there may be unfavorable tax consequences including recognition of taxable income and the loss of income taxfree treatment for any death benefit payable to the beneficiary you should consult a qualified tax adviser prior to changing the policys ownership or making any assignment of ownership interests policy loans we expect that except as noted below see pay premium limit and modified endowment contract status loans received under the policy will be treated as indebtedness of an owner and that no part of any loan will constitute income to the owner however if the policy terminates for any reason the amount of any outstanding loan that was not previously considered income will be treated as if it had been distributed to the owner upon such termination this could result in a considerable tax bill under certain circumstances involving large amounts of outstanding loans you might find yourself having to choose between high premiums requirements to keep your policy from lapsing and a significant tax burden if you allow the lapse to occur diversification rules and ownership of the account your policy will not qualify for the tax benefits of a life insurance contract unless the account follows certain rules requiring diversification of investments underlying the policy in addition the rules require that the policy owner not have investment control over the underlying assets in certain circumstances the owner of a variable life insurance policy may be considered the owner for federal income tax purposes of the assets of the separate account used to support the policy in those circumstances income and gains from the separate account assets would be includible in the policy owners gross income the internal revenue service irs has stated in published rulings that a variable policy owner will be considered the owner of separate account assets if the policy owner possesses incidents of ownership in those assets such as the ability to exercise investment control over the assets a treasury decision issued in  stated that guidance would be issued in the form of regulations or rulings on the extent to which policyholders may direct their investments to particular subaccounts of a separate account without being treated as owners of the underlying assets as of the date of this prospectus no comprehensive guidance on this point has been issued in rev rul  however the irs ruled that a contract holder would not be treated as the owner of assets underlying a variable life insurance or annuity contract despite the owners ability to allocate funds among as many as twenty subaccounts the ownership rights under your policy are similar to but different in certain respects from those described in irs rulings in which it was determined that policyholders were not owners of separate account assets since you have greater flexibility in allocating premiums and policy values than was the case in those rulings it is possible that you would be treated as the owner of your policys proportionate share of the assets of the account we do not know what future treasury department regulations or other guidance may require we cannot guarantee that the funds will be able to operate as currently described in the series funds prospectuses or that a series fund will not have to change any funds investment objectives or policies we have reserved the right to modify your policy if we believe doing so will prevent you from being considered the owner of your policys proportionate share of the assets of the account but we are under no obligation to do so  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th pay premium limit and modified endowment contract status at the time of policy issuance we will determine whether the planned premium schedule will exceed the pay limit discussed below if so our standard procedures prohibit issuance of the policy unless you sign a form acknowledging that fact the pay limit is the total of net level premiums that would have been payable at any time for a comparable fixed policy to be fully paidup after the payment of  equal annual premiums paidup means that no further premiums would be required to continue the coverage in force until maturity based on certain prescribed assumptions if the total premiums paid at any time during the first  policy years exceed the pay limit the policy will be treated as a modified endowment contract which can have adverse tax consequences policies classified as modified endowment contracts are subject to the following tax rules o first all partial withdrawals from such a policy are treated as ordinary income subject to tax up to the amount equal to the excess if any of the policy value immediately before the distribution over the investment in the policy at such time o second loans taken from or secured by such a policy and assignments or pledges of any part of its value are treated as partial withdrawals from the policy and taxed accordingly pastdue loan interest that is added to the loan amount is treated as an additional loan o third a  additional income tax is imposed on the portion of any distribution including distributions on surrender from or loan taken from or secured by such a policy that is included in income except where the distribution or loan o is made on or after the date on which the policy owner attains age  o is attributable to the policy owner becoming disabled or o is part of a series of substantially equal periodic payments for the life or life expectancy of the policy owner or the joint lives or joint life expectancies of the policy owner and the policy owners beneficiary these exceptions to the  additional tax do not apply in situations where the policy is not owned by an individual furthermore any time there is a material change in a policy the policy will begin a new pay testing period as if it were a newlyissued policy the material change rules for determining whether a policy is a modified endowment contract are complex in general however the determination of whether a policy will be a modified endowment contract after a material change generally depends upon the relationship among the death benefit of the policy at the time of such change the policy value at the time of the change and the additional premiums paid into the policy during the seven years starting with the date on which the material change occurs moreover if benefits under a policy are reduced such as a reduction in the death benefit or the reduction or cancellation of certain rider benefits during the  years in which a pay test is being applied the pay limit will generally be recalculated based on the reduced benefits if the premiums paid to date are greater than the recalculated pay limit the policy will become a modified endowment contract all modified endowment contracts issued by the same insurer or its affiliates to the same owner during any calendar year generally are required to be treated as one contract for the purpose of applying the modified endowment contract rules a policy received in exchange for a modified endowment contract will itself also be a modified endowment contract you should consult your tax advisor if you have questions regarding the possible impact of the pay limit on your policy corporate and hr  retirement plans the policy may be acquired in connection with the funding of retirement plans satisfying the qualification requirements of section  of the code if so the code provisions relating to such plans and life insurance benefits thereunder should be carefully scrutinized we are not responsible for compliance with the terms of any such plan or with the requirements of applicable provisions of the code withholding to
