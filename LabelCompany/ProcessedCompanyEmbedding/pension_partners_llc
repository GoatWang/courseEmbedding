deflation central bankers around the world can’t seem to get enough of the d word deflation is rampant and needs to be purged they say justifying rate cuts and even negative interest rates the us federal reserve bucked the trend last december in raising rates to a paltry  bps its first hike since  and remains the only developed central bank in the world whose last move was a hike since the december move the fed has refrained from hiking again due in part to increasing fears of deflation during the market correction to start the year during every correction as long yields fall the perma bear deflationistas come out in full force screaming of deflation and another great depression how accurate are these fears of deflation in the us let’s take a look at the data  looking at the us cpi data inflation is running about  core excluding foodenergy and  overall including foodenergy over the past year  looking at us personal consumption expenditures pce data inflation is running at about  core and  overall over the past year  looking at owners equivalent rent the largest component of cpi it is running at  over the past year  average hourly earnings in the us are up  over the past year  market based inflation expectations breakevens calculated from tips minus nominal are currently running at  to  over the next two to ten years inflation and expectations for future inflation are certainly lower than the historical average but this is not deflation prices are still rising overall as anyone who pays the bills for food housing healthcare and education will tell you in fact if we look at the historical inflation data going back to  we have never seen outright deflation in the united states yes it has been trending lower over this time but it is still positive this is interesting as it pertains to the markets today because there seems to be an increasingly vocal view that the us will eventually go the way of europe and japan pursuing negative interest rate policy and currency debasement while anything is possible i don’t believe this is probable in the near term as i wrote back in february “the easy money game has changed” why because the easy money game changed back in december with the first rate hike in seven years the fed wants to normalize interest rates as they recognize that there are serious untended consequences to keeping rates at artificially low levels for an extended period of time they also likely recognize if they are honest about the data that there is no actual deflation in the us to justify the extreme measures of the ecb and the boj to shift from the path to normalization then would require a severe stock market downturn and another recession at a minimum as far as i’m concerned europe and japan can have their negative interest rates i’d much prefer higher interest rates accompanied by higher growth yes the two are related as you can see in the chart below click here for our research on treasuries as for the us economy jobless claims hit their lowest level since  this week given this backdrop the notion that a  bps fed funds rate is holding back growth seems a bit absurd this is still extraordinarily easy monetary policy as for the equity markets the sp  total return hit new highs this week not a backdrop suggesting a need for additional monetary stimulus the one thing missing from my silver linings playbook piece penned at the february lows higher long duration yields and a steeping yield curve the question for investors today are long yields being held down by the extreme policies of europejapan or a real concern about growth in the us given the rise in inflation expectations in recent months it would seem to be more of the former if that’s indeed the case long bond yields should start to rise from here and the fed will be inclined to continue normalization in the coming months as for the pundits screaming about deflation and depression without any data to support that view

markets risk management charlie bilello in a world increasingly focused on the short term five years can seem like an eternity how many among us would stick with an investment that has gone nowhere for five years that is precisely the question gold investors are faced with today with a return of  over the past five years the case for buying gold five years ago was seemingly obvious the federal reserve was embarking on a second round of quantitative easing and continuation of  interest rates this was supposed to lead to higher inflation a collapse in the us dollar and increased demand for the “other” currency gold fast forward five years and we have seen continued central bank easing not only in the us but across the globe while we did see inflation in housing and stocks prices what we did not see was a collapse in the dollar or a spike in reported inflation we also did not see an increase in the demand for gold the past five years have not been a straight line though gold prices initially surged higher in  and money flowed in as investors chased returns for a brief period of time the spdr gold shares etf gld stood as the largest etf in the world since then gold prices have fallen  and assets in gld have fallen more declining over  from their  peak so the answer to the above question about how many of us would stick with an asset that has declined over the past five years is … not many still there remains  billion of assets in the gold etf not a small sum those sticking with the yellow metal today argue that gold is not just an “inflation hedge” but also acts as an insurance policy of sorts it is supposed to provide an uncorrelated alternative to stocks that proves valuable during times of stress fair enough there has been no stress to speak of in recent years and thus no need for any uncorrelated exposure or diversification in hindsight but eventually we will enter another volatile period in equities where gold will prove valuable – or so goes the argument let’s examine this thesis looking at the period from  through today first gold is indeed uncorrelated to stocks with a monthly correlation of  to the sp  second it has acted as a hedge on average with a  down capture to the sp  meaning it tends to rise when the sp  falls during months in which the sp  has finished lower gold has risen  of the time lastly introducing gold into a stock portfolio has also improved riskadjusted returns returnvolatility a  portfolio of stocks and gold slightly underperforms stocks alone  vs  but does so with lower volatility  vs  and lower drawdowns  vs  than an allstock portfolio see table  based on these stats a reasonable case can be made that gold can add value to an allstock portfolio but this conclusion is one made only in isolation failing to consider other competing investments gold is not the only asset class with a low correlation to equities that can mitigate volatility in a portfolio there are also bonds since  the barclays aggregate bond index agg has a correlation of  with the sp  and the merrill lynch   year treasury index has a correlation of  both bond indices have a down capture ratio that is more negative than gold  and  with a higher percentage of positive returns during down months for the sp   and  they also tend to perform better during up months for the sp  with up capture ratios of  and  versus  for gold an additional factor favoring bonds over gold is their lower volatility a portfolio of stocks and bonds produces a significantly higher riskadjusted return than a portfolio of stocks and gold see returnvol in table  below adding gold to a portfolio of stocks and bonds seems to add little additional benefit other than a lower correlation profile to the sp  note at pension partners we use bonds as our defensive position in our absolute return strategies for all of the above reasons bonds have provided a more consistent defensive alternative to stocks during periods of market stress with lower volatility and drawdowns than gold in our research on treasuries click here and lumbergold click here we illustrate tactical strategies that use bonds as the default position when equity volatility is expected to rise gold what is it good for in the past forty years bonds have been the better alternative than gold for investors seeking to minimize drawdowns and lower volatility in their portfolios bonds also throw off an income stream while gold yields nothing does that mean gold is good for absolutely nothing having no place in a portfolio no the future is not the past and anything could happen in the next five years should we see high inflation and rising interest rates as we saw during the ’s gold would likely prove beneficial in a portfolio if the us dollar were to experience a sharp decline one would also expect gold to perform well handicapping these scenarios is not an easy task and i certainly wouldn’t recommend trying the real questions for gold investors are about staying power discipline and asset allocation  staying power how long are you willing to wait for gold to prove its worth gold is down over the past five years which already seems like an eternity would you be willing to sit in gold for twentyseven years with flat returns as we saw from the peak in  through  not likely  discipline gold is prone to sharp spikes higher and dramatic moves lower do you have the discipline to resist buying gold after a spike and selling gold after a crash this is true for any asset class but given the higher volatility of gold it is a particularly important question  asset allocation assuming you have staying power and discipline what is the appropriate sizing for gold in a portfolio there is no easy answer to this question and really comes down to  whether you view gold as a better diversifier and equity hedge than bonds and  what your expected returns are for gold versus stocks and bonds as outlined above gold hasn’t been a better hedge or diversifier on average than bonds in past forty years on the second question there is a strong case that can be made that equity and fixed income returns will be below average in the coming years considering today’s high valuations and low bond yields this should increase the odds of gold holding its own as compared to the early ’s when equity valuations were low and bond yields were high that said even if gold performs well in the next five years it’s likely to be a volatile ride which is why for most investors staying power discipline and sizing may actually be more critical
