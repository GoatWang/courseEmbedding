network as well as having a large pipeline for potential business prospects in january seesmart validated their worth by receiving an order that could be worth as much as  million in the near future why the led market is expected to grow the most exciting aspect of new led technology is how much more energy efficient it has become compared to traditional lighting led lighting is  more efficient than traditional lighting and is being utilized as a way to not only go green but also to save money on electric bills most led lighting is  recyclable and when combined with its  greater efficiency led lighting has become the new standard for companies and individuals around the world the lighting market has only begun evolving as only  of the market is using by led lighting us legislation such as the energy independence and security act of  mandates more energy efficient lighting as an effort to encourage consumers to use less energy and to consume fewer fossil fuels specifically the legislation prohibits the use of fluorescent tube lighting after june  scheduled to be voted on in  additional legislation concerning even stricter energy efficiency requirements may be placed on the lighting industry these requirements may force the us lighting market to turn exclusively to led lighting as traditional lighting methods have not been remotely as efficient as led lighting technical outlook by harry boxer the following technical analysis of the companys shares is by the renowned harry boxer who has published the tech trader for  years low priced and thinly traded rvlt has emerged since last september when it exploded on heavy relative volume moving from just  to  a nearly  fold move in just  weeks a move of those proportions is very often followed by a long period of consolidation and thats exactly what occurred over the following  months as the stock got very quiet before the next move which was triggered late january when it nearly tripled from  to  in just  sessions by now you can see how explosive this stock can be when it does move since then the stock has consolidated bullishly in a wedge type pattern as underlying technicals held up very well actually improving the stock is now in a th wave consolidation that has lasted  weeks and action last week in particular got very quiet as the stock price movement narrowed substantially with volume decreasing to a low ebb perhaps a precursor to an imminent move we often see just this type of action before another move takes place which could be a substantial th wave up price resistance appears to be near the  zone but a move over that especially with volume could trigger the next leg up we are looking for price projectionstargets going forward are      harry boxer the technical trader wwwthetechtradercom conclusion according to rvlts november   press release the market for led lighting is projected to control  of the lighting market by  with an industry sector growing so rapidly the best way to find the greatest returns is to focus on the company whose operations are focused solely on the growth industry itself in rvlts case their operations are focused solely on the development and production of led lighting and will see growth proportional to the led market growth at the very least the growing market for led technology plus a strong growth driven management team

investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report and hopefully surge higher in price too in fact when combining a zacks rank  or better and a positive earnings esp
