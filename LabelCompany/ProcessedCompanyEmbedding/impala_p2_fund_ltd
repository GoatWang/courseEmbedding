hard that is screeches the tires we had the transmission serviced thursday and now it is even worse than before i have done extensive research on this issue and i am not the only person with this issue in fact there are hundreds and hundreds of people wondering why this has not been recalled on these cars this has been a problem for many years of impala and for many people take a look at all the power train complaints for just the  on nhtsa why is there no fix issued for this repeated problem it is a safety issuehelpfulyesnopam of findlay oh on june  satisfaction ratingi purchased a  chevrolet impala lt  ltr in  with k miles on it in the last year i have experienced having  tank or more of gas showing on the gas needle and  miles until empty per the calculations option my car has died on an interstate highway at these levels all three times rendering me stranded in construction when there was no safe place to really be stranded dealership only advised a new fuel sensor would be  i now ensure i keep tank above  needle mark at all times no recall but lots of reviews of similar experiences these are dangerous events chevrolet  i assume youd rather pay a wrongful death claim than fix the known issueadditionally i too have experienced the loud clunkingcreaking sounds coming from my front end the dealership quoted me  worth of repairs to fix drill and tap front braces replace front strutssprings w new kits right front hub bushings bearings etc ishaft steering i had them do the ishaft  no change in sounds over the weekend i installed new strutsspring kits same as what dealership was offering but instead of them charging  i paid  total i replaced the right front hub and right front lower control arm assembly no change clunking and creaking sound still existsi have had more than one mechanic tell me its not a safety issue although no diagnosis has been given and to just turn my music up and ignore it with the consistent complaints on this impala and about  years worth of this model why is chevrolet still sitting on correcting the problem i can avow this much i will never purchase another chevrolet product again new or usedhelpfulyesnosarah of kenosha wi on march  satisfaction ratingi leased a brand new  impala at the end of may  it is the lt model in october of  i was traveling on the freeway with my two children in the car toddler in the backseat to take my son to school the car had a sudden reduction of power quickly dropping from  mph to around  mph the engine light came on and i nervously tried to move out of traffic to avoid being hit by other cars frightening i was able to get my son to school finally even though the car refused to accelerate beyond  mph after taking the car to the dealership i was told my fuel pump would need to be replaced i found this odd since it was a brand new car but figured it was a flukein october of  i was on the freeway traveling to pick up my toddler from my parents again the vehicle quickly dropped from  mph or so down to  mph and i was almost hit from behind by a semi truck who was traveling full speed i put on my hazards pulled my heart out of my stomach and managed to exit the interstate after driving a mile or so in the emergency lane to the next exit this time i told the dealership they would need to pick up the car and tow it backafter they checked out the car i was informed that it was once again the fuel pump two fuel pumps and two near death experiences under k miles this time i was angry my husband and i told the dealership they needed to do something i could not continue to drive this car in fear with my children inside after all the whole reason we decided to lease a brand new vehicle was to have a safe and reliable car we were informed by the dealership that the sudden reduction of power resulting in two near accidents on the interstate was a safety feature in the particular trim package of our vehicle it was designed to protect the engine in the event of a problem with the car safety feature it seems that chevy is more concerned with protecting their vehicles than the occupants insidefurthermore why should i have even learned about this supposed safety feature twice already on a new vehicle after writing a terrible review on the chevy customer satisfaction survey we were contacted by chevrolet we explained our complete dissatisfaction with this vehicle and that since i no longer felt safe transporting my family in the obviously unreliable vehicle we wanted out we gave them the option to put me into a different vehicle to ride out my lease to which they said my lease would start over for another  months ridiculous we just want rid of this vehicle asap their solution a free year of xm radio this is what my life and those of my family members is worth a year of radio doesnt really seem like a reasonable trade offwell guess what over this past weekend the engine light came on again my husband used a small diagnostic machine to find out that it is the fuel pump for the third time the car has just under k miles on it we havent even had it a full two years yet even more interesting it was barely k miles between the second and third time this happened so two things gmchevy  stop putting junk disposable parts in your vehicles and  fix your safety feature before someone gets killed it should not take someone being seriously injured or killed before you take notice and recall these vehicles i will never again buy any gmchevy producthelpfulyesnojuanita of winston salem nc on march  satisfaction ratingafter purchasing my third chevrolet a  chevrolet impala ltz at  im informed my rear wheel bearing are in need of complete replacement how does this occur my  trailblazer and my prior impala ltz had higher miles and yet no issues i had an issue with my trailblazer the blower motor resistor and its components kept melting and burning out three years straight the last time i replaced these parts i realize chevy had made a different part in  sold only at the dealership no recall for my  and a more durable component this is not normal wear and tear on this luxury model as an exampleits as inferior as placing resistor plugs in a car that best performance are with platinum plugs and will cause it to misfire this is a bad experience for me and as much as i love an american made product i dont know if im as confident as i was before about chevrolethelpfulyesnowayne of conroe tx on jan  satisfaction ratinglet me start by saying i have bought many new gm cars off the showroom  c corvettes  c  c a  monte ss a  th anniversary camaro z a  tahoe and have been pleased to a large part now on to my biggest car buying nightmare of my life i bought a new  impala ss and it to be the last or nd to last car i will buy at least i hoped so lets seetransmission gone at  miles both front wheel bearings  twice  batteries a total of  dash actuators at  different intervals eats tires for it main meals plus a gas tank actuator just for starters now i take care of all of my maintenance as required so needless to say nothing close to this with any of my other gm cars now i have spent enough in service to pay for my car twice not counting  sets of tires just buy used now  batteries engine mounts repair of the drivers seats hog rings electric seat motors replacement needless to say no more gm cars for me and my family my car has had to be towed  times for service run from the new gm they have no regard for their customers at allhelpfulyesno how do i know i can trust these reviews about chevrolet  reviews on

for  last year  months after buying you couldnt shift it outta park brought it to gm and they fixed it for  now it just did it again thats  times within a year of owning this lemon gm should be responsible for their bad designs of wiring in these cars if you are experiencing the same thing start complaining and hopefully someone will make them pay for their poor designs and hard working people can keep their hard earned money instead of paying for their mistakes all the time if you know anyone looking at a chevy impala tell them to stay away from all we have owned many and every year of make and model have nothing but electrical problems that costs hundreds into the thousandshelpfulyesnotracey of dublin va on dec  satisfaction rating impala lt developed a whining noise in the rear i took it in for service both rear wheel bearing bad at  miles gm agreed to pay for the repairs but this part should not be failing at this mileagehelpfulyesnoteresa of rainbow city al on dec  satisfaction ratingi have a  chevy impala ltz my car goes completely dead even though it states that i still have  miles left to go and will not crank back up i can put gasoline in it and it will crank back up but will go dead again around  miles left to go before empty the dealership has replaced the fuel level sending sensor thing to no avail there is no code showing the technicians are baffled anyone out there that have had the same problem with their carhelpfulyesnobobby of zion il on oct  satisfaction ratingbought new impala ltz in june  at  in february  heard loud roaring noise from rear take the car in to the dealer and was told that the rear wheel bearings needed replacing i asked what could cause that at  miles and was told i must have been running over a lot of pot holes excuse me nonetheless i was highly upset at the remark at this point more than anything i told the serviceman that i would let them know about fixing my car i was so angry that i went to the ford dealer next door and purchased a  ford taurus i drove the  taurus back to the chevy dealer and made the salesman who sold me the car and the finance guy that this should have never happened they are sealed bearings i turned in my warranty and gap for a refund and i do not want another chevy after this experiencei dont know why these service guys think people dont know anything about cars i also contacted gm who contacted the dealership management who tried to contact me but a fix was not going to satisfy me and i was disappointed with this car that i liked so well i got and was consistently getting good reviews on how the car looked i also experienced steam from the radiator every time it rained or when i went to the car wash i was told that it was a design issue experienced a loud noise when both back windows were down while on the road it was deafening i am   lbs and yes i had difficulty getting inout the  was the best styling impala ltz in my book but too many issues took away the enjoyment i had  ford tauruss  and  and just traded the  in for a  ford fusion fords have a better powertrain anyway so long chevy it was a slicehelpfulyesnotina of plantation fl on oct  satisfaction ratingi have  chevy impala and for those who are having issue with the abs light and the traction control or when youre turning left or right you hear a strange noise it actually could be the harness thats what the dealership told me one year my right harness was bad and i had it change then the lights came on again and the left harness was bad as well a year later it wasnt cheap but i had it fixed and i havent had any issues since hope this helpshelpfulyesnothomas of syracuse ny on oct  satisfaction ratingi bought the  chevy impala lt at  miles at  i had to have both front wheel barrings and the cv joint replaced the engine does run fine with the exception that it has a sound that does not appear to be normal like a lifter is not even i had the oil changed tire rotation i see that most service stations put  psi max in the tires the door indicated  psi and that when i changed it made a relative smooth ride there does appear to have a slight rattle sound in the back end i thought it might be the exhaust hangers but a mechanic drove it and he says its the cups on the top of the rear shocks i will probably have to replace them both soonhelpfulyesnotracey of carthage ms on sept  satisfaction ratingis there a recall i just bought this  chevy impala at mi at  the abs and traction lights is blinking and when i turn left i hear noise from wheel what do i do who knows how to fix thishelpfulyesnomarvin of tigard or on sept  satisfaction ratingfirst of all do a lot of web research i bought a  impala last year for my daughter i told the dealer it was for a female student and needed to be reliable they sold us a car with  on it and said those engines will just keep on going yeah we have just kept going back and forth to the dealers shop ever sincethese cars especially ish have major front end problems major brake rotor problems and major transmission solenoid problems causing the transmission to slam into gear in one site alone i found almost  complaints about the transmission for the front brakes always causing horrible pulsations i discovered that chevy factory rotors are worthless and should not be recut or replaced at the dealer i had to buy aftermarket semirace rotors and pads and my brake problems went away now im at battle over the transmission that acts like its a clutch car and slams into gear this is a known defect that gm wont address the rotors are a known problem there are other very dangerous problems known to gm such as the engine losing power while being driven which has almost caused deaths i dont see much help for anyone except to start class action suits file complaints with the transportation safety board the more the complaints the more likely to get something done i can verify my ownership with documentation but do not have it at hand at the time of this writing  will add it when i can i bought the car at hubbard chevrolet in canby oregonhelpfulyesnojake of mira loma ca on sept  satisfaction ratingwas driving down the freeway in my impala ss and all of a sudden there was a loud clicking from my dash so loud that it scared me and i swerved almost hitting another car got home and researched that many people have had this same problem with the actuator i called gm corporate and they have no one i can speak to in regards to safety i told them my problem amongst others having the same issue also causing accidents because of the sudden loud noise and they said they couldnt help me out and to take it to a dealer to have them check it out we all know thats how dealerships make their moneyon the mechanical back end i know what the problem is and i just wanted to address my safety concerns how come this hasnt been recalledthis is a huge safety issue not only for those who own an impala but for others that could be part of the accident caused by this malfunction while on the road why didnt they have a safety team they could transfer me to instead they felt annoyed and hung up on me thanks gmhelpfulyesnolinda g of miami ok on sept  satisfaction ratingwe bought our  chevrolet impala ls  ltr v cyl new at crossroads chevrolet in vinita ok we had a passenger side window which would scrape

going off telling me i was losing engine power and traction when i called a chevy dealer they told me there were a hundred reasons why that could happen and they will only pay for repairs if the computer in my car recorded the error code for that sensor the charge for inspecting my car was  and i would have to pay that if the right error code wasnt recorded on my computer luckily the right

aug  satisfaction ratingproblems with  chevy impala ss i bought this car used with  miles on it in september  ive had to replace the ac blend door actuators on both sides twice myself and now the

owning it about a year the lights in the vanity mirror on the drivers side quit working about the same time not a fuse problem nor bulb problem apparently an electrical issue passenger side airbag sensor is out  not sure what caused that but causes the warning light to stay on  has been for about  years transmission started slipping around  miles  have it serviced and maintained as it calls for now today on my way to work the stabilitrak warning came on the car started shaking almost violently then the warning light came on along with reduced power alert i pulled to the side of the road and shut the car off walked around it kicked the tires mostly out of anger and frustration got back in and the problem was gone and the only recall on this car is for the ignitionkey if so many complaints about the actuators and the warning lights which on a freeway is very much a hazard to immediately lose power why are there no recalls on these problems i love my car but it is becoming a drain it now

anyone any relief or to issue a recall i have owned at least  gm vehicles and most of them went over  miles and still ran when i sold them  gm to know they have this problem and keep those cars on the

much for buying americanhelpfulyesnoangel of centinnial co on may  satisfaction ratingi own a  impala ls for  years now and ive noticed a lot of people are having a stability control issue i had that problem one time and found out it had to do with the battery on my impala the  impala doesnt come with a battery gauge on the dashboard to notify you when your battery could be losing charge or might even need to be changed in my own impala when i started receiving that message i took to the mechanic and found out that the battery had been in the car since it had been built in the factory i also found out that the battery needs to be strong enough to push every point thats needed to push the engine a lower battery would still cause the message to appear and the car to shake because its not strong enough to push the stability control and other thingsi experienced a lot of different things when my battery was bad that all happened at once since i have changed the battery at  miles i havent had no other problems with my impala and im now at  shes still going strong hopefully this can help out a few people with a few of the issues they’re having with their impala i’ve had  in my life and they all  have been my most dependable also do your research on the vehicle before you purchase it like get repair receipts or history reports so you know the car has been taken care of most

expensive of all of my cars with a price tag of  my dealership asked me if i had my tires rotated during services i replied did i you were the ones that performed my serviceit seems odd for a  care to need new tires at around  miles now today a new issue arose my engine light came on along with the stabilitrak sensor after looking at this page and many other impala reviews i see that this is another impala issue i will be very surprised to hear the dealerships reason for the lights for i called and i was told that there are many reasons for these lights to come on and i have an appointment in two days the car shakes when i am idle or driving slowly it also stutters when i start the car i am so angry because i actually suggested this car to people a friend of mine even purchased the same vehicle i have i regret ever suggesting it again put your money in a good car and spending  on a vehicle means that i should not have to spend more money fixing issues that shouldnt
