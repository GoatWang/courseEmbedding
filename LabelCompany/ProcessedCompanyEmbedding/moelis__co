now turn the call over to joe joseph simon thanks michele and good afternoon everyone on todays call i will discuss our results and then ken will provide his views on the market environment and our outlook im pleased report that we achieved our strongest second quarter of revenues to date of  million up  from the prior year quarter our performance compares favorably to the overall ma market in which the number of global ma completions greater than  million was down  from the prior year quarter for the first half our revenues were  million up  from the first half last year consistent with last quarter our revenue growth was widespread across products and sectors in particular we saw strong yearoveryear growth in ma and large complex advisory assignments where we continue to gain share our ma activity was up both sequentially and yearoveryear and we earned higher average fees on larger transaction completions in both the second quarter and first half restructuring activity also grew yearoveryear as we completed a greater number of both incourt and outofcourt transactions for clients and earned higher average fees on these completions sequentially restructuring activity was down with fewer completions than in the first quarter as we noted on our last call we expect restructuring activity to be a steady contributor overall we advised a greater number of clients in the first half of  including a greater number of clients who paid fees over  million and we completed a larger number of transactions over the prior year period were encouraged by our strong business momentum moving to expenses our adjusted comp expense ratio of  for the quarter and first half is in line with our target as well as with prior periods our noncomp ratio decreased from  to  in the second quarter and from  to  for the first half driven by higher revenues for the second quarter we reported  million of noncomp expenses the increase in absolute dollars was largely attributable to new business development and transactionrelated charges we continue to target a noncomp expense ratio of  to  as a result of the ipo of our australia business we recognized a gain of  million on the dilution of our ownership interest in june the australia business issued a limited number of shares in connection with a small acquisition which resulted in an additional gain of  million these gains are noncash and are reported within other income we currently hold  million   million shares of the listed security which translates to approximately  per fully diluted share of mc moelis our corporate effective tax rate declined to  from  for the first half this includes the impact of an excess tax benefit related to an april vesting event the contribution of this tax benefit to eps this quarter was approximately  given the timing of our vesting events we do not anticipate similar tax benefits in the second half of the year excluding the impact of this discrete benefit our effective tax rate would have been  for the first half as a reminder our adjusted presentation assumes that all partnership units have been converted to shares so that all of the firms income is taxed as if it were subject to the corporate effective rate finally our board declared a quarterly dividend of  per share consistent with last quarter to be paid on august  to shareholders of record as of august  we ended the quarter with a strong financial position with no debt and  million of cash and liquid investments which was measured prior to the  per share special dividend we paid on july  ill now turn the call over to ken kenneth moelis thanks joe and hello everyone as joe discussed we achieved another quarter of record revenues as we continue to see strength in all product areas with particularly strong growth in ma this quarter id like to touch further on our revenue growth and where we see opportunity going forward our strategy of covering a diverse set of clients continues to pay off as our global network comes together were not only advising on the assignments you can see in the public domain but were also delivering significant resources in large complex situations and with complete discretion these situations include boardroom assignments in defense and activism and other large strategic advisory engagements our ability to solve issues quietly and to make it difficult to track our activity level  may make it difficult to attract  to track our activity levels but it is an extremely valuable asset for our clients and were developing deep long term trusted relationships our approach to client coverage and our increasing momentum also helps us attract highquality likeminded talent those who value a collaborative model and are committed to building an enduring franchise based on long term client relationships earlier this month we announced a veteran managing director hire in our london office to help build our european private funds advisory business and in the first half of this year we advised  private funds clients this hire will continue to accelerate our growth in the business particularly outside the us we started the year with a focus on enhancing our technology expertise in addition to hiring a senior software banker who we announced in april this morning we announced the hiring of  veteran managing directors in the highly active industrial tech and fintech sectors these senior hires are a compelling addition to our global network they will help industrial and financial services clients address the impacts of technology on their evolving businesses which we believe to be an important trend with such change we expect continued ma and restructuring activity excluding these hot new hires we ended the quarter with  managing directors yeartodate we have internally promoted  managing directors and hired  from outside the power of collaboration creates a network effect that multiplies the value of each new hire and accelerates the growth of our franchise in terms of our business when i look at our activity levels and the high quality of talent were promoting from within and adding externally im excited about our franchise the resonance of our brand globally and our continuing growth with that well now welcome any questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions and our first questioner is going to be ken worthington with jpmorgan kenneth worthington so ken first to follow up on your comments it seems like moelis is finding its way into more milliondollar assignments more often you mentioned bigger deals more complex transactions can you give us some color into what sort of  how youre able to drive that  the position in higherfee deals with higherfee clients kenneth moelis well i think its the same thing ken that weve been doing but now weve been doing it for  years i think we tried to tell a story early on in our ipo that we were hiring a different kind of managing director earlier in their career who really wanted to combine on a collaborative team effort and cover complex situations which require teams very different than a  ill call it a peak higher somebody late in their career who only wants to cover their existing account and now weve been doing it for  years and weve been doing it globally for  or  as we expanded around the world and its very effective we put  or  managing directors in a room and we cover those clients in ways that i think others dont and its effective and so were bringing  brought in more and more to some very large complex assignments that require confidentiality i think thats a way we compete against the big firms and long term commitment to the resources and the senior resources and the multiple senior resources required to cover these complex assignments over long periods of time and its no magic formula but it takes commitment kenneth worthington okay and its working right and then just secondly another strong quarter youre doing special dividends youre returning more money to us as investors maybe talk about the thought about increasing the pace of investment in the business now obviously you just announced that youve hired  so were seeing that but talk about the pace is it something that you will use the windfall from how good the business is performing right now to increase the pace in  of investment in the business and if that seems to be attractive to you maybe give us some color on what opportunities you see either by sector by region or by business like just a little more color into maybe where you would see the opportunities to further invest if thats really what youd like to do kenneth moelis the answer is yes yes and yes so let me start by saying  but theres a couple of sectors that are high on our list to invest in health care things wed like to do more in energy but look ken id say based on our current level of activity it would be hard for me to find a sector or area that i would not hire and invest in and thats in all levels of the firm junior right up to managing director so im not holding back its just that you got to find the right people in the right spot in the right region who really want to participate in the collaborative environment that were putting together if we find that person believe me  and if you have any names email them to us were very interested in growing and we dont see it as a windfall we see the result of  the cash flow that we generate is a result of being disciplined and making sure those people are the people you  that fit in and also the  internal promotes dont forget if we can continue on a pace ator near there that is a significant way to build the business and its the best way to build the business operator and the next questioner is going to be devin ryan with jmp securities devin ryan just a couple here i guess first activism defense you mentioned that as kind of one area that contributed and i know sometimes we cant follow that particularly from the outside as well so im just curious in that business specifically how should we think about the fees there are they attractive fees on their own or is it more of a lead in to other types of bigger deals over time how should we think about that business kenneth moelis some of both and i dont want to  look were talking about highly discrete assignments that are hard to characterize as commodities some of the things that ive been talking about are unique theyre complex as i said theyre hard to categorize i dont want to generalize on the assignments but what i think weve been able to do on a couple of situations is quietly go in and i think that some of the activism in the world today some of the actions beget their own reactions and were believers that sometimes quietly getting into companies and talking about strategies and doing these things we think are more effective and we think weve been very effective at it quietly id say but i think all im saying on the fees its very hard its  theyre not cookie cutter assignments and i just  i dont want to try to generalize a specific fee method devin ryan yes understood no thats helpful i think last quarter you spoke about the restructuring business and maybe seeing in terms of new announcements of tapering a bit but still feeling pretty constructive around the opportunity there and so obviously its still contributing nicely to results and then that might be one area that can be a little bit difficult to track as well so im just curious kind of for the current update youre realizing your prior business but how has new business been how much is new business offsetting stuff thats going out the door kenneth moelis its been fairly constant percentage of our business i would say i wouldnt look to restructuring as anything that was exceptionally good or bad this quarter it was kind of  its okay i think there was a big wrapup to the first energy shock that happened in the fourth and the first so the second i think was not  just didnt have as many energy closings but i think our new assignment rate and our advisory rate i think we tell you its  to  of our business its  and weve been saying its the low end of that and its kind of about where wed expect it to run devin ryan got it okay helpful and then with respect to noncomp expenses maybe for joe i know that its probably better to look at it as a percentage of revenues and youve been running at a really good level there last quarter i think we spoke about  million to  million is kind of a dollar amount that might be a decent range weve been a little bit above that but obviously youve had a couple of great revenue quarter so im just curious if there is any timing in there or maybe just because of revenue backdrops been a little bit better we should expect the range could be a little bit higher going forward joseph simon yes id say the underlying run rate is around  million maybe a little higher but the reason were higher this quarter and last is really largely due to spend thats not captured in the run rate those are the expenses related to transactions so youll have finder fees or coadvisory fees or other types of transaction fees that ultimately get captured in noncomp that are ultimately are above and beyond the run rate devin ryan got it okay and then just last one here with respect to the special dividend could you just  quickly just talk about the default process around declaring it now versus maybe waiting and assessing kind of where cash positions and capital is  and excess capital is at yearend i mean is it just because of the special event of the gain and so this is really truly kind of a onetime type of situation or as youre always evaluating your capital position and as cash builds like we can actually think about it being  these specials could come at any time really depending on how you feel at that time kenneth moelis look weve said were going to return capital to our investors we dont need a lot of capital to run the business we looked around a month ago and we had a lot of excess capital some of it  there were some  we had  good quarters going we had the australian dividend excess capital we had just good tax position too at the beginning because of those tax events and we just looked at it and said the capitals better in your hands than our hands we sort of hold it in treasury bills we dont think thats the rate of return of most of our shareholders and we felt very comfortable that we had access capital to give back and we said we might as well give it back to them why hold it for another  or  months and that was our whole thought process was better in the hands of our investors than our hands operator and our next questioner today is going to be ann dai with kbw yian dai ken im wondering around the political environment if youre finding that the longer that some of these items drag on if some of your clients are looking to put a further discount on those items being able to pass through congress to the point where they kind of say well its a longer time frame that we had expected and maybe well just move forward with our decisions and stop waiting for potential resolution do you think theres a point at which that happens for some of your clients kenneth moelis my theory is on some of the very large transactions around  that had to do especially with taxation theres a hold waiting to see what happens with tax i think there were some industries that felt like the us tax rate was not competitive and they were looking to do inversions for a few years i think theres a feeling now and a hope thats worth waiting for its sizable enough that we may solve our own tax problem so not to do an unnatural act here while waiting to see what happens look if that goes on another year maybe they will run out of patience but i think for the time being there is a feeling that that particular problem might get solved i think everything below that i dont see a lot of waiting we see companies strategically and financially moving ahead with their plans and not waiting for resolution of any of the agenda i think the handicapping of this is from here going forward therell probably be less regulation lower taxes less mandates on companies so i think from here they dont expect it to get worse so they are going to go implement their plans other than the one thing that i think is  just a very big event would be to try to change your venue for global taxation yian dai okay thats good color my other question is around retail obviously there continue to be a lot of headlines around the sector and i guess from your perspective i guess im wondering whether youre expecting to see more of an acceleration in ma or restructuring in that area or whether you can have both coexist kenneth moelis you probably could have both coexist i think theres a fundamental need to rationalize people want to get larger to fight online and to fight amazon and retail specifically and therell be restructurings as well now the last time i was asked this this would retail step in for energy and the answer is i dont believe its going to be as big an opportunity as energy energy was a very very large user of capital in the leverage world so i think retail will undergo both but i dont think its worth  i dont think itll be so large that itll step in and replace things like energy in the restructuring world but it will be  yes theres a lot of restructuring going on in the retail business but a lot of those are smaller companies who are just kind of closing stores and shutting down in some cases so yes i do think youll see some of both operator and our next questioner today is going to be conor fitzgerald with goldman sachs conor fitzgerald ken maybe just a question on what youre seeing in europe and the outlook for ma there weve had a lot of positive economic data points there recently and then your conversation with management just curious on how these positive economic data points are being weighed versus some of the overhangs you still have from brexit to the german elections et cetera kenneth moelis yes im sensing a bit of an upturn in european business i think some of its us doing better as a group so i always like when you guys ask us these questions we only have  we have a small portal into it but we do  we feel like the general market is getting more upbeat on doing things and we feel like were having a better year and have organized europe and feel much better about our activity there so yes i think its steady  i wouldnt expect a spike but i think  i feel like therell be a steady improvement in european corporate activity and yes the corporates well i think the corporates are facing the same thing theyve been facing for a long time which is low growth but low interest rates higher asset values high stock prices and extraordinarily low volatility and thats a good time for transactions the volatility  if you think about trying to put  stocks together in a transaction low volatility is a big asset you can get a good bead on what your relative values are versus high volatility times and i think thats undertalked about as a protagonist in the ma environment conor fitzgerald thats helpful and then maybe just one on the hiring front youve got a couple of successes yeartodate obviously just curious when youre competing for new talent or maybe to retain the talent you already have are you competing with nonpublic independent advisory firms more so than you were say a year or  ago and just curious how you found being public company there in terms of is it a competitive advantage or disadvantage kenneth moelis no i dont think we compete much with private market advisory shops the only thing id be wary of large banks that have completed their recapitalization and raised money in  i said those  after youve done your rights offer you tend to become very more aggressive and want to show youre back in business so other than  i think thats where we see the most competitive environment now conor fitzgerald and then just one housekeeping one for joe just the loss on  from other equity method investments sorry if i missed that but what drove that this quarter joseph simon that was related to a gaaponly charge so australia has different accounting and it related to a revenue share contract that took place contemporaneous with the ipo and so that basically hit that line item rather than other income operator and our next questioner today is going to be michael needham with bank of america michael needham this is mike needham from bank of america so first is on the kenneth moelis maybe we hired somebody else michael needham thats right full disclosure the  so first just on the pipeline for ma work from what i can see it looks like the pipeline is still pretty good despite you guys putting up a few strong quarters can you help us understand just how active your bankers are now compared to the last couple of years kenneth moelis its very active i would say we feel like were  activity levels are high lets put it that way as i said i think i said it when i said we would hire in most regions quality people and thats at all levels middle level managing director our regions are active our sectors are active and we feel like its building on itself that people like the  they like what were delivering to them and were doing  were growing by the best way possible in our business and thats wordofmouth michael needham got it okay and then just one on employees and growth this year youve made  promotions you’ve hired a few maybe a couple more its a going to be a bigger year for i guess gross adds on the promotions do you set the same level of  the bar at the same level of productivity for internal promotes versus new hires and then i guess just specifically on the  fintech guys is that part of a  or fintech and industrial tech is that part of a bigger theme to hire in disruptive sectors kenneth moelis yes so ill take the second part first yes we think that its very important fintechs been a part of the world we wanted to have been in for a long time its very active and theres a lot of companies in it and then industrial tech its just we feel like the call on what used to be general industrial now requires  and people want to speak about software and technology and how it affects them so every industrial conversation requires a technology conversation and we want to make sure were leading with that so yes that is strategic on what the disruption would be on your first question i was going to ask you what it was but i remembered yes look ive been trying to fight this from the time we went public this terrible idea that theres such a metric called revenue per md that means much we would much rather promote a young managing director with a low level of firstyear revenues and a high level of growth and future and expertise in  years to  years whatever you want to say thats whats happening to our revenue base if you dont  if youre looking at our revenue base and not quite getting it it is our internal promote coming up the curve on maturity and what we dont want to do is hire what i call peak talent peak price at peak level my age im going to  i could pick on myself i guess because i cant see myself for being  but there is a moment where youre paying for peak and youre not going to get the growth so we look at it very different and yes our internal promotes are a very different decision than our external hires operator and our next questioner today is jim mitchell with buckingham research james mitchell just one question maybe on the expense side given the strong start to the year and your comments on strong momentum does that start to give you kind of wiggle room on the comp ratio or do we still think targeting  or can we see margins expand a little bit more given the strong revenue environment joseph simon yes i think that for the next couple of years given the change that we made about  years ago on divesting that were   is how you should think about comp james mitchell okay so even if revenue is  growth it will still be  joseph simon well in those  in an outlier we may take it under consideration but i think in reality kenneth moelis well what joes referring to is we have an overlap as we changed our vesting schedule so its hard to go  even applestoapples if we keep it at  you are seeing some of the benefit in the gaap number james mitchell right right because the amortization is increasing i got it okay thats all for me operator operator instructions and our next questioner is going to be betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy graseck ken i just wanted to touch base on a couple of things one was the driver of ma in the past i think youve talked about expense in a slow growth world expense management driver of ma my question is is that still the majority or is there anything else going on is there any credence to ma occurring for customer acquisition ma occurring for technology acquisition thats increasing as a percentage of total or is expense management really the biggest driver here kenneth moelis thats a good question sure theres ma for all those reasons i dont want to characterize everybody but i do think synergies and getting larger and synergizing expense is still a priority whether its a majority or just a plurality its a big reason i think you touched on technology and i do think technology is driving some of this but its more of a positioning yourself i think if you really get behind a lot of the media the tmt deals and that includes media its sort of finding your place in the distribution channel and how youre going to create content  so a lot of that i think is technologydriven not costdriven its where do i fit and do i have the right tools to go up in a world thats changing dramatically so id say the  are basic cost synergies and then a lot of it now i think is do i have the right technology am i in the right place to service my accounts i think thats driving a lot now as well trying to get ahead of the technology curve betsy graseck okay and then just secondly on the efforts that youve had underway in asia what does  the recent china kind of secession or crackdown on some of the overseas acquisitions what did that do for you and your franchises are there ways that you can be nimble to flex your business model to maybe internal within china kenneth moelis look its changed there definitely is a crackdown on capital coming out of china and the amount of deals we have a good  great team in china but its small and no you cant really change it to a china china ma its not going to stand in for the  it wont do enough i think what we do in china  look this is whats good about being a small operation with not a lot of sales and trading and all of the overhead of that well continue to call on the clients there we look at china as a generational calling effort and so if other people slow down and pull out or whatever theyre going to do well stay in there and look at it as a way to build relationships over a long period of time but its definitely been a great year in china ma china outbound ma last year and it definitely is not the same this year hard to plan on getting a deal done this year operator and our next questioner today is jeff harte with sandler oneill jeffery harte just a couple of cleanups i mean most questions have been asked when i look at the cash and liquid investments adjusted for the special dividend i mean youre still north of  million which is for a second quarter pretty historically high for you guys i guess my just kind of  questions here one that makes me look and say another special dividend this year would seem likely just because of the amount of cash sitting there but the second part of it kind of gets to the revenue outlook and how strong the first half ended up being versus what  certainly its stronger than what we were looking for on the outside are we potentially not to expect as strong a second half in revenues and maybe that kind of helps to use some of that cash as opposed to building maybe on the second half like it historically has joseph simon so i can hit your first question which is  million excess cash its  theres a  theres certainly the opportunity for a special but i dont know that its part of the  million the  million is a combination of earmarked cash for bonuses taxes as well as the minimum capital that we put to the side so i think that given our strong revenues together with  that cash ultimately reflects that strong first half and ultimately has a bonus and tax component that maybe isnt completely obvious kenneth moelis well and to say if we continue on the way were going  i think what joes saying if we have a second half he  we  joe the years not going to end on june  either so the  just the answer is yes to your question about we have to discuss it with our board but if things continue to go the way we think theyre going of course we think theres a possibility but i mean its subject to all the approvals and discussion with our board of another dividend the  and i dont think look theres been  we dont think the first half has taken anything from the second half in terms of acceleration of the revenue stream we feel like activity level is high its been high for  straight record quarters and if anything we feel like our activity level thats not a revenue prediction but our activity level if anything is higher today than its been and its  so were not trying  were  again i dont want to send any  were not talking about the second half of the year but were busy jeffery harte okay and secondly on the noncomp i mean were running at the  millionplus i mean i guess ive been thinking of noncomp as a dollar amount and maybe watching headcounts recently but a quarter like this makes me think that maybe the noncomp ratio with it being somewhat more variable of a total line item is the right way to think about it should we be looking more at the comp ratio were targeting going forward as opposed to dollar amounts maybe that makes more sense joseph simon i do ive always thought that looking at pretax margin is kind of the overall target that we have for the business and we obviously disaggregated between comp and noncomp based on just comparatives kenneth moelis yes its more of a fixed cost on the noncomp dollar price but some of that  theres some of that in there is activity level like theres more professional fees things of that nature that are  but think of it as a dollar joseph simon yes jeffery harte okay because it  so think of it more as a dollar amount as opposed to a comp  as a noncomp ratio kind of when were modeling going forward is that  im sorry is that what i  i guess im not sure if i heard the answer correctly joseph simon the way i think about it is theres an underlying run rate of what ive described before on the order of  millionplus on a quarterly basis and then there is some wobble around that based on sometimes transactionrelated stuff that could push it a little higher and thats what weve experienced in the first  quarters operator ladies and gentlemen this will conclude the questionandanswer session i
