this offering we face competition from different sources in each of our two primary activities acquiring properties and renting our properties we believe our competitors in acquiring properties are individual investors small private investment partnerships looking for oneoff acquisitions of investment properties that can either be rented or restored and sold and larger investors including private equity funds and other reits that are seeking to capitalize on the same market opportunity that we have identified our primary competitors in acquiring portfolios include large and small private equity investors public and private reits and other sizeable private institutional investors these same competitors may also compete with us for residents competition may increase the prices for properties that we would like to purchase reduce the amount of rent we may charge for our properties reduce the occupancy of our portfolio and adversely impact our ability to achieve attractive total returns however we believe that our acquisition platform our extensive inmarket property operations infrastructure and local expertise in our markets provide us with competitive advantages company description we are a leading owner and operator of singlefamily homes for lease in the united states our portfolio of nearly  high quality homes is wholly owned and is concentrated in attractive infill submarkets of major msas we have selected locations with strong demand drivers high barriers to entry and high rentgrowth potential we are highly concentrated in the western united states and florida with  of our revenues generated in those regions and  of revenues coming from california and florida alone during the three months ended september   through disciplined market and asset selection we designed our portfolio to capture the operating benefits of local density as well as economies of scale that we believe cannot be readily replicated since our founding in  we have

bedrooms and two bathrooms and an average monthly rent of  for the three months ended september   appealing to a resident base that we believe is less transitory than the typical multifamily resident we have made approximately  billion of upfront renovation investment in the homes in our portfolio representing approximately  per home in order to address capital needs reduce ongoing maintenance costs and drive resident demand as a result our portfolio benefits from high occupancy and low turnover rates and we are well positioned to drive strong rent growth attractive margins and predictable

 in our markets for the twelve months ended september   weighted by revenue contribution based on the september  case shiller index compared to growth in the broader us market of  we believe we are well positioned to achieve organic growth through a combination of rent increases driven by strong market fundamentals including demographic shifts new ancillary revenue opportunities and increasing operational efficiencies we continue to identify and implement new opportunities to drive revenue in the near and longer term by applying proven approaches of multifamily rental providers we also see
