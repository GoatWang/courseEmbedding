use instant diversification benefits and cost efficiency additionally he stresses the importance of a continued focus on education to retail investors on understanding investment risks and the inherent benefits etfs provide“when we launched the first etfs in australia there was little awareness of these funds’ benefits based on our global experience we realised the need to provide australian financial advisers with better information to help them explain the benefits of etfs to investors today the etf investor base has grown from institutional investors and financial advisers to individual investors retail investors are now realising that etfs are an easytouse transparent investment tool that gives them diversified exposure to some of the largest companies in the world through a single trade” said macnevinthe asx also recognises the importance of investor awareness as underpinning continued market growth“asx is proud to have partnered with state street global advisors in establishing the etf market in australia since the  launch the market has now grown to more than au billion due in large part to the strong education initiatives of ssga and other asx exchange traded product issuers which have increased the awareness of retail investors with  exchange traded product issuers and  products available investors and advisers alike have greater access to new market segments and asset classes than ever before they also have a better understanding of how to use etfs and other exchange traded products in their portfolios” said max cunningham general manager listings and issuer services at the australian securities exchangessga expects future growth to be driven by continued product innovation diversification and increased awareness among investors“overall investors’ portfolios have evolved and advanced since the introduction of the first etf and investors continue to seek greater insight into how etfs can be applied to achieve their
