child custody schedulea child custody schedule pertains to visitation rights and might go into great detail as a courtordered breakdown of when a child lives with and spends time with each parent it is not uncommon for child custody schedules to be broken down by the hour established months in advancewhat is primary custodyprimary custody is the classification for the parent with whom the child spends the majority of their time in unequal joint physical custody distributionswhat is joint custodythe legal definition may vary somewhat by state but joint custody generally refers to a dynamic in which both parents retain physical custody rights after a divorce this typically means the child spends time at two homes and technically has two different addressescan a child custody ruling be reversedyes but in most states and jurisdictions the “bar” for socalled abuse of discretion is high in order to overturn a custody decision the guardian in question must be proven to have violated specific terms of the agreement in a manner so egregious that the child was endangered or otherwise put at serious riskwhat are the primary factors taken into consideration during custody casesthe foremost consideration is almost always a suitable living space for the child social services might inspect a home to ensure it meets certain standards for public health in addition to providing a positive and loving environment beyond that the court will look at the custodian in question’s less tangible connections with the child particularly in thirdparty cases to ensure they are providing the best possible care work history income personal health and any official legal records will all be taken into account the opinions of the children or child also might be taken into accountcan someone other than a parent get custody of a childyes in circumstances where neither parent is alive available or otherwise fit to care for the child a relative or other legal guardian can win full custody provided they display to the court “legal standing” for a third party that entails not only a suitable living space but also sufficient connection to and involvement in the child’s lifewhat is the difference between the legal and physical custody of a childphysical custody means the child lives either full or parttime with that parent in essence a parent with legal but not physical custody rights will have visitation privileges as well as a right to be involved in decisions directly affecting the child such as where they go to schoolhow much does it cost to file for child supportchild support payments are generally dictated by the net income of the noncustodial parent but in conjunction with the earnings of the custodial parent the payment model will then determine the noncustodial parent’s obligation based on their percentage of the total earnings for example if a noncustodial parent earns about  per month out of  the court might use an economic table based on average childraising costs to determine the former’s payments to be around  per monthhow much does it cost to hire a child custody attorneydifferent attorneys and their firms will structure billing differently but if they’re charging a flat fee it usually starts at around  and can cost as much as  hourly fees range anywhere from   some firms might ask for a retainer and still others might work out alternative payment plans for families with fixed incomes it’s worth noting a lower fee does not necessarily indicate lower quality service but rather a representation of what the attorney expects the case to cost them in time and resourceswhat type of attorney handles child custody casesmost child custody lawyers specialize in that area of expertise but some might position themselves more broadly as family litigators what’s most important is for the client to seek answers to the questions pertaining directly to their case and feel comfortably with the attorney’s qualifications

of legal and tax complications by billbischoff parents set up custodial accounts for children for various reasons some legitimate and some not aunt gertrude gives  to little johnny set up a custodial account to hold the money parents want a tax shelter for little stephanie’s college savings fund set up a custodial account to invest the dough until college time single mom wants to hide some cash so she can qualify for financial aid and go back to school move the money into a child’s custodial account and take it back later you get the idea the problem many parents fail to recognize that custodial accounts have significant legal and tax implications here are the five most important things to understand  that money isn’t yours anymore irina schmidt  shutterstockcom when funds are transferred into a minor child’s custodial account at a financial institution or brokerage firm the funds now irrevocably belong to that child while the parent can and usually does function as the custodian manager of the account the money can legally be used only for expenditures that benefit that child in other words parents are legally forbidden from using custodial account money for expenditures that benefit themselves like a new car and you can’t take money from one kid’s custodial account and use it to open up or supplement an account for another kid obviously it can be a fine line between expenditures that benefit the child and those that benefit other family members and i’ve never personally heard of a parent getting into legal hot water for raiding a custodial account that said staying on the right side of the law is the right thing to do  your kid will gain control at a young age a minor child’s custodial account must be established under your state’s uniform gifts to minors act ugma or uniform transfers to minors act utma under applicable state law most states have utma regimes these days your child will gain full legal control over the account once he or she ceases to be a minor this will happen somewhere between age  and  in most states it’s  remember nice little kids can turn into obnoxious teenagers and young adults are not necessarily much better so consider the possibility of future “ugma or utma regret” before taking the irrevocable step of putting money into a child’s custodial account  your kid may have to file tax returns and pay taxes any income from your child’s custodial account belongs to the child if that income exceeds  for  a separate federal income tax return generally must be filed for the child using form  a or ez the child will probably owe some tax and the kiddie tax rules may make it higher see below a state income tax return may be required too exception if all of your child’s income consists of interest dividends and mutual fund capital gains distributions you may qualify to simply include the income on your form  and pay the resulting extra tax with your return for details on this simplifying option see irs form  parents’ election to report child’s interest and dividends at wwwirsgov  the kiddie tax could bite it would be swell if children with substantial custodial accounts were allowed to pay the same tax rates on investment income as other unmarried individuals if that was allowed to happen a child’s  ordinary income would typically be taxed at a federal rate of only  or  and a  rate would typically apply to longterm capital gains and dividends unfortunately our beloved congress created the socalled kiddie tax to prevent such happy outcomes under the kiddie tax rules a minor child’s investment income above  for  may be taxed at the parent’s higher rates so the federal rate on a child’s interest income could be as high as  and longterm gains and dividends could be taxed at up to  the kiddie tax is calculated on irs form  tax for certain children who have investment income of more than  or on the aforementioned form  when allowed bottom line in the good old days a custodial account could function as an efficient tax shelter because the income was taxed at the child’s low rates these days the kiddie tax rules make it difficult for custodial accounts to deliver meaningful tax savings  there might be gift tax consequences for  you can take advantage of the annual federal gift tax exclusion to move up to  into a custodial account for each of your children so can your spouse you can do the same thing next year and the year after that and so on gifts up to the  annual limit don’t reduce your lifetime  million federal gift tax exemption that’s good however if you transfer more than  you must file a gift tax return on irs form  united states gift and generationskipping transfer tax return you probably won’t actually owe any gift tax thanks to the  million exemption but you still have to file the form the last word custodial accounts are not as simple as advertised and there’s even more to the story than i’ve told you here for example a healthy custodial account balance can reduce college financial aid awards one good source for additional info is wwwfairmarkcomcustacct more from marketwatch cocacola to replace coke zero in us elon musk just
