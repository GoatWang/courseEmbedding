portfolio team news contact  all news at twitter working behind the scenes toward a billiondollar payday november th  via new york times prince alwaleed bin talal of saudi arabia looks like a big twitter winner so do the moneyed clients of jamie dimon but as you’vegottobejoking wealth washed over twitter on thursday — a company that didn’t exist eight years ago was worth  billion after its first day on the stock market — the nonboldface name of the moment is suhail r rizvi mr rizvi  runs a private investment company that is the largest outside investor in twitter with a  percent stake worth  billion at the end of trading on thursday using a web of connections in the tech industry and in finance as well as a hearty dose of good timing he brought many prominent names in at the ground floor including the saudi prince and some of jpmorgan’s wealthiest clients twitter’s successful opening also made gushing winners out of the usual suspects including its cofounders jack dorsey and evan williams and a spate of more traditional tech investors but mr rizvi’s rise illustrates how a new tech investor class with deep wall street connections is carving new paths into the unfamiliar and insular terrain of silicon valley traditionally stalwart venture capital firms like kleiner perkins caufield  byers and accel partners use their location in the valley and their sizable funds to buy a piece of a startup and have a hand in the company’s direction and benchmark capital and spark capital two such companies did get sizable pieces of twitter but mr rizvi and others like him have formed a network of investors including prominent mutual fund companies like fidelity t rowe price and blackrock that sometimes have even deeper pockets and a willingness to buy smaller pieces and assume no management control many startups say they value the new source of handsoff capital from these investors outside silicon valley’s palace intrigue aaref hilaly a venture capitalist at sequoia capital a top venture company in the valley said the new type of investors could offer entrepreneurs some breathing room the entrepreneurs “don’t have to have all their assets tied up in a company which is inherently risky” he said “it lets them have their cake and eat it too” still some of mr rizvi’s counterparts on sand hill road the epicenter of venture capital say the influx of new money will drive up startup valuations in what is already a crowded part of the market “we all know how this plays out” said paul kedrosky a venture capitalist and entrepreneur “there is no question that this is fueling some kind of bubble” investors taking part in this new strategy include chase coleman of the manhattan hedge fund tiger global who rolled a large preoffering stake in facebook into other hot startups and thomas laffont at coatue management another wall street hedge fund that recently set up shop on sand hill road but twitter’s public offering represents a comingout party for mr rizvi who remains largely a mystery in silicon valley despite his growing number of tech investments in silicon valley and even at twitter’s san francisco headquarters prominent investors and executives said they had not heard his name until it popped up in public disclosures by the company last month mr rizvi declined several requests for an interview but interviews with nine people who are close to mr rizvi or have worked with him on past deals all of whom would speak only if they were not named painted a picture of him as a strategic power broker who prefers to operate behind the scenes his money and connections have also led to slices of several other hot startups flipboard the social news app pinterest an online pinboard square jack dorsey’s payments service and of course twitter mr dorsey’s other company mr rizvi was born in india and raised in iowa falls iowa and although he is known as a quiet man he has built a powerful and diverse group of friends from his perch in greenwich conn those in his circle include richard branson founder of the virgin group and salar kamangar chief executive of youtube and mr rizvi has been seen partying atop eric schmidt’s yacht the oasis at cannes before finding a path to silicon valley mr rizvi invested in telecoms and manufacturing but his biggest moves were in the entertainment industry in  he asked a mutual friend to introduce him to jeff berg then chairman of international creative management the talent agency which was looking to expand a year later mr rizvi led a private equity investment in icm taking a
