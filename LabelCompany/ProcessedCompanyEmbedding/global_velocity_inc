algorithms users can also generate digital fingerprints of sensitive documents to be monitored and protected the original document remains unaltered while the resulting digital fingerprints are used by the securio to create a “virtual vault” that detects when the content or portions of the content have been moved or sent to unauthorized locations global velocity is the only company offering this powerful functionality and protection in the cloud   policy engine a critical component of any security product is the policy engine based on extensive testing and refinement on large federal government projects global velocity has enhanced its policy engine to be comprehensive yet easy to use administrators of the system can create both straightforward or sophisticated security policies based on items such as patterns dictionary keywords digital fingerprints internet traffic classification and protocols email recipients and senders file types and ip addresses incidents and notification lists can be configured to alert key personnel in real time when security events need attention the system can be setup to block notify quarantine or log individual incidents and findings     global velocitys securio platform has the following components to help clients know exactly where their sensitive digital assets reside how they’re being used and if they’re being properly protected   discover the discover component is a comprehensive informationaware solution used to scan enterprise data storage areas for data at rest inspecting it for fingerprint pattern and keyword dictionary matches depending upon a customer’s workflow needs flexible scheduling options are available to perform continuous daily weekly or monthly scans the discover functionality can be used to identify sensitive data that is located in unauthorized areas this might indicate an ineffective company policy or that an unauthorized user has infiltrated a network and is staging sensitive data for

protect the protect component is designed to defend against unauthorized data loss over the web and through email  it is designed to monitor andor block sensitive data from being sent to unauthorized users or locations the global velocity informationcentric security platform can be used to inspect all outbound internet traffic and scan content for fingerprint pattern and keyword dictionary matches user defined policies can be set up to block quarantine or log this activity all major internet protocols are supported such as http https ftp and smtp  global velocity also provides a unique protect option called “policy as a service” this option allows cloud application vendors to interactively query the policy engine with a single piece of content such as a file or body of text the policy engine will inspect the content request comparing it against the customer’s defined policies and return an appropriate status that the vendor can use to determine next steps to take within their application or process flow this unique functionality offers great flexibility for saas vendors in particular allowing them to integrate informationcentric security capabilities directly into their applications   manage the manage component is an intuitive and easy to use webbased interface for management and reporting of all securio solutions this interface is completely restful api application programming interface driven and can be replaced by a customer’s proprietary dashboard if desired this design allows cloud providers saas installations and managed service providers msps to fully utilize securios functionality and optionally have results displayed cohesively within their product’s dashboard systems whether customer proprietary or commercially available offtheshelf track a unique and optional feature of global velocity’s securio platform is the ability to track and record the genealogy and chain of custody of sensitive documents this information is used by the

protected   discover the discover component is a comprehensive informationaware solution used to scan enterprise data storage areas for data at rest inspecting it for fingerprint pattern and keyword dictionary matches depending upon a customer’s workflow needs flexible scheduling options are available to perform continuous daily weekly or monthly scans the discover functionality can be used to identify sensitive data that is located in unauthorized areas this might indicate an ineffective company policy or that an unauthorized user has infiltrated a network and is staging sensitive data for

users or locations the global velocity informationcentric security platform can be used to inspect all outbound internet traffic and scan content for fingerprint pattern and keyword dictionary matches user defined policies can be set up to block quarantine or log this activity all major internet protocols are supported such as http https ftp and smtp  global velocity also provides a unique protect option called “policy as a service” this option allows cloud application vendors to interactively query the policy engine with a single piece of content such as a file or body of text the policy engine will inspect the content request comparing it against the customer’s defined policies and return an appropriate status that the vendor can use to determine next steps to take within their application or process flow this unique functionality offers great flexibility for saas vendors in particular allowing them to integrate informationcentric security capabilities directly into their applications   manage the manage component is an intuitive and easy to use webbased interface for management and reporting of all securio solutions this interface is completely restful api application programming interface driven and can be replaced by a customer’s proprietary dashboard if desired this design allows cloud providers saas installations and managed service providers msps to fully
