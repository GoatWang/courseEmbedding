special type of business that doesn’t do anything itself  instead it owns investments such as stocks bonds mutual funds gold silver real estate art patents copyrights licenses private businesses or virtually anything of value  the term holding company comes from the fact that the business has one job to “hold” their investments history is filled with examples of amazing holding companies such as allegheny loews berkshire hathaway the marcus corporation cascade investment and walton enterprises  many modern day corporations such as general electric or bank of america are really holding companies because they own a bevy of smaller businesses eg bank of america is actually a bank holding company owning control of the stock of other private companies including the eponymous bank insurance businesses asset management companies securities underwriters and more  that is when you buy shares of bank of america on the new york stock exchange the company you are buying doesn’t do anything itself  it is merely a conduit through which it controls and owns the stock of underlying businesses   personally i like to think of holding companies as coming in two forms holding companies that serve as investment vehicles for investors holding companies that serve as risk management tools for large corporations although they have some similarities they are different  it is important you understand which you are thinking about and why both types are used how a hypothetical holding company could be formed for investors a holding company provides the ability to make investments in a wide range of assets including taking minority stakes in businesses it would be easier to just provide a fictional example to illustrate how this would work imagine you were part of a rich family that decides to invest together  you think a holding company is your best vehicle so you decide to form one  you incorporate a new business called arlington investment group llc by filing the documents with the secretary of state and paying a lawyer to draw up the operating agreement all of which costs less than a few thousand dollars and it can even be done or less than  if necessary there are  family members each of whom writes a check for  million to the new holding company’s bank account in exchange for  ownership  once everyone’s contribution is received the holding company has the simplest balance sheet in the world assets  liabilities none member equity book value  i’m going to show you how the holding company could use that  million to control  million or more without a lot of risk  this is an extreme oversimplification but the idea is to teach you how holding companies work so we can ignore the details for now holding companies allow for structural leverage opportunities first say the family decides they want to build a  million apartment building in town but they only want to invest  million of their own plus receive a management fee  the new holding company is the perfect way to achieve this  they create a new company oak lane apartments llc and contribute  million in cash and write the operating agreement so that other investors can buy  million in ownership  and the bank can provide  million in debt financing through a secured nonrecourse mortgage  the operating agreement requires that  of rents be paid to a business called arlington property management llc which is another new subsidiary the holding company formed mainbodyad in effect the family is using only  of its assets or  million to control a  million apartment building  they are receiving  ownership in the building plus  of rents giving them a form of “synthetic equity”  but if they wrote it correctly they would only have  million at risk  they have achieved  leverage with a relatively small amount of debt it is the structure that did it for them then they could start making investments in other companies taking minority stakes in businesses buying stocks launching new companies etc  they could even create a mutual fund adviser and manage hundreds of millions of dollars on a tiny investment earning fees on that giant pool of capital the result is the family is now controlling more than half a billion in assets with very little risk to itself on only  million assets in a holding company can be put in “silos” just as important if one of the investment fails the others are isolated say the arlington property management llc business had an employee embezzle all the money and it went bankrupt  the parent holding company could put it into receivership create a new property management group the next day and the only loss would be the  they put into the business to get it off the ground  their investment in the chocolate candies company the mutual fund adviser and the apartment building itself were beyond reach money managers often refer to this as putting assets in selfcontained “silos” because if one is destroyed it burns to the ground in the middle of a field without taking down anything else of value consider dunkin donuts  it is actually a holding company  all of the intellectual property such as the dunkin donuts name logos etc are owned by a subsidiary known as dd ip holder llc  take a look at the side of one of the cups … get it  it stands for dunkin donuts intellectual property limited liability company this subsidiary will license the brand name assets to the franchisees or company owned locations  they may hold the real estate in another subsidiary which rents the storefronts to the business  they may have the equipment owned by another company that leases it to the business  then they may have the actual operating company that sells the donuts called “ main street donuts llc” but it is paying fees to the other subsidiaries to rent the dunkin’ donuts name rent the real estate rent the equipment … you get the idea mainbodyad the result is if someone walks in falls sues the company and bankrupts it only that location that operated is going down  within  seconds a dunkin donuts could open a new restaurant at that same location called “ main street donuts version ii llc” with the sister subsidiaries leasing all of the assets right back to it  the person who sued may walk away with little or nothing to put it another way if you were going to own a manufacturing business you might consider creating a parent holding company structure like this acme factory holding company llc acme ip holder llc brand names trademarks etc acme real estate llc the building and real estate acme equipment llc the equipment acme human services llc the employees acme manufacturing llc the operating company all of the subsidiaries would be owned by the holding company but acme manufacturing llc would be the business in the traditional sense  it just that it would pay a fee to lease employees from the human service subsidiary equipment from the equipment subsidiary the building from the real estate subsidiary and the brand name from the ip holder subsidiary  if an employee sued the company only the human services business would be at risk a lot of multinational mega corporations use this structure and then have the ip holders located in very low tax rate countries because the income paid to it by the operating companies which may be in high tax rate areas will be charged a lower rate  bloomberg ran a story today about how google had gotten its tax rate down to  or  in some jurisdictions by using companies in the cayman islands and ireland  imagine that dunkin donuts charged each location  per year to use the name shoving all of that income in the dd ip holder llc subsidiary which may be in the isle of man  this is why the big accounting firms can be so lucrative  people who do this stuff and know the tax code spend their whole lives studying likewise british american tobacco has an entire page of its massive major subsidiaries  it would be almost impossible for someone to bankrupt it unless they went after the parent holding company  you couldn’t just sue the local cigarette factory  it’s like a lawyer’s dream  keep in mind each of these main subsidiaries may have dozens of subsidiaries of their own now to be perfectly clear the rules are so incredibly complex that this is just a theoretical incredibly simplified broad overview example of how something like this would work  it probably wouldn’t be worth the effort to setup a structure that complicated unless your business were generating massive annual profits  in most cases a guy running a little bakery in a small town is going to be covered by his insurance policy  to him the odds are good that a holding company would be an expensive mind numbingly painful paperwork nightmare transferring and pooling assets through a holding company another big advantage of a holding company is that it allows families to pool their assets or transfer wealth in a far more efficient way  imagine trying to give shares of each of the above businesses to dozens of grandchildren  it would be a logistical nightmare  with a conglomerate structure you could just issue shares of the holding company to your grand kids and they would indirectly own part of everything  they would only have to deal with one tax filing one stock and one shareholder meeting  plus you could write the holding company operating agreement so that you retained  voting control holding company taxation it is extremely important that you use the best most respected and most qualified accountants attorneys and advisers because the rules surrounding investments can be complex when using a holding company  in the case of taxes there is a special holding company tax that is only applied to regular ccorporations in the united states that have  or more of the stock held by five or fewer investors  it is a doubledigit surcharge tax that could be devastating to your profits a holding company is a type of investment company that owns other assets and investments  a holding company itself doesn’t do anything  it owns things  image  comstockthinkstock that is the reason so many families seem to be opting for holding companies structured as limited liability companies also known as an llc or limited partnerships also known as an lp  by employing these legal entities you can elect passthrough taxation just like an oldfashion partnership so that no holding company tax should apply  each partner reports his or her share of the prorata gains and losses after receiving a schedule kand pays tax on his or her personal filing with the irs for regular ccorporation holding companies it becomes highly advantageous to acquire at least  of the stock of another ccorporation because the double taxation of dividends doesn’t apply on distributions made from the subsidiary to the parent company  that is that is if your holding company owns  of the stock in another business and that other business pays dividends at christmas your holding company would owe regular corporate tax on those dividends  however if your holding company owned  of the other business it should not have to pay corporate tax on the dividends it received from that other business it was already taxed once at the subsidiary level the reason tycoons and investors prefer holding companies in addition to all of the above reasons a holding company is often the preferred vehicle of a true investor because it allows you to open an office and have that office devoted to nothing but finding places to put your money to work once you have the capital all you need is a good fireplace some nice paintings a cup of coffee and a stack of annual reports or if you’re walter schloss a desk next to a water cooler in a space the size of a closet you show up each day try to do intelligent things avoid stupidity and keep costs low  as i’ve said a million times compounding will do the rest  you can pay yourself a salary and watch your net worth through the holding company’s book value grow higher each year if you run it well mainbodyad holding companies are as diverse as their owners  some specialize in hotels and other real estate some own restaurants some build coffee shops some invest only in publicly traded stocks others focus on making investments in hightech startups some fund movie projects while still others acquire silver mines or mineral rights the point is a holding company is worth too much effort and doesn’t provide enough benefits for most small investors  you should never add an extra layer of management unless it is necessary  there are some expenses involved such as preparing another set of tax returns that must be taken into account  if those are even a rounding error you probably should wait until it is going to be worth the expenditure  you should never want a holding company simply for the sake of owning one  they have very specific purposes  an exception might be a family who has a few hundred thousand dollars and wants to invest together through a single entity summary of a holding company a holding company is any regular corporation llc or lp that owns investments in other companies but doesn’t engage in any operations itself that is berkshire hathaway is a holding company because it doesn’t do anything  instead it owns  of the stock of geico which is an insurance company  it owns  or  of the stock of nebraska furniture mart which is a huge furniture retailer  it owns more than  of the stock of cocacola through its insurance holdings  but berkshire itself just has a handful of employees and a bank vault full of stock certificates  that is it  any money it has comes from dividends paid by the subsidiaries on june th and december st of each year can be used to silo investment assets and protect them such as dunkin’ donuts putting its intellectual property into its own llc can be used to transfer wealth to friends and family if you own a collection of businesses rental properties or other valuables it is far more convenient to transfer shares in a parent company than it is in each individual asset can permit you to structure deals so you control far more money than you otherwise could afford if you had  million and used it to buy control of a  million insurance group that had  million in float you would be controlling  million from your holding company in essence a holding company is in the business of providing capital and people  that is it  some don’t even do that berkshire hathaway refuses to provide management to the subsidiaries it purchases they don’t run businesses  general electric on the other hand is one of the greatest machines of all time and can have someone else running a company within  hours i hope that helps you understand the concept and why they are so useful   category business strategy investing articlesby joshua kennonoctober   commentsshare this postshare with facebookshare with

company llc and this wonderful amazing article just inspired me to go for it thanks for the information and encouragement if the big guys can do then so can i the walton article is so inspiring also  love it ps i bookmarked this page mr kennon joshua kennon thank you  welcome to the site sean leder do you have a clean copy of the arlington investment group org chart that you could send out…had trouble reading the notes…thx joshua kennon click on the image in the article load the big picture once the new page has loaded if your browser shrunk it to fit click again to see it in the original size the image is huge  massive  you will be able to see every dot httpdklfnjoloacloudfrontnetwpcontentuploadssampleholdingcompanypng kpra good article one question i am thinking of using a holding company to take a more strategic view of my business investments and also limit risk exposure in this case do you think it is worth having a dedicated holding subsidiary that employs staff to oversee the holding company eg arlington  holding management llc or something so that the holding company never has employees which obviously come with risk gilvus it depends on how much extra overhead you’re capable and willing to take i’ve also been looking into this and it seems that in order to qualify as a personal holding company the company’s gross income for any tax year must be  passive income dividends rents royalties etc search for “ usc sec ” naturally i’m eager to hear joshua’s input on this wil ‘chilli’ schock   not that i am an expert on this issue but think about it for a second the way of corporate business in the us today is saturated with hiring employees who are not employees they are across the board seeming to for force employees into becoming contractors in order to get the job then when they want to fire them they just do and then they don’t worry about paying unemployment benefits or being sued for discrimination giving them proper severances etc the insulation afforded the corporation from this is significant so if you were to have a kpra staffing llc subsidiary of the kpra holding llc company that supplied staff to manage that parent company you may even want to make them contractors it gets complicated but clearly adding layers to the equation is all more doorways that someone ultimately would have to unlock to get back to the real cash itself that is what anyone is looking to protect and of course forming the holding company somewhere like wyoming and not having your name associated with it in any public record adds that much additional insulation depending on the level of investment we are talking about it may even be worth it to form the holding company in seychelles or another foreign country with laws that make law suits almost impossible to launch so your money may be in a seychelle’s bank or it may be owned by your seychelles llc but is actually held inside  different banks in the us none of which are identifiable to anyone anywhere without paying massive court fees in advance to launch the suit all blind and guessing at who the rightful owners of the llc even were again all levels of insulation do we need that many levels for a lawful business well i have lost a lot of money not having a holding company to insulate my operating liabilities so i am open to all ideas of insulation now    jojo florendo good idea knowledge seed if you are not an accredited or sophisicated investor is it against the law for you tostart a holding company that invests in privatelyheld businesses joshua kennon the accredited or sophisticated investor rules deal with certain types of securities issuance if you are raising money eg issuing shares of stock or bonds to investors in exchange for cash or goods i guess theoretically you could start a holding company with nothing but  and buy a couple shares of stock but i don’t much see the point in that case a simple brokerage account would have been more effective or if you own a family business keeping the family operating entities separately owned until the economies of scale and organization benefits of bringing them under the same roof justified it knowledge seed i have a several family members siblings and cousins that own a variety of businesses that as i accumulate substantial savings i would like to invest in i was under the impression that because i don’t meet the requirements to be an accredited or sophisticated investor i can’t invest in those companies the holding company was just a way to skip those requirements  – if possible but you’re saying whether i meet those requirements or not i can invest in those companies without a holding company right joshua kennon no that is different  you asked if you can start a holding company  sure anyone can  but neither you personally nor your holding company could invest in a private offering eg private stocks or bonds if the business issuing them only allows accredited or sophisticated investors because it is relying on something like regulation d as a safe harbor  you can’t get around the requirements if that’s what you’re trying to do   technically there are a few ways a nonaccredited or sophisticated investor can buy shares of a privately held business such as regulation d rule  which allows up to  nonaccredited investors in an offering of private securities reference httpwwwsecgovanswersrulehtm but a lot of smart people won’t even take advantage of that  there is too much liability exposure if you start letting in a lot of nonaccredited investors  a few years ago i point blank had a securities lawyer tell me that even if i loved the family member with all of my heart it would be patently stupid to allow anyone who didn’t meet the accredited status into a business i was considering launching even if they wanted to buy several hundred thousand dollars worth of shares  i listened to him and scrapped the idea of allowing them in until i could come up with a better solution  no one wants to hear “sorry but you aren’t worth the liability exposure” but that is what it comes down to in the end i’m not a lawyer so take this with a grain of salt but it’s just not worth the trouble for the business owner to admit anyone family or friend who isn’t accredited  no matter how hard you try it sounds like your family members are going to find a reason not to let you invest and frankly they should  they are being wise given the current state of regulation in the country  you may not want to hear that but the gist is move on and find somewhere else to put your money  it isn’t worth the trouble and it sounds like your family is trying to be polite because they don’t want to use one of the regulation d rules to make an exception for you  they are being rational msmbjohnson this is a great article very informative and very useful thanks for sharing  obert  wowi have been going through all the details here and find them interestingbutcan you guys advise me say one registers a holdings company without even huge amounts of monies as some statements suggestdo you guys think its wise to start a holdings company with a notion of raising funds for it through loans from the banks and then open subsidery companies to operate the businesses and pay the dues to it as should the case bedo you think its a wise idea tyson so i’ve got a question for you that i hope you can shed some light on in regards to possible conflict of interests etc example fact arlington family runs and owns a construction company structured as a sole proprietor fact in addition to running the construction company they also own several pieces of property that they lease problem assessment they are currently researching changing the company over to an llc for increased liability protection for all their assets and seeking future expansion into other ventures if they create a holding “arlington enterprise llc” then create operating “arlington construction llc” and operating “arlington real estate” can they actively manage either of the operating llc’s ie father arlington being the primary manager bidder operator etc of “arlington construction” but all other assets remaining in the holding llc the question arises for me is does this cause a conflict of interest and negate the purpose of the holding  operating llc setup if father arlington is also part of the holding llc my hours of research can’t seem to address this situation any ideas or help location for hypothetical is california thanks for the article and website joshua kennon there is no clear cut answer the concern is whether or not “father arlington” in your question treats the company as a de facto extension of himself that is whether or not he “pierces the corporate veil” that “piercing the corporate veil” is what you are asking me about whether you realize it or not research that phrase and you will learn everything you want to know about your question there is no clear line it is a judgement call when litigation arises the safest way would be to avoid it entirely but that isn’t always practical or desirable if a concern arose in that department i would unquestionably be speaking to attorneys in the respective states rather than trying to figure it out for myself tyson thank you mr kennon for getting back to me its pretty much as you said there isn’t an exact guideline or ruling to follow in this situation the best answer i’ve been able to find for limiting pcv follows this abide by the rules of an llc submit all required documents quarterly statements etc follow the operating agreement do not comingle personal  business assets ie good accounting practices etc limit possibility of “alterego” accusations however like you said there isn’t a clear cut response for it and if this were to be happening bring in an attorneys thanks again for your feedback this was a good exercise in future planning for me phiston thanks for sharing this great article mr kennon i was wondering if you can address obert’s question from  months ago about starting a holding company through bank loans thanks in advance tayler hi i really appreciate the information in this article–very helpful many articles discuss how to start a holding company however rarely do i see articles that discuss how to manage a holding company such as the daily operations could you share some light on that please thanks so much danesh narayanan higreat articlethanks for the infoi have an excellent investment opportunity to invest in agricultural land iam planning to invest my own funds and also use funding from a couple of my friends is it advisable for me to say start a holding company in an offshore country pool in the funds then start a locally registered company in the country where we plan to invest and the holding company buys the shares of this companyam i getting your point rightwould appreciate your advisetks dan andrew knight wow amazing site amazing article amazing everything this is the best read regarding this topic i have ever read now i have a question i read the article and i understand you pointed out not to start a holding company just because you want to or unless you have a lot of funds to manage but what about starting one for security of assets and planning for the future i’m not a big wig or in any of those categories but i’ve always been fascinated about holding companies and how they can be used to owninvest in other assets companies stocks etc…but never really understood at what additional cost to me i guess but it’s something i’ve wanted to do for the long haul thinking ahead for the future just trying to put things in place i know most of the big guys do it so i guess my question is is it just for the big guys is this something to do as planning for the future going on the assumption that i’ll have successful investments and ventures pee jay i am extremely glad to have come across this well laid out article i shall be forever grateful to you joshua keep up the good work dyan great job tremayne i had to take a second to tell you how useful this article was i google alot of articles on this subject matter and you were the only article that explained that a  year old could understand which is my capacity for financeslol james smith never invest in any idea you can’t illustrate with a crayon peter lynch too many parts to be able to put something like this together i could see me making the lawyer and accountant rich and me being broke because i cant figure out who gets what on to a new plan wayne inorder to attract investors to new business opportunity if we formed a group of construction planning designing company general builder heating and air electrical etc would this new formed cooperation of individual companies become a partners in a holding company or is there a different entity formed by cooperations if the group decided to build a medical building and wanted to invest into the a medical building to sale or rent would a holding company be a proper entity to offer stocks to outside investors fab formed a ccorp and i have a real estate llc i am partnering on a restaurant deal and will be creating another llc to operate it the ccorp was set up to “own” both llc’s and large amounts of income from coming onto my personal tax return my question is how do i make

academic books were that simple thank you prashant wow that was incredibly useful thanks ronald ragan after hours of researchi might be wrong in order to avoid personal holding company tax c corp is to have  or more share holders with equal shares so no  share holders or less will have more than  interest of the company also have not found any information regarding multiple c corporation to lower tax bracket so for  people they can form multiple whyoming c corp and pay  fed tax and reinvest their profit foreverthe tax bracket will be raised in future time when profit increased which would be another research the purpose of this is to grow dividend investment with minimun fed tax and zero state tax for controlling purpose one can have a master llc lending  to them and deferarrange interest payment please correct my rookie plan marilyn this was very interesting i am wondering if this is the correct business structure to setup i have come up with a name which is the brand name for business  different business that wants to be under the umbrella brand but will still have their own name its the link to bring all the businesses together however the business underneath would be owned and operated by those individuals the types of business are just services ie health fitnesslife coach etc people providing services not product but we all want to come together under a brand potentially we see bringing other businesses underneath so we have a network of trusted business to offer clients however the brand would not money from the original service providers but if we allowed others to come under the brand then it would have incomewhat kind business structure would you recommend i was thinking its a franchise but looking at that seems really expensive when really this is just a company name that brings everyone together to provided different services any help or suggested on where to research would be great mscott very helpful josh i learned a lot from this

to list you as a member and sends you monthly checks for about  what legal recourse would you have to protect your identity and stop the llc fraud this has actually happening at this time jb great article thanks for making it understandable to the layperson mohamedalthaf very well explained easy to undesratand thank you hb can my holding company own  equity in xxxxx inc which i am also the

information for those who are thiking to start hc geraldine okay my question leads elsewhere if you think you have been bilked how do you recover your  from a holding company ronald ragan was trying

thanks for this article i’ve learned a lot abk llc thanks i found that very educational benjaminbutler thanks a bunch this article has really helped a lot i actually read it all the way through too sameer musa thanks i have just read your article and to me it deserve not just one time review i hope you would do more of its kind in the future sahar hi joshua thanks for this introduction to holding companies i found it very useful are there currently any books you recommend in the area of setting up a holding company denise treusch i have a very confusing question my father had his house which was paid off listed as a llc holding co he passed away leaving the holding co to the  children as members the  children decided to sell the house my question is… do we have to pay capital gains taxes on the income or is the house considered an inheritance and not taxable sean foley depends on the papers by which the llc is formed it can run as a c or s corporation or partnership spartnership do pass through to the owners c would completely shield you it wouldn’t be considered and inheritance because the property is owned by an entity that cannot die the llc… llcs can behave weirdly if the operating documents specify them too it’s important to study them in detail donna i own shares in an unlisted company and have just received an offer from a private equity holding company to indulge in share swop i have no idea what to do as does anybody know if i have a better chance of selling my shares if i take part in this  jim mino joshua… this information is great in your opinion should you start a separate holding company for assets and for ip or can one holding company have both danny question let’s say i want to start a company that i will fund from day trading and other investment activities and then use the funds in the holding company to purchase other businesses and real and real estate how would you structure the holding company legally llc or corporation what i am trying to do is have a place where i initially fund with profits from day and swing trading until i’ve accumulated a certain amount of capital and then incorprate another entity where the funds will be transferred to from the main holding company to purchase the an initial investment that generates cash flow and do that all over again and the funds from the investment will stay with that specific new entity and accumulate while transferring additional funds from trading to purchase more cash flow generating investments that initial new entity will be separate from the main holding company and i want to do that for several different types of investments real estate softwarehardware business acquisition terrance a collins jr it depends… review the laws and codes in the area in which you wish to form your entity and see what it entails corporations pay tax on the corporation and then the individuals pay tax on the income they receive thus “double taxation” llc’s are disregarded entities and are not taxed at the business level so the owners “members” are taxed on the business a whole on their personal taxes some juristictions allow the minimum number of corporate board members and officers to match the number of shareholders of the entitiy you could be a  person private corporation however as mention in joshua’s wonderfully worded articles… you may become subject to additional taxation meaning you risk potential triple taxation at the federal level not counting state or local taxations as well however if you plan to level money in the entity to grow you aren’t paying taxes personally on income you aren’t receiving in llc’s even if you take  out of the entity you are still taxed on the entire profitloss of the entity but you are only taxed once personal taxation on corporate dividends are lessor than personal taxes from llc distributions at the highest tier there is no perfect right or wrong answer for this bill gates has the cascade llc warren buffet had berkshirehathaway inc both deal in the billions of dollars in business cocacola and ge are incorporated and have hundreds of subsidiaries each even though cocacola has holding companies as large percentage shareholders both bill gates and his private cascade llc have shares in microsoft cocacola  berkshirehathaway which has shares in cocacola technically bill sees  lines of income from cocacola plus the income he receives being a board member of berkshire and his salary as ceo of the llc both of which are partially afforded by dividends from cocacola warren meanwhile does everything from the confines of berkshirehathaway and has almost zero corporate staff these two gentlemen are the  most influential figures of the evolution of american economics over the past two decades warren and bill best friends and business partners and one does his holdings from an llc and the other a publically traded corporation remember i am not a attorney or a cpa this comment is not meant to be taken as legal investment or financial advice to get your questions answered and before making a determination for yourself it’s always highly recommended you speak to a licensed attorney with the authority to practice under the jurisdiction of the formation of your business entity and a cpa lennox very informative thank you andre hey how do i actually go about building something like this say i have   million can i used  and buy a  m mutual fund and used the rest for real estate investments and franchises m can a trust fund own a holding company terrance a collins jr yes remember i am not a attorney or a cpa this comment is not meant to be taken as legal investment or financial advice to get your questions answered and before making a determination for yourself it’s always highly recommended you speak to a licensed attorney with the authority to practice under the jurisdiction of the formation of your business entity and a cpa john very helpful thanks josh michael christopher shimkin very well done especially with the use of examples i also particularly enjoyed your humor amos thank you nate di cenzo i’m still trying to get my head around an effective model using holding companys so if holding company a owns  of two subsidiaries also acting as holding companies b  c which both have their individual subsidiaries how would i move funds from subsidiary b to subsidiary c subsidiary b will be the revenue driver to create the startup capital holding company a infuses into other startup ventures i’m trying to figure out a way to move b’s capital throughout the network without extreme tax ramifications terrance a collins jr this is simple if they are llc’s llc’s are pass through entities and aren’t taxed at the company level you personally and your other membersowners of the holding llc are responsible for taxes on the entire structure of your operations therefore you can transfer the money to company a from company b and transfer the money back down to company c… just make sure your book keeping is on point and accurate because the more transfers you make the more complicated it becomes if you transfer directly from b to c then in the event of a lawsuit you lose liability protection for company a b  c and all of the assets they own are subject to the suit it makes it easy to then say that your operation is not really several companies but  company company a doing business as a whole and can thus be sued as one such company the exception would be loans from company b to company c if it’s a corporation you can file a consolidated tax return in which your company a is responsible for the taxes of the entire group like example above for llc’s this means you aren’t taxed for distributions  dividends between the companies just the overall profitloss for the group but itemizing the group on reporting means you’re going to need a team to handle reporting and tax prep and filing still you’ll want transfer the money upstream then back down stream in both of these structures losses from one company can offset the profits of another so there is no real need to transfer money from company b to company c as the holding company is responsible for the group’s taxes the capital accounts and contributions from parent company to subsidiary and the dispersments to the parent company from the subsidiary need to be kept up to date in very pristine manner in order to do this the corporation must own at least  of the vote and percentage interest in the subsidiaries in the llc model the llc is only responsible for their ownership interest in the subsidiary for tax purposes so if the ownership percentage varies between subsidiary to subsidiary the potential for a book keeping nightmare exists and the ability to properly report or defend an audit decreases the real risk is book keeping and accounting and as mentioned in the article… the cost of the required services to keep the engine running smoothly and recorded properly can become very pricey and time consuming i hope this helps remember i am not a attorney or a cpa this comment is not meant to be taken as legal investment or financial advice to get your questions answered and before making a determination for yourself it’s always highly recommended you speak to a licensed attorney with the authority to practice under the jurisdiction of the formation of your business entity and a cpa the lawyer will help you protect your assets and the cpa will focus on how to preserve the maximum amount of your capital therefore to get the answers you are looking for in depth with applicable information you should consult with both duc de richleau speaking as a trader let’s assume with the werewithall to do this would there be an incentive to become a holding company allowing others to invest in my project that is i would not be part of some familly group like you used in your example but pretty much the boss of what i am doing investing my own initial cash what legal pitfalls would i face nick in order to transfer money tax free from the operating company to the holding company a does the holding company have to be a c corp or an llc electing to file as a c or b can it be an llc not electing to file as a c in essence i would like to have the operating company a c corp and the holding company as an llc not electing to file as a c owning  of the operating company thanks for this awesome post making me think mohammad ali i have come cross some information that classified holding companies into three models operational management strategic management financial management but i did not understand how this is related to your holding companies that you presented in this article i look forward to your clarification about this classification mary flowers very informative i appreciate you annabanana very helpful thanks 🙂 ryan if i wanted to start an llc to only hold stock in other companies with the purpose of giving it to my son to take over down the road what are the proscons of this red elle your question is too vague and broad for example if i want to retain income and reinvest income of a holding ccorp llc of pure stocks i need to find  equal share share holdersincluding me with absolutely no family ties to avoid holding company tax the solution turns out to be just buy spy or brk to solve this problem ryan is there still a holding company tax if its considered an scorp this holding corp would other assets besides stocks instead of setting up trusts for kids i could add them as members to my llc down the road when they become middle aged red elle there would be no “holding company tax” other than ccorpccorp llc you need to focus on giftestate taxfedstatelocal you also need to consider “families by law” problems sometimes it would be better to create debt for “families by law” problems it would be uncomfortable to see “were families by law” you hate sitting at the board meeting of your llc ryan thank you for your replies consider that i would also be holding other assets under the llc this would be ok red elle can not comment on your situation i would try an example let’s say i setup  wyoming llcs each of them own a piece of beach front calif re  years later the buyers can choose to buy llc with extreme low re tax or buy re with extreme high re tax this works perfect if trump get rid of tax deduction raymond tyson hi looking for a debt consolidation loan unsecured loanbusiness loan mortgage loan car loan and so on i am a

key issues in selecting formation state filed under running a business fact checked on may   limiting liability in your business structure involves choosing the best an organizational form however selecting the state in which to form the business is also a significant consideration choice of state issues location incorporate establish entity organizational form home state foreign registration asset protection planning strategy debtor preserve wealth saving limit liability risk small business owner many small business owners choose to operate their business as either a corporation or a limited liability company in order to limit their personal liability for business debts an additional factor to consider is which state is the best one in which to form that business entity  you can form a corporation or limited liability company llc in any state even in a state in which you conducts no business activities further even when an outofstate entity is created there is no requirement that any assets be located in that state regardless of state you choose you must file articles of organization with the appropriate agency for that state as part of this process you must designate a registered agent within that state that will accept service of process ie for purposes of consenting to the states jurisdiction this formation paper work is usually filed with secretary of states office a fee is required at the time of the filing warning failure to file means the entity does not exist and the owner is operating a sole proprietorship or a general partnership this can spell disaster if your business experiences financial difficulties or if you experience personal financial issues because all of your assets are at risk in addition if your company does does business outside of the state of formation or incorporation you must properly register in all the states in which you do business this process is referred to as foreign qualification this may sound daunting but in nearly all cases it simply requires filing out a very simple form and paying a fee to the secretary of state thus you have two options form the entity in your home state or form the business in another state there are advantages and disadvantages to either option and among the considerations are complexity of administration fees and costs from an asset protection standpoint youll want to consider the benefits of forming and registering in a state known as friendly to business ownership any additional expenditure of time and money may be inexpensive compared to the unique protections some states offer advantages entity formation in your home state when choosing the state in which to form your business entity the simplest option for the small business owner is to form the entity in his or her home state where typically all of the business activities will be conducted forming an entity outofstate will create additional costs the outofstate entity will have to register to do business in your home state thus you must pay two sets of fees to form the entity outofstate but only one fee if the entity were formed in the owners home state if you are going to do business in other states you may need to registration in those states in any event however from an asset protection perspective these extra fees may be worth the cost some states laws are considered more businessfriendly than others and may afford you more protections for your business and assets in this way the extra costs are like paying for extra liability protection registration required in each state with substantial business activity you must register your business entity as a foreign entity in each other state in which you do substantial business the activities of a holding entity usually do not rise to the level of doing business in a state thus normally an outofstate holding entity would not have to register in either the owners home state or where the operating entity conducts the businesss operations failure to register in this regard should be distinguished from failure to file articles of organization the consequences of a failure to register as a foreign entity in a state vary from state to state for example the entity may be barred from pursuing legal or equitable relief in state courts  on the other hand failure to register will not prevent others from bringing legal actions against the corporation some states impose civil penalties for failure to register and some states simply provide that the entity must pay the registration fee that was due however a few states might provide for far more insidious results by not recognizing the entity which would result in unlimited personal liability for the businesss debts incurred in that state or invalidation of the businesss contracts when in doubt registeror consult an attorney for advice work smart note that the entitywithinanentity concept which is embodied in the delaware limited liability company llc statute eliminates this problem a single llc can house multiple separate legal entities this single llc is formed in delaware and then registers in any state in which the operating entities will do business holding entities need register only in formation state holding entities need to register only in the formation state if two entities are being formed ie a holding entity and an operating entity there will be no additional costs involved in forming an entity outofstate the holding entity could be formed outofstate and the operating entity in the owners home state because the holding entity will conduct no business activities in the home state it neednt be registered in the home state specifically the activities of the outofstate holding entity should not rise to the level of doing business in the home state thus the cost of forming two entities with one formed outofstate will be the same as forming both entities in the owners home state factors to consider when selecting formation some of the factors to evaluate when selecting a state of formation are fees involved protection of business assets against personal creditors fullshield liability protection management flexibility and simplicity statutory close corporation option asset protection trusts tax incentives and exemption from securities registration state fees are only one factor to consider when choosing a state in which to form your business the simplest or cheapest choice may not be the best choice another states lower formation fee should not be the deciding factor in forming the entity there when the owner will be doing business in his own home state as well clearly the small business owner cannot avoid his home states fee by forming an outofstate entity because a registration fee equivalent to a formation fee must be paid to the owners home state anyway if the owner will be doing business there  however if you are doing business in another state but not in your home state and you intend to use only one entity you should consider forming the entity in the state in which you will be doing business rather than your home state this will result in only one fee example john is a massachusetts resident who plans on doing business exclusively in connecticut if he decides to form a corporation in massachusetts his home state he will pay a formation fee of  to the state of massachusetts and a foreign registration fee of  to the state of connecticut johns best choice may be to form a corporation in connecticut and pay only the connecticut formation fee of  if your company conducts business across state lines or outside your state of formation you may need to go through the process of foreign qualification including the selection of a registered agent at this point state fees sometimes become a consideration state fees to form an llc are often lower than the fees charged to form a corporation however this is not always the case particularly as states look for new forms of revenue for example in nevada one of the key states for business formation the fees charged by the state are the same for the formation of a corporation and an llc  and some states charge significantly higher fees for forming and renewing an llc than for a corporation if you live in one of the states that charge higher fees for forming and renewing an llc than a corporation you may want to consider forming a corporation rather than an llc at least where fees are an important deciding factor however the fee savings may be misleading in general a corporation will end up costing you more money because it may be subject to state corporate income tax as well as annual assessments franchise tax based on the number of authorized shares and annual reporting fees the small business owner intending on forming a corporation should usually form it as a statutory close corporation however this form is not legally recognized in some other states that charge high llc fees so the fee for forming the statutory close corporation out of state plus the fee for registering the corporation in the home state or wherever it will be doing business will probably be equivalent to the fee charged by the home state for an llc there some states impose publication fees while the small business owner should consider that other factors may in fact be more important than the relative fees charged nevertheless special note should be made of publication fees that may be required of corporations and llc in several states llcs new york nebraska and arizona require that an llc publish the information from its articles of organization in a newspaper for example in new york this information must be published once per week for a total of six weeks in two different newspapers this can cost anywhere from  to  and this may make the llc a costprohibitive option in these states similarly any outofstate llc that will be doing business in one of these states must satisfy the same publication requirements with information from its registration this cost can be expected to be in the same range as described above corporations note that four states arizona georgia nebraska and pennsylvania require that corporations publish the information in the articles of incorporation thus the publication fees are not a factor in arizona and nebraska creditors rights are factors when choosing a formation state for your business entity simplicity and immediate outofpocket costs for state fees should not always be the main considerations the internal affairs voting management etc and the liability of the owners for a limited liability company llc or corporation are governed by the state where the business is formed and not the state where it does business the laws in each state are not all the same  some states offer significantly greater asset protection and other benefits as well in fact some states such as delaware and nevada have a reputation for developing a body of law and a court system favorable to the business owner as a result you should give careful considerationand seek input from a professionalto forming your business entity in one of these states this is especially true if your home state is deficient from an asset protection perspective warning a business entitys internal matters voting management etc and liability status will be governed by the state in which it is formed however nothing requires a state to recognize a type of entity that cannot be legally formed there california prevents professionals from operating in the llc form california also limits its limited liability partnerships llps to a narrow class of professionals namely lawyers architects and accountants new york also limits llps to professionals but defines this term more broadly than california thus in the case of professionals who form an llc or an llp and plan on doing business in california or new york caution must be exercised  if the entity could not be formed in those states it also will not be recognized if it is formed in another state and then seeks to register to do business in those states the end result could be that the business will be recognized only as a sole proprietorship or general partnership with very limited asset protection available evaluate state law protection for business interests against personal creditors some states do not offer adequate protection for the owners business interest in a limited liability company llc against the claims of the owners personal creditors these states model their llc statutes charging order remedy on the general partnership provision that allows for foreclosure of the interest and forced liquidation of the business many states including delaware and nevada offer protection for the business interest these states model their llc statutes on the charging order concept found in the revised uniform limited partnership act rulpa if the business owners home state does not offer this business interest protection serious consideration should be given to forming an llc in a state that does offer such protection fullshield limited liability protection is ideal some states offer only a limited shield ie a strippeddown version of limited liability for the owners of limited liability partnerships llps in particular the limited shield means that the owners of an llp will have limited liability only with respect to the actions of their coowners the owners will still have unlimited personal liability in all other cases if the home state only offers this limitedshield version and an llp is the type of entity that will be formed consideration should be given to forming the llp in a state that offers this fullshield protection delaware and nevada are two states that offer this protection evaluate management flexibility permitted some states create mandatory voting rights for all members of a limited liability company llc on certain issues even when the llc is managed not by all the members but by a small group of members who are termed the managers this can cause confusion and can make certain votes illegal it also can interfere with an estate planning strategythe use of the family limited liability company where children are given nonvoting interests llc statutes in some states make it clear that the operating agreement can provide that members have no voting rights at all or limit voting rights to only certain matters delaware is one of those states when the law in the home state accords all members certain mandatory voting rights consideration should be given to forming the llc in delaware or in some other state that allows the owner to completely eliminate voting rights for selected members in addition the delaware llc statute may offer greater protection in the event one of the llc members declares bankruptcy consider states that allow series llcs delaware law permits series llcs moreover the delaware llc statute provides incredible flexibility and simplicity in forming and operating the llc it has no counterpart in statutes governing corporations nor even in llc statutes found in other states for instance it allows the forming of an entity within an entity thus eliminating the need to form separate llcs or corporations for each separate operating activity carried out by the business each entity within the single llc can have its own accounting system own its own assets and be liable only for its own debts as if each entity were a separate llc thus in many cases a single llc can be used to manage the holding entity as well as the multiple operating entities see our discussion of using multiple holding and operating companies this may lead to fee savings as the single llc would require a formation fee in delaware and a single registration fee elsewhere where it does business it also eliminates the question as to whether an outofstate holding entity also must register to do business in other particular states tools to use the business tools section contains sample articles of organization and a sample operating agreement for a delaware llc know state tax ramifications for entity selection ordinarily a limited liability company llc and a subchapter s corporation are not subject to state income taxes in a state in which they conduct no business and in which the owners do not reside this may make it desirable to form the entity outofstate the owners will be subject to state income taxes in the state in which they reside or the state in which the entity conducts its business activities usually but not always the same state delaware and nevada two popular states for formation of llcs and corporations both follow these rules moreover most states will follow the presumed tax status of the llc as a conduit and the federal subchapter s tax election of a corporation to be taxed as a conduit however a few states may not recognize the subchapter s election these states may impose states income taxes on the corporation even when it does no business in the state it also is remotely possible that a state would still treat an llc as a corporation for state income tax purposes and impose taxes on it regardless of whether it conducts operations there although these situations are unlikely to be encountered its a good practice to check with state taxing authorities before choosing a state in which to form the businessor form the business in a state such as delaware or nevada which provides clear rules favorable to the small business owner look for a business friendly state while every state allows you to form a corporation or an llc not all of them offer some of the newer more effective asset protection and business management entity types such as a statutory close corporation or a domestic asset protection trust not all states permit statutory close corporations some states have a special statutory close corporation statute that is very favorable for owners of small corporations the statutory close corporation statutes relax many of the formalities normally applicable to a corporation basically these statutes allow the corporation to be operated similarly to a limited liability company llc specifically these corporations may do away with a board of directors and shareholders can run the corporation by way of a shareholder agreement which is similar to an llc operating agreement generally shareholders do not have to hold meetings a failure to follow the formalities normally applicable to a regular c corporation can form the basis for a courts decision to pierce the veil of limited liability and impose unlimited personal liability on the owners with the absence of such formalities in the statutory close corporation the likelihood of this doctrine being applied is lessened significantly thus if a corporation is to be formed it should usually be formed as a statutory close corporation this can only be done in the small group of states that allow this option such as delaware and nevada think ahead forming an entity outofstate will not create additional costs if for example the holding entity is formed outofstate and the operating entity is formed in the owners home state the activities of the outofstate holding entity should not rise to the level of doing business in the home state thus the holding entity should not have to register in the home state essentially only the interest in the holding entity requires extra protection as the holding entity will house the wealth of the business through strategic funding practices the holding entity will normally own the operating entity and the most valuable assets used by the operating entity the assets owned by the operating entity will be protected in other ways such as with liens that run to the holding entity if additional costs are not an issue the ideal situation may be to form both the holding entity and the operating entity in an asset protection friendly state such as delaware this may mean three fees two formation fees plus a registration fee even if additional costs are involved however the benefits will outweigh those costs in most cases asset protection trust options exist in a few states forming the holding entity in delaware nevada or alaska can be part of an overall asset protection plan because these states have statutes authorizing the creation of domestic asset protection trusts however this is a significant departure from domestic law in the united states accordingly a trust created under either of these statutes could be challenged on jurisdictional grounds one way to bolster the validity of these trusts is to create additional contacts in delaware or alaska where the trust is formed having a holding entity formed the state that funds the asset protection trust located there would create additional contacts in that state certain states facilitate use of holding companies if you are forming a holding entity and an operating entity consider forming the holding entity outofstate in particular in delaware and the operating entity in your home state or where the businesss activities will be conducted forming the holding entity outofstate will produce no additional costs there will still be only two state fees one to form the holding entity and the other to form the operating entity the small business owner should take the lead from larger businesses and consider delaware as the site for the holding entity this also may help sustain the validity of an asset protection trust formed there in addition if fees are not a significant concern consider forming both the holding entity and operating entity in delaware so that delaware law will govern each entity here the operating entity will have to register to do business in the owners home state or where the businesss activities will be conducted thus creating a third fee however this fee may prove to be an inexpensive form of insurance this option is more attractive when the home states limited liability company llc statute does not effectively protect an owners interest from his personal creditors note too that the delaware llc statute allows for the creation of multiple entities within the form of single entity this can make formation of an llc in delaware less expensive delawares security registration exemption could prove important unlike other states delaware expressly exempts from securities registration all limited liability company llc interests that are not actually traded in a securities market such as in a family llc see our discussion of securities issues in business formation this kind of flexibility is particularly advantageous when in the managermanaged llc nonmanager interests are to be issued premium services for
