source bp what shares of bp prudhoe bay royalty trust nysebpt a royalty interest trust in the prudhoe bay oil field located on the north slope of alaska collapsed in march with its share price plunging  according to data from sp global market intelligence there appear to be three primary culprits for the tumble so what first bp prudhoe bay royalty trust is dependent on rising crude oil prices to pay out its handsome and highly coveted cash distribution but as we all know crude prices have sunk by roughly twothirds in less than two years crushing the average perbarrel royalty that bp prudhoe bay royalty trust would net by  between q  and q  all the while its contractual costs are rising image source pictures of money via flickr second in march bp nysebp announced that it would be cutting production in the prudhoe bay region of alaska to just two rigs from the current five largely on account of persistently low crude oil prices bp prudhoe bays royalty interest allows the company to receive a royalty on up to  barrels a day but it appears as if production in the region is about to be slashed hurting its royaltyearning capacity thats also bad news for investors who count on the cash distribution the final nail in the coffin came from the companys k which suggested that the trust is on pace to fund cash distributions through  but did not expect to pay out any distributions thereafter heres the pertinent information from bp prudhoe bay royalty trusts k based on the  twelvemonth average wti price of  per barrel current production taxes and the chargeable costs adjusted as prescribed by the overriding royalty conveyance it is estimated that royalty payments to the trust will continue through the year  and would be zero in the following year therefore no proved reserves are currently attributed to the bp prudhoe bay royalty trust after that date  now what with an end to cash distributions in sight were simply witnessing investors not overpaying for future distributions which is a smart move royalty trusts can offer substantial yields that can lure in inexperienced investors who are chasing yield but their distributions are based solely on their ability to control their costs and maintain production all while their primary product oil in this case rises in price right now were seeing bp prudhoe bays costs rise each and every year as expected meanwhile production is falling crude prices remain weak and an end may be in sight for the trust keep in mind that when it discontinues paying cash distributions its share price would be expected to head to  what could bp prudhoe bay royalty trust pay in cash distributions over the next five years that depends on a number of factors but the general consensus that i happen to agree with is that bp prudhoe bay is a huge gamble even after a nearly  haircut in a month id suggest you avoid this mess altogether sean williams has no material interest in any companies mentioned in this article you can
