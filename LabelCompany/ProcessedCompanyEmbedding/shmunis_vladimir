all sizes move their on premises telephone service to the cloud the global market is expected to reach  billion by  according to grand view researchvladimir shmunis is well aware of those statistics  he’s the founder and ceo of ringcentral and he’s been at this for a while“we are the largest ucaas pureplay provider in the world today we’ll do close to  million in revenues this year we are on record with the investment community that we are targeting to reach  billion revenue in three years – by  so we think we are within a major disruption that is global in nature this disruption is irreversible namely the fact that business communications solutions are leaving the traditional way of being onpremise to moving into the cloud” says shmunisthe publiclytraded belmont caheadquartered company positions itself as provider of cloud unified communications and collaboration solutions that are more flexible and costeffective than legacy onpremise systems for today’s mobile and distributed workforces ringcentral allows modern workers to be connected anywhere and on any device through voice video team messaging collaboration sms conferencing online meetings contact center and fax  the company counts some  organizations worldwide as customersringcentral is the second go around with business communications solutions for shmunis  “both were done mostly out of ignorance laughing and the ignorance part was – and i’m only halfjoking here – is i never understood and i don’t understand to this day why communication products needs to be done in a using a hardware box and b in a closedended manner so to me from day one and in my case day one goes back about  years the part that didn’t compute for me personally was why can’t i have a software system which is running on conventional computing devices and that empowers people to communicate the way that they want as opposed to the way that the system wants”in fact shmunis started a company called ring zero systems  years ago to set out to do just that long before the cloud existed “my background is by the way technical – software engineering – so i at that time had no business background whatsoever which was matched by my lack of funds so the only thing we had to rely on was technology itself”   nonetheless the company became the number one supplier of desktop communication software to the pc oem channel the software would come prebundled on the system and was one of the early players in voiceenabled pcs “we built a nice little franchise on that we shipped tens of millions of units through the oem channel” says shmunis  he later sold that company to motorola in ’ for an undisclosed sum but purported to be somewhere in the teen millions   but shmunis felt the time was right to sell for other reasonsthe price of pcs were dropping precipitously from the hay days of  to  models to hundreds of dollars the margins were shrinking and along with it ring zero’s revenue potential “i saw the writing on the wall motorola was a customer at the time and we had good relations they had their ideas what to do so we ended up doing the deal and it worked out for everyone” says shmunis the worlds richest agree this will impact everything see the tech sponsored by the motley fool in  he took what he learned from the ring zero experience started anew with ringcentral but with a new recurring revenue subscription model where he felt he was better in control of his destiny“the idea was to do recurrent revenue sure go through the channel but most importantly go straight to the end user” he had a little bit more money from the sale but was still writing checks to float the business as the dot com bubble burstyet the business continued to grow organically and it wasn’t until  that the company took on institutional funding from sequoia and khosler ventures with  million in funding that serve to accelerate ringcentral’s growth  the company went from  million to close to  million in sales in eleven yearsshmunis is used to making his own way in the world he was born in the ukraine when it was part of the old soviet union his parents immigrated to the us in the seventies and wound up in san francisco  vlad and his younger sister went to public high schools in the city and he later graduated from san francisco state university with a degree in computer science followed by his master’s degree from the same school he began working as an engineer out of school at a small startup in silicon valley “i fairly quickly figured out that as far as a software developer i was okay i wouldn’t say world class but i was pretty good at understanding what customers wanted and what engineers could feasibly deliver and moved into the technical management ranks fairly early in life”after working for a few years in a corporate setting he realized he didn’t envision a future for himself there “i really didn’t see myself as part of the traditional corporate world at that time so my next best thing to do would be work on my own i like things to move faster and i don’t have a lot of patience for politics and corporate bull” says shmunis  far from the stereotyped carefree silicon valley startup entrepreneur shmunis was  then when he left the corporate world to start ring zero and already had a family to support  “i explained it to my wife if i’m going to be unhappy anyway let me be unhappy with myself as opposed to with my boss”“once we started gaining traction and the product started taking shape and customers started lining up that’s where we go ‘okay well maybe it wasn’t such a bad decision’”hard to disagree as of this writing ring central’s stock price is up   yeartodate  and synergy research group has recognized ringcentral as the  worldwide market share leader in both

experience we have grown revenue from about  million to over  million have substantially increased the size of customers we address and are now winning multiple enterprise customers we are profitable have now generated five consecutive quarters of free cash flow and have a strong balance sheet with no debt i have accomplished all the things i wanted to when i joined four years ago including the successful ringcentral ipo and presence of the public company mitesh has been at ringcentral even before me and we have worked together for the last four years during this time i have given him

ringcentral with that i will turn the call over to vlad followed by dave sipes and mitesh i will be available during the qa portion of this call with that let me turn the call over to vlad vladimir shmunis thank you clyde before i give an update on q i want to acknowledge clyde for all his contributions clyde played an important role in our journey from ipo to over  million in revenues and i want to thank clyde for the excellent job he did in transition planning and developing our next generation finance leadership now on to q q was a great start to the year our software subscription revenue growth accelerated to  up from  last quarter total revenue grew to  million up  yearoveryear our results were driven by our success in all segments and especially in the midmarket and enterprise as well as increasing momentum with our channel partners legacy onpremise vendors businesses in our industry are mostly shrinking cloud is winning and were winning in the cloud were the largest fastestgrowing pureplay cloud provider for business communication solutions last quarter we believe our win rate further increased in the midmarket and enterprise our channel business continues to accelerate as enterprises are increasing their adoption of cloud communications solutions with these tailwinds we believe we are further widening the separation between us and our cloud competitors for a little more color i like to talk about the following three areas one overall industry perspective two summary of our q performance and three our continual rapid pace of innovation we recently participated in enterprise connect the leading trade conference in our industry it was remarkable how clear it was that the future is cloud three years ago at enterprise connect cloud was just a discussion topic even as recently as last year cloud was still not the clear winner however this year cloud was front and center and the move to the cloud seemed to be a foregone conclusion even the legacy vendors have recognized that cloud is winning the legacy pbx vendors are mostly no longer promoting their purely onpremise offerings instead theyre trying to push a hybrid or hosted systems approach but these are still at their core expensive legacy solutions which continued to suffer from lack of innovation closed architectures and poor onboarding and user experience larger enterprises are increasingly looking to the cloud to better serve their global workforces integrate their communication stacks with other lines of business applications and consolidate multiple display systems and vendors into a single solution legacy or legacybased hosted systems simply cannot effectively meet these challenges we are seeing channel partners rapidly getting more comfortable leading with our ucaas solutions the strong demand from our channel partners is particularly coming from those who in the past used to lead with legacy solutions such as avaya to better satisfy demand generated by the channel we have recently introduced ringcentral europe this new offering now enables us and our channel partners to serve needs of businesses headquartered in  european countries these market shifts are reflected in our q results in q our midmarket and enterprise segment grew  yearoveryear and is now an over  million recurring revenue business our enterprise sales team had another record quarter i am happy to say that in q usually a seasonally slow quarter for large deals we closed six deals with tcv north of  million up from five in q one of these wins was at hyatt hotels corporation hyatt will be replacing legacy avaya system at their headquarters with ringcentral office dave will later provide you more color on hyatt and some other key wins in q new business from channel partners showed impressive growth of over  yearoveryear and over  quarteroverquarter a number of our large enterprise deals came through our channel partnerships moving forward we expect to continue expanding our momentum by extending our clear technology and product competitive leadership we continue to make product enhancements to address the increasing needs of midmarket and enterprise customers we also continue to outinvest our nearest cloud competitor by over two times in rd our unique differentiators remain the seamless integration of enterprise communications and team collaboration open platform global footprint and our relentless focus on usability and mobility with our strong growth expanding enterprise demand rapidly evolving partner ecosystem and continual innovation leadership i feel confident that we will achieve our  billion revenue goal by the end of  now for some additional color i will pass the call over to our coo dave sipes david sipes thank you vlad i want to also thank clyde for his support and leadership over the years i wish you all the best i will now give more color on our q performance our strong performance in q illustrated the market inflection were seeing across all segments and especially in the midmarket and enterprise the combination of our industryleading integrated solution global and open platform and a rapidly expanding partner channel continues to distance us from the competition our integrated open platform includes enterprise voice video contact center team messaging collaboration and conferencing with these capabilities our cloud solution is not just a replacement for legacy voiceonly pbx systems in many of our deals were also displacing a wide range of discrete legacy communication tools as a matter of fact in a number of wins were replacing multiple products and services such as avaya and cisco pbx and contact centers webex web meetings and slack team messaging our pipeline for midmarket and enterprise customers continues to show strong growth as demonstrated by our six sevenfigure deals in the quarter a key winning differentiator is our integrated collaborative communications capability vlad mentioned hyatt earlier as one of our sevenfigure wins this is a replacement of legacy onpremise avaya system initially at hyatt’s headquarters multiple vendors competed for this business including our closest cloud competitors hyatt chose us because our solution seamlessly integrates voice video team messaging and collaboration in the future hyatt plans to standardize its communications solutions across its mobile and distributed workforce another example of a sevenfigure tcv enterprise win that was driven by our unique collaborative communications capability was an user win from a specialty communications provider this account is going to be deployed globally including in the uk brazil germany and south africa additionally the customer is also deploying over  ringcentral contact center seats in the process were replacing multiple legacy systems that are currently providing discrete voice video and collaboration solutions another key differentiator enabling us to win larger deals is our open platform this provides our isv partners and enterprise customers the ability to easily integrate communications data and services into their applications this has proven pivotal in several large customer wins including an user win at n a global sales execution and demand generation firm for productivity improvements n is utilizing microsoft dynamics integration with ringcentral office to customize their business workflows in addition to our open platform n chose ringcentral based on our proven global capabilities the ability to deliver collaborative communication solutions to enterprises globally is a unique advantage of our platform over legacy systems another example of a global office win this quarter is ultratech a leading supplier of semiconductor manufacturing equipment in addition to its us headquarters this customer has employees in brazil costa rica ireland the uk and singapore as a matter of fact we now have over  enterprises on our global office platform up from around  last quarter contact center also continued to be a strong growth vector for us and now accounts for about  of our midmarket and enterprise new business up from  a year ago ringcentral contact center is integrated with ringcentral office collaborative communications capabilities for a strongly differentiated competitive offering we continue to see strong and improving acceptance of our solutions by channel partners this is helping us efficiently grow our enterprise business as these partners are enabling us to reach more enterprise customers faster and with higher win rates this quarter five of our six sevenfigure deals were won with channel partner involvement as we continue to ramp up more channel partners we expect this to continue to be a key driver of scalable growth in midmarket and enterprise were also seeing good traction from google for example during the quarter we won a user deal with a new york based global independent advertising network this customer chose ringcentral office based on its tight integration with google cloud’s gsuite we also added  new google partners in q for a total now of about  in summary q was a fantastic quarter with continued industryleading growth many investors have asked how our midmarket and enterprise revenues compare if we were to cast it as customers with over  mrr that some other vendors use by that measure our midmarket and enterprise business is now approximately  million and grew over  yearoveryear it’s no longer a question if enterprises will switch to the cloud it’s only a question of how quickly and ringcentral is best positioned to benefit from this trend given our world class gotomarket technology platform and accelerating pace of innovation i will now hand it over to mitesh congratulations mitesh mitesh dhruv thanks dave good afternoon everyone before i start i want thank you clyde for your mentorship over the years it’s been a pleasure working for you i joined ringcentral prior to our ipo and it’s a privilege to step up to the cfo role we see many years of strong and profitable growth ahead for ringcentral and i look forward to working with all of you over the coming quarters and years before i begin with the results i want to ask that you refer to the slide deck posted on our investor relations website which will help summarize the key points in our call today as well as provide some supplemental information unless otherwise indicated all measures that follow are nongaap with yearoveryear comparisons a reconciliation of gaap to nongaap results was provided with our earnings press release issued earlier today and in the slide deck posted on our ir website q was yet another strong quarter for ringcentral we delivered total revenue ahead of the high end of our guidance range along with yearoveryear improvements in operating margin and earnings per share q was underscored by  software subscription revenue growth and nongaap software subscription gross margin of over  amongst the bestinclass saas companies more important we saw strong momentum in our midmarket and enterprise execution our midmarket and enterprise segments are now over a  million business grew  and represented around  of our new sales for ringcentral office total annualized exit monthly recurring subscriptions or arr grew to approximately  million up  yearoveryear and up  sequentially arr for ringcentral office grew to approximately  million up  yearoveryear and up  sequentially i should note that the quarter was aided by a number of factors including avaya’s bankruptcy news unforecasted new business from att albeit at a diminishing contribution and better monetization of our customer base as a result we expect q arr to grow more normalized at  to  sequentially in line with our last years growth although at a much higher level of revenue the indirect channel contributed  of arr in q as we continue to grow and diversify our indirect channel an increasing percentage of our indirect channel bookings is coming from our channel partners which are our noncarrier partners in fact channel partners had a record bookings quarter and now represents more than  of the total indirect bookings in q over  of our new office business came from existing customers overall this demonstrates customer satisfaction with the ringcentral platform along with tailwinds from land and expand with larger customers as we consistently expand up market office net monthly subscription dollar retention was once again over  across the installed base software subscription revenue in q was  million up  yearoveryear and up  sequentially other revenues were  million bringing total revenue for the first quarter to  million up from  million in q a year ago representing  yearoveryear growth we reverted to the direct sales model for the hardware business which generated a twopoint tailwind to our total revenue growth in q this had no impact to our subscription growth rate our software subscription gross margin was over  during q consistent with last quarter and represents over a point of improvement yearoveryear once again demonstrating the leverage from our multitenant saas model gross margin from other revenues was  in the quarter other gross margins reflect the change to the direct sales model in our hardware business on a sustained basis we expect gross margin from other revenues to be between  and  as a reminder the other revenues line includes phones professional services and revenues from rental phones total gross margin was  up about  basis points yearoveryear on a comparative basis adjusting for the change to direct hardware sales total gross margin would have been up  basis points yearoveryear sales and marketing expenses were about  million for the quarter or  of revenues this was up from  in the first quarter a year ago and flat from  last quarter these expenses include investments we are making in the enterprise segment which remains a significant opportunity for us with meaningfully higher lifetime values our longterm unit economics continue to be attractive for each dollar invested in sales and marketing we continue to see  of revenue and  of gross profit over the projected life of an office customer for midmarket we continue to see  of revenue and for our enterprise customers we continue to see  of revenue over the projected life rd expenses were  million for the quarter or  of revenues down from  in both q a year ago and from last quarter ga expenses were  million for the quarter or  of revenues down from  in q a year ago and up from  last quarter our operating profit was  million resulting in an operating margin of  versus our guidance range of  to  this is up from  in q a year ago sequentially the operating margin is down  basis points from q driven by one point of headwind from seasonal effects such as reset of payroll taxes net income improved to  million compared to  million in q of last year and  million last quarter earnings per share was  at the high end of our q guidance range of  to  share count was  million fully diluted shares on a gaap basis our q net loss was  million or a loss of  per share the difference between our gaap and nongaap results was  million or  per share this is primarily driven by  of stockbased compensation while  was due to amortization of intangibles and other items related to the glip acquisition we ended q with cash and shortterm investments of  million compared to  million at the end of q the decline in our cash balance reflects a  million repayment of our entire debt deferred revenue was  million an increase from  million in q and  million a year ago for the quarter cash flow from operations was  million compared to  million for q and  million in the same period a year ago free cash flow was  million in q free cash flow included a onetime working capital headwind due to a switch to direct hardware sales which was offset by higher deferred revenue stronger collections and other improvements in working capital before i move on to the guidance i would point out that our att new business peaked in q of last year and optically is a tough compare looking ahead to q of this year we expect the growth rates to normalize in the second half as channel partners increase their contribution to the indirect channel this is reflected in our full year guidance now for our outlook for the second quarter and fullyear  for the second quarter we expect software subscription revenue of  million plus or minus  million dollars which represents an annual growth of  we expect total revenue of  million to  million which represents an annual growth of  to  on a comparative basis adjusted to the direct sales model growth would have been three points lower we expect nongaap operating margin of  to  we expect nongaap earnings per share of  plus or minus  based on  million fully diluted shares the difference between our q gaap and nongaap eps is expected to be approximately  including  of stockbased compensation and  of amortization of intangibles and other items related to the glip acquisition this excludes any effects from currency remeasurement which is difficult to forecast for the full year  we are raising our software subscription revenue guidance to  million to  million or an annual growth of  to  up from our prior guidance of  million to  million we are raising our total revenue guidance to  million to  million which implies yearoveryear growth of  to  this is up from our previous guidance of  million to  million on a comparative basis adjusted to the direct sales model growth would be about three points lower we expect nongaap operating margin of  to  consistent with the guidance we provided last quarter we are raising our nongaap earnings per share guidance to  to  up from  to  previously the difference between our  gaap and nongaap eps is expected to be approximately  including  of stockbased compensation and  of amortization of intangibles and other items related to the glip acquisition this excludes any effects of currency remeasurement which is difficult to forecast we expect fully diluted shares to be  million we expect free cash flow for the year of approximately  million to  million up from  million to  million previously in summary q was another great quarter that marks a strong start to the year with that ill turn the call over to the operator for qa questionandanswer session operator thank you ladies and gentlemen at this time we will be conducting a

with you a little more closely my first question is really to vlad or david you talked about improving win rates youve talked about various reasons for some of the big deals when you look at the partners and the larger midsize and enterprise segments youve touched on the google integration youve touched on glip is there some commonality in why youre winning these deals will be the competition is it just glip is it about a more frequent features thats requested is it google is it sales force integration is there something specific there and then i have a quick followup vladimir shmunis yes bhavan vlad here thanks for the congrats and yes great question look its really the combination of things its really hard to say that its just glip or just the open platform or just the global footprint what we see really are enterprise customers really wanting to go for the bestinclass solutions which fairly should include all of these and also it has to be usable and it has to be easy to onboard and administer and this is where we excel this is why made the investments we have both into our product technology and the infrastructure and its paying very nice dividends now as you can see bhavan suri for clyde or mitesh you guys have sort of brought up that  billion run rate number reiterate that in fact i think i just want to touch on just what would the margin be when you hit that  billion what should we think currently  operating margin what does that look like sort of in that  timeframe when you hit the  billion run rate mitesh dhruv sure bhavan ill take it its mitesh and thanks for the debut question itll be a special question forever so its a good question right we get this question a lot from all the top investors so it really depends it depends on the growth rate at that time and how fast we are growing as you know bhavan there is an inherent tradeoff in the saas model between our longterm growth and shortterm profitability and we tend to optimize for profitable growth and longterm unit economics so given the opportunity we have right now to invest in future profitable growth and attractive unit economics you saw for every dollar we invest we get about  of lifetime revenue back we would tend to optimize for growth and show some leverage and basically capture this unbounded market we have ahead of us and you can  you saw the recent momentum vlad and dave highlighted with the hyatt win and whatnot so i think the preference would be to grow profitably now over time if these investments stop generating the same roi were seeing we can just dial back the sales and marketing investments because its really a variable cost its a tight dial we have and we deliver higher profitability with all that said to give you a guide post at a  billion you can think about a combination or a rule of  which is a combination of our growth plus free cash flow margin to be indiscernible towards  which is what the bestinclass companies are doing and you can expect us to either meet or beat the rule of  at a  billion operator our next question comes from the line of john difucci with jefferies please proceed with your question john difucci thank you first of all clyde its really has been a pleasure and i assume youre getting the rv all powered up and definitely do not be a stranger and also congrats to mitesh my question  my first question is really for i think for dave and vlad and theres two interesting things happening here and theyve been happening but this quarter it sort of accentuated and thats both the strength in midmarket and mostly enterprise and then also partner stream im just curious how related those are are partners driving more of your enterprise sales or is that more directed this time david sipes yes this is david so the partner strength is really helping in the enterprise and midmarket segments and creating introductions we have also made significant investments in the enterprise teams both in growing our enterprise team and the leadership there as well as getting leaders in every region in country and growing out our professional services so there is really a combination between those investments were making in enterprise as well as the partners that weve made strong relationships with are gaining brand recognition with and are helping bring deals in that segment also we see both directly sourced and channel source deals growing significantly for us john difucci okay david so i guess maybe a related question it sounds like both are sort of happening now and i guess is with avaya and some of the issues with avaya and you mentioned that a very large deal with  that was a previous avaya customer is it the timing  are customers now just larger customers more comfortable consuming unified communications as a service so the timing of the issues with avaya is that just sort of playing to your hand and as you know and indiscernible as you mentioned and we know that you sort of built it built it not only product but also the gotomarket strategy and is this something  are we seeing somewhat of an inflection right now are we in the midst of that or is this just sort of a gradual thing and this is sort of the first quarter and maybe thats really see a quarter of that kind of benefit just trying to gauge that david sipes yes no no good question theres definitely a mind shift especially customers that maybe on platform that hasnt been invested in significantly and isnt delivering integrated collaborative communications that were able to bring with the very rapid rate of innovation so those customers are seeing the market shift they are requesting to look at cloud solutions and you see that with people moving off of the avaya platform we mentioned hyatt is one of those and i think thats something that is happening today and is going to continue to progress john difucci okay great thats helpful thank you operator our next question comes from the line of george sutton with craighallum please proceed with your question george sutton thank you mitesh my congratulations and clyde best of luck my first question relates to the collaborative side of the business and with glip now live and running and were seeing sort of competitive threats if you will or at least competitive entrants from a variety of different places can you kind of give us an update in terms of  or you made this acquisition at a brilliant time well before others had come out with a lot of these products where are we now are you happy is this exactly where you want to be competitively are there other things we might see on the collaboration side vladimir shmunis hi george vlad here so yes ill take this one so yes another very good question look if the question is are we satisfied with what we have of course not that would be  that would mean end of progress and were not there yet we do feel that we made this very strategic acquisition at the right time it did give us a very nice head start in coming out what is ultimately our vision which is a fully integrated collaborative communications solution we are coming at it from a different angle from some of the other leaders in the collaborative space in fact weve cracked the harder problem to solve which is enterprise grade global voice and text communications so the pbx replacement in the cloud as you know we are the clear leader in that and the gap is only widening so this put us in a very interesting and favorable position of now adding the collaborative elements text messaging file sharing task management calendar but the end result we feel we have a fairly nice mold here which has to do with integration and specifically integration leveraging all of our enterprise communications assets so thats just because not been repeated and we dont frankly see anyone on the horizon thats gaining ground on us with indiscernible george sutton okay great with my followup id like to get a little deeper on the avaya side so you did mentioned that relatively to the hyatt takeaway that was avaya we are aware of others that you also took away im just curious are we at the tip of the iceberg from your perspective is this something that a year from now well be looking back and saying that drove a material portion of your opportunities or can you just put it in a little bit more perspective david sipes this is david and we did talk about hyatt as one example and of course there are many many more examples that were experienced of moving people off of that platform and right now i think its still early days in that and there is  they obviously have historically a significant market share in legacy and those customers as they migrate to the cloud i think this is expediting their migration to the cloud and expediting their investigation into that so we are seeing some increased activity because of that but i think the size of the opportunity is so significant it will play out over a fair timeframe george sutton okay perfect thanks guys operator our next question comes from the line of nikolay beliov with bank of america please proceed with your question nikolay beliov hi thanks for taking my question and a followup first of all congrats on the nice performance clyde its been great working with you and congrats to mitesh my question is to clyde and mitesh when you look at sales and marketing and your overall structure  margin structure gross margins as a target rd as a target ga getting into that direction sales and marketing clearly is the biggest variable here when should we expect to get to see leverage here is it a function of you guys going down enterprise investments at some point or you just wanted to get your thoughts on the puts and takes mitesh dhruv sure thanks nikolay if you look at the leverage the question is leverage and sales and marketing and so the way to look at sales and marketing is again its a function of a tradeoff between growth and leverage and as you know we are maniacally focused on roi and investing in every profitable dollar we can which is what i said in the earlier questions but let me doubleclick a little bit on the sales and marketing side so if you look at it another way  if you look at our installed base we have a very large installed base which is very very profitable if you look at our smb segment this segment requires very little overhead all the rd investment is actually getting funneled to midmarket and enterprise investments and if you look at even the sales and marketing itself there is  the investments are getting over indexed to the upmarket so if you look at the recurring operating profit of the smb business its north of  now the question becomes what do you do with the  you can either flow it to the bottomline and print  operating margin or selfdirect investments to grab even further share of the market and what were trying to do right now is grab an even bigger share of the market and selfdirecting all those leverage points from smb into midmarket and enterprise and i think over time you will see leverage in the business model from time to come nikolay beliov thats very helpful and mitesh just double click on that at your analyst day in november you shared a little detail of what you think your business is going to be at  billion in revenues and i think the small medium enterprise business mix was    and you said with same companies like salesforce maybe its onethird age based on your enterprise traction over the last  months and is it building up the salesforce and the marketing opening up do you see that maybe that  number for the enterprise thats in the mix actually might be a little bit conservative mitesh dhruv sure so early days as i think george mentioned it could be tip of the iceberg and we are at the very early innings of a huge longterm opportunity so right now we are seeing incremental proof points in the enterprise which give us more confidence versus our analyst day so could that  be a third absolutely it could be so i feel that its a journey and youll keep on seeing us deliver more and more proof points in this enterprise segment going forward nikolay beliov got it thank you operator our next question comes from the line of terry tillman with raymond james please proceed with your question terry tillman hey good afternoon gentlemen can you hear me okay mitesh dhruv yes we can terry tillman well its big news on a variety of fronts congrats mitesh and im going to miss you clyde hi vlad hi david hopefully i haven’t missed anybody there on the cash flow its actually nice to see nice progress there on slide  and it looks like youve increased the ranges or i guess the midpoint would move higher based on updated guidance on both ocf and free cash flow i jumped on this call a little late so maybe you already touched on this but im just curious what would be the delta whats driving the improved cash flow expectations mitesh dhruv sure terry ill take that it is a combination of things wherein if you look at the first quarter deferred revenue came in higher than our expectations and thats because we are seeing an uptick from customers who are prepaying and on an annual basis thats point number one we had a really good quarter in terms of streamlining our arr efforts and collections thats point number two and just overall working capital management makes us feel incrementally more comfortable to inch up the guidance terry tillman got it okay and i guess another question just relates to you had kind of a longterm plan here and roadmap to get  monetize the enterprise market but obviously some kind of events outside of your spear of influence have happened with competitors and im just curious that the earlier question about sales and marketing and when we see some leverage but im just curious because of some of these opportunistic situations could you talk about what youre doing with the enterprise sales force i mean i have a sense of how big it is but if i looked at avaya i mean its  per sales rep so have you accelerated some of the hiring or even maybe potential opportunities to bring on some talent from some of these legacy vendors could you all talk on that vladimir shmunis hey terry vlad what ill  i apologize if this comes across this too snide but usually there is a balance between or a choice between investing in the product and just investing in the sales force and were going to add or making the product that kind of wants to sell itself so with that in mind we clearly do have a growing sales force it is a fairly small compared to avayas and dave will provide maybe a little bit more color here but in general we do have coverage domestically in every region its same coverage but it is coverage and we are  philosophically we are investing just ahead of revenue so you should expect some growth there dave if you can maybe add some color david sipes yes and as weve  i think answer on several points of what you talked about is yes theres gaining and market momentum both from the customer perspective from the channel perspective as well as weve typically taken a measured approach to expanding into new segments but were seeing very encouraging results in the enterprise segment and are continuing to grow the teams very quickly and weve been able to bring in significant leadership of with industry experience as well as software experience and so all of that has helped expand that significantly and the shape of that team is  im very enthused about where were at with that team operator our next question comes from the line of meta marshall with morgan stanley please proceed with your question meta marshall hey thanks guys and congrats on the quarter and all the new positions turning to the contact center you spoke to midmarket adoption kind of rising to  from  a year ago and just wanted to know is that a better sales motion are you just seeing more customers kind of wanting that product and then on the second question just on hyatt if you could just speak to how long that sales cycle was and kind of the timeline to roll out or a potential expansion opportunity would be helpful thanks mitesh dhruv sure on the adoption of the contact center and i think it was the first part of your question and we have had increased adoption as we continued to gain traction in the enterprise and midmarket segments we are seeing a interest in customers of coupling those products of the enterprise communication system with the contact center and weve made significant investments both in the integration of the product as well as the team enablement of our sales teams as for hyatt our typical enterprise deals can be a six to  months sales cycle and with hyatt as with many of our large enterprise deals well typically see a transition to our services as quickly as two to three months from booking a deal when were looking at a limited number of locations with doing that transition and thats what we should expect here meta marshall thank you operator our next question comes from the line of sterling auty with jp morgan please proceed with your question sterling auty yes thanks guys mitesh congratulations clyde enjoy the next phase but clyde i do want to start because i know im going to get the question is this truly it or are you retiring or is there going to be another career after this what should investors be looking for and if thats the case what drove the timing i know you gave some insight in your prepared remarks but any additional color would be helpful clyde hosein so sure thing sterling ill miss this place ill miss the team thats on the call with me today and all of the employees at ringcentral ill miss the product because its a terrific product and ive been passionate about it over the years what drove the timing sterling is and ill be candid with folks as i always been my wife retired earlier this year my daughter is  my younger daughter is in the high school and so you couldnt get a better opportunity to spend some time with them and i think if you look back and talk to a lot of folks they look back in the life and say take the quality time to spend with family so thats part one but other part of as we described earlier mitesh and i have worked together for the longest while since ive been here mitesh is ready to take over so those  intersection of those two things gave me the opportunity to spend time with family and i know some investors takes and says thats usually euphemism thats real im actually going  im driving a big bus a pound bus starting in june across the country it sounds like an old man but ill enjoy it i dont think im retiring but i have no idea when im going to come back if i enjoy the ride ill spend up to a year my wife has a different over or under when ill get bored so people who know me will be but in any event sterling ill be rooting heavily for ringcentral in the sidelines ill be available to the team if they need me but they get to call me when im not driving the big bus hope that helps sterling auty thats it thats perfect and put me on the list with john or people that are jealous of that situation and then just one followup question so weve had all of the talk and noise about att as a channel partner et cetera et cetera but what im curious about is obviously with the channel program that you have and some of the changes that you made theres other areas that are really stepping up to probably produce more than what they had been previously given the structure i just want to make sure im clear what are those pockets of areas within the channel and the partner programs that are really getting the chance to step up and contribute more david sipes this is where were getting traction the question is where were getting traction on the channel side is that what you sterling auty yes so if we go back to last quarter and talk of att and different changes around how theyre viewing their gotomarket with you it would seem like given the growth that means other partners are probably contributing at a faster rate than what they did a year ago where are those areas that are getting incrementally stronger if att is maybe just kind of treading water at this point david sipes yes absolutely so weve talked a lot about the channel partners and how theyre contributing to our midmarket and enterprise success and in there we have different types of partners so we talked about signing  last year when we talk about national partners or partners with employed salespeople you talked about people like cdw or carousel or shi when you talk about master agent that weve had success with or organizations like intelisys or ingram micro and then weve also talked about like the google partners which are their own set of partners we talked about indiscernible and cts last quarter when we signed a new person in that premise this quarter so i think there is a lot of different pockets that we are having success in in our indirect channels and flowing the entire category to continue to grow and diversify significantly mitesh dhruv and just  ill just add one small color to on the financial side to what dave said is if you look at the bookings from the indirect channel the channel partners now contributed about  of the new bookings came from those pockets dave mentioned so you can see the change of guard or shift in the guard from the carrier partners we had earlier to the new channel partners dave mentioned i think and this momentum is just here to stay operator our next question comes from the line of mike latimore with northland capital please proceed with your question michael latimore great thanks great quarter and congratulations mitesh and nice work over here clyde and if your bus makes it through atlanta let me know indiscernible clyde hosein you got it thats the golf clubs pit under the bus so well be happy to do that michael latimore excellent just i think mitesh you mentioned a couple of things that enhanced sequential growth in the quarter one other thing you mentioned was just sort of better monetization of the customer base i believe can you just elaborate a little bit on what you meant by that mitesh dhruv sure sure mike so as you know we continue to add features and weve been expanding our value proposition of all our products and also if you look at the brand awareness that has only gone up over the years in the marketplace so we have had an opportunity to better capture the value and so we did and that weve baked into our guidance going forward michael latimore okay got it thanks and then just on the sales cycles can you talk a little bit about  has there been a change in the sales cycle in the midmarket and separately the enterprise segment versus say a year ago mitesh dhruv i think what we see is in those segments youre looking at when youre in early on a deal a six to  months sales cycle we do  when we brought in by partners we have often can come in in the middle of that cycle and have an even much more accelerated close in that so i think you see that with partner segment today but i do think those sales cycles will kind of continue to be about that length its a very considered purchase by these customers but its something that even in hotly contested deals like hyatt were able to demonstrate the power of our product and be successful operator our next question comes from the line of heather bellini with goldman sachs please proceed with your question heather bellini hey guys just a couple of questions for you one i wanted to know on the followup to the morgan stanley question about avaya was one or hyatt i think particularly with avaya i was just wondering if you could share with us the sales cycle what you think the typical sales cycles will be for those avaya replacements to still differ from the enterprise sales cycle you laid out and then secondly just if you could share with us you mentioned in your prepared remarks that youre investing in areas where the enterprise customers youre talking to want to see innovation and see development can you share with us specifically what are some of those areas that theyre asking for thats it thanks mitesh dhruv yes so i think again the question was sale cycle on enterprise and hyatt we talked about six to  months hyatt was right in that its actually closer to the six month on that one probably more like eight months on that deal and it was  we got through an rfp and there was  everyone responded but we quickly got down selected and selected overall and we look at several months transition as they move onto our service and the second part is what our enterprise customers asking us for product enhancement and capabilities and we see that  were making significant investments in the open platform aspect of our product and the globalization of our global office product are critical as well as the tight integration that weve announced at enterprise connect with our enterprise collaborative communications bringing the team messaging and enterprise communications together so all three  all of those areas are very critical and our expansion into the enterprise segment and our differentiation in the market operator our next question comes from the line of will power with robert w baird please proceed with your question will power great thanks and clyde and mitesh i echo with the previous comments i guess a couple of questions or followups maybe just quickly somewhat obligatory coming back to att i think in the prepared remarks you indicated you did win some new business in the quarter that benefited the arr but that you werent expecting new business in q if i understood and i guess im just wondering is thats just the same conservatism you had or is there new messaging from att and that relationship any real change there and then secondly just as i think about the global opportunity the ringcentral global office you went from  to  customers i guess on that platform is that principally us based companies with offices in europe and if so how should we think about the opportunity to really expand distribution in europe and outside the us and over what timeframe mitesh dhruv sure ill take the first one and ill let dave take the second one so on att we did see some business from att in the quarter in q albeit at a very meaningfully lower levels from a year ago so in terms of the forecast were not changing anything we are assuming the same thing which is no net new ads from att and normalized churn from the att business so no change there i will say that if you look at our full year guidance despite those  if you look at the total headwinds that contribute from att its about three to four points of headwinds from att resulting from that so anyways our guidance reflects all those things but no change to philosophy there david sipes and on the global office that has been a very strongly received product offering and weve continued to expand the number of countries were covering so youll find from all directions so from us organizations we talked about ultratech being on global office and having been a semiconductor tools manufacture having operations globally and in asia as key we had a customer in the uk paramedic science that expanded global office its actually back into the us and into canada you see examples like that as well as we see those organizations having global office users across western europe and apac and latin america and that all led to part of our interest in launching our european offering which allows us to do direct sales into those countries so i think youll be seeing more of global office going in new directions as we bring on new organizations outside of the core countries we sold to historically and bringing all their users globally on to our product operator our next question comes from the line of jonathan kees with summit red stone please proceed with your question jonathan kees great thanks for taking my question and ill add to the kind words for mitesh and for clyde my two questions really are focused on pricing im just curious what the pricing environment is like you talked about for example at the hyatt you competed against other pure cloud competitors they kind of offered the same total cost of ownership savings versus atpremise provider and you talked about some of your differentiators in terms of with team messaging and contact center how much  what was the pricing environment in those situations mitesh dhruv yes so our customers  one theyre looking to get off a legacy product and theyre seeing the advantages that theyre getting by being cloud with mobility usability the global capabilities of rapid innovation so i think its less about how it compares to that and when you look to move to the cloud obviously these large organizations we provide different pricing for larger enterprise organization but the ability to sell across multiple solutions and replace discrete onpremise solutions or even cloud solutions whether thats meetings contact center and unified communications allows for the customers to have extremely strong roi in replacing those systems and so thats what were benefiting from as well as our ability to continue to deliver rapid innovation like our collaboration solution across all our users jonathan kees that makes sense and maybe i wasnt too clear on my question there i guess first is your pure cloud competitors who can offer the same total cost of ownership cost savings across multiple products contact centers uc that kind of stuff are you seeing a more competitive environment and are you seeing pricing being the initiative on top of product differentiators and then really my second followup question was are you being a pricing leader by chance i know this is for your channel harmony program that youre awarding  commissions to your channel partners and youve seen that you are in unique compared to others in industry is that just a indirectly of providing pricing discount to your partners and to your customers vladimir shmunis yes vlad here so i guess let me take that so look im not so sure that we agree with the statement our competitors have the same product to offer they do not we already went through some of the main differentiators again to recap were talking to the worlds best global footprint were talking to the worlds only fully integrated collaborative communications solutions and were talking to the worlds only open platform all under one umbrella okay and these are objective not subjective differentiators subjectively to the emphasis on mobility user experience all of the things just for example will make apple great okay so we do see power of the product getting today for us we do not perceive ourselves as price leaders certainly we need to price competitively but there have been numerous occasions where people try to win against us on price alone and generally it doesnt work i need to remind everyone what we have is a missioncritical application if business communications goes down even for a few minutes that has tangible business impact and what we havent done much on this goal for example is we havent talked about our uptime and the slas that were able to provide and backup and millions of customer reference examples that we can now cite against our competitors some of them interestingly enough are not just our satisfied customers that we won but also competitive takeaways where people have been able to experience some of our direct competitors and at this point are now happy and referenceable with central customers that goes a very long way operator we have time for one last question our last question comes from the line of kash rangan from bank of america please proceed with your question kash rangan hey guys hey mitesh congratulations its been great to watch your career progress over the last  years and look forward to staying tuned over the next several several dozens of years and clyde congrats to you on training a superstar not too often do we find public company cfo is training the replacement as effectively as you did and achieve the seamless transition so congrats to you clyde and i have to ask a question about the business and i was blown away by the number of sevenfigure transactions you did and im curious to see these sevenfigure transactions were walltowall ringcentral implementations or are you testing the waters with some kind of deployment and if that goes well youre surely positioned to win repeat business and therefore trying to understand how much more penetration do you have left in your sevenfigure accounts thats it for me thank you david sipes yes thanks kash this is david and thanks for the recognition on the sevenfigure deals and it shows kind of consistent and increasing performance two quarters in a row now in  so we get  well get some of those deals will be the entire organization but as we continue to penetrate into the very largest organization some of those deals are just a starting point even though theyre initially contracted for a very large amount and i think when you look at our amount of new business that were getting from our installed base is at  which is a very healthy and slightly increasing number over time so this opportunity will continue to develop and to grow as we take examples like hyatt where our initial sale is into headquarters its obviously a much larger global organization beyond that so theres going to be many many more opportunities for expansion within some of these enterprise accounts operator id like to hand the call back over to management for closing comments vladimir shmunis well id like to startoff by again thanking clyde for his outstanding contribution he was the cfo that took us public under clydes leadership i believe weve compiled a perfect record of beating and raising every quarter and honestly we probably will not have been here without clyde having said that he is less so far his contribution he has been in providing outstanding mentorship and training for mitesh so i feel very very comfortable that we will have a seamless transition which is especially important for us as we are closing in on our  billion revenue target and are now beginning to think of life beyond  billion so with that we feel good where we stand competitively we had a very good quarter we feel good about quarters to come weve done our best to highlight some of the seasonal effects that may take place but generally we feel were on solid ground now its great to now be recognized by the investor community a little bit better than we used to be and we hope for a lot more together so thank you very much and thanks for wonderful and supportive questions operator ladies

webcast replay of todays call and to learn more about ringcentral with that let me turn the call over to vlad vladimir shmunis thank you darren the first quarter was a great start to  for ringcentral we delivered strong top line growth combined with continued margin expansion average arr or ringcentral office grew  yearoveryear ringcentral office is about a  million recurrence revenue business and represents over  of our net new business underpinning the growth of office were key three drivers first were successfully executing indiscernible market second we had the strongest quarter in our indirect channel and third we are beginning to see initiation traction in multinational enterprises with our global office division the cloud communications market has reached strategic point after several years of the gradual shift to the cloud we believe the debate between on premise and cloud is finally over with the evidence that the balance first steps to the ground onprem is finally acknowledging the shift they are trying to give it their business model to accommodate the crowd as the event begins to talk more about cloud it is of interest that derives confidence continues to ride likely the competitors can talk about the future that is two to three years away ringcentral is already here with the platform that is market rating and focused with no direction in our midmarket its hit an inflexion point for ringcentral since last year with title stand coming up meaningfully for the first two quarters our midmarket roi has exceeded that of more business in order words it now is more cost efficient for us long term to acquire a customer with over  employees than as in the past this is a momentum and will expect till april with our enterprise account down the line on the interest side our adaptic to the new business model but every cloud solution is will hold it this validates the specific point that i mentioned earlier which is an outstanding quarter with us generating significant new business in q the overall total addressable markets remained confused under penetrated gartner estimates that close to a  billion was spent on onpremise based telephony over the last four years onpremise solutions primarily were indiscernible the stamp where the market is much larger it includes other areas of the specification including messaging collaboration contact center and vva and other capability additionally our unique open platform enabled integration to custom workload and other best of this offer under this by our unwavering commitment to technology leadership the other three main growth drivers does not change these are one expenses of market two international reach and three strong execution with our channel partner in the first quarter we are continuing to see good progress in all of these areas the progress are marked as i mentioned expansion of markets continue to show great progress in q in the fiscal first due to market segments the successful expansion into large enterprises has driven annual revenue price well over  this segment now account for about  of ringcentral office bookings up from about  last year also i am proud to announce that we have now doubled customer with over seven figured contemplated all this has combined led to arr growth for this segment to be over  yearoveryear for the eighth consecutive quarter and this on a much large base roi for customers with  employees is a best across all our direct selling sector this is one industry will continue expanding up margin resulting in high quality revenue with attractive return this also gives us extra confidence in our enterprise segment namely with customers with over  computer we believe this segment will follow a similar path and we are positioning ourselves to continue in q our sales team had its best ever quarter thus introducing this concept for example europe as you know we will now be expanding our footprint there to include our global office feasibility as well as our competitor the install base continues to grow and provide an insulated more predictable ready to grow more than start of the group gain from existing customer we expect the land and expand opportunities to continue to increase as we install the upmarket adoptions we also continue to expand longer term contract greater than twothirds of net new office bookings potential customers opting for annual or multiyear agreement as a result more than half of our office install base is now under contract second expanding our international region during q we announced an expanded international footprint with our global office product this is a very important growth driver and key differentiator in the enterprise segment connecting multiple onpremise legacy system compounded by multiple geographies is very complex and expensive this also result in full user and administrator experience results of global office stop this pain point it provides indiscernible and local incountry experience while being globally connected together on a single cloud communication provider this sculptor give good momentum with the boot into multinational enterprises in the short period of just three months installing out our global office project overriding that by hundred multinational companies on global office one such example is that a leading provider of enterpriseready build the platform total works looking for the solution quickly extend its present in different geographies while not overburdening the it staff we won the deal by providing very abroad a local user experience while being globally connected together in addition we also displaced their existing competent provider with our cloud solution that is closely integrated with indiscernible similarly we recently won a  user deployment with arc document solutions arc is a global technology company focused on document and information management with over  locations around the world arc was looking for a single reliable global solution to cover their needs the third key growth driver i referred was our strong partner relationship with indirect channel that includes carriers and parts leveraging partners to provide more feasibility that indirect channel contributed approximately  of earnings in q up from  year ago with ata bt and telus we remain the only pureplay saas business communications company with multiple major carriers reselling our solution in the third quarter we continue to expand this out from our carrier partner in spite of q being typically a seasonally slow carriers we see a sequential increase in our carrier business it was a great start to the year one example of the win with the carrier partner was the  user customer this customer is a reseller of communications and service across all application the key to this win was our unique multicenter solution to intense their employee presence indiscernible a great booking quarter as well as our partners adapt the customers request to move to the cloud in fact several of the business deals came from one party for example one of the well partners worked without order indiscernible to deliver a more than  user wins with the avaya ph company avaya ph is a world class franchise restaurant operator with over  venture ringcentral is a place of their multiple legacy cdf quality of service and attempts to implement were key factors in the win ringcentral growth of the occasion by signing and deploying over the units within the quarter in addition avaya channel partner closed a  set deal at the avaya ph a multinational company spread around the world into the holding company where franchises such as indiscernible the avaya ph group is utilizing global office to software need aboard in the uk and germany on the technology front we continue to innovate at a rapid pace ringcentral has the first mover advantage as a dual play cloud solution to capture the size and sifts in communications and in collaboration to the cloud indiscernible has remained solidly the largest and fastest growing provider in the space we have consistently invested for  of revenue both into rd to maintain and accelerate rd we believe a focus on rapid innovation has been and will continue to be a significant differentiator to develop growth the cycle is measured in weeks not months or years we are well ahead of the competition in terms of investment innovation possible integration and product portfolio we are able to do this because the combined gotomarket up and core technology are all under one role it drives faster deployment and deployment cycle and spend for better customer satisfaction overall this is a big advantage even relative to the needs of the customer when compared to legacy onpremise capital solutions to that end were making good progress in our quest to tightly integrate diversification and collaboration in the cloud we recently unveiled a new capability that enables you to specifically transition from a glip messaging to a voice with a simple click of a button this is indiscernible to integration of the enterprise cloud visibility with an initiative evaluation tool this will create a more streamline and convenient experience for all our users for the  user arc document solutions i mentioned earlier all glip enterprise messaging an collaboration capability were a key differentiator in winning the deal with a slight refund in q we also continued to open platform with closer integration last quarter we achieved a significant milestone of over  million sales price api requests per day through the platform up  sequentially additionally we saw more than  stores for integration in the quarter raising the total to over  this integration provides the definitive benefit for our customer while creating further growth for ringcentral in q one example of which was driven by ringcentral connect platform visibility   user customer as one of the major largest major electric company the seamless integration with google was critical for this business integration is a new vertical are also part of our enterprise drill strategy to create an abundant solution for our customer however power integration with indiscernible is a selfstarted vertical now the patients automatically enables medical officer workers to see this a  degrees view of a patients medical and insurance profile were now working on a similar integration of the insurance industry at medical indiscernible detained a customer of potential of last year with over  user expanding this customer relationship with an integrated partnership is in our ecosystem expansion strategy this gives us a vertical integration for yet another differentiator for extensive office to extend our margin our clause comp extensor offering seems to unlock meaningful new facilities for restructure in q we want profit sensor users at the holding it is one of the largest independent honor of absolute authority to disseminate our ability to provide one solution for communications series was key to this win our extended product portfolio with the recent cloud comp extensive offering is also increasing our extent these are all the growth of multi channels in beverages we could not provide to the customer this has allowed us to close out of the install base and to the extend our deployment in other areas however that market is playing out as we set multiple vendors of growth alongside this huge opportunity created by business communications suggestive of the cloud puts us in a great position we are well ahead of communications in terms of investments in innovation partnerships and integration the cloud communication market traditionally is early stages we are still in very earnings inning with the long run rate attached we could more than double the size of the company in the last few years and still be well under  share of the overall market these are early innings indeed as the best is yet to come and with that ill now turn the call over to clyde clyde hosein thank you vlad and good afternoon everyone before i begin i want to ask that you refer to the slide deck on our investor relations website which will help summarize the key points in our call today as well as provide some supplemental information q was a great start to the year highlighted by another quarter of over  subscription revenue growth record software subscription gross margins of  and a third consecutive quarter of positive nongaap operating margin relative to our guidance we once again met or exceeded the high end of our outlook for revenue growth in operating margin and eps total annualized exit monthly recurring subscriptions or arr grew to approximately  million up  yearoveryear and  sequentially the arr for ringcentral office grew to approximately  million up  yearoveryear and  sequentially customer satisfaction continued to be strong in q with overall net monthly subscription dollar retention over  office net monthly subscription dollar retention was once again over  as it is common for customers to adopt ringcentral office in part of the organization and increase their footprint over time our software subscription revenue was  million up  yearoveryear and  sequentially this was driven by a strong performance in office especially up market along with a very strong quarter in our indirect channel total revenue for the first quarter was  million this was above our guidance of  million to  million compared to the midpoint of guidance this was an over achievement of  million i would note that this  million over achievement includes about  million as a result of the transitions to the new agency model for our phone fulfillment as we were conservative in our initial forecast given this was the first quarter of implementation for the new model as a reminder in the first quarter of  we began to transition direct phone sales to an agency model where phones are sold to our customers by a third party distributor under the new agency model ringcentral received the commission for phone sales instead of recognizing the full sale price in order to provide transparency to investors we have provided supplemental information on a pro forma basis to provide a clear comparison of the companys result with prior periods under the new agency model the pro forma information reflects the result as if the company had fully transitioned to the new agency model for the first quarter of  and for all periods in  this supplemental information is provided in todays press release and on our ir website adjusting for the new agency model on a comparable basis by removing the  million additional revenue from the transition i mentioned earlier pro forma total revenue was  million and grew  yearoveryear this was up from  million in the first quarter of  there is no change to software subscription revenues under this model before i move further down the income statement i want to remind you that my commentary will be focused on pro forma results and guidance a reconciliation of all gaap to pro forma results is provided with our earnings press release issued earlier today and in the slide deck on our ir website our software subscription gross margin was a record  in q this represents a  basis points improvement yearoveryear on a  basis points improvement sequentially our continued margin expansion further demonstrates the leverage from our multitenant saas model this  gross margin achievement places us amongst the bestinclass saas pro forma gross margin from our other revenue line was  in the quarter other revenue includes commission under the agency model professional services and revenues from phone rental pro forma total gross margin was  sales and marketing expenses were about  million for the quarter or  of revenues this was up from  last quarter and down from  in the first quarter a year ago as we continued to invest in growth given our model attractive unit economics as vlad noted we have seen midmarket sales and marketers rois surpass those of the small business sector you may recall that we discussed investing into the midmarket ahead of the curve and we are started to see that pay off these efficiencies give us the capability to further invest in the midmarket and enterprise market segment which should result in higher quality and stickier revenue to the company as a testament to our business model combined with the efficiencies i mentioned above we continued to see attractive unit economics with each dollar invested in sales and marketing contributed  of revenue and  of contribution margin over the projected life of an office consumer rd expenses were  million in the first quarter or  of revenues down from about  last quarter and q a year ago ga expenses were about  million in q or  of revenues up a point from  last quarter and down from  we reported in the first quarter of  we had an operating profit of about  million from an operating margin of  which is above our guidance of breakeven to  this is an improvement of nine points from the first quarter a year ago and about  point from last quarter net income improved to  million compared to a net loss of  million in q of last year and  million profit last quarter net income per share was  at the high end of our q guidance range of breakeven plus or minus  per share share count was  million fully diluted shares on a gaap basis our q net loss was  million or a loss of  per share the difference between our gaap and pro forma results includes  million or  per share of that amount  per share was in stockbased compensation from the combination of amortization of intangibles and other items related to the glip acquisition and from currency measurement of our balance sheet all of which we excluded from our pro forma results we ended q with cash and short term investment of  million compared to  million at the end of q deferred revenue was million as of december  an increase of  sequentially and yearoveryear deferred revenue grew faster than revenue yearoveryear due primarily to the addition of larger customers who are more receptive to annual invoices  for the quarter cash flow from operations was positive  million compared to negative  in q of last year and positive  million in last quarter this is the fourth consecutive quarter of positive operated cash flow result moving to our outlook for the second quarter and full year  we have historically provided guidance to total revenue today we will also be providing guidance to subscription revenue for additional clarity for the second quarter we expect software subscription revenues of  million to  million or growth of about  to  yearoveryear we expect total revenue of  million to  million which are the pro forma basis would imply yearoveryear of  to  we expect nongaap operated margin of  to  this should lead to a nongaap earnings per share of breakeven to two penny based on  million weighted average fully diluted share for the full year  we are raising our software subscription revenue guidance to  million to  million or growth of  to  and up from our previous guidance of  million to  million we are raising our total revenue guidance to  million to  million up from our previous guidance of  million to  million on a pro forma basis this would imply a yearoveryear growth of  to  we are also within our outlook for pro forma operating margin to a range of  to  up from  to  we provided last quarter this should lead to pro forma earnings per share of  to  up from  to  previously we expect weighted average fully diluted shares to be  million in summary we started  with great momentum across multiple growth factors which bodes well for our future success throughout the year we are going after a huge under penetrated market opportunity we believe our first mover advantage in investment and innovation channel partners and expanding our adjustable market will continue to differentiate ringcentral as the industry leader with that ill turn the call over to the operator for qa questionandanswer session

nice guidance vlad despite youre obviously being a little unwell i hope you feel better just a dive into questions the bigger question i think that investors are wrestling with is around your relationship with att and sort of the concerns of the rollout sort of a what could be viewed as a potential competitive offering we would love just to get an update on how the relationship is progressing and sort of how you view what might play out there over time and i have a follow after that thank you vladimir shmunis sure bhavan so yeah vlad ill take this one okay so firstly yes im a little bit disappointed with the weather unfortunately also indiscernible and it had a very full day of meetings yet but is for good cause but i think ill be fine look as far as the att i think it is same answer it would be fine att has been a longterm value jumbo partner of ours we have coexisted with other service providers and other vendors within the att ecosystem weve completed within and survived within the environment very effectively to be clear our relationship with att actually coincides that of most of the other service providers in this area and there continued to be still big with reasons to continue thinking that this is a healthy relationship were still in a need in their portfolio their own pronouncement lately have indicated that the fact that they will continue offering the best solution for use case so were pretty optimistic as this relationship will continue and will continue keep growing bhavan suri great thats really helpful and then one quick follow up if i may you talked about sort of the value again moving up market weve obviously seen that in terms of the deferred the billing just a quick question on investment do you think it’s going to need you know you shipped the sales force and you added sort of a midmarket enterprise sale force do you need to continue increase estimate as you move up midmarket or do you think that at least for this year you got those investments build into you guidance and numbers to continue allowing penetrating up market vladimir shmunis yes so let me take the first bit so first related to dataclear yes that were a growing company and you can see our growth it speaks for itself of course were planning to continue our interment but every investment that were planning to do is of course built into the guidance so no of course we will not be projecting a negative trend and as you know this has not been our history from day one with indiscernible a further conservative indiscernible now with respect to midmarket in particular its actually a very interesting point and i just resorted in my prepared comments but i want to reiterate it is really a momentous occasion for us that now our midmarket roi is actually better than that of what we get with molded so what this really means and this used to be not be the case because it was a more than double for us so as we were scaling up since were not as efficient but we are now finally in a situation to where it is actually on roi basis made better business sense for us to invest midmarket than even in the smaller businesses where we started stronger a number of years ago so yes well continue this investment very focused given this revenue we are extremely optimistic and we actually have a very solid base at indiscernible at this point that this success should also transfer over into enterprise account and would define midmarket as absolute and enterprise as indiscernible so we will continue the investment continue growth and we are confident to continue the growth in roi and clyde anything you want to this clyde hosein no vlad i think you covered it the key is in midmarket just to reiterate the efficiency that we see in which makes it a lot more easy and more efficient to grow revenues in that midmarket so i think you did a great job operator our next question comes from the line of terry tillman with raymond james please proceed with your question terry tillman hi gentlemen can you hear me okay vladimir shmunis yes terry tillman okay hi indiscernible i like indiscernible first off great numbers the first question is the broader competitive question in terms of the classic characters you see in the smb market or the small business market midmarket enterprise are you seeing any changes in terms of who youre seeing and could you remind us until one comment vlad on how or why we win across those segments vladimir shmunis sure so let me take you through that so why do we win we win because we still have a better product better usable product we continue meaningfully out basic over our competition investment in rd we own our own platform we are not a reseller of any indiscernible as some of our competitors are and very importantly we invest very heavily into user experience both visàvis the product itself but also in the entire provisioning on board and life cycle management so frankly you get what you pay for and were very very heard about valuating the best possible product in this category and i think as always we have thirdparty validation in that the absolute magic quadrant leader will get an opportunity this year so this is far as why we win and by the way we continue this investment and yes they are also baked into the guidance and we believe that we are well poised to continue this record of outperformance and excellent technology clyde hosein look as far as the competitors that we see we see larger companies cisco and microsoft waiting their chance and saying they also want to be in cloud communication uk segment and that just means that there is finally broad market acceptance and from that should make that job easier we no longer need to condemn the government that cloud is a viable solution for communication for business to obtaining guidance of course larger companies are also a bit conservative but frankly what we did and what you hear from gartner as we seal the deal we do this to curb a sizable advantage that measures the entire year both cisco and microsoft and while were talking a good game we play a good game so were comfortable with that terry tillman and my followup that relates to its good to see the milestones turn around the upmarket business could you remind us you obviously had the denver operations and im assuming you continue to invest the mass and how is the seller operating going until we expect regional sale of offices in  or is it going to be more of our prepaying the fence beneath those offices thank you clyde hosein so we probably see more of a deepening debate but understand the location that youve mentioned which is denver and charlotte in the course dont forget they are exworkers in vermont its in gabelli this is our major centers but we do have people throughout and we are effectively covering the entire focus of the united states having said this look charlotte is our nearest office but typically wellestablished playbook so we know how to onboard people how to get them to be productive and its all executive same time as we in the connectively its still the same company operator our next question comes from the line of nikolay beliov from bank of america please proceed with your question nikolay beliov okay thanks for taking my questions and adding my congratulations on the great quarter and the guidance a quite a hit question for you and just point in the ipo you provided a longterm guidance of subscription but having your gross margins of  to  you hit  in q and you provided longterm gross margin guidance of  to  you hit  in q which is above the highend of the longterm guide you already there i mean at this point service tax goes to max to level off or there is more room for improvement here going forward and how that out performance on the gross margin line might impact your overall ebit goal of  to  in the longterm clyde hosein thank you nikola so as a company the team has done a traffic job in executing we have a terrific team from sales all the way down to operations that got us to  on our subscription gross margin couple of years out after the ipo so a big shoutout to all of them and i think it demonstrates the quality of the product and the acceptance of customers i think its still a little early we just hit it to look at the extended ranges that might be something for the future as you know earlier we shifted a model and that shifted a model by direct phone sales is going to help margins thats what you saw on the total gross margin improving so we will go and implement that and without right now today change in that as to the bottom line one of things mike mentioned earlier is a couple of things that we account for you its still a very large market under penetrated we are wining very well in that space but consistent with saas model requires a fund investment in product and sales and marketing and we intend to continue to do that while generating  plus of revenue growth so our bottom line is improving i think this is third consecutive quarter of improvement obviously not close to our target yet but the target is much further long and it probably doesnt reflect  growth so for now in summary were very comfortable where we are i think you might see some modest improvement on total gross margin and we will continue to have that in other market and products that continue to drive the top line nikolay beliov thank you operator our next question comes from the line of mike latimore from northland capital market please proceed with your question mike latimore yeah great thanks a lot so in this year’s first quarter you saw you had positive ar growth which was about the same as in the prior quarter whereas in the last year you saw a little bit of slowdown in the first quarter so is it fair to see kind of the indirect channel in the midmarket are keeping the growth rate a little bit more sustainable clyde hosein well we had a good quarter on indirect i think vlad mentioned there is a very good probably a record – it was a record quarter for indirect particularly it was and weve invested in that area mike as you know for quite a while that combined with the inflection in the midmarket is beginning to yield good returns for us so not surprises i would caution you guys not to get too hung up about absolute yearoveryear there will still be some volatility in those yearoveryear bookings change but as we still as the market is still emerging and then were mixing it to go to latter customers hopefully youll start seeing more and more  plus customers so i wouldnt get too hung up at any given quarter but youre right we had a very good first quarter partly driven by some of the other growth vectors we have in indirect in general and did particular did well for us mike latimore and vlad you mentioned cisco and microsoft racing ahead i guess clearly you had a very strong first quarter but i mean just qualitatively are you seeing customers take a little bit longer time here to evaluate those options now or no real changes in sales cycle vladimir shmunis actually as mentioned is we see a sales start cycle in the midmarket actually contracted a little bit and that it will truly lead to better our roi our overall i think that one of the dynamics that youre seeing is that firstly the customers know you no longer need to be convinced of the fact that cloud is the solution of choice so definitely we see a different point there we just mentioned that we now have several customers with  million commitment on our books that would not be the case up indiscernible and what we see is customers now saying okay well you know what we are going to do with cloud anyway who is the business leader who is the segment leader and i dont know whatever due diligence they do but the fact remains neither cisco nor microsoft today have a true cloud offering that would elicit growth to what we have shortcoming in ciscos offering is really stung together and microsoft seems to be a couple of years behind of features so it has been helpful for us for this giant to acknowledge that cloud is the way to go operator our next question comes from the line of john difucci with jeffries please proceed with your question john difucci thank you thanks for taking my question vlad and clyde i would somewhat come back to your question you asked and listen your results and your guide sort of speak for themselves you obviously see a lot of traction in the market and all the data and the indiscernible we points to the secular move that youre talking about in those businesses in the cloud based solutions in this market but with att and we talked to investors about this all the time in indiscernible and im sure you should have probably talked about this the last month it is about a month ago so that it was now the material part of your revenue and thats why there is such a focus here and i just it took me that has not been that long ago this was announced but have you seen any change in your business coming in through att and you had enough time now to speak talk att about it how do you think this is going to move going forward i realize you have a lot of other partnerships through and they can make up four times especially if there a second move but just to get a better feel for us and as we think about this going forward how do you think – have you seen any changes in that relationship as far as the business coming from it and do you anticipate that happening going forward clyde hosein yes hi clyde again so look short answer is no we continue getting very strong performance and monthly amount of numbers the pigment itself as i mentioned were very optimistic that the strength of our product would continue carrying the date and of course its good that att with  of our revenues and we have mainly other channels and theyve large user base of our own but were by no means should we get the doubt on att and as a matter of fact as far as what we see on the ground today is on the track and really what i really urge you and my overall concern for this is that resort to their own announcement of some of their new products which were very excellent in the position that they think that they will continue dealing and offering multiple platform and what we can offer is a level playing field we know that our product technology and gotomarket will carry the basis there john difucci thats great vlad thank you very much its very clear and if i could my followup probably a question for clyde its nice to see the runrate profitability clyde its also nice to see that you guys are doing what youre saying youre going to do consistently here in this regard in this case still i dont think it was mentioned but your free cash flow positive in this quarter two so its really nice to see but assuming this growth opportunity continues here and it almost feels like now especially given some of what were seeing out there in some of what you talked about and vlad about in the prepared remarks that the woods are ready now does it make sense for you to potentially increase your investment in your gotomarket efforts at this point obviously that could have an effect on margins it doesnt – but if youre growing you could still profit and how do you think about that given the opportunity today clyde hosein yeah john thanks you very much the company has done and the team has done a great job the – you mentioned free cash flow positive we were last quarter minimally well over  million bucks but let me add to that as we are going to invest thats clearly within the management team to keep investing so well continue that we agree with all of the points that the market is ready the market inflexion point you could use that for several quarters thats there the adoption rate is increasing so why not increase investments well do it in a very intelligent way as we have in the past but we will increase our investment in that space so just speaking back about cash flows to make that point we really didnt highlight this as much next quarter more likely than that youll see us making some capex investment to expand our footprint globally to increase our presence in some other countries we dont participate in the geographies we dont participate today and so thats one quarter that so you might see a negative but i think consistent free cash flow basis is in our neartomedium term future so the point is that as continue to invest both in sales and marketing and product and in capex to take advantage of the inflexion point that we have so while top line would grow continue to grow and grow healthy the inherent saas model where youve got to invest upfront for sales and marketing and you get your return over a period of time will tamper down the rate and pace of increase of your margin improvement but you will see that increase now that basis our guidance so guidance is a full guidance with revenue and profit so there is no additional risk involved in there but the short answer is we are going to build on the success we had were going to keep investing were going to keep investing as we have in the past intelligently and delivering results to you the investment community as we have in the past vladimir shmunis indiscernible john is everything every investment we will continue to invest in aggressively but to the best of our knowledge and ability every land investment have been indiscernible basis operator our next question comes from the line of heather bellini of goldman sachs please proceed with your question unidentified analyst hi this is jack again im filling in for bellini just a couple of question one on the international expansion so it looks global office the global office product is being rolled out and its like more than  countries i assume versus just ability in  today i guess what are the hurdle involved there i know you talked about the capex investment so is there any other sort of i guess any other barriers on that secondly what do you assume with that uptick for that product so far vladimir shmunis okay yes hi so couple of things so firstly as were rolling out global office is today already available well over  but its actually most of macro account because there are much larger accounts you know and much stronger one we cover some of the major ones already of course europe uk germany france some of the larger economy in the western hemisphere already covered and just deliver where we get demand clyde hosein as far as capex is concerned i also wanted to be very carefully here we have the infrastructure in place already open up for to cover both north america as well as both western europe okay so it really is more of a matter of rolling out a product across those geographies which have a lot to do with abide barrier local regulation legal requirement domestic to get the appropriate licenses to operate frankly none of this is rocket science but it just takes time and procedure and were very very comfortable with our international expansion roadmap and again just to reduce you know numbers itself three months over a  global enterprises using ringcentral global accomplishment again most account operator our next question comes from the line of brian schwartz with oppenheimer and company please proceed with your question daniel greenfield hi guys this is daniel greenfield dialing in for brian congrats on the quarter just one question from me surrounding the contact center actually how did the contact center and i understand its relatively new how that help you grow this quarter and are beginning to actually comment any deals were you actually start with the contact center or are you participating in a lot of rfps where the customers asking for both contact center and pbx replacement thanks vladimir shmunis yes we look we should never position our growth contact center and a standalone solution even though if we do just fine at that level but really the value is very close integration it went uk and grow at contact center and thats where we sell so the way that we look at it is selling this product does really two things so firstly its on luck new opportunities for us where customers essentially they want to have a single vendor single bill and you know single sort of a joke and we are now heading both under one roof satisfied and the second of course is contact center pricing is generally higher than that for uk is and that does have a positive effect on our part okay as well as you know indiscernible so its a very important indiscernible daniel greenfield great thanks operator our next question comes from the line of sterling auty from jp morgan please proceed with your question sterling auty yeah thanks hi guys just one question in your prepared remarks you gave a lot of examples of technology customers just wondering if in the new customers you brought on the quarter was there industry concentration for technology or any other one or two industries vladimir shmunis yes sure go ahead clyde hosein so the short answer is technology we had some very good successes primarily because they are early adopters but we have many examples of successes outside of the tech industry early we announced we had an announcement early this quarter with an engineering company obviously not in the tech space that deployed a very large deployment as an example there are more examples out there our press release of this we have retail a number of phones restaurants pizza hut for example a franchise deployed out of the east coast so the deployment is not industry specific its very broad as you would expect it to be maybe there is a flight as the technology company that may be earlier adopted but thats di minimus i think this has been adopted of course all industries sterling auty thank you operator our next question comes from the line of jonathan kees from summit research please proceed with your question jonathan kees great thanks for taking my question and i will add congrats for the quarter just wanted to talk about your indirect revenues obviously there is a lot of questions in terms of att just wondering if you can provide some more elaboration in terms of other two carriers att being obviously  customer and being a good part of that indirect revenues but your expectations of at least with bt is not with telus to become in the near future some of course being a  customer certainly you have mentioned in the past that the growth rate has been better than the att has they performed in the past just some additional color on that and i also have additional question follow question thanks clyde hosein sure let me take that so of course we would like you know every such really expect to become  customer but i want to caution that it took att over five years to get there and att is a larger company that it doesnt represent the bt product mix so its a matter of time and really want to since you paint everyone were a pureplay cloud service provider and what that means is that while growth can be fairly rapid but we can get trained buy the seats buy them up so it takes some time to build to really meaningful revenue base but the good news is that once you do it should keep your churn under control and our churn as you know our netsure continues to be in that – we continue to seek more revenue from customer cohort yearoveryear so as long as that track continues we will you know we feel very good about double strategy and exit those channels but really its going to be some time it also of course dont forget that we were investing quite heavily on indirect side as well and we never want to move that because with that that put us in control of our destiny it allows us you know really the most secure way of controlling delighting our customers and so keep your horse riding you know but hopefully we will continue growing very strongly across all our channels and also as i had mentioned not just direct and carrier or service provider but also some additional parts which have been doing very very well for us jonathan kees okay great and if i can ask by those horse it’s still far on the indirect area i guess ex carriers thats a smaller part of the indirect revenues you recently added a new chief for that division and looking to expand your partnerships there and master agents i guess i wanted to see what if you can elaborate more in terms of what youre looking to do there there are lot of companies out there that added and increased parts and its still not gotten the traction that they had hoped for i guess i wondered what youre doing hopefully what youre doing differently clyde hosein well so you know as i just mentioned well we havent yet broken our general numbers publicly but just to reiterate we are seeing very good performance from the general as you know were seeing healthy growth in our overall business were seeing very healthy growth in the metro site reported for retention orders and that is approximately what  million they went to  million business so things are well having said that well are doing even better than in terms of average as far as well other companies are investing in this general about the market general i think the result look i can only keep ourselves with them to balance our investment in the product and technology with our investment in the general and we strongly believe that even above and potential we see people do is over invest is the a general as it central to product and product needs to carry it off to so we think that as long as we continue believing the categories and technologies and as long as we continue our focus and our investment and hire the best people out there that we can find and we can find very good people given our performance lately we should be fine again were very very excited about our indirect channel and within that specific reward operator our next question comes from the line of james faucette with morgan stanley please proceed with your question unidentified analyst hi this is eugene anderson ph on for james thanks for taking my question just a little bit more on the gross margin outperformance asides from the change to the phone model are there any other drivers that you could perhaps shed some more color on perhaps youre seeing better pricing or may be a lower transport cost thank you very much vladimir shmunis if you look at the subscription margin which is totally independent to the model that also improved almost  points quarteroverquarter and i think  points yearoveryear so thats the true value of our software subscription of having a multitenant model youre seeing leverage in there but as we get bigger we get better economies of scale particularly like on transport cost for example so there is a fair amount of on the cost side on the other side the cost as weve described in previous calls our churn has been improving last time we reported about  yearoveryear each of the last two years that also helps and then as we move up to larger customers youre getting a lot more that contributes to the same thing that achieving longterm a lot more stickiness underline so all of those contributed what eventually was last quarter  subscription margin on subscription so it is just a business model the fundamental software is generating a significant amount of gross margin unidentified analyst thanks so much vladimir shmunis thank you operator our next question comes from the line of kash rangan from boa merrill lynch please proceed with your question kash rangan hey guys can you hear me okay vladimir shmunis yeah clyde hosein yes youre fine kash rangan okay wonderful thanks so much some had to hit me over the head to remind that you actually you guys have seven figure so talk a little bit more about the seven figure deals what is – my rough math suggests thats about  users for at least per seven figure customer how do we get to this point and how were you able to convince these customers that you are for real in the enterprise business to role i mean are we potentially looking at a good chunk of the fortune  equity  using ringcentral over the next few years because i think this is an important landmark and secondly i know that we all like to study microsoft and we wouldnt like to dismiss microsoft they have this package in e which includes the skype functionality coupled with office all delivered as a cloudbased service previously you had to install a server and i know that several of your management team members had been at other companies that compete with microsoft how are you viewing microsoft and how i understand that your technology is two years ahead of microsoft but lets say we were two years down the line what is ringcentral going to look like that can give us a confidence that you have a game plan to continue to stay abreast of microsoft maybe you have to find a new market segment or is there something else going on in your mind just want to get your thoughts thank you vladimir shmunis yes thank you kash obviously were trying to give more that we have as far as seven figure deals so yes its very very exciting and look if really another testament to the fact of ucaf except being at the setting points across the board and in particular with larger customers with multiple users that they need to satisfy so with this is on record i believe it is our ipo and every color we had thank that we dont see a glass ceiling out there and on the road show kash as you may remember we were getting equations like well are you guys going to we will get a  seat customer or a  seat customer which is just question anymore and im asking this that we will eventually be announcing a  seat customer and probably it will be beyond that and i just want to reiterate one more point that even though for in this quarter for some time with the social about our growth growth up market customers as seen over difficulties but in reality the average account for those customers is well over  so we are absolutely wealthy too debt market and as you stay by doubledigit indicator this seven figure deal we are now containing service stages of penetrating to enterprise down to the employees and penetrate a lot of the success is again in our absolute commitment to technology innovation and application of excellence and in particular the fact that our global audit we will people have been already in fact that are global audit product is just short three months and over accounted more multinational usage is this will go to show just how much had to size there is out there again the numbers the new numbers that our overall market penetration not just us but for the entire new customer would be centered in single digit though established legacy for it and writing is on the wall you cant grow it will take over we are leading in the segment and we expect to continue this leadership we exactly do the second phase integration okay so what about microsoft of course notably whatever do this quarter a very strong company with a very strong channel but over and over people are well focused wellfunded and i really aim at interesting on a particular strategy in a particular field over and over those people have been able to set up and as you know we got quite a few goals from capex that did extremely well when microsoft bought a direct competitor of the of course you other example you have people like indiscernible you know or about  of that market is basically supporting microsoft about the field and look its a very large market so we usually dont see anybody monopolizing it even microsoft and there is a quite a roadmap that we have a better part and we know to execute we believe we will be able to give up and continue delivering better value better functionality better customer service and continually get paid you know the old fashion way operator there are no further questions in the queue at this time this does conclude todays teleconference
