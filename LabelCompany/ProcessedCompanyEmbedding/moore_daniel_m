arkadelphia arkansas her father managed the local cinema where each of her four siblings had a role to play beth’s job was to hand out samples of popcorn and soda growing up in the theater had its perks sometimes beth would be allowed to slip into a movie and take with her a pickle bag full of popcorn and a dixie cup of coke there in a theater chair wideeyed and filled to the brim with cocacola beth began a lifelong love for stories she loved to tell them write them and be told them the story that captured her heart and consumed her life however was not told in a movie theater it was the story told in sunday school of jesus a savior who loved children and who thought she was special a seed was planted in her young heart that would grow to mark her life with a passionate love for christ at the age of  beth sensed god calling her to work for him although she couldn’t imagine what that would mean she made it her goal to say yes to whatever he asked beth graduated from southwest texas state university with a degree in political science she would later receive an honorary doctorate in humanities from howard payne university she married keith in  and soon after the lord added amanda and melissa to the family as a young wife and mother beth served the lord by speaking at luncheons and retreats working at mother’s day out and teaching christian aerobics a love for the word of god was embedded in beth’s life when she took a bible doctrine class at her church her teacher was buddy walters a former college football player who taught the scriptures with tears streaming down his cheeks she fervently prayed for such a passion for god’s word it was buddy who first taught beth along with keith how to study the bible beth founded living proof ministries in  with the purpose
