chronic disease epidemic in this country is staggering it demands innovative scalable models for early detection using objective data to proactively and objectively baseline and chronicle progression” maureen peszko trevia’s president stated “this is about preventing limb loss and helping millions of americans maintain a quality lifestyle – especially for those at risk for diabetic complications a recent study in the journal of the american medical association demonstrated that chronic disease accounts for  percent of us health care costs making accessibility of this innovative and simple diagnostics tool not only a clinical imperative but an economic one trevia enables neuropathy screening using the portable prosenex device and delivering lifetime progression evaluation data for
