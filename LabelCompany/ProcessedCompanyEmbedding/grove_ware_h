to navigation search a grooved ware shard from the excavation of the durrington wall site the building settlement associated with stonehenge grooved ware is the name given to a pottery style of the british neolithic its manufacturers are sometimes known as the grooved ware people unlike the later beaker ware grooved culture was not an import from the continent but seems to have developed in orkney early in the rd millennium bc and was soon adopted in britain and ireland the diagnostic shape for the style is a flatbottomed pot with straight sides sloping outwards and grooved decoration around the top beyond this the pottery comes in many varieties some with complex geometric decorations others with applique bands added the latter has led some archaeologists to argue that the style is a skeuomorph and is derived from wicker basketry grooved ware pots excavated at balfarg in fife have been chemically analysed to determine their contents it appears that some of the vessels there may have been used to hold black henbane hyoscyamus niger which is a poison and a powerful hallucinogen since many grooved ware pots have been found at henge sites and in burials it is possible that they may have had a ritual purpose as well as a functional one grooved ware comes in many sizes some vessels are extremely large c  gallons and would be suitable for fermentation the majority are smaller ranging from jug to cupsize and could be used for serving and drinking the theory that the first british farmers c  bc had the knowledge and ability to make ale from their crops with their pottery appears to be controversial and not yet widely discussed by the archaeological community the earliest examples have been found in orkney and may have evolved from earlier unstan ware bowls the recent excavations at nearby ness of brodgar have revealed many sherds of finely decorated grooved ware pottery some of it representing very large pots a large number of drinking vessels have also been identified the style soon spread and it was used by the builders of the first phase of stonehenge grooved ware pottery has been found in abundance in recent excavations at durrington walls and marden henge in wiltshire here the feasting would have involved drinking ale and eating pork smaller quantities of grooved ware have been found at the nearby site of figsbury ring grooved ware was previously referred to as rinyoclacton ware first identified by stuart piggott in the s and named after sites where it was found rinyo is a neolithic settlement on the island of rousay orkney the site at clacton now lies under the sea one way the tradition may have spread is through trade routes up the west coast of britain what seems unusual is that although they shared the same style of pottery different regions still maintained vastly different traditions evidence at some early henges mayburgh henge ring of brodgar arbor low suggests that there were staging and trading points on a national motorway during the neolithic and bronze age this evidence perhaps explains how cumbrian stone axes found their way to orkney unstan ware a variation on grooved ware emerged in orkney the people who used unstan ware had totally different burial practices but managed to coexist with their grooved ware counterparts some hybrid chambered cairns have emerged in this region containing architectural

activation analysis of pgw sherds appendix     section    distribution of pgw                 in dartford town      abstract    patch grove ware was thus named by ward perkins in a  report and has since been employed in the literature the ware has been examined at the macro level to test whether or not a homogeneous fabric exists sherds from two hundred sites in nw kent were examined a record of the sherd count vessel form extent and intra and inter site differences has been noted the research brought to light the existence of a hitherto unsuspected kiln site the wares dating and its role as a traded ware in the c to c ad in nw kent is briefly discussed introduction    the paucity of information concerning the vessel form extent of patch grove ware ward perkins  has led to the view that the ware is found in the guise of large jars only moreover the date for these jars is given as c and c ad however the evidence of recent research particularly on newly excavated and unpublished material conflicts with this view evidence for an innovatory local ware industry has emerged spanning the c  c ad producing a wide range of forms these discoveries are of obvious local importance but also reflect a general trend in localised handmade coarse ware production that has yet to be studied in detail in other parts of the province this material represented by a range of forms is here designated patch grove ware pgw and an analysis of its distribution and main characteristics forms the main content of this paper evidence is also presented as to the first discovery of a kiln site for this ware    note frog farm otford kent some areas of this farm from the text refer to twitton or wickham farm names and some field names change in time       pottery of the patch grove type     after excluding vessel types such as amphorae tazza and fine wares such as terra nigra samian ware and colourcoated wares only one coarse ware  named patch grove ware ward perkins  p  is constantly listed in n kent archaeological reports in this paper the abbreviation pgw is used    the basic problem is clear from all the literature pgw is described as such andor as a type andor as an allied ware as well it is important therefore to test whether or not a pgw homogeneous fabric does exist as archaeological workers repeatedly cite an orange coloured surface type should this prove to exist then it may point to one or more places in nw kent as being kiln sites the existence of such a subregional industry if proved can help to expand knowledge in the area of pottery supply in nw kent in the romanobritish period    the approach adopted in this research was to examine in the hand sherds from romanobritish find spots in nw kent and its borders aided by inspection using a x mag hand lense the aims were       to research the vessel form extent       to elucidate the distribution of pgw in nw kent       to indicate the dating of pgw       to consider briefly pgws role within the framework of pottery supply in nw kent     nomenclature the name of this ware was coined by ward perkins it being no more than the place name of a site by  the oldbury hill fort ward perkins      the name since has been contracted on occasion to patchgrove ware by a number of authors eg    cm green p palmer     further the name has also been extended on occasions to cover other wares similar to pgw     eg patchgrove fabric  green ppalmer  class m  includes the original patch grove storage jar form ward perkins  fig  marshtyers    p group b  patch grove and related wares  g clewley philp  p  the conclusion is disturbing a named ware has had its original name used in various ways to also include other similar wares       pgw fabric    the first writer to place the fabric under a correct title handmade grogtempered pottery    types was green  p in lamas no      as a type it was included in the study of grogtempered wares of south eastern england thompson      this highlights another fundamental problem is there a pgw fabric amongst a sea of grogware fabrics       pgw fabric inclusions    reports have mentioned the minor presence of            shell including fossil  marshtyers  green             sand  marshtyers            burnt organics  green             mudstone  green            charcoal  pollard ib    green            mica  green            quartz  green     besides the major inclusions of grog this list adds to the uncertainty of a pgw homogeneous fabric being in existence cf        pgw recognition    within the scope of this paper published references to pgw cf  without an in hand inspection a    moot point in terms of provenance value    what is clear is that archaeologists have followed ward perkins and isolated an easily recognisable fabric in its most common guise an orange surfaced soapy ware in the form of a large jar with an horizontal row of jab decor high on the shoulder  fig    an extensive literature search undertaken with in hand examination revealed the existence of sufficiently sized rimwall sherds and complete vessels some of which may be attributed to styles current in the c and c ad   in the same period ward perkins fig  jars have also been described as coloursurfaced black brown and grey found alongside the orangesurfaced type     pgw terminology  to describe the gross and minor morphological details of the ward

godwin and m hoverden were amongst those who assisted ward perkins at the oldbury hill port excavations in  and his knowledge probably prompted ward perkins to test dig at hookers swimming pool field in patch grove    ward perkins site notebook survives with the finds in maidstone museum his test dig campaign was four boxes by the swimming pool fig  and two further sets of boxes marked pg  and  series elsewhere in the swimming pool field the other wares in each layer of each pg  box found with orange surface coloured pgw date from c  ad to c o ad this situation was no different for the box

ward perkins dating for pgw as immediate preimmediate post claudian conquest to the end of the first century ad on this sites intraspecific sequence is not valid in fact there is no valid secure dating by association for pgw at patch grove and no evidence whatsoever that patch grove was a pgw kiln site the finds suggest a romanobritish farmstead still awaiting discovery in the immediate area fig    typed copy of dr gordon wards notes specimens from patch grove area selected to show characteristics of the patch grove type of pottery the site by patch grove is a dump of wasters and may not accurately represent the quality to be met elsewhere a   the paste shoes grey mottling on lighter grey it is very soft and often contains white specks b   the paste has a rough fracture and often contains flint iron concentrations etc c   the slip is normally orange red and has been applied to the paste before firing it covers inside outside          and base d   brush marks show one of the ways in which the slip was applied it is very soft e   the slip when underfired has a soapy feel and dirty grey colour f   rims are very variable but mostly are on section club or quarter circle in

of ward perkins  pgw sherds and marked them in white and black ink for a display long ago withdrawn at maidstone museum fig  he remained convinced of this attribution sevenoaks privately printed p and at least one archaeologist followed this school of thought parsons     chemically this a  k marking by dr gordon ward has severely contaminated approximately  of all the ward perkins excavated pgw    ward perkins excavated material from the oldbury hill fort contains much romano british fabrics ranging from the first to the fourth century ad which throws revealing light on his mention of two mortaria being found  some of this material is listed in fig     ward perkins   cited awg lowther for the surrey distribution the significance of this is that the reported surrey find spots lie on the line of the pilgrims way the road adjacent to frog farm otford and a barn the charne site meates  opposite frog farm    six of the patch grove site pgw sherds not mentioned nor illustrated in either the  or  reports are of interest fig     since the ware found at patch grove was too fragmentary for illustration four rims from other nw kent sites were used the omission of the other vessel forms was unfortunate and has had lasting effect    the pgw at patch grove oldbury hill fort and the four rims    in fig  have ail been examined and all are homogeneous had dr gordon ward concentrated on

ward et al in the �s and s    banking mead field contains two earth works both hitherto unrecorded the first is a bank now spread by plough action running from the pilgrims way on the m contour line parallel with the river darent the other is a rectangular enclosure with a single entrance facing the river darent    the flint pavements noted by dr gordon ward and team may represent floors or minor structures the precise nature and dating of which is not presently known    it is striking that the kiln field was confined to a corner of what appears to be a mixed economic unit embracing farming stockholding and pottery production it is not surprising therefore that this sites main product  the ward perkins  and  type jar  should have reached the progress villa on the opposite bank  and of some large yellowish stone vessels with two or more bands of stick made marks for ornament pearce  p      frog farms position for pottery production was ideal ample supplies of gault clay wood and water are in the immediate area its place for communication was ideal products being moved up or down the pilgrims way the river darent and minor roadstracks running up or down the darent valley       listing     over one hundred and thirtyfive find spots for pgw fabric  have been noted these are arranged in linear blocks for nw kent appendix   note to appendix  provides a comparison with frog

appendix i is totally absent      analysis    carbon as a filler for pgw has been suggested pollard sb a fellow member of the ddag mr ian gerrard took three pgw sherds from ash villa one site and mechanically crushed them he reported as follows        kiln set at  hrs at � c         new crucible one           carbon        new crucible two           crushed pgw sherd                         new crucible three         hand picked black grog fraction          new crucible four           hand picked grey grog fraction        results after being let to cool crucible one had a slight black stain  the carbon had evaporated crucibles two to four contained a homogeneous bright red brick dust    carbon as a deliberately chosen filler would call for a regular supply  an added complication to the process of making pots its presence as a filler has never been noted satterwaite  a void in the paste due to occasional burnt out organics would not be surprising for a whole range of ceramic

has been found in either the same context or sealed layer no evidence has been found for pgw being in a claudian or nero era context this confirmed it is suggested an observer that pgw had never been noted in a secure claudian context pollard b    from the  dartford villa ddag  excavations a pgw base sherd with a unique decor scheme not unlike a modem quiche dish was removed and a sample taken    both samples had been washed in tap water and dried both were irradiated for a neutron activation analysis at north east london polytechnic in march  fig     the presence of manganese in the dartford sample may be due to sampling error as this is a trace element in gault clay allowing for the fact that this sampling is not typical that the neutron activation analysis neutron flux was low this is a striking match    pgw has been found on twentyeight sites in the dartford area cf appendix     dartford block       dating     the association of pgw fabric  in layers on a number of nw kent sites for the period circa    ad with a number of known forms and fabrics is striking fig  pollards suggestion that pgw achieved a recognisable form in the later c ad pollard a is considered here correct in the precise sense of an orange surfaced product     the presence of everted rim jars jars bearing reserved zone acute lattice decor a bb mimic and flanged rim bowls and dishes points to production at frog farm into the first quarter of the c     this is not the place to discuss in detail the dating evidence of each open and closed form however appendix  offers an insight of form  reaching cray end darent valley sites whereas the kiln site has a low form  body sherd count compared to form        industry     as a ware pgw arose out of a southern england preconquest belgic grog ware tradition fabric  appears circa  ad and fell from the record in the troubled times of the early third century     the main output  pits out of  was form      this form monopolised the market in nw kent in the supply of a large storage jar for the period    it had only one rival marketed from the thamesside industry this was the shelltempered storage jar form k marshtyers  fig  this has bean noted in the course of this research on thirtyfive nw kent sites it was first illustrated in a report alongside pgw at joydens wood caigertester      the frog farm potters also engaged in a volume production of a second closed form  the bead rim jar  in the later part of cearly c it would seem that it was traded only a few miles from the site all other forms were not volume produced and the uncommon decors may well reflect kiln site experiments      conclusions    much of what has been said has necessarily been one of opinion the prime aim of the research has been achieved  that there is a homogeneous fabric  that the fabric appears confined to nw kent in the main and embraced a long term output of an open and closed form series the recognition that frog farm is the kiln site was an unexpected result in the face of the fact that a grog ware producer  by recycling waste  would leave virtually no trace of pottery activity     this work is a ground work survey opening up to a marked degree the extent of pgws distribution most of the sherds seen in the hand were derived from antiquarian collections stray field surface assemblages and amateur rescue excavations the value of these finds would have been severely limited had not the distinctive nature of the pgw fabric been so evident finds from the bulk of these find spots have never been published even at the interim report level    this has been a major drawback in that it has cast doubt on the size and relative importance of pgw in its role of supply to the nw kent market fig  a   higham marsh shell  breenlewis  higham marsh  type

acre site philp  the keston warbank site complex philp and the gravesend town centre site philp unfortunately nonpublication has thus far been the general rule in n kent pottery research monaghan      considerable scope exists to add in blank areas of the distribution to increase the form parallels and extend the fore series and refine the dating      modern developments pose a considerable threat in that the poverest road site is currently threatened with building schemes area b fig  of the frog farm site has been sold off as recreation plots and the springhead complex remains under the plough     a considered sampling policy and analytical programme to understand the nature of pgws fabric is needed as is a modern open plan excavation at frog farm in an attempt to deduce the type of kiln technology it is hoped that future researchers may find this study of some help in their work and it remains for me to thank all those contributors in kents museums and groups who gave their help in particular mr john pyke of the otford group for allowing the use of copies of his  scale master drawings of some of the frog farm pits material and for other kindnesses
