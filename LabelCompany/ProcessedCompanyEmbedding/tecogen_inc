electricity or cooling power that you need plus capture much of the thermal energy that is normally lost during the energy conversion into power with chp the “waste” thermal energy is captured and put to good use on site for heating water or building spaces a normally very energy intensive task heating is now accomplished at no additional cost to the customer or environment this doubleduty translates into significant energy and cost savings for you as well as proportional decreases in carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emissions with efficient cogeneration you get the electricity and heat that your building needs or alternatively the chilled water and heat for a lot less money and a lot more reliably a variety of products to suit your facility’s needs chp chillers water heaters emissions control chp with our chp system you get both electricity and heat for your building from a single fuel source resulting in dramatic savings on your energy bills the engine’s mechanical energy is used to drive a generator that produces electricity while at the same time the engine’s free waste heat gets recovered to satisfy building heating needs this is sometimes referred to as “electrical” cogeneration view chp products chillers with a tecochill chiller system you get both chilling and heat for your building from a single fuel source resulting in dramatic savings on your energy bills the engines mechanical energy is used to drive a compressor that produces chilled water while the engines free waste heat can be recovered to satisfy simultaneous building heating needs
