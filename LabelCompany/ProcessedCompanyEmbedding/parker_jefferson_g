the proper inquiries there are several questions you should ask but the majority will fall under three general topicstraining and experience questions one of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorneys history when you first step into a lawyers office you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas you have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practices success look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of courtonce you inquire about the broad details of their legal career you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue you should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs lawyers cant mention clients by name but you should ask for basic details about identical past casesfinancial questions you need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney you should request a list of all costs in advance so you wont be surprised by additional expenses like overhead also determine exactly when you will start being billed you want to inspect paperwork carefully if the attorney charges you for his or her experience you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistantfind out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour many civil lawyers work on contingency whatever the payment plan make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performancelawyerclient relationship questions when you hire a lawyer youre agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time you need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship the attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updatesyou should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyerclient relationship great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier such as how to keep fees down or what daily

michael butts on april  format mass market paperback parker has written a very interesting and evocative thriller in the triggermans dance ultimately it is a novel of revenge both john and joshua want to avenge the accidental death of the woman they loved joshua also inwardly wants revenge for knowing that prior to her death rebecca was going to choose her lover john and not joshua her fiance fueled by this revenge john and joshua work together to bring the killer to justice a complex undercover assignment begins with startling if predictable results there are times in the novel when you want parker to hasten things along it seems like the time john spends on the ranch is interminable and there are times when the action slows down fortunately this doesnt hurt the overall impact of the story parker is to be commended for allowing us to like and dislike both john and joshua to like and dislike the villain vann holt and to feel sorry for valerie holts daughter who ends up falling for the mole johnthis is a thoughtful emotional novel and though not as suspenseful as some thrillers still manages to both entertain and stimulate was this review helpful to you yes no sending feedback thank you for your feedback sorry we failed to record your vote please try again report abuse  out of  starsslowbuilding suspense by untouchable on aug  format mass market paperback after a woman is mistaken for a colleague and gunned down in the parking lot of the newspaper where she works she leaves behind two men bent on revenge one of them is an fbi agent and her fiancé the other is a fellow journalist and her lover josh weinstein the fbi agent enlists john menden the lover to take an undercover role to bring the killer to justice what makes this difficult is the suspect is an exfbi agent who now heads a very successful security agency and is surrounded by both heavily armed employees and a patrolled virtually impregnable fortresswhile the idea is good one vengeance for the death of a loved one the execution was just a little sloppy the pretext that was used to penetrate the fortress was just a little too unbelievable for my liking thats just a minor quibble on my part though and once i accepted that mendon was in i got on with enjoying the tension of a mole working undercover  hours a day  days a week if you enjoy this kind of slow boiling suspense story then i think youll enjoy the triggermans dance was this review helpful to you yes no sending feedback thank you for your feedback sorry we failed to record your vote please try again report abuse  out of  starshang with this oneit gets better and better by john j raspanti on july  format mass market paperback i think i understand why some folks gave the triggermans dance a fair reviewit starts really slowso slow that i was thinking about the next book i was going to read the charactersat the beginningare not very interestingand the story plods alongbutas i saidnear page  or soi began to care about john and the fbi agent joshuathe story is basically about revenge and what some are willing to do to achieve it two men in love with the same woman join forces to bring down the guy they think is responsible for a murder and there broken hearts is this guy guilty or innocentwhen the author introduces van holt a former fbi agent things really begin to take off the tension builds and builds summing upi would saystay with this onetjefferson parker knows how to write a good thriller this time it just took a little while to get going was this review helpful to you yes no sending feedback thank you for your feedback sorry we failed to record your vote please try again report abuse  out of  starsi liked this a lotdont understand the bad reviews by k barrett on may  format mass market paperback so its a little farfetched a little bit technical and ascary scenario to think about i still liked it a bunch joshua thefbi agent and john the unlikely sports writer turned secret agent drew me in and kept me on the edge of my chair throughout the entire read i enjoyed the tension between the two menand the terrible bond that held them together im happy to have discovered t jefferson parker recently loved the blue hour also parker has the ability to capture the inner workings of his characters mindsand besides that he can tell a mighty interesting story i must also say i was drawn to the villain in the story it was so very hard to hate him i recommend this booki really liked it was this review helpful to you yes no sending feedback thank you for your feedback sorry we failed to record your vote
