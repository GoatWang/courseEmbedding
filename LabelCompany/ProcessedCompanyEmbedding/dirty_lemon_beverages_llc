tweet upload more images previousnext buy online review dirty lemon raw detox posted jul   at  pm last updated aug   at  am dirty lemon raw detox is as the name suggests a cleansefocused product the beverage which is high pressure processed is made with water coldpressed lemon juice dandelion root extract ginger root extract and activated charcoal it has  calories and g of sugar per  oz bottle from a taste perspective the product has a very heavy lemon flavor which is cut ever so slightly by the added ginger the activated charcoal does not have a specific flavor per se but the product does seem to have a slightly not of burnt flavor to it truly though what we really like about this product is that it’s much more of a water than a juice which sets it apart from most of the other activated charcoal products that we’ve sampled to date from a packaging perspective the approach to this product is chic and minimalist short of a few transparent strips that run across the package and in effect turn into black stripes since that’s the color of the liquid it’s not possible to see inside the bottle we did not however like that the sleeve wrap label went over the cap this part neither looked overly attractive especially compared with the professional photo of the product which has a silver cap and no wrap over and hinders one’s ability to quickly open the product still the overall design and concept of the product feel very much like the company is headed in the right direction finally there’s the fact that this is a directtoconsumer product this is only relevant to the review in that the back of the bottle has a calltoaction to reorder which requires either a visit to the companys website or sending a text message to a number that’s printed on the bottle whether or not the approach is commercially viable is hard to say ultimately dirty lemon raw detox is a wellexecuted product that goes at the cleanse market in a unique and innovative way comments beverage
