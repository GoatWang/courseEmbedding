checkinno commentsdid you ever go to a meeting and then have to wait in the lobby for several minutes to get processed as a visitor either the receptionist was too busy answering incoming phone calls or better yet she was unable to locate the person you came to meet because they were not at their deskfortunately we’ve solved that problem with a self checkin that sends an instant notification to the individual you’re visitingthis video shows a recent installation that our toronto digital signage team deployed downtown it does a great job demonstrating how easy it is to use an interactive lobby kiosk solutionare you wondering — what problem does it really solve a lot of corporate offices today do not have a receptionist to greet and process visitors even though they have high standards when it comes to documenting processing and logging them this poses a real challenge when a receptionist or security personnel is not situated in the front lobbya few months ago one of our toronto clients asked us for a costeffective and efficient way to process visitors on each floor of their corporate head officeour solution was a kiosk with an interactive touch screen enabling the visitor to signin by entering their first and last name along with a company name an optional feature is to have their photo taken which can be kept for future records or sent to the person being visitedafter they signin the visitor enters their contact’s name this step triggers an instant sms message and voice mail informing the contact that they have someone waiting for them in the lobbyat this point the device prints out a badgesticker for the visitor to wear and we are ready for businessthis solution offers immediacy and also reduces wait times and the reliance on a front receptionist and security

this page for informational purposes only editors review by downloadcom staff on september   mymedia is an image and video downloader and browser for ios devices that integrates a number of useful tools to manage media files on your phone or ipad the inclusion of a custom browser is nice and the media browser while not as advanced as those in similar apps is effective allowing you to access and move through large volumes of audio image or video files on your phone remotely when you set up mymedia you will see a rundown of how the app works complete with an outline of what it can do and what options you are given to work with the features of this app the browser may look pared down at first but it uses many of the same features from safari combined with download tools that will move any media you encounter to your phone or tablets library you can then access these files view them move them to a cloud storage platform of your choosing transfer them via wifi to itunes or delete them settings are also available to passcode lock your files or change how they are saved and backed up mymedia ran smoothly in all of our tests finding files downloading them and backing them up when we selected them while the interface is cumbersome at times with some options hidden in unexpected places the app is generally well made so you can find and access these files on the go with ease   read

our first choice we knew mediabox had all the parameters we needed to streamline our approvals royalty tracking and agreement consolidation the simplicity of the site made for an efficient transition for pacific cycle’s personnel and our licensed partners there is no question this is a very efficient and timesaving tool another important point is mediabox’s staff we lean on them regularly with questions and suggestions to see to the everchanging needs of pacific cycle’s licensing tracking system and our partners’ approval protocol they have been more then accommodating to our needs and continue to buildup their technology” pacific cycle “mediabox has proven to be an invaluable tool for our staff licensors and our licensees around the globe the website which is very user friendly allows our brand and property images and artwork to be available immediately to everyone  it also allows us to be in charge of what is on the website and the ability to change the art offered and the user access rights – easily from our own computer and at any time of the day or night without having to rely on an outside service’s availability mediabox has helped to reduce art fulfillment costs while freeing up valuable staff time to focus on more critical needs it has been tremendously helpful for our company” joester loria group “as our business has evolved we find ourselves dealing with increasing volumes of designs on ever expanding product categories the media box system enables us to manage the design and approval process from concept right through to final samples it allows us to respond to licensees efficiently no matter where in the world we or they happen to be one key advantage of media box is that multiple access by different users means that no matter how many people
