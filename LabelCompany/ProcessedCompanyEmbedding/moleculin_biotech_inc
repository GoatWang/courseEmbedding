many of which are based on discoveries made at md anderson cancer center the world’s largest cancer research facility headquartered within the world’s largest medical center each of our projects represents a breakthrough discovery and a highly disruptive technology our lead product candidate is annamycin a phase ii clinical stage anthracycline for the treatment of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia more commonly referred to as aml unlike current therapies that risk cardiotoxicity and can have their effectiveness limited due to multidrug resistance annamycin appears capable of avoiding both of these problems and has already demonstrated the ability to save lives in clinic  we are now preparing to seek accelerated approval for this gamechanging drug we also have two active preclinical small molecule portfolios one of which is focused on the modulation of hardtotarget cell signaling mechanisms and appears capable stimulating the patient’s natural immune system while also attacking tumors directly  the other portfolio targets the metabolism of tumors and exploits a unique approach for crossing the blood brain barrier for the treatment of glioblastoma and other central nervous system malignancies problem cardiotoxicity and multidrug resistance severely limit pediatric oncologists’ ability to effectively treat children suffering from acute leukemia solution we believe annamycin’s ability to avoid both cardiotoxicity and multidrug resistance has the potential to eliminate this critical problem one of the most exciting scientific discoveries here at moleculin which we believe will have a profound impact on the treatment of children suffering from acute leukemia is our lead drug annamycin’s ability to be noncardiotoxic we believe that this characteristic alone has the ability to change the way pediatric oncologists’ treat children suffering from acute leukemia for the foreseeable future cardiotoxicity can be a killer causing severe permanent and sometimes fatal damage to the heart of both adults and children and cardiotoxicity is highly present in the currently approved drugs used to treat all acute leukemia patients the drugs that are used to treat acute leukemia patients are called “anthracyclines” oncologists and especially pediatric oncologists are limited in how they can treat their patients due to the harmful effects of cardiotoxicity here are some quotes from other publications “the effectiveness of anthracyclines and related compounds doxorubicin daunorubicin idarubicin epirubicin and the anthraquinone mitoxantrone is hindered by their cardiotoxicity” – cardiotoxicity of anthracyclinelike chemotherapy agents “anthracyclines remain an important class of drugs in the treatment of cancer but also remains a problematic chemotherapeutic agent given their cardiotoxic effects” – anthracycline cardiotoxicity prevalence pathogenesis and treatment to better understand how cardiotoxicity impacts children suffering from acute leukemia consider that acute leukemia is the most common form of cancer in children comprising approximately  percent of all childhood malignancies of the acute leukemias acute lymphoblastic leukemia all occurs more commonly than acute myeloid leukemia aml however the treatment of both typically involves the same induction therapy the preparation for a bone marrow transplant used in adults to reduce the presence of leukemic cells in the patient’s bone marrow and bloodstream in preparation for a curative bone marrow transplant most unfortunately for children however the standard drug used in such induction therapies is significantly cardiotoxic this often means that even though the chances are often good that current treatments can cure a child’s leukemia it is very likely that the child’s lifespan will be shortened and their quality of life diminished as a result of permanent heart damage caused by current therapies this is why we believe annamycin’s lack of cardiotoxicity has the ability to change the way children are treated for the foreseeable future annamycin has been shown to be noncardiotoxic in animal models when compared with one of the leading anthracyclines doxorubicin to make matters worse the leading induction therapy drugs lose efficacy due to something called “multidrug resistance” requiring more and more drug to try and prepare patients for a successful bone marrow transplant but because of the harmful effects of cardiotoxicity patients simply cannot tolerate an increase in dosage  at the same time that annamycin avoids cardiotoxicity it also avoids multidrug resistance and as a result annamycin has demonstrated in early clinical trials the ability to deliver efficacy in patients who have failed repeated attempts with the existing induction therapy drugs oncologists and especially pediatric oncologists have been clear that there is a tremendous unmet need here and we believe annamycin has the potential to fill that need and change forever how children with leukemia are treated  the severity of this unmet need may allow us to position annamycin for accelerated approval under fda guidelines and we will be working hard this year to secure an accelerated approval pathway we look forward to moving quickly to translate this important breakthrough into new hope for those children who have run out of options here are some interesting articles on the effects of cardiotoxicity risk of heart damage follows some childhood cancer survivors woman battling breast cancer diagnosed with heart failure cutaneous tcell lymphoma ctcl a form of nonhodgkin’s lymphoma is a rare cancer that occurs when tcells in the skin grow uncontrollably it is estimated that about  to  people in the us have ctcl with a higher incidence in men between the ages of  and  years old ctcl is often mistaken for eczema psoriasis or contact dermatitis since it initially presents as patches or plaques over time the patient may develop tumors or generalized erythroderma abnormal redness of the skin over widespread areas of the body the disease is categorized as stages iiv each of which represents an increased risk for metastasis or the spread of cancer to distant parts of the body about threequarters of the patient population fall into stages ia ib and iia the lower risk group once the disease becomes systemic however the prognosis—or outlook—is significantly worse beginning with stage iib ctcl is considered progressive or advanced and median survival drops to  years “i have been in drug development for close to  years and led the development of carboplatin and cisplatin which have been blockbuster drugs for years in all my experience annamycin is one of the best drug development opportunities i’ve seen” donald picker phd  copyright  moleculin biotech llc subscribe to our newsletterjoin our mailing list to receive the latest news and updates regarding moleculin and breakthrough cancer related

cardiotoxicity » cardiotoxicity a key advantage of our lead drug annamycin is it’s lack of cardiotoxicity  to understand just how important this we need to focus on the critical role cardiotoxicity plays when treating cancer patients especially children the term cardiotoxic refers to drugs that can cause severe permanent and sometimes fatal damage to the heart cardiotoxicity is a major concern for clinicians as they administer chemotherapy to their patients the effects of cardiotoxicity are not always immediate they can show up   or  years later and the patient can possibly die from heart failure caused by the chemotherapy that was intended to save their life when treating a child with a chemotherapy regimen cardiotoxicity plays an extremely important role as the clinician has to limit dosing due to the potential for heart failure this can be very restrictive in cases where the cancer is aggressive and the need for higher dosing is required yet the risk of severe cardiotoxicity is great enough that dosing must be limited even after a successful treatment it is suggested that childhood cancer survivors should visit their doctor yearly for followup care because heart conditions may not cause symptoms early on this is why we believe our lead drug annamycin is extremely disruptive with its ability to be noncardiotoxic annamycin was designed to avoid the cardiotoxicity that is common with currently approved therapies and it has been shown to be noncardiotoxic in animal studies we believe this unique characteristic alone increases the chances that we would receive an accelerated approval pathway for the treatment of acute leukemia here in the us and in europe for clinicians globally having the ability to treat acute leukemia patients with a drug that is noncardiotoxic would be a gamechanger in the industry here are some interesting articles on the effects of cardiotoxicity risk of heart damage follows some childhood cancer survivors woman battling

technology navigation menu home » technology » multidrug resistance » multidrug resistance multidrug resistance mdr refers to mechanisms by which many cancers develop resistance to chemotherapy drugs and is a major factor in the failure of many forms of chemotherapy it affects patients with a variety of blood cancers and solid tumors including breast ovarian lung and lower gastrointestinal tract cancers tumors usually consist of mixed populations of malignant cells some of which are drugsensitive while others are drugresistant chemotherapy kills drugsensitive cells but leaves behind a higher proportion of drugresistant cells as the tumor begins to grow again chemotherapy may fail because the remaining tumor cells are now able to recognize the chemotherapy and reject it at the cellular level thus rendering it resistant to the therapy this resistance to therapy is often the result of molecular “pumps” in tumorcell membranes that actively expel chemotherapy drugs from the interior this allows tumor cells to avoid the intended toxic effects of the drug as mdr begins to counteract chemotherapy drugs it can require higher and higher doses to kill tumor cells yet the unwanted side effects of the drugs like cardiotoxicity ultimately prevent such increases in dosing two kinds of pumps commonly responsible for multidrug resistance in cancer are pglycoprotein pgp and the socalled multidrug resistance–associated protein mrp because of their role in mdr they have been the targets of several anticancer efforts  unfortunately efforts to block the activity of these pumps have resulted in serious side effects because they also play an important role in normal cell function our most advanced therapy annamycin represents a muchneeded breakthrough in the battle against multidrug resistance  its unique design prevents it from being recognized by mdr pumps allowing annamycin to avoid the multidrug resistance mechanisms that often defeat current therapies technology

discoveries made at md anderson cancer center each of our projects represents a breakthrough discovery and a highly disruptive technology navigation menu home » technology » about aml » about aml leukemia is a cancer of the white blood cells and the acute forms of leukemia can manifest quickly and leave patients with limited treatment options aml is the most common type of acute leukemia in adults it occurs when a clone of leukemic progenitor white blood cells proliferates in the bone marrow suppressing the production of normal blood cells the therapy of combining  chemotherapeutic drugs which always includes an anthracycline in inducing a cr or complete response has not improved since it was first used in the ’s and we estimate that it has the same cure rate of about  as then currently the only viable option for acute leukemia patients is a bone marrow transplant which is successful in a significant number of patients however in order to qualify for a bone marrow transplant the patient’s leukemia cells must be decreased to a sufficiently low level unfortunately the current clinically approved anthracyclines are cardiotoxic which can result in damage to the heart and limit the dosage amount that may be administered to patients additionally the tumor cells often present de novo or developed resistance to the first line anthracycline often through what is called “multidrug resistance” making them capable of purging themselves of the available anthracyclines consequently there remains no effective therapy for these patients and unfortunately most will succumb quickly to their leukemia if a patient’s leukemia reappears before they can be prepared for a bone marrow transplant they are considered to have “relapsed” if a patient fails to achieve a sufficient response from the induction therapy to qualify for a bone marrow transplant they are considered to be “refractory” resistant to therapy together this group of aml patients is our primary focus with annamycin and our intent is to pursue approval for annamycin as a secondline induction therapy for relapsed and refractory aml patients of the estimated  us cases of acute myeloid leukemia

other aspects of allergies were this glamorous reason i bought a molekule allergies asthma gunky eyes runny nose eczema from makeup and moisturizersits allergy season in the bay area and there is

other rooms of the house when it doesnt smell as clean as my bedroom now aaaaand it just looks great the design looks like it belongs in ad or sunset magazine ive been recommending it to anyone ive caught sneezing but really anyone with two eyes and a nose could benefit natalia delarosa best environmentalbiohack for your house reason i bought a molekule allergies help my child pets mold air pollution i cannot even write a deserving review for the molekule molly cool is the name of my device not only do i live in an area heavy of oil refineries but my wife and oldest daughter are literally bed ridden due to extreme allergies since the first week of having the molekule neither of them have had a single alllergy crisis it took just maybe  minutes to set up and looks sleep in any room as a functional wellness consultant i have recommended this device to everyone i know that can benefit from breathing cleaner air todd shipman molekule is competely different reason i bought a

allergies and trouble sleeping molecule made a huge difference in my sleep and my health i now wake up well rested and not sniffling and sneezing it is amazing i have never had an air purifier do this before not to mention it is a beautiful and well crafted piece of furniture in my home i am proud to show it to people and i doeven though it lives in my bedroom most of the time seriously i bring it out at parties to show people i cant imagine living without it kimberli hudson it transformed my life reason i bought a molekule allergies pets mold air pollution i have an extreme case of environmental allergies—to the point that my immune system is on record at several major hospitals ive had allergists in five different countries look at my lab results in disbelief at the depth and breadth of my reactivity and literally tell me that i was one of the worst cases theyd ever seen i lived in a permanent state of congestion and hadnt breathed through my nose in over  years that sounds like an impossible exaggerration it is not i was that slackjawed person who wheezed and panted through life at all times ive had two major underanesthetic sinus surgeries septoplasty and turbinoplasty ive had acupuncture ive taken an obscene cocktail of powerful drugs and inhalants none of these approaches had a particular impact on my quality of life but came with considerable side effects i finally got to the point where i simplygave up it had been simply too many attempts and too much failure i decided to simply accept that this was going to be something i simply needed to learn to accept about a year ago my boss actually bought molekule for me as a gift because a they are wonderful and b he felt sorry for how ill i looked all the time its very visible i had absolutely no faith it would work because nothing ever has but in the interest of being polite i dutifully turned it on at home within a week of having molekule in my bedroom on full power  my nose entirely cleared up i stopped waking up with watery bloodshot puffy eyes i stopped sneezing i stoped drooling and snoring in my sleep i stopped waking up with wheezing panics where my throat had almost entirely closed during the night at first my symptom relief was contained only to my bedroom but within about  months i felt my symptoms lessen even when i left my bedroom i cant explain why but perhaps having  hours a day with my immune system not being constantly assaulted by allergens allowed it to begin to recalibrate and tone down i still have skin allergies eczema but my ear nose throat symptoms are  resolved i am calmly breathing through my nose as i type this and i can tell you that its an absolute transformation i will happily purchase a molekule for every room in my house and have ordered two more for my office at work i believe this is a breakthrough innovation for those who suffer deeply from environmental allergies and can wholeheartedly recommend it ive never endorsed anything that ive purchased in the past and genuinely believed this would fail me it did not and i happily recommend it now andréa mallard finally an air purifier that relieved my sons allergy symptoms reason i bought a molekule allergies pets mold air pollution my son suffers from severe allergies we starting using the device due to his constant battle with symptoms due to his allergies he would wake up sneezing congested and runny nose itchy eyes and coughing even with currently undergoing weekly allergy shots he still experienced multiple symptoms at a high level our house does not have curtains knick knacks carpet rugs and his bedding and pillow are all encased as a parent i had done everything i could in our household to allergy proof my home we tried multiple air purifiers that we purchased at retail stores however my efforts still did not give my child relief our experience with molekule has been a life changer  after just a short period of time using the unit i noticed his symptoms decreasing significantly and his quality of sleep improving my son would wake up and not experience his sneezing attacks immediately he would also not have to start off his mornings with blowing his nose multiple times i know this sounds like a minor issue but he would no longer have to carry a box of tissues and trash can around the house with him thank you to dr goswami and the staff at molekule for giving my son allergy relief when it comes to air quality jodie f molekule changed our lives for the better reason i bought a molekule allergies asthma mold air pollution my wife and i moved from new york to florida a few years ago and were instantly plagued by inflamed asthma as well as allergies to all the new pollens and trees to make matters worse we purchased a  year old home surrounded by oak trees every night was interrupted by our allergy and asthma symptoms and with a baby on the way we were nervous how these symptoms may impact the baby we tried a few other big name air purifiers to no avail introduce molekule molekule arrived at our home the day we started renovations the unit is not only sleek and compact but elegant in design it would fit anywhere in our home however we chose the bedroom as its semipermanent home it is as simple to use as plugging it in and following the on screen instructions to select room size and configure it to my phone all which took no more than five minutes immediately i could feel the difference not only did the air smell clean but i could taste clean air as it entered my mouth and nose it was almost as if i could feel the air in the room changing during the initial cleaning stage of the molekule as i mentioned we started renovations on the bottom floor of our house the day the unit arrived and were prepared to sleep upstairs due to the smoke and dust in the air to our amazement in only an hour after work was completed for the day the entire downstairs was habitable again and there was no remnant smell or dust from construction we were all able to sleep in our bedrooms on the first floor and had the best night of sleep since moving to florida molekule has made such an impact on our lives in the short time we have had it allergy symptoms are a rare occasion now and we always sleep through the night ive gone from have congestion daily to rarely having any congestion on nasal symptoms where i once had to use a rescue inhaler daily i now cant remember the last time i picked it up i wake up every morning refreshed and ready to start my day i owe this all to molekule we now travel with our unit when we stay in hotels or in other peoples homes the silence of the unit makes zero noise impact on our hosts and there is no stigma of traveling with an air purifier the beauty of the unit makes it a conversation piece and i can not tell you how many people ask me how can i get one this was by far the best choice we could have made for our health ive already ordered  more units for other areas of the house and for my office ross newman its time to come clean about the air you breathe indoor air is  times more polluted than outdoor air  percent of your life is
