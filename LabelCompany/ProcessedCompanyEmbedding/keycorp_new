growth in the first quarter  coming in at a mere  much of the deceleration in the first quarter of  can be attributed to a slowdown in personal consumption expenditures in addition to drawbacks in private inventory investment and state and local government spending however these were partially offset by increases in exports and fixed investment gdp growth in  was slower than in  due to a weaker start with tepid growth of  in the first quarter of  and  in the second quarter of  before accelerating in the third quarter of  to  and  in the fourth quarter of  consumer spending and inventory investment were major contributors slower growth in emerging markets weak investment spending and sluggish demand for american exports caused by a strong us dollar all factored in to the muted economic expansion in  the imf estimates that global gdp is set to expand  in  the global recovery however appears to be uneven as developed countries are leading most of this years upswing in global growth with robust domestic demand buttressing growth in the euro area and the united states oil prices remain relatively flat compared to the fourth quarter of  after plummeting to multiyear lows in  and  although inventories remain elevated recent declines may help clear the way for stronger appreciation in  and help support americas struggling energy industry the stock market performed admirably in the first quarter with the sp  equity index up  since the end of  a general rally has occurred following the november elections and based on expectations for growthfriendly economic policies from

year in march  surpassing the federal reserves target of  although it fell slightly month over month down  core inflation was also healthy year over year at  thanks to the solid economy and persistently low rates the housing market generally benefited in the first quarter of  new home sales growth was up  compared to the first quarter of  while existing home sales were up  prices are also up with average new home prices up  from year ago levels and existing home prices up  housing starts also posted respectable gains in the first quarter of  up  from the first quarter of  these gains were supported by multifamily construction up  while singlefamily construction was up  as expected the federal open market committee raised the target range for the fed funds rate by  basis points to  to  in march  policymakers reiterated that the risks to the economic outlook remained fairly balanced forward guidance was unchanged with their statement noting that economic conditions will likely continue in a manner that will warrant gradual rate hikes federal open market committee meeting minutes also suggested that a reduction of their balance sheet may be on the agenda later
