you cannot invest directly in an index consider these risks before investing our allocation of assets among permitted asset categories may hurt performance stock and bond prices may fall or fail to rise over time for several reasons including general financial market conditions factors related to a specific issuer or industry and with respect to bond prices changing market perceptions of the risk of default and changes in government intervention these factors may also lead to increased volatility and reduced liquidity in the bond markets growth stocks may be more susceptible to earnings disappointments and value stocks may fail to rebound investments in small andor midsize companies increase the risk of greater price fluctuations bond investments are subject to interestrate risk the risk of bond prices falling if interest rates rise and credit risk the risk of an issuer defaulting on interest or principal payments default risk is generally higher for nonqualified mortgages interestrate risk is greater for longerterm bonds and credit risk is greater for belowinvestmentgrade bonds lowerrated bonds may offer higher yields in return for more risk funds that invest in government securities are not guaranteed mortgagebacked securities are subject to prepayment risk and the risk that they may increase in value less when interest rates decline and decline in value more when interest rates rise international investing involves currency economic and political risks emergingmarket securities carry illiquidity and volatility risks active trading strategies may lose money or not earn a return sufficient to cover trading and other costs reits are subject to the risk of economic downturns that have an adverse impact on real estate markets commoditylinked notes are subject to the same risks as commodities such as weather disease political tax and other regulatory developments and other factors affecting the value of commodities risks associated with derivatives include increased investment exposure which may be considered leverage and in the case of overthecounter instruments the potential inability to terminate or sell derivatives positions and the potential failure of the other party to the instrument to meet its obligations efforts to produce lowervolatility returns may not be successful and may make it more difficult at times for the fund to achieve its targeted returns in addition under certain market conditions the funds may accept greater volatility than would typically be the case in order to seek their targeted return there is no guarantee that the funds will provide adequate income at and through an investors retirement for the portion invested in the government money market fund these risks also apply you can lose money by investing in a fund although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at  per share it cannot guarantee it will do so an investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the
