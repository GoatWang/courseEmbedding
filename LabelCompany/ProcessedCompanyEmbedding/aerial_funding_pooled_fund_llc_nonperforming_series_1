from many individual investors that are aggregated for the purposes of investment as in the case of a mutual or pension fund investors in pooled fund investments benefit from economies of scale which allow for lower trading costs per dollar of investment diversification and professional money management along with the added costs involved in the form of management fees the main detractor of pooled fund investments is that capital gains are spread evenly among all investors — sometimes at the expense of new shareholders breaking down pooled funds groups such as investment clubs partnerships and trusts use pooled funds to invest in stocks bonds and mutual funds the pooled account lets the investors be treated as a single account holder allowing them to buy more sharespros and cons of pooled fundsgroups of investors can take advantage of opportunities typically available to only large investors in addition investors save on transaction costs and further diversify their portfolios however the individual investor has less control over the group’s investment decisions than he would making the decisions alone in addition each investor has different goals risk levels and exit strategies therefore not all group decisions are best for each individual in the group also the group must reach a consensus before deciding what to purchase when the market is volatile taking the time and effort to reach an agreement can take away opportunities for quick profits or reducing potential lossesadvantages of mutual fundsmutual funds spread their holdings across various investment vehicles reducing the effect any single security or class of securities has on the overall portfolio because mutual funds contain hundreds or thousands of securities investors are less affected if one security underperformsprofessionals manage nonindex mutual funds ensuring investors receive the best riskreturn tradeoff aligning with their objectives this helps investors who lack the time and knowledge for managing their own portfolios mutual funds allow reinvestment of dividends and interest for additional fund shares the investor saves money by not paying transaction fees while growing his portfolio mutual funds also offer a range of investment options for the highly aggressive mildly aggressive and riskadverse investor most investors can purchase mutual funds to help meet their objectivesdisadvantages of mutual fundswhen investing in a mutual fund an investor gives control to the money manager running itan investor is taxed when the fund sells individual stocks and distributes capital gains if the fund sells holdings often capital gains distributions could happen annually increasing an investor’s taxable income exceptions include investing via a traditional individual retirement account ira roth ira or employersponsored plan such as a ksome mutual funds assess a load or sales charge on all purchases all mutual funds charge annual expenses as the cost of doing business because the expense ratio is expressed as a percentage the investor pays annually a portion of his account value which lowers his gains trading center mutual fund closed to new accounts

worknchrp synthesis  pavement management systems can help agencies optimize the use of their available funding communicate funding needs and objectively manage their pavement network this synthesis identified current pavement management practices used at state and provincial transportation agencies particularly for use in resource allocation analyzing the costeffectiveness of treatments program development and communication with stakeholders the project found that most agencies develop customized pavement deterioration models and treatment rules using such data variables as pavement type functional condition highway system treatment history and traffic data report framework for a pavementmaintenance database systemnchrp report  this project developed a framework for a pavement maintenance database including a uniform format for collecting reporting and storing information on pavement maintenance activities a common framework would promote compatibility of maintenance data reported by different agencies and could provide an effective way to use data in costbenefit analysis the report includes a dvd that contains the pavement maintenance database and a cd that contains sample data both can be downloaded as iso images report element level bridge inspection benefits and use of data for bridge managementindiana dotpurdue university joint transportation research program report the moving ahead for progress in the st century act map requires the collection and submission of elementlevel bridge inspection data for all national highway system bridges this project used a survey of indiana dot peer agencies and a review of literature and bridge inspection guides to develop recommendations for elementlevel bridge inspection techniques data collection and inspector training the study found that while data required by the federal highway administration is sufficient in the short term indots inspection program should be expanded over time to make it more useful additionally a rigorous training program with detailed quality control procedures will be needed to ensure data reliability report historical performance evaluation of iowa pavement treatments using data analyticsmidwest transportation center report iowas pavement network has reached maturity making maintenance and rehabilitation more important than new construction iowa dot needed to evaluate the performance of maintenance and rehabilitation activities to better predict their impacts and support costeffective decisionmaking pavement condition data is stored in iowa dots geographic information system but not in a format compatible with the departments preservation and rehabilitation data to integrate the two databases this project used gis tools and methods including the departments linear referencing system to compare pavement conditions before and after treatments the project found that rutting and international roughness index are the most consistent performance indicators and made several recommendations to maximize the benefits of collected data report benchmarking the operations and maintenance of new zealands roading sectornew zealand transport agency research report transportation agencies sometimes have to determine appropriate levels of investment for maintenance and operations of their infrastructure without having adequate information to make that determination using benchmark data from similar agencies can help to clarify what constitutes an appropriate investment and help better understand the overall performance of complex systems like highway maintenance this project documented existing benchmarking methodologies used in new zealand and around the world and evaluated best practices opportunities and barriers and risks in benchmarking a valueformoney equation originally developed for notforprofit organizations has also worked well for highway maintenance and data envelopment analysis was found to be helpful in normalizing for unique characteristics report migration probability matrix for bridge element deterioration modelstrb annual meeting paper  transportation agencies are required to develop transportation asset management plans that feature life cycle cost analysis for bridges including deterioration models no dots yet have sufficient element inspection data to support this deterioration modeling this project conducted for florida dot suggested a readily implementable migration probability matrix that encapsulates the differences between floridas bridge element inspection data gathered under aashtos  guide to commonly recognized structural elements and data gathered using floridas  inspection manual this matrix can be used to adjust deterioration models developed using the older data to make it compatible with inspection data gathered under the new manual conference paper bridge repair and rehabilitation research continuous longterm health monitoring using ultrasonic wave propagationnebraska department of roads report reinforced concrete bridge decks are exposed to harsh loading and environmental conditions making them susceptible to deterioration delamination is a common flaw caused by chloride salts moisture and oxygen in the environment dots commonly use a variety of nondestructive techniques to detect delamination in bridge decks but this practice is only used to detect existing delamination this project investigated whether ultrasonic wave propagation and a specific sensor arrangement can monitor and identify the onset of delamination which could detect delamination before serious problems develop experimental results demonstrated the feasibility and reliability of the approach and a followup project will work to expand the application of the method and make it practical for widespread implementation report climate change impact on management of deteriorating bridges a case study of us midwest regiontrb annual meeting paper  many reinforced concrete bridges in the united states are at least  years old and suffering degradation due to environmental stressors while this deterioration has been studied environmental parameters such as temperature humidity and precipitation have changed due to climate change effects this project investigated the impact of climate change on the deterioration of reinforced concrete bridges in the midwest including its role in altering the frequency and intensity of extreme events such as floods conference paper longterm maintenance of the anthony wayne suspension bridge main cablesohio dot report the anthony wayne bridge the only suspension bridge in ohio is undergoing a significant rehabilitation acoustic emission sensors to monitor the condition of the bridges cables have already been installed and a dehumidification system will be installed this project investigated the potential use of the analatom an corrosion sensor on the bridge to measure corrosion rates in real time tests found that the sensor can consistently record changes in corrosion due to changes in the environment to ensure that dehumidification proceeds as expected report culvert maintenance research using remote data collection to identify bridges and culverts susceptible to blockage during flooding eventsuniversity of vermont transportation research center report when debris blocks culverts and bridges it can cause flooding at lower flow volumes than predicted by floodplain delineations this project pilottested the use of an unmanned aerial vehicle to gather stereo imagery of streambeds upstream of crossing structures and developed a process to rapidly transmit that information via email or text message the uav can be rapidly deployed and output data can be provided in less than  hours which makes it suitable for highrisk crossings report emergency maintenance operations research postextreme event damage assessment and response for highway bridgesnchrp synthesis  this synthesis reviews procedures used by state and local transportation departments to assess damage to bridges in response to extreme events including earthquakes landslides hurricanes floods truck crashes and terrorist attacks collisions primarily caused by overheight vehicles were the most common source of bridge failure followed by failures caused by hydraulic sources such as scour or flood and debris flow all agencies surveyed for the synthesis reported using visual inspection as the first tool when assessing bridge damage with nondestructive testing commonly used as a secondary approach to better locate and measure damage the synthesis found that most states have emergency response plans for extreme events but not all of those plans are tailored for response to bridge damage report funding and budgeting research development of a cost index for inhouse roadway maintenance work for the north carolina department of transportationtrb annual meeting paper  a cost index that represents how maintenance costs change over time is useful to transportation agencies for developing work plans and budgets over multiple years fhwas highway maintenance and operations cost index was discontinued in  and since then state transportation agencies have had to use available cost indices that are not specific to roadway maintenance this project developed cost indices for north carolina dot representing inhouse maintenance in the roadside maintenance traffic and bridge categories of the maintenance budget and then combined them into a composite index the methodology should overcome the limitations of fhwas previous index including the number of tasks included outdated units of measure and lack of guidance about goods and tasks included conference paper pavement repair and rehabilitation research systems preservation guide a planning process for local government management of transportation networksminnesota dot report local agencies are facing severe challenges in keeping roads safe and in good repair including aging infrastructure increasing material costs and stagnant or decreasing funding levels some local governments have considered unpaving roads but this is only one solution and likely to be unpopular except as a last resort this project developed an interactive resource guide including research tools and strategies to help local agencies communicate transportation system preservation needs to elected officials and the public the guide helps agencies define their preservation needs select preservation strategies select communication strategies and review lessons learned from pilot counties in minnesota report ranking of pavement preservation practices and methodssouth carolina dot report pavement preservation represents a proactive approach to maintaining road networks this project sought to identify methods to improve the implementation of pavement preservation strategies on asphalt roadways in south carolina with particular attention paid to pavements in the nonfederal aid secondary system recommendations to help improve the states roadway health include methods to identify pavement sections that are candidates for preservation activities a locallevel pavement evaluation system a preservation treatment selection support tool a methodology for tracking treatments to support future benefitcost analysis and training materials for dot personnel report preventing transverse bumps and cracks in new asphalt overlays over crack sealantscolorado dot report crack sealing is a common method for preserving asphalt pavements by preventing water intrusion into the pavement foundation however hotmix asphalt overlays placed on top of pavements containing crack sealants sometimes develop bumps and transverse cracking this fiveyear project sought to identify factors related to the appearance of these bumps and cracks researchers found that vibratory breakdown rolling pavement gradients sealant geometry tack coat application rate and tack coat adhesivity are the factors that most contribute to the occurrence of bumps and transverse cracks during overlay construction additional observations suggest that bumps and cracks are proportional to the size of the bow wave of asphalt in front of the breakdown roller which is dependent on mixture properties roller size speed vibration characteristics and pavement gradient report performancerelated specifications for emulsified asphaltic binders used in preservation surface treatmentsnchrp research report  the properties of the asphaltic binder used in a pavement preservation surface treatment are important to the treatments performance in practice however binders are often selected based on availability rather than performance this project produced recommended emulsion performance grade specifications for emulsions used in chip seals microsurfacing and spray seals it also evaluated tests of binder properties and developed test protocols for properties for which test methods previously were not available report algorithm and software for proactive pothole repairindiana dotpurdue university joint transportation research program report typically when potholes appear in pavement a repair crew is dispatched to patch the hole intending that the patch will last until a more permanent repair can be made this reactive approach means that potholes are often repaired too late to prevent further damage and it results in inefficient deployment of repair crews this study investigated the relation between traffic loads winter weather records and the number of potholes requiring patching to attempt to develop a model to predict pothole formation the research showed that traffic loads are more important to the formation of potholes on interstate highways than urban us highways and urban and rural state routes but that temperature is more important than traffic loads on rural routes while the findings are encouraging the project did not produce implementable results report chicagos lake shore drive a case study for rapid response to blowups and concrete joint investigationtrb annual meeting paper  lake shore drive is one of chicagos major thoroughfares and is composed of jointed plain concrete pavement with epoxycoated dowel bar reinforcement in the transverse joints extreme weather exposure and aging pavement has led to multiple pavement failures this project formulated and oversaw a repair procedure to eliminate further distresses and restore longterm ride quality and structural stability while meeting the citys logistical constraints for traffic closures using a patching material containing stone matrix asphalt with fractionated recycled asphalt product recycled asphalt shingles and groundtire rubber was found to be a sustainable approach that would stand up to the highways longterm environmental and traffic demands conference paper development of recommended guidelines for preservation treatments for bicycle routescalifornia department of transportation report this project was a followup to a previous study that evaluated the effects of pavement macrotexture on bicycle ride quality this study included a wider range of riders and bicycle types considered roughness and distresses and included measurements on urban streets state highways and county roads findings included that changes in caltrans chip seal gradation specifications resulted in higher macrotexture values that most slurry seals on city streets produced high acceptability rates and that the presence of distresses particularly cracking lowers the ratings that riders give to pavements report subscribe to this newsletter   how to fund your movie a guide to the basics of film finance skip to main content no film

this fast enough for k  how do i get lighting in my film guest author august   how to fund your movie a guide to the basics of film finance financing is an important and often dreaded aspect of the making of any movie without money films cant exist but its often the topic with the least amount of information floating around if youre considering funding a movie or producing a film matthew helderman has come up with a handy guide to get you started understanding all of the different ways you can get financing for a movie this is a guest post by matthew helderman of buffalo and bondit the difficulty in raising capital for any venture is twofold firstly the market is crowded with opportunities that are currently earning strong returns the stock markets the bond markets and the traditional high yield sectors of realestate speciality finance and lending all present solid outlooks financially secondly speculation is the killer of many financial deals who wants to invest in an opportunity when the return not only is unlikely but the timeline is completely unknown when raising capital for a film project  even more elements come in to play talent timeline creative and multiple financiers needing to feel comfortable with the structures and scheduling having raised capital many times in the past  our overview here is a sample of the realities currently presented in the private equity financing arena of independent feature films  and furthermore our ebook details a breakdown on bestpractices for structuring raise specifics before we go any further lets define the most common categories of film finance what are the different kinds of film financing equity hard cash investments made to your project by a single investor a group of investors and personal investments from colleaguesfamily equity investments require that the investor own a stake in the ﬁlm the llc or operating structure and must be paid back typically on their principal investment   before proﬁt is seen on the side of the filmmakers presales presales agreements are prearranged and executed contracts made with distributors before the ﬁlm is produced these agreements are based on the strength of the projects marketability and sales potential in each given territory a distributor will generate a value for your project given the script the attached talent and crew as well as the marketing approach and then enable you to take out a bank loan using the presales deal as collateral presales can also result in direct payment at a discounted rate from the buyer themselves presales investments require that the producer pay back the bank its loaned capital before proﬁting on their respective upside gap with partial equity raised you are then able to procure a loan from a bank or a private lender on the unsold territories of the ﬁlm and additional elements of collateral such as the intellectual property “ip” or corporate guarantees gap financing is only available when other elements have been assembled and there is adequate security for the investor to “bridge” against tax incentives individual state and country legislation enables producers to subsidize spent costs for production tax incentives require a producer to hire a certain number of local crew employees rent from local vendors and run payroll through local services tax credits are based on an application process and are often lengthy  months  difficult tedious paperwork to procure certain credits are sellable transferable and even tradeable based on the local legislation states such as new mexico north carolina georgia new york and michigan offer the strongest solutions deferred  crowdfunding producers are able to avoid nearly all costs on a project if they are able to negotiate a deferred deal deferred agreements basically state that crew cast vendors locations and services are all rendered up front at no cost until the ﬁlm generates money upon release deferred financing is difficult because experienced cast and crew are unwilling to work under these types of structures crowdfunding kickstarter indiegogo etc enables a donationsbased model for capital to be raised without selling equity private equity private equity investors are flooded with opportunities today with the traditional markets performing well the venture capital sector offering incredible teams and projects and the reemerging performance of realestate and lending how do you make your project stand out to these investors we’d like to believe it’s as simple as a strong script a great team with experience and a game plan for success  but it’s never that simple the key factor to private equity investors is to remove speculation  meaning when are they going to start earning a return and can you guarantee that the more speculation you remove by utilizing the steps below the better chance you’ll have of securing capital assets in “hard money agencies the talent agencies are a difficult nut to crack they are well guarded highly established and protected entities they are the gatekeepers of taste talent and possibility  and more than anything they are the lifeblood of the independent producer seeking to put projects together with financing step number one is finding a piece of material that excites you and that you believe you can rally a team behind remember you’ll be living with each film you produce for many years  so choose wisely once you have a piece of material get an agentagency excited about the project as well as with most of the entertainment business agents think in numbers how much will my firmi make from this deal incentivize the agency by offering them the ability to package the project  place multiple roles with their roster rather than just one or two roles  which gives them the ability to earn  of multiple deals across the board furthermore offer them the ability to have a first look opportunity for domestic sales representation  again finding ways to incentivize by packaging these elements early on you’ll be able to bring strong talent to the project and gear up to be more ready to approach equity players strength of team  experience a first time producerdirectorstar is a tough sell for many in the film business sales teams are unable to project value presell agents are unable to place large name talent packaging and financiers are unable to gauge project roi basic returns find a director who has carried a project before find an agency who is interested in packaging and will keep youyour project in the stratosphere of content that matters and you’ll be in a great starting position if you have to utilize unknown talents to make your project  surround them with experience on all fronts an unknown star with a strong director dp producer and writer is a reasonable recipe tax incentivespresalesdebtdomestic mg with your packaged talent signed on a strong team on board and a welldeveloped script you can now approach “soft money” options tax incentives are nothing new they offer a percentage of the instate spend back in rebate form meaning you can bankrollcashflow this piece to offset your investors risk presales are nothing new  they offer projections of value based on the elements you’ve brought together meaning you can bankrollcashflow this piece to offset your investors risk debt options are nothing new  is this starting to sound like a trend try to find ways to cover  cents of every dollar your investor is putting up before the cameras even turn on shoot in tax incentive rich states with a strong presold package and with a great salesteam onboard to execute you can then reduce the level of speculation and guarantee a return of x based on y investment in a tangible timeline plan of execution with these elements onboard make your investment proposal personable professional and tailored to your investors specifics do not pitch high level film financing to firsttime entertainment investors keep it simple aboveboard and remind them that while smoke  mirrors often run throughout the business you’re putting together a basic structure returning x on y investment over z timeline  they will respect you and your approach much more lastly look into completionguarantor bonds as a way to assure your investors that the project will be completed on time schedule and budget and with the elements they have agreed to finance the liability is now removed via a bond company and their return is partially guaranteed via incentives and additional softmoney pitch smart often and confidently knowing that you’ve done your homework and that the investment is wellstructured for a return link fund how to finance an independent film  ebook images courtesy of milad mosapoor buffalo  buffalo  productions was

sale uk your comment comment  leave this field blank post  comments its difficult to say with a straight face to investors that any independent film project has a good chance of return because the odds are really that it does not hopefully the crowd funding model continues to evolve and dominates as it theoretically promotes a more sincere end product money gained from investors on shakey claims of financial return encourages the making of films focused primarily on financial return more genre films horror films derivative films and endless films set in new orleans and atlanta cause that is where the tax breaks are of course there is room for all types creativity and business are inseparable when making features i would just personally prefer to see ones that the content is driven by creativity more than the business august   at pm edited september  am  reply share share this answer truthnuggets good thoughts my hope is that crowdfunding will continue to evolve in the direction of creativity with a mix of balanced business principles my fear is that the biz will figure out how to manipulate the structure and i worry government will regulate the innovation out of it i hope i am wrong about this august   at pm edited september  am  reply share share this answer refugee if you think like a great producer you turn a negative into a positive be upfront about film investment being a straight up gamble    and then talk up the elements in your package that excite them that make them think that if they win they can win big even if the odds are against august   at am edited september  am  reply share share this answer jps what is the point of talking it up like this though if the producers ultimately do not get the return they are promised that will inevitably become public information shit spreads wider than margarine whereupon further proof is added to the pile that independent film is a nogo for investors with full respect to you i must disagree with your definition of a great producer such a producer will not merely talk it up but actually find ways to realistically achieve the roi they promise even if that return is modest who needs a talker this town is full of those already august   at am edited september  am  reply share share this answer z i just cant stress enough the importance of selffunding ie not waiting til someone else funds

filmmaker  its good to see some articles about the sharp end of producing here we do need scripts we do need to know about new cameras etc but without this kind of info you cannot sustain yourself and move from production to production and grow your business august   at am edited september  am  reply share share this answer jps one thing they dont say about presales is that to bank the contract the presales agent not distributor has to be recognised by the bank as being reputable to take the presales estimate seriously also the presale estimate is base line in other words its the minimum guarantee value otherwise known as the mg the other hiccup is that its very unlikely a reputable sales agent will enter a mg without a star cast that is sellable in a variety of international territories that means you have to generally enter into a pay or play agreement with the star that means cash up front and a first day of principal photography date thats set in stone that if you fail to meet you lose the pay or play which can be a few hundred thousand thats high risk money and without it the rest of the contracts are unlikely to fall into place domino effect this is why funding low budget films through crowdfunding or direct investor relationships are much easier although still difficult to achieve august   at am edited september  am  reply share share this answer jps i keep hearing about the list as inlist of acting talent who have big audience followings in other countries territories outside the us as insame list of same acting talent that so many producers pre sales agents use over and over to impress and try to guarantee reasonble profits to the money people inotrder to get investment capital as insame list of same acting talent all the studios use for overseas marketauds projections while in the process of determining whether or not a certain genre movie has a more highly favorable process of profitabilty with those specific acting talents in those specific overseas territories lot of good points here in this article but no mention of the list guess access to market  auds informationdemographics is more important than a good script august   at am edited september  am  reply share share this answer mark i make my movies cheaply because i know im not going to make money on them my first film space trucker bruce wwwspacetruckerbrucecom will probably never make a profit but at least i didnt borrow money or have investors to pay back at the time i totally wanted to borrow and get investors at the time but im glad i didnt now i pay my crew and actors what i can afford and get people who are interested the nice thing about crowd funding is people are not expecting profit but want to help you make the movie august   at pm edited september  am  reply share share this answer anton walmart hoover linx august   at pm edited september  am  reply share share this answer wwwunlockuorg i like how paul osbourne put it he said basically when approaching investors you should have all your ducks in a row to show them that they have the potential to make money but remember individuals dont invest in low budget movies to make money they do it because they believe in the film they want to be able to tell their friends they made a movie and have fun with the process now if we are talking studio budget films then thats another story with these micro budgets and low budget find the people who can spend their fun money on an adventure they will enjoy and work your butt off to get them their money so they can have another adventure with you on your next project october   at pm  reply share share this answer caleb pearson director  producer  ceo  investment company – this is a term you have probably come across while trying to work
