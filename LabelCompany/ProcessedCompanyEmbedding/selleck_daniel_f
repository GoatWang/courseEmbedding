potent than simple nostalgia and audiences continued to welcome him in any role he essayedthe man who would spend a decade inextricably linked with bright hawaiian shirts was born in the decidedly untropical city of detroit mi on jan   four years later robert and martha relocated their young family to sherman oaks in californias san fernando valley selleck enjoyed a stable upbringing and excelled in baseball and basketball harboring dreams of playing professional sports instead enrolling in business at a local junior college after graduation from grant high school he was trying to build up grades to transfer to usc when a friend suggested that an acting class would be an easy a on his transcript with the encouragement of the teacher selleck began auditioning for commercials which he continued to do even after he was accepted into usc and landed a position on the usc trojans basketball team in  just three classes short of graduating with a business degree selleck quit usc and signed a contract with th century fox while waiting for that contract to turn him into a star he joined the national guard and was scheduled to ship off to fight in vietnam when the infamous riots broke out in watts selleck was fortunately reassigned to the los angeles neighborhood for riot control selleck resumed commercial auditions did print and fashion modeling and continued training with famed acting coach milton katselas at the beverly hills playhouse fox eventually dropped him but selleck worked tirelessly to support himself in search for that big break in  he launched his film career by playing the stud ogled by mae west in the notorious myra breckenridge  campfest he also landed a recurring role in the primetime drama brackens world nbc  a slew of bmovies like daughters of satan  and russ meyers the seven minutes  followed while the late s were marked by half a dozen failed pilots but also a costarring role opposite sam elliott in the western miniseries the sacketts nbc by  the strikingly goodlooking and admirably hardworking selleck had appeared in over  commercials had over a dozen film and tv credits to his name and was feeling confident about the increasing quality of his acting work that is why when universal called on him to anchor yet another action series pilot selleck was boldly honest about his opinion of the script for magnum pi he wanted something more from the clichéd main character  a flawless james bondtype womanizer  so negotiated rewrites that transformed thomas magnum into a fallible goofy and much more endearing private detective sellecks instinct to imbue a tall handsome heroiclooking figure with humility humor and an admitted lack of all the answers was spoton and the script came to life so did sellecks career before shooting had even begun on the pilot selleck was offered the lead as indiana jones in raiders of the lost ark  taking the role would have meant reneging on a freshlyinked contract with cbs and after much soulsearching the ethical actor decided to honor his commitment to the network the rest was history for both selleck and the penultimate indiana jones harrison fordmagnum pi debuted in the fall of  and quickly rose to the top of the ratings charts for its compelling blend of mystery action and comedy the show chronicled the life of former navy seal and vietnam veteran thomas magnum who lived on the lush hawaiian estate of a famous novelist and was responsible for its security the undemanding job allowed the charming adventurer plenty of free time to locate missing persons and break up drug smuggling rings it also allowed him free use of a ferrari  gts the estates livein manager  a bythebook former british sergeant major jonathan higgins john hillerman  was also part of the deal and the lovehate relationship between the polar opposites was an endless source of entertainment also crucial to the shows appeal was magnums camaraderie with veteran buddies tc william moseley who operated a helicopter shuttle service and rick larry manetti manager of a local bar with handy ties to the underworld the show was notable for being among the first to feature characters who were vietnam veterans and regularly included references to their experiences both during wartime and readjustment to civilian life selleck earned an emmy award for magnum in  a golden globe award in  and peoples choice awards in  and magnum catapulted selleck into stardom practically overnight and despite the fact that he was well into his thirties his face graced the covers of teenybopper magazines hot off the success of his tv gig he ventured back into feature films several times during his shows run delivering a dashing performance as a harddrinking pilot in the period adventure high road to china  and  in one of his biggest box office roles  as an unwitting cofather to an abandoned baby in the comedy three men and a baby  for the most part sellecks cinematic turns in her alibi  and mr baseball  were neither critical nor audience favorites though s quigley down under where he played an aussiebound american gunforhire who discovers that his target is tribal aborigines were cited as his best feature work then to dateselleck had served as executive producer on the last two seasons of magnum so in  he resumed that title for eight bl stryker abc  tv films starring burt reynolds he also produced a number of other tv movies including revealing evidence nbc  and silverfox abc  after his show went off the air in  selleck kept a low profile for the next few years unsatisfied with the roles he was being offered and enjoying the freedom to spend time with wife jillie mack and their young daughterbut in  he surprised and delighted audiences with a return to series tv in the recurring role of richard on the hit sitcom friends nbc  playing a family friendturned lover of monica gellers courteney coxarquette the wellreceived run critics and fans commented on how well preserved he was still sporting his omnipresent moustache reinvigorated sellecks career ramping him up for another round of westerns  his favorite genre  with executive producer and star status in ruby jean and j  usa  and last stand at saber river usa  selleck found himself in the headlines that same year when he took a supporting role in the big screen comedy in  out starring kevin kline as a college professor desperately trying to set the record straight after being outed during the academy award acceptance speech of a former student for sellecks role as a gay newspaper reporter who shares an onscreen kiss with the films star a real life newspaper tabloid inaccurately proclaimed selleck to be gay selleck successfully sued the tabloid and donated his settlement to a university program promoting ethics in journalism but it was not his only runin with an unkind press several years prior he had been forced to hold a press conference confirming his heterosexuality after a gay magazine falsely outed himbut his most notorious battle came years later in  when during an appearance on the rosie odonnell show syndicated  he and an emotional and opinionated odonnell sparred over gun control issues in an interview segment following sellecks appearance in a national rifle association ad for the powerful organization the interview had occurred shortly on the heels of the columbine school shooting that had shocked a nation so unsuspected was the onair attack from odonnell that after the dust had settled the cardcarrying nra member denied accusations that he was the rightwing heir to nra president charlton hestons throne citing his support of a wide variety of nonpartisan organizations and maintaining political identification as a registered independent the situation soured him on life in the public eyesellecks continuing popular appearances as monicas ex on friends led cbs to cast him in his first sitcom the closer cbs  in which he costarred with ed asner as a pair of advertising executives the show had its charm  not to mention an unusual song and dance fantasy sequence with guest star bernadette peters who earned an emmy nomination  but the show was shortlived at only  episodes selleck retreated to triedandtrue western territory with louis lamours crossfire trail usa  which reached the largest audience  million homes ever for an original cable movie and monte walsh usa  both of which he executiveproduced more unexpected than sellecks appearance as monicas boyfriend on friends was his totally bald appearance as general dwight d eisenhower in ike countdown to dday usa  sellecks portrayal of the great military strategic thinker navigating through one of the most pivotal moments in us history helped garner the production six emmy nominationsin  selleck began a longterm role as executive producer and star of a series of tv movies based on the jesse stone detective novels by robert b parker selleck was proudly responsible for the gritty filmlike feel of stone cold usa  night passage  and death in paradise  and earned an emmy nomination for playing the restless demonhaunted small town cop in s sea change sellecks positive reception led to a long overdue return to prime drama  in fall of  he was slated to join the cast of las vegas nbc  taking over as the new owner of the montecito resort  casino ironically just as selleck was enjoying the peak of his postmagnum career  and at an age where many actors would be resting on their laurels  imagine entertainment announced the  release of a big screen version of magnum pi starring matthew mcconaughey in the title role selleck turned down an offer to participate in the film feeling that audiences had finally allowed him leave the role in the past and move on to other just as rewarding parts as he continued the popular jesse stone string of tv movies he returned to the big screen in the romantic action comedy killers  as katherine heigls goodnatured
