column group  tcg l o a d i n g extraordinary starts here tcg is a sciencedriven venture capital firm with  billion in assets under management tcgs three funds are invested in a select group of early stage drug discovery companies with unique scientific platforms that can change the world mission  strategy the column group tcg is a sciencedriven venture capital firm that makes significant financial and operational commitments to build early stage drug discovery companies based on their unique scientific platforms and potential to deliver multiple breakthrough therapeuticstcg’s investment strategy runs counter to the prevailing trend in life sciences venture capital toward assembling diversified portfolios of later stage single productorientated companies across multiple industry sectors with proximity to value inflection points and the early identification of a pharma “buyer” as key investment considerationsin contrast tcg takes the long view in making investments recognizing that significant time is often required to generate significant value our approach is not “buildingtoexit” key variables including scientific opportunities the competitive and regulatory landscape and pharma priorities can change very rapidly instead tcg’s mission is the generation of fundamentally strong companies built from the ground up based on great science and the ability to generate multiple differentiated product opportunitiesrather than diversification tcg emphasizes focus we are dedicated to early stage drug discovery as the best source of a new generation of novel highly effective human therapies we believe that the most critical resources such as great ideas world class founders and top quality managerial and scientific talent are very rare and that concentrating them within a small cohort of companies is the key path to successtcg is about the bold pursuit of big ideas using innovative science to generate breakthrough therapies that address significant diseases our firm is committed to all facets of company building and brings together a rich combination of scientific financial and operational expertise to shape promising science into a valuerich portfolio poised to have a profound impact on human health tcgs success starts with idea generation having the capacity and connections across the scientific community to generate at least the germ of a powerful idea inhouse  that’s not something you find everywhere richard heyman ceo seragon pharmaceuticals the column group is a big science daretodream venture fund they identify large unmet needs in life sciences and back these ideas and teams with conviction bill rieflin ceo ngm biopharmaceuticals the driving force behind tcg is great science and the desire to start meaningful companies with a key platform component that will be here for the long term dr david baltimore science partner the column group our team  vital to the execution of tcg’s unique strategy is the ability to tap the extraordinary capabilities of its team comprising partners and science partners with decades of collective experience building operating and financing biotech companies as well as
