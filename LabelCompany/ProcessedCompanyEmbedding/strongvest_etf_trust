shares that are redeemable in creation units only  applicants also request an exemption from section d of the act and rule c under the act as secondary market trading in shares will take place at negotiated prices not at a current offering price described in a funds prospectus and not at a price based on nav applicants state that a secondary market trading in shares does not involve a fund as a party and will not result in dilution of an investment in shares and b to the extent different prices exist during a given trading day or from day to day such variances occur as a result of thirdparty market forces such as supply and demand therefore applicants assert that secondary market transactions in shares will not lead to discrimination or preferential treatment among purchasers

control or voting power or in connection with certain services transactions and underwritings ii excessive layering of fees and iii overly complex fund structures which are the concerns underlying the limits in sections da and b of the act  applicants request an exemption from sections a and a of the act to permit persons that are affiliated persons or second tier affiliates of the funds solely by virtue of certain ownership interests to effectuate purchases and redemptions inkind the deposit procedures for inkind purchases of creation units and the redemption procedures for inkind redemptions of creation units will be the same for all purchases and redemptions and deposit instruments and redemption instruments will be valued in the same manner as those portfolio positions currently held by the funds applicants also seek relief from the prohibitions on affiliated transactions in section a to permit a fund to sell its shares to and redeem its shares from a fund of funds and to engage in
