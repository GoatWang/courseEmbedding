llc issues open letter to shareholders of pimco dynamic credit income fund  business wire ironsides partners llc issues open letter to shareholders of pimco dynamic credit income fund encourages fellow stockholders to vote for its slate of board nominees ironsides’ nominees would take concrete steps to enhance shareholder value if elected april    pm eastern daylight time bostonbusiness wireironsides partners llc an investment management firm advising funds holding shares in pimco dynamic credit income fund nyse pci today issued the following open letter to pci shareholders from robert knapp founder and chief investment officer dear fellow pci shareholder allow me to open this letter with a simple question consider ironsides is a shareholder – like you ironsides only benefits if pci shares perform – like you pimco on the other hand is paid fees regardless of performance or the discount pimco and its nominees benefit from the status quo so who should you believe we are writing to you again in connection with pimco dynamic credit income fund “pci” upcoming meeting scheduled for april   funds advised by ironsides partners own over  mm worth of pci shares and ironsides has nominated two independent nominees for election as directors both ironsides and pimco as manager of pci have written to you explaining why we think our nominees will serve you best pimco has stated that “ironsides is pursuing a selfserving agenda” sounds serious right if you will take a moment to read this letter though we will set the record straight and highlight that pimco is distorting reality by mischaracterizing the mediocre actual returns of pci ironsides interests are aligned with yours ironsides is a shareholder although many of our clients are institutions ultimately the beneficiaries are individuals like most of you trying to save for retirement we only benefit if the shares perform what about pimco the manager of pci they earn fees  a lot of fees pimco was paid  million in management fees by you and me the shareholders of pci in  alone pimco has called ironsides “short term” oriented suggesting that somehow ironsides has interests different than any other shareholder but consider the steps that ironsides nominees will work for if elected to the board initiating a share repurchase plan to enhance the nav per share and narrow the discount evaluating a tender offer at nav considering other managers or alternative management arrangements what do these steps have in common they will reduce pimco’s fees while potentially improving shareholder returns so when pimco starts namecalling we hope you will reflect on who will really benefit from having the fresh perspective that ironsides’ nominees will provide all pci shareholders the discount harms shareholders pci shares have consistently traded at a discount to nav since shortly after the fund was launched in early  pimco blames this on “the volatile market environment that followed the launch of the fund in ” really could pimco possibly offer a more pathetic excuse other funds including several managed by pimco navigated the same volatility and trade at premiums pci has a  billion portfolio which we estimate could be liquidated in about a day there is no good reason for the shares of a liquid bond fund to trade at a  discount to nav despite pimco’s attempt to dismiss the discount it remains wide at  as of march   the discount represents  per share of lost value or in total over  million in lost shareholder funds this money belongs to you pimco is aggressive with leverage and derivatives pimco manages pci with very high leverage we calculate leverage by dividing total assets by net assets or  billion   billion at yearend which equals x the average leverage ratio in morningstar’s multisector peer group of closedend bond funds is x see table below pci also has significant derivative exposure to credit default swaps or “cds” principally written against default risk on russian government bonds insuring putin yikes and issuers such as petrobras of brazil mired in a corruption scandal that is destabilizing the brazilian government while pci’s prospectus includes standard legal disclosure saying these risky derivatives are possible pimco certainly does not explain the full dimension of the risk it is taking at yearend  pci was exposed to default risk on over  million worth of russian and brazilian issuers the market value of those credit default swaps is reported in its schedule of investments as approximately  million but if russia and petrobras were to default pci shareholders would be exposed to more than  million in losses   morningstar multisector bond funds name       ticker       leverage       tm trailing total return

sec filings total assetsnet assets   pci’s performance is mediocre – especially considering its leverage pimco has written to pci shareholders saying that its performance has been great stating that pci’s “total return has significantly outperformed the average performance of its peers” ironsides asks what peers and for that matter what strategy the fact is that pimco has never articulated a strategy for pci except “to earn current income” nowhere in pci’s documents can we find any articulation of the fund’s benchmark or geographic focus or credit quality focus or duration focus all we know is that pci is a “dynamic” income fund and hurrah that pimco has won morningstar awards well according to morningstar’s own numbers displayed in the table above pci’s performance ranks near the bottom of the “multisector bond” funds ironsides asks does this performance deserve a boastful defense in addition if we consider the high leverage and use of derivatives employed by pimco then we pci shareholders have reason for more than dissatisfaction we should be alarmed leverage amplifies returns with all its risky leverage and derivatives pci’s returns should have been much much higher pimco must go before the proxy contest began ironsides believed that with the fresh perspective of its director nominees a concerted effort by pimco to market pci and the repurchase of pci shares in the market that the discount could be eliminated in a cooperative process of working together with pimco and the other incumbent directors of pci but based on pimco’s conduct during the process and the desperate statements issued in what we believe is a clear attempt to preserve pimco’s fee stream over the interests of shareholders ironsides has concluded that a different manager is required pci’s proxy statement says that the incumbent independent nominees serve as directors or trustees on  different pimco or pimcoaffiliated funds how can these individuals possibly exercise independent judgment when they are being paid over  per year for these services pci shareholders deserve good performance and the elimination of the nav discount under pimco’s management they are getting neither
