looking for firebase instead data dumps the freebase api will be completely shutdown on aug   this page provides access to the last available data dump read more data dumps are a downloadable version of the data in freebase they constitute a snapshot of the data stored in freebase and the schema that structures it and are provided under the same ccby license the freebasewikidata mappings are provided under the cc license freebase triples freebase deleted triples freebasewikidata mappings license citing freebase triples this dataset contains every fact currently in freebase total triples

parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in

customers to accelerate the next generation of highperformance computing mobile and automotive products thanks to a new partnership that will tightly integrate ansys’ power integrity and reliability signoff technologies with synopsys’ physical implementation solution for indesign usage developers of innovative costeffective and reliable smart products need to quickly optimize validate and signoff their designs while designers have been using ansys and synopsys tools in combination for years the integrated solution will enable mutual customers to apply power integrity and reliability signoff technologies earlier in the design flow – empowering them to deliver innovative highperformance and reliable products faster while reducing power area and cost the integration of ansys’ industryleading platform for chip power and reliability signoff ansys® redhawk™ with synopsys’ bestinclass placeandroute solutions synopsys ic compiler™ ii will provide users earlier signoff accuracy within the synopsys design environment this integration will enable rapid design exploration design weakness detection optimization and thermalaware reliability through increased functionality within the placeandroute environment the indesign power integrity and reliability signoffdriven flow will eliminate late design changes and ensure consistency with final chippackagesystem signoff analyses with redhawk “this partnership is a continued step in synopsys’ strategy to bring more physical and signoff technologies earlier in the design flow within our synopsys digital design platform” said sassine ghazi senior vice president and cogeneral manager design group at synopsys “partnering with ansys enables synopsys to quickly deliver a reliability and thermaldriven design flow that is critical for designing the next generation of semiconductors” synopsys and ansys will also provide a feedback loop between the twogold standard solutions synopsys primetime® and ansys redhawk voltageaware timing analysis can be performed rapidly to avoid additional guardbanding and design margining “as the industry moves to more and more complex chips signoffdriven rail analysis needs to be available sooner in the physical design flow just like timing and design rule checking” said john lee general manager at ansys “we believe partnering with synopsys to bring our signoff technology into the synopsys indesign approach is the right way to accomplish this objective” “tsmc collaborates with our eda partners on silicon design solutions to enable our customers to achieve competitive performance power and area for their next generation electronic products” said suk lee tsmc senior director design infrastructure marketing division “this industry collaboration between synopsys and ansys provides an opportunity for them to take the collaboration a step further by enabling reliability and thermaldriven physical design built on the industry’s popular physical implementation and signoff solutions” “arm has been a longtime user of both synopsys and ansys technologies which have helped in the development of some of the most sophisticated cpu cores available in the market” said hobson bullman vice president and general manager tsg arm “this announced partnership will enable our semiconductor partners to optimize our ip within their soc designs earlier in the flow allowing more time to focus on reliable robust and energy efficient designs” both synopsys and ansys have been strong collaboration partners with mediatek to manage increasing manufacturing complexity and to
