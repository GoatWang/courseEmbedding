privacy policy the london stock exchange is using its core technology to become an investment industry service provider that offers companies both industrialised trading technology and direct trading services antoine shagoury joined the london stock exchange in february  as cio his first job was to oversee the replacement of legacy trading platform tradelect with the millenniumit system the london stock exchange acquired when it took over the srilanka based trading software maker for £m in september  adding the coo role to the cio job he was recently appointed coo and but retained his cio role his deep understanding of the technology will enable him to manage the integration of the exchange’s different businesses which rely heavily on technology the cio component of his role is also split in two on the one hand he manages the technology that keeps the business running here he focuses on efficiencies he spends about  of his time on this and has about  it staff globally working on projects such as virtualisation the introduction of business intelligence tools and using cloudbased crm and collaboration software on the other hand he is in charge of the systems that drive the business to which he dedicates considerably more of his time he has about  staff in this part of the business – which includes the provision of software to other trading venues – of which  staff have been added only in the last two years most are sri lankabased software developers shagoury says less time is required for corporate it because it is more stable as his operational role increases he is looking at ways to reduce the time spent on his corporate it role helping management in different divisions take on a more strategic technology role  “we will empower the leaders of different pillars of the business to take on a more strategic technology role” says shagoury maximising the performance of the trading platform in contrast heading up technology at the exchange puts him in charge of customerfacing systems none more important than the core trading platform since the london stock exchange migrated to the millenniumit platform in february  it has run smoothly in the last  months it has had no downtime the certainty is in stark contrast to the last couple of years of the net based tradelect system which experienced numerous highprofile outages the london stock exchange management realised it had reached the end of its life in a fastchanging sector and acted quickly to replace it now the core trading platform provides what shagoury describes as the three cs of certainty continuity and capacity to customers he is focused on adding services using the same platform that give customers industrialised packages that can be adapted to fit their requirements “all of this is possible now that the right technology is in place in the past we were limiting the business that could be done” says shagoury today the millennium software provides an extensible platform there are constant attempts to maximise performance reducing development time a few years ago when new exchanges known as multilateral trading facilities mtf appeared – following the liberalisation of the market – there was a race to be the fastest  reducing trading times or latency as it is known is an important differentiator to investment firms that use algorithmic software to automate massive volumes of trades milliseconds can make a huge difference today after reducing latency to about  microseconds from tradelects  milliseconds there is less focus on speed but the exchange’s software teams are busier than ever developing software to give customers more services and confidence “we are improving latency all the time – but it is not about speed but better risk control reporting and data” says shagoury the exchange uses agile software development techniques to introduce services to its customers in days rather than months  “over the last year we have created tighter working groups and teams” says shagoury working thus the business gets a realtime view of the development process and prototypes are created quickly much of the focus is to push the technical capability of the core system to the periphery to improve tools such as those to collect and distribute data and this to protect the market from potentially risky volatility  other ongoing developments include the introduction of common market and data access and the embedding of more intelligence into hardware industrialising trading technology at the same time the company’s software supplies business millenniumit – which grew about  last year – is focused on industrialising trading technology shagoury says the business wants to create systems that do not always have to be bespoke but are flexible enough to be offtheshelf  “we can ask customers what bits they want and we put them together” says shagoury but he says systems for the trading sector must enable exchanges to customise  “we can provide a common solution and exchanges can customise it so they don’t lose their identity” he says the supplies business is picking up new customers all the time and as more and more exchanges start using the millenniumit platform the better the exchange becomes at migrations  this is largely down to the industrialised nature of the software as well as moving its own trading venues onto millenniumit such as milanbased exchange borsa italiana it has also recently moved the johannesburg stock exchange and mongolian stock exchange to the platform “we are getting faster and faster delivering systems because it is industrialised” adds shagoury the fastmoving technology nature of the trading sector is rewarding for it professionals shagoury’s advice to it professionals of the future that have ambitions in the trading sector is to build a strong understanding of the business  “it is no good being a pure technology professional because you have to understand how to apply it”

people antoine shagoury cio london stock exchange james rundle jimrundle  mar  tweet   facebook   linkedin   save this article send to   print this page   when antoine shagoury took on the role of cio at the london stock exchange he embarked on an ambitious program of reform at the venerable but embattled institution several years on he reveals how technology is driving the growth of the entire business by james rundle the last  years have been a period of intense reflection and change for every traditional stock exchange fragmentation of liquidity in europe following the implementation of the markets in financial instruments directive mifid and the rise of multilateral trading facilities mtfs such as bats and chix threaten these institutions’ existence antoine shagoury cio at the london stock exchange lse found this challenge exciting rather than daunting the first thing that attracted him to the role was lse ceo xavier rolet and the senior management team’s vision of the future of the market and exchanges shagoury knew he could help make that vision a reality “i was prepared to change the tires on a truck moving at  miles per hour” he says “we took a calculated risk to build a system that would position us as the fastest exchange in the world and we turned our own world upside down to do it we rebuilt the exchange from the inside out from physical infrastructure systems and messaging protocols all the way through the organization and operating culture—everything was changed” that reform was long overdue—and sorely needed for several years technical hitches and misfires with its electronic trading system tradelect threatened the lse’s reputation for being a solid business that paired reliability with location presence and resources the exchange hadn’t reacted with enough speed to a rapidly transforming market “we didn’t have much choice” shagoury says “we had to do something and we had to do it soon we were facing a growing technical challenge from our competitors—we weren’t on a par with the speed of accessing our market and providing execution certainty to our clients  you can’t sustain your business like that and as a primary market you have to be able to facilitate the business that clients are demanding” the challenge with such a largescale reformation stemmed from the technical aspects as well as in maintaining the operation of the business the exchange’s public image was just as important and it necessitated a complex process by which the visual persona of the lse continued to project its presence while it changed its footing to become as nimble as its most agile competitor and as trusted as the most dependable institution adding value such an ambitious project required someone with a deep and abiding connection to and understanding of business and technology shagoury didn’t always fit the bill in high school he considered a career in corporate law and later found himself attracted to architecture finance was in his blood however as his father worked in the retail side of the industry and it was while helping him at work that shagoury found his niche “my real introduction to technology was working with my father as a teenager at his bank in new york” he explains “at that time there was a real push to adopt internetworking in retail banking and mortgage and loan origination was begin automated and i was a free resource i found that i enjoyed going through the technicalities such as getting systems up and running—even from the most basic level of connectivity and networking applications and configurations i really enjoyed it” thus shagoury switched to designing systems rather than buildings and working with digital plumbing rather than lead piping while at college in rochester ny his course gave him a perfect combination of the technical aspects that he’d enjoyed so much before as well as education on how it intertwined with business practices following his graduation and two years at datastream corp shagoury joined agency broker instinet which helped to instill in him a philosophy about business practice that he has carried throughout his career the culture at instinet was such that shagoury was constantly asked where he thought he could add value “they never limited you” he says as a result he was able to work in almost every area of the business—from the trading floors to technical operations “that excitement—that adrenaline—only added to the personal attraction” he says shagoury spent a decade at instinet interacting with clients and learning his trade through constant feedback from end users his progression from the position of manager in advanced clientsite engineering through to cto prepared him for taking on his next role at the american stock exchange amex in  first as a consultant and then as both an executive vice president and cio at amex it was a turnaround—shagoury would design systems implement them and then receive instant feedback from the floor traders about what worked and what didn’t it was a development ecosystem of sorts that worked in a cyclical loop amex was eventually bought by the new york stock exchange where shagoury continued specializing in the business side of operations management then in  the london stock exchange came calling quantum leap one aspect of shagoury’s personality that helps to explain his success at the lse is his boundless energy he doesn’t sit still for long he thinks quickly he talks fast and his sense of humor colors every point he makes and every memory he relates it’s no surprise that his reforms had a remarkably short gestation and implementation period the lse group bought millenniumit in  to strengthen its technology division and had seen success in terms of speed and reliability but it had to force through technical migration to the platform speedily in order to stay competitive expanding on that other exchanges—such as oslo børs last year—have also adopted it in all the lse has completed five migrations the most notable being the millennium rollout of the turquoise mtf followed by the main cash markets in the uk “i don’t think anyone in the market has ever done what we’ve done in such a short time period” he says “everything we’ve tried to do has been competitively levelsetting and feeds directly back into the business we had legacy platforms running the uk cash equity markets the retail bond markets and we had to introduce change but that wasn’t small change—it was a quantum change we were rebuilding everything from the physical connections and the means of accessing our systems to the protocols and languages that our clients use to connect to us then we were changing the actual systems themselves we changed our market delivered an extensible platform reduced operating costs and complexity and decreased latencies by an order of magnitude and that was anything but a simple process when you’re dealing with hundreds of clients—global institutions—you have to introduce that type of change in a way that isn’t destructive to their business their clients or to our markets” all of this was done over the course of one year and in technical terms it was four major structural overhauls of the lse’s system architecture—a phenomenal technological shift by any standard growth engine as the technology changed so too did the focus of the entire business the lse’s most recent results showed that its technology services division grew by  percent in a month period led by the success of millenniumit fundamentally the lse is still a place where clients are brought to market to raise capital and that will never change shagoury says but the ways in which the business as a whole will grow in the future are being driven by the technological aspects and services that the lse can provide “we’re the facilitator of the business and technology has become the engine that drives the business forward” he says “the acquisition of millenniumit has made us more technically flexible and responsive to client needs there are simple aspects such as performance and capacity but we have to bring it to the next level working with customers to develop new products and services with this growth the new challenge is to remain technically current and that’s not taken lightly now we’re at that point and we have to ask how we can harvest that maturity and the technical currency and keep delivering value to our business our clients and our marketplace” diversification is one of the key areas in which the lse has managed this along with its millenniumit migrations the exchange’s unavista system for posttrade services has grown significantly along with its other technologybased offerings such as its mtf turquoise the ability of the lse to create new indexlinked products and synthetic instruments rapidly and demonstrate them to clients says shagoury is also a growth point for the immediate future with regulatory reform at full speed in europe and the us he sees this as an area in which the lse can expand “i think there are  tremendous opportunities in risk management and surveillance i don’t mean the fundamental functions that people immediately think of but rather technical automation and providing the tools to enhance management of market and member interaction—‘regulating’ the market”  he says “can you manage notional risk at a user desk firm and market level and can you calculate it in real time while you’re trading on our markets can you detect fatfinger errors or programmatic errors on trading strategies or algorithms  that’s an area where we can grow and i think it’s a huge opportunity for the exchange the lse group and even the industry enhancing the ways we can match speed with market management certainty brings confidence back to the market and ultimately investors back to it—not just institutions but real individual investors” community service along with revamping from the inside out the lse has also had upsets on the business side in recent times nasdaq omx launched a hostile takeover bid in  that the lse managed to fend off while its own proposed merger with the tmx group fell through in mid since then however it has established more unique initiatives and has pursued a program of acquisition last month after a lengthy discussion period the lse posted a bid for a majority stake in lchclearnet which remains subject to shareholder approval the deal would allow the exchange to capitalize on regulatory reform for the trading of derivatives the lse has also been linked along with the singapore exchange with a bid for the london metal exchange in media reports although it declines to comment on this the lse also recently announced a project to post realtime share data on google an aspect of information dissemination that—coupled with the lse group’s purchase of ftse and the ability it now has to create new synthetics—plays into the idea of market improvement “the way i look at the google agreement is that it’s building the market not just from the professional side but from the investor side” shagoury says “opening the market so people understand what’s happening is part of our commitment our obligation it’s fundamental to the growth of capital markets driving information down to the individual investors if you look at some of the established retail markets the investor is a real driving force and that’s what you want to promote here too” this idea of a more communal approach to market economics through technology and other areas appeals to shagoury “capitalism is about wealth creation and we’re a part of that process but we’re also part of the economic community” he says “this community is global of course but we’re no less obligated to help support stability in that community there’s balance there it’s a great job that we have—we have to think and act globally  we can’t be biased toward one market this is again one of those companies where you have a rare opportunity to contribute and if you couple that with a topdown desire to drive a bottomup contribution to change that’s a great combination in any business” career defining for shagoury who describes himself as challengedriven this has been the project of a lifetime he cites his background at instinet and amex and coming from a supportive family where the emphasis was always placed on doing what you love as reasons why he is where he is today so what would shagoury’s ideal job be “you know i actually have no idea” he says “i love what i do and i can’t see it stopping unless i run out of energy” luckily for the lse that seems unlikely tweet   facebook   linkedin   save this article send to   print this page   topics exchanges  trading venues london stock exchange group lseg people
