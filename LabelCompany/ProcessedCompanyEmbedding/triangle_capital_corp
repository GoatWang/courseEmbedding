rating and  price target october   christopher r testa  this email address is being protected from spambots you need javascript enabled to view it investment conclusion we are initiating coverage of triangle capital corp tcap with a buy rating and  price target triangle is predominantly a subordinated lender with subordinated debt and second lien notes comprising  of the portfolio at fair value as of  compared with  of senior debt and first lien notes while this is certainly riskier given the subordinated position in the capital stack triangle utilizes conservative attachment point leverage weighted average net debtebitda when structuring its investments the attachment points are typically slightly above x through the company’s last dollar of risk the company had a rough start to the year as its former ceo retired during q which caused a significant hit to niishare  as did a reversal of dividend income they received the year prior backing out the onetime charges pertaining to the ceo’s retirement the company still earned only share of nii below the regular dividend of share in q before it was cut to share during the second quarter the company has emphasized that management grasps the reality of spread compression and are committed to preserving navshare two notions that we certainly agree with during q triangle completed a highly accretive secondary offering at a  premium to q navshare and raised an estimated  million in net proceeds the equity offering combined with what we expect will be additional sba debentures granted in  will likely permit robust portfolio growth without the need for further equity issuance through  and  our  price target implies an estimated  pnii of x dividend yield of  and pnav of x compared to the bdc sector averages of x
