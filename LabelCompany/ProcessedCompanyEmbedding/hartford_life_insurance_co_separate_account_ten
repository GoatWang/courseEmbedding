adverse effect on its business deferred acquisition costs dac and reserves management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates the most significant estimates include those used in determining deferred policy acquisition costs and the liability for future policyholder benefits and other policyholder funds although some variability is inherent in these estimates management believes the amounts provided are adequate deferred acquisition costs policy acquisition costs which include commissions and certain other expenses that vary with and are primarily associated with acquiring business are deferred and amortized over the estimated lives of the contracts usually  years deferred policy acquisition costs related to investment contracts and universal life type contracts are deferred and amortized using the retrospective deposit method under the retrospective deposit method acquisition costs are amortized in proportion to the present  table of contents value of expected gross profits from investment mortality and expense margins and surrender charges actual gross profits can vary from managements estimates resulting in increases or decreases in the rate of amortization management periodically reviews these estimates and evaluates the recoverability of the deferred acquisition cost asset when appropriate management revises its assumptions on the estimated gross profits of these contracts and the cumulative amortization for the books of business are reestimated and adjusted by a cumulative charge or credit to income the

premium paying period of the related policies in proportion to the ratio of the present value of annual expected premium income to the present value of total expected premium income adjustments are made each year to recognize actual experience as compared to assumed experience for the current period to date our experience has generally been consistent or favorable to the assumptions used in determining dac amortization however if we were to experience a material adverse deviation in certain critical assumptions including surrender rates mortality experience or investment performance there could be a negative affect to the companys reported earnings and shareholders equity reserves in accordance with applicable insurance regulations under which hartford life insurance company operates life insurance subsidiaries of the company establish and carry as liabilities actuarially determined reserves which are calculated to meet their future obligations reserves for life insurance and disability contracts are based on actuarially recognized methods using prescribed morbidity and mortality tables in general use in the united states which are modified to reflect the companys actual experience when appropriate these reserves are computed at amounts that with additions from estimated premiums to be received and with interest on such reserves compounded annually at certain assumed rates are expected to be sufficient to meet the companys policy obligations at their maturities or in the event of an insureds death reserves also include unearned premiums premium deposits claims incurred but not reported and claims reported but not yet paid reserves for assumed reinsurance are computed in a manner that is comparable to direct insurance reserves the liability for policy benefits for universal lifetype contracts and interestsensitive whole life policies is equal to the balance that accrues to the benefit of policyholders including credited interest amounts that have been assessed to compensate the company for services to be performed over future periods and any amounts previously assessed against policyholders that are refundable on termination of the contract for investment contracts policyholder liabilities are equal to the accumulated policy account values which consist of an accumulation of deposit payments plus credited interest less withdrawals and amounts assessed through the end of the period for the companys group disability policies the level of reserves is based on a variety of factors including particular diagnoses termination rates and benefit levels the persistency of the companys annuity and other interestsensitive life insurance reserves is enhanced by policy restrictions on the withdrawal of funds withdrawals in excess of allowable penaltyfree amounts are assessed a surrender charge during a penalty period which is usually at least seven years such surrender charge is initially a percentage of either the accumulation value or considerations received which varies by product and generally decreases gradually during the penalty period surrender charges are set at levels to protect the company from loss on early terminations and to reduce the likelihood of policyholders terminating their policies during periods of increasing interest rates thereby lengthening the effective duration of policy liabilities and

the investment at the end of the period the separate account may also advertise nonstandard total returns that predate the inception date of the separate account these nonstandardized total returns are calculated by assuming that the subaccounts have been in existence for the same periods as the underlying funds and by taking deductions for charges equal to those currently assessed against the

the following manner the net investment income per unit earned during a recent one month period is divided by the unit value on the last day of the period this figure includes the recurring charges at the separate account level including the annual maintenance fee a money market subaccount may advertise yield and effective yield the yield of a subaccount is based upon the income earned by the subaccount over a sevenday period and then annualized ie the income earned in the period is assumed to be earned every seven days over a week period and stated as a percentage of the investment

accumulation units and  the accumulation unit value the subaccount value is determined by multiplying the number of accumulation units by the accumulation unit value therefore on any valuation day your contract value reflects the investment performance of the subaccounts and will fluctuate with the performance of the underlying funds when premium payments are credited to your subaccounts they are converted into accumulation units by dividing the amount of your premium payments minus any premium taxes by the accumulation unit value for that day the more premium payments you put into your contract the more accumulation units you will own you decrease the number of accumulation units you have by requesting surrenders transferring money out of an account settling a death benefit claim or by annuitizing your contract to determine the current accumulation unit value we take the prior valuation days accumulation unit value and multiply it by the net investment factor for the current valuation day the net investment factor is used to measure the investment performance of a subaccount from one valuation day to the next the net investment factor for each subaccount equals  the net asset value per share of each fund held in the subaccount at the end of the current valuation day divided by  the net asset value per share of each fund held in the subaccount at the end of the prior

death certificate or other legal document acceptable to us plus  of the contract gain since the date the earnings protection benefit was added to your contract we determine any contract gain by comparing your contract value on the date you added the earnings protection benefit to your contract to your contract value on the date we calculate the death benefit we deduct any premium payments and add adjustments for any partial surrenders made during that time we make an adjustment for partial surrenders if the amount of a surrender is greater than the contract gain in the contract

earnings protection benefit when you purchased your contract  you made a single premium payment of   you took no partial surrenders  the contract value on the date we receive proof of death was  hartford would calculate the contract gain as follows  contract value on the date we receive proof of death equals   minus the contract value on the date the earnings protection benefit was added to your contract or    to determine if the cap applies  hartford calculates the contract value on the date the earnings protection benefit was added to your contract   plus premium payments made since that date   minus premium payments made in the  months prior to death  which equals  the cap is  of  which is  in this situation the cap applies so hartford takes  of  or  and adds that to the contract value on the date we receive proof of death and the total death benefit with the earnings protection benefit is  before you purchase the earnings protection benefit you should also consider the following  if your contract has no gain when hartford calculates the death benefit hartford will not pay an earnings protection benefit  partial surrenders can reduce or eliminate your contract gain so if you plan to make partial surrenders there may be no earnings protection benefit  if you transfer ownership of your contract to someone other than your spouse who would have been ineligible

the assignment or pledge of any portion of the value of the contract shall be treated as an amount received for purposes of this subparagraph a and the next subparagraph b v in general the transfer of the contract without full and adequate consideration will be treated as an amount received for purposes of this subparagraph a and the next subparagraph b this transfer rule does not apply however to certain transfers of property between spouses or incident to divorce vi in general any amount actually received under the contract as a death benefit including any optional death benefit or earnings protection benefit will be treated as an amount received for purposes of this subparagraph a and the next subparagraph b as a result hartford believes that for federal tax purposes the optional death benefit and the earnings protection benefit should be treated as an integral part of the contracts benefits eg as investment protection benefit and that any charges under the contract for the optional death benefit or the earnings protection benefit should not be treated as an amount received by the contract owner for purposes of this subparagraph a however it is possible that the irs could take a contrary position that some or all of these charges for the optional death benefit or the earnings protection benefit should be treated for federal tax purposes as an amount received under the contract eg as an amount distributed from the contract to pay for an additional benefit that should be treated as a benefit that is being provided by a separate contract for tax purposes ie by a separate contract that is not part of the annuity contract for tax purposes if the irs takes such a contrary position however then any beneficiary of an optional death benefit or an earnings protection benefit may be entitled to claim that some part of such death benefit is excludable from gross income for federal tax purposes eg as a death benefit that should be treated for tax purposes as if it were being provided by a separate contract that qualifies as a life insurance contract for tax purposes b distributions after annuity commencement date annuity payments made periodically after the annuity commencement date are includible in gross income to the extent the payments exceed the amount determined by the application of the ratio of the investment in the contract to the total amount of the payments to be made after the annuity commencement date the exclusion ratio i when the total of amounts excluded from income by application of the exclusion ratio is equal to the investment in the contract as of the annuity commencement date any additional payments including surrenders will be entirely includible in gross income ii if the annuity payments cease by reason of the death of the annuitant and as of the date of death the amount of annuity payments excluded from gross income by the exclusion ratio does not exceed the investment in the contract as of the annuity commencement date then the remaining portion of unrecovered investment shall be allowed as a deduction for the last taxable year of the annuitant iii generally nonperiodic amounts received or deemed received after the annuity commencement date are not entitled to any exclusion ratio and shall be fully includible in gross income however upon a full surrender after such date only the excess of the amount received after any surrender charge over the remaining investment in the contract shall be includible in gross income except to the extent that the aggregation rule referred to in the next subparagraph c may apply c aggregation of two or more annuity contracts contracts issued after october   by the same insurer or affiliated insurer to the same contract owner within the same calendar year other than certain contracts held in connection with a taxqualified retirement arrangement will be treated as one annuity contract for the purpose of determining the taxation of distributions prior to the annuity commencement date an annuity contract received in a taxfree exchange for another annuity contract or life insurance contract may be treated as a new contract for this purpose hartford believes that for any annuity subject to such aggregation the values under the contracts and the investment in the contracts will be added together to determine the taxation under subparagraph a above of amounts received or deemed received prior to the annuity commencement date withdrawals will first be treated as withdrawals of income until all of the income from all such contracts is withdrawn as of the date of this prospectus there are no regulations interpreting this provision d  penalty tax  applicable to certain withdrawals and annuity payments i if any amount is

contract will not be treated as an annuity contract for any period during which the investments made by the separate account or underlying fund are not adequately diversified if a contract is not treated as an annuity contract the contract owner will be subject to income tax on annual increases in cash value the treasury departments diversification regulations require among other things that  no more than  of the value of the total assets of the segregated asset account underlying a variable contract is represented by any one investment  no more than  is represented by any two investments  no more than  is represented by any three investments and  no more than  is represented by any four investments in determining whether the diversification standards are met all securities of the same issuer all interests in the same real property project and all interests in the same commodity are each treated as a single investment in the case of government securities each government agency or instrumentality is treated as a separate issuer a separate account must be in compliance with the diversification standards on the last day of each calendar quarter or within  days after the quarter ends if an insurance company inadvertently fails to meet the diversification requirements the company may still comply within a reasonable period and avoid the taxation of contract income on an ongoing basis however either the company or the contract owner must agree to pay the tax due for the period during which the diversification requirements were not met

code we intend to administer all contracts subject to the diversification requirements in a manner that will maintain adequate diversification  ownership of the assets in the separate account in order for a variable annuity contract to qualify for tax deferral assets in the separate accounts supporting the contract must be considered to be owned by the insurance company and not by the contract owner it is unclear under what circumstances an investor is considered to have enough control over the assets in the separate account to be considered the owner of the assets for tax purposes the irs has issued several rulings discussing investor control these rulings say that certain incidents of ownership by the contract owner such as the ability to select and control investments in a separate account will cause the contract owner to be treated as the owner of the assets for tax purposes in its explanation of the diversification regulations the treasury department recognized that the temporary regulations do not provide guidance concerning the circumstances in which investor control of the investments of a segregated asset account may cause the investor rather than the insurance company to be treated as the owner of the assets in the account the explanation further indicates that the temporary regulations provide that in appropriate cases a segregated asset account may include multiple subaccounts but do not specify the extent to which policyholders may direct their investments to particular subaccounts without being treated as the owners of the underlying assets guidance on this and other issues will be provided in regulations or revenue rulings under section d relating to the definition of variable contract the final regulations issued under section  did not provide guidance regarding investor control and as of the date of this prospectus guidance has yet to be issued we do not know if additional guidance will be issued if guidance is issued we do not know if it will have a retroactive effect due to the lack of specific guidance on investor control there is some uncertainty about when a contract owner is considered the owner of the assets for tax purposes we reserve the right to modify the contract as necessary to prevent you from being considered the owner of assets in the separate account d federal income tax withholding any portion of a

subaccounts performance information about a subaccount is based on the subaccounts past performance only and is no indication of future performance total return for all subaccounts when a subaccount advertises its standardized total return it will usually be calculated from the date of the inception of the subaccount for one five and ten year periods or some other relevant periods if the subaccount has not been in existence for at least ten years total return is measured by comparing the value of an investment in the subaccount at the beginning of the relevant period to the value of the investment at the end of the period to calculate standardized total return hartford uses a hypothetical initial premium payment of  and deducts for the mortality and risk expense charge the highest possible contingent deferred charge any applicable administrative charge and the annual maintenance fee n the formula hartford uses to calculate standardized total return is pt  erv in this calculation p represents a hypothetical initial premium payment of  t represents the average annual total return n represents the number of years and erv represents the redeemable value at the end of the period  pnd page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust nd in addition to the standardized total return the subaccount may advertise a nonstandardized total return these figures will usually be calculated from the date of inception of the underlying fund for one five and ten year periods or other relevant periods nonstandardized total return is measured in the same manner as the standardized total return described above except that the contingent deferred sales charge and the annual maintenance fee are not deducted therefore nonstandardized total return for a subaccount is higher than standardized total return for a subaccount yield for subaccounts if applicable the subaccounts may advertise yield in addition to total return at any time in the future yields may be higher or lower than past yields and past performance is no indication of future performance the standardized yield will be computed for periods beginning with the inception of the subaccount in the following manner the net investment income per accumulation unit earned during a onemonth period is divided by the accumulation unit value on the last day of the period this figure reflects deductions for the mortality and expense risk charge any applicable administrative charge and the annual maintenance fee  the formula hartford uses to calculate yield is yield  abcd   in this calculation a represents the net investment income earned during the period by the underlying fund b represents the expenses accrued for the period c represents the average daily number of accumulation units outstanding during the period and d represents the maximum offering price per accumulation unit on the last day of the period money market subaccounts a money market fund subaccount may advertise yield and effective yield yield and effective yield figures reflect the deductions for the contract which include the mortality and expense risk charge any applicable administrative charge and the annual maintenance fee at any time in the future current and effective yields may be higher or lower than past yields and past performance is no indication of future performance current yield of a money market fund subaccount is calculated for a sevenday period or the base period without taking into consideration any realized or unrealized gains or losses on shares of the underlying fund the first step in determining yield is to compute the base period return hartford takes a hypothetical account with a balance of one accumulation unit of the subaccount and calculates the net change in its value from the beginning of the base period to the end of the base period hartford then subtracts an amount equal to the total deductions for the contract and then divides that number by the value of the account at the beginning of the base period the result is  prd page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust rd the base period return or bpr once the base period return is calculated hartford then multiplies it by  to compute the current yield current yield is calculated to the nearest hundredth of one percent the formula for this calculation is yield  bpr x  where bpr  abc a is equal to the net change in value of a hypothetical account with a balance of one accumulation unit of the subaccount from the beginning of the base period to the end of the base period b is equal to the amount that hartford deducts for mortality and expense risk charge any applicable administrative charge and the annual maintenance fee c represents the value of the subaccount at the beginning of the base period effective yield is also calculated using the base period return the effective yield is calculated by adding  to the base period return and raising that result to a power equal to  divided by
