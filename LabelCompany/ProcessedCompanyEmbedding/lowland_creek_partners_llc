email more share this storyhighland creek partners canadas newest search fund now seeking targetstumblrpinterestgoogle pluslinkedinreddit the relationship between rameez ansari and steve lau started more than a decade back when both were students at the university of toronto they then went their separate ways — ansari to study at stanford and lau at wharton and both to work outside canada — before returning to canada where they became reacquainted they have now joined forces to form highland creek partners the country’s newest search fund the fund so named because it’s a street name near the campus they attended has raised seed capital from individual and institutional investors and is now seeking an acquisition a process that could take up to two years “we have funding for the next two years and we can call on capital from the group of investors for the acquisition” said ansari whose website details the individual and corporate investors john hunkin and paul rogers former senior executives at cibc in toronto and new york respectively are two notable canadian investors while hunkin is a first time search fund investor rogers is a veteran his firm rhv capital has invested in  search funds rogers said the decision to invest is based on understanding the “motivations” of the entrepreneurs behind the search fund “it is a risky thing to do and we want to ensure that they have thought through all of the pros and cons next we try to assess if they could actually run a business” said rogers adding he has seen lau in action “he tackled a tough strategic issue with insight and precision rameez is a remarkable individual having been an entrepreneur in pakistan prior to going to stanford” but more importantly rogers said they are “both humble guys who want to continually listen and learn” and both want to be more than investors they want to run a business – the second element to the search fund model “we both have a passion for operations” said lau added ansari “our aspiration is to run a company” search funds raise capital a little differently from other investment funds the capital raising occurs in two rounds with the first raise earmarked to run an office and allow ansari and lau to seek out an acquisition and the latter round to fund the purchase of a business as is the norm with any private company there is a markup between the price paid by the initial investors — who have rights of first refusal when an acquisition is presented to them — and all subsequent investors to find the acquisition ansari who worked with boston consulting group and lau who has worked with cpp investment board and td securities will use two approaches they will call on middlemen lawyers and accountants with contacts in the private company world and from their own research into industries they like the targets will be chosen because of their industry business and financial characteristics as well the owner must be seeking a way to reduce his role in the company a typical target would have  million —  million in revenue be profitable with steady cash flows and not overly complex “industry growth is the key” said ansari “because macro dominates micro” search funds started at stanford about four decades back but until recently hadn’t made much of dent in canada now there are at least two handfuls of such investment firms a number of which have bought business and are now running them  comments share your thoughts news videos fp street home capital repays  billion line of credit from berkshire hathaway four years ago omers bought civica for 63
