like ‘hey i really am losing my hair’ then it really got serious so i really started to look and research different places that could help me out and all the roads led me to bosley which i’m very pleased about” – jared h hair loss treatment options there are two main types of hair loss treatment options—surgical and nonsurgical  nonsurgical hair loss treatments include options like propecia or lasercomb surgical hair restoration can be performed by a bosley physician as either a follicular unit transfer fut or follicular unit extraction fue hair restoration for those suffering from hereditary hair loss there is unfortunately no hair loss cure in such cases medication like propecia rogaine and even the lasercomb may help to slow down the progression of hair thinning and baldness for early stages of hair thinning these hair loss solutions can help regrow some hair but they will not fully restore the hair and hairline that have been lost the only proven permanent solution to genetic hair loss is hair transplantation it works by surgically restoring hair from the donor area to the recipient thinning area while surgical hair transplantation is the only permanent and the most significant receding hairline treatment these other hair loss solutions can help in your fight against hair loss surgical hair transplantation surgical hair transplantation involves transplanting hair follicles from one area of the head called the donor area to another the recipient area most causes of hair loss may be traced to the hormone dht in hair transplantation dhtresistant follicles are removed from the scalp and artfully placed in thinning areas on the top and front of the head our patients find there are many benefits of hair transplantation over other treatment options you may also wish to see the steps involved in a bosley hair replacement procedure follicular unit extraction the bosley follicular unit extraction fue is a minimally invasive hair transplantation technique in which follicular unit grafts hair follicles are individually removed from the patient’s donor area and then individually transplanted to the recipient thinning area the grafts are removed using a

find out if a bosley hair restoration is right for you       “i really noticed my hair loss when i definitely turned  and it was kind of funny i did start to laugh like ‘hey i really am losing my hair’ then it really got serious so i really started to look and research different places that could help me out and all the roads led me to bosley which i’m very pleased about” – jared h hair loss treatment options there are two main types of hair loss treatment options—surgical and nonsurgical  nonsurgical hair loss treatments include options like propecia or lasercomb surgical hair restoration can be performed by a bosley physician as either a follicular unit transfer fut or follicular unit extraction fue hair restoration for those suffering from hereditary hair loss there is unfortunately no hair loss cure in such cases medication like propecia rogaine and even the lasercomb may help to slow down the progression of hair thinning and baldness for early stages of hair thinning these hair loss solutions can help regrow some hair but they will not fully restore the hair and hairline that have been lost the only proven permanent solution to genetic hair loss is hair transplantation it works by surgically restoring hair from the donor area to the recipient thinning area while surgical hair transplantation is the only permanent and the most significant receding hairline treatment these other hair loss solutions can help in your fight against hair loss surgical hair transplantation surgical hair transplantation involves transplanting hair follicles from one area of the head called the donor area to another the recipient area most causes of hair loss may be traced to the hormone dht in hair transplantation dhtresistant follicles are removed from the scalp and artfully placed in thinning areas on the top and front of the head our patients find there are many benefits of hair transplantation over other treatment options you may also wish to see the steps involved in a bosley hair replacement procedure follicular unit extraction the bosley follicular unit extraction fue is a minimally invasive hair transplantation technique in which follicular unit grafts hair follicles are individually removed from the patient’s donor area and then individually transplanted to the recipient thinning area the grafts are removed using a precision tool and then
