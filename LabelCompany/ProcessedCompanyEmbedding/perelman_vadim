along — for fate to smile upon methis quote needs a citation with this in mind perelman began to option the film rights to literary works he discovered house of sand and fog by andre dubus iii before it was an acclaimed bestseller and an oprah selection i closed that book after i finished it and through the tears managed to call my agent to check into the rights perelman got shawn otto to adapt the novel for the screen and went on to attach ben kingsley and jennifer connelly to the project raised financing and parked himself at the helm of his first feature film dreamworks acquired domestic distribution rights and released the film to great critical acclaim perelmans second feature film the life before her eyes was shot in  in connecticut the film independently financed by  productions

mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a

at least one fan in high finance these days vadim perelman  founder of los angelesbased hedge fund baker street capital first made news in september when he published a bullish report about sears holdings corps real estate portfolio yesterday he increased his stake in the company to  percent according to regulatory filings lifting his holdings to  million shares and optionshis  million shares are worth  million and his total holdings would be valued at almost  million assuming the options are priced at the same level as the stock baker street now ranks as the eighthlargest investor in sears according to bloomberg data regulatory filings indicate baker street owned  million shares of sears common as of june  purchased in the second quarter and equivalent to a  percent interest mr lampert remains sears top stockholder owning  percent of the hoffman estatesbased department store chainmr perelmans report estimated that sears real estate is conservatively worth more than  billion — a  percent premium over the entire companys current market cap of  billion at  a share some  billion the equivalent to  a share was attributed to sears top  owned stores and best  leases the report garnered media attention including two mentions in the wall street journal and sears stock climbed to a week high of  less than two months after the report was publishedsince then one analyst has argued that mr perelmans valuation of at least one property was too high chad brand founder of st louisbased peridot capital llc wrote that mr perelman and baker street pegged sears lease at torontos eaton center as worth  million but less than two months later sears decided to sell the lease along with four others back to the landlord for a total of  millionas mr brand wrote in a blog post even if you assume eaton center was by far the most valuable of the five stores lets say  million versus  million each for the other four baker street likely overestimated its value by  percentmr perelman reached by phone last night fired back saying that the  million number was simply illustrative and that sears canada property was not figured into his reports formal  billion valuation moreover he pointed out that the eaton center sale was only for about half of the property — sears handed over the first four floors and kept floors five through eight — meaning that the propertys total value was closer to his estimate than mr brand asserted mr perelman remains adamant that sears is a great value right now most other analysts have valued sears at  to  a share mr perelman said he stands behind his estimate that shares are worth  to  we clearly love the investment and we clearly added to it mr perelman said we think people completely misunderstand and underestimate eddiewe think the margin
