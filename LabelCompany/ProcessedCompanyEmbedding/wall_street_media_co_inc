wall street media co inc   wall street media is situated within the consulting services sector and looks to expand its services to companies of the utmost quality wall street media chooses to

pursuant to the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission the “sec” in the opinion of the company’s management all adjustments consisting of normal recurring adjustments and reclassifications and nonrecurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the results of operations and cash flows for the six months ended march   and the financial position as of march   have been made the results of operations for such interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the operating results to be expected for the full year certain information and disclosures normally included in the notes to the annual financial statements have been condensed or omitted from these interim condensed financial statements accordingly these interim condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto included in our report on form k as filed with the sec on december   the march   balance sheet is derived from those financial statements   use of estimates   the financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap”  these accounting principles require the company to make certain estimates judgments and assumptions  the company believes that the estimates judgments and assumptions upon which it relies are reasonable based upon information available at the time that these estimates judgments and assumptions are made  these estimates judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented  the financial statements would be affected to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require management’s judgment in its application  there are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result  significant estimates include the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets   cash and cash equivalents   the company considers financial instruments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents                revenue recognition   in accordance with asc  revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists products are delivered to and accepted by the customer economic risk of loss has passed to the customer the price is fixed or determinable collection is reasonably assured and any future obligations of the company are insignificant these criteria are generally met during the period when the development or consulting services are provided or completed   basic and diluted net income per common share   basic net income per share is computed by dividing the net income by the weighted average number of

if dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period  potentially dilutive securities consist of the incremental common shares issuable upon exercise of common stock equivalents such as stock options and convertible debt instruments  potentially dilutive securities are excluded from the computation if their effect is antidilutive there were no potentially dilutive securities

analysis of financial condition and results of operations   forwardlooking statements   there are statements in this quarterly report on form q that are not historical facts these “forwardlooking statements” can be identified by use of terminology such as “believe” “hope” “may” “anticipate” “should” “intend” “plan” “will” “expect” “estimate” “project” “positioned” “strategy” and similar expressions although management believes that the assumptions underlying the forwardlooking statements included in this quarterly report are reasonable they do not guarantee our future performance and are subject to certain risks uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict therefore actual results and outcomes may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in any such

selected its more subjective accounting estimation processes for purposes of explaining the methodology used in calculating the estimate in addition to the inherent uncertainties pertaining to the

material adverse impact on the company’s results of operations and financial condition   revenue recognition   revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists products are
