todays call on our website the key themes for the quarter are outlined on slide  the businesses delivered solid results in the third quarter especially given strong macroeconomic headwinds from market and interest rate volatility and the continued strengthening of the us dollar the results generated this quarter demonstrate the revenue and earnings stability that our diversified business mix provides in a variety of market conditions strong fundamentals and focused execution across our businesses resulted in total company operating earnings of  million in the third quarter driving the yeartodate total to  million yeartodate net income is strong at nearly  billion our continued ability to generate growth enables us to increase longterm value for shareholders through capital deployment last night we announced a fourth quarter common stock dividend of  per share and our board authorized a new share repurchase program these actions signal our confidence and our ability to grow earnings in  and beyond terry will provide additional details on third quarter financials including normalizing items that impacted results despite unusual items this quarter our businesses continued to achieve solid underlying growth on a trailing month basis total company net cash flows were  billion and we ended third quarter with  billion in assets under management strong investment performance continues to be a differentiator and is a foundation for future operating earnings growth  of the rated mutual funds or  have a fourstar or fivestar morningstar rating additionally as slide  shows at quarter end  of principals investment options were in the top two quartiles of morningstar rankings on a oneyear basis and  in the top two quartiles on a threeyear and fiveyear basis finally  of our target date funds were once again on the top two quartiles of morningstar rankings across all time periods at quarter end further enabling us to help more customers achieve financial success this performance translated into strong flows across our retail retirement and institutional platforms principal global investors ended the third quarter with total assets under management of  billion including  billion of unaffiliated assets under management third quarter unaffiliated net cash flows of  billion were a large portion of principal global investors third quarter net cash flows of  billion success across multiple asset classes along with our global distribution footprint have helped us build scale and drive strong growth principal funds had its rd consecutive quarter of positive net cash flows the combination of strong and diversified distribution channel and a broad mix of investment options aimed at solving for favorable outcomes drove strong sales of  billion for the quarter on a trailing month basis principal funds sales were up  and both our equity and fixed income flows were four times the industry average versus the same period a year ago third quarter  marked principal internationals th consecutive quarter of positive net cash flows on a trailing month basis net cash flows were  billion highlighting the negative impact foreign exchange has had on our results reported assets under management of  billion for principal international included a  billion negative impact from foreign exchange rates over the last  months more than a decade ago we focused principal internationals strategy to serve the retirement and longterm saving needs of the rapidly growing middle classes in select emerging markets we knew that emerging markets would have volatile time periods thats the nature of emerging markets however our consistently strong growth metrics in principal international demonstrate that the longterm growth opportunities outweigh bouts volatility despite the recent volatility in these markets tremendous growth opportunities remain and were just as confident as weve always been about our ability to capture market share and continue to grow over the longterm the success we have achieved in principal international is driven by two key advantages our expertise in providing the savings solutions customers seek and our partnership with marquee distribution networks which is critical for success in international markets for example our longterm exclusive distribution partnership with banco do brasil the largest bank in latin america provides us access to their large customer base where to date weve reached just  of their customer base as a stateowned bank with a quality reputation customers in brazil view banco do brasil as a safe haven particularly during volatile periods our tax advantaged individual retirement products remain in favor garnering brasilprev  billion of net cash flow in the third quarter this strengthened its position as the number one private retirement provider in terms of net cash flow and assets in addition during the quarter brasilprev received multiple awards including recognition as one of the most innovative companies in the brazil pension industry additionally our partnership with china construction bank the second largest bank in the world has generated  billion of net cash flows in china on a trailing month basis the continued growth in china makes us a formidable player in this market as other pension and other longterm savings opportunities materialize in china were well positioned to capitalize on those opportunities in this longterm strategic market another key focus is on enhancing and expanding distribution a main driver of growth in principal international has been our successful implementation of strategic acquisitions such as cuprum in chile and hsbc in mexico weve closed on the acquisition of axas pension business in hong kong on september  and the transition is proceeding smoothly the acquisition adds  billion of assets under management to our current business making us the fifth largest mandatory pension provider in hong kong importantly the deal includes a year exclusive distribution agreement with axas network of some  agents this provides additional opportunities to grow our market share as the mandatory and voluntary pension markets grow in hong kong turning to principal funds our ongoing advisor development efforts have driven doubledigit growth yeartodate and a number of advisors selling our funds to  principal funds is the th largest advisorsold fund family in the us and we continue to grow our market share our advisor centered distribution strategy provides us a competitive advantage for our us retirement business as well yeartodate alliance channels accounted for more than  of our full service accumulation sales third quarter sales of  billion were largely driven by sales in the small and medium size business market this market has been a longterm focus for principal as its historically been underserved additionally we continue to grow the number of plans in the large market as plan sponsors of all sizes seek our retirement benefit solutions for their employees in addition to building strong distribution partnerships weve built our leadership position in the retirement industry by providing solutions from hire through retire and we continue to successfully execute on that strategy the underlying growth metrics in full service accumulation remain strong with third quarter recurring deposits up  for the quarter and yeartodate plan count and active participants continue to increase as well this growth reflects our efforts to continue to expand participation and deferral rates through innovative plan design features in addition to improved employment trends the us is still the largest retirement market in the world and theres still a lot of work to be done as people are not yet saving enough for a comfortable retirement as a leader in the industry we remain actively engaged in working with others to ensure the proposed regulations from the department of labor protect efforts to help americans achieve a secure retirement providing protection solutions in addition to retirement and longterm savings options is important to our strategy of helping customers achieve financial success and specialty benefits our competitive benefit solutions and strong distribution networks helped drive an  increase in yeartodate normalized premiums and fees we continue to see inplan growth quarteroverquarter and the loss ratio remains favorable at the low end of our targeted range business market sales in individual life remained strong and made up nearly  of sales in third quarter these plans help small and medium size business owners with the business continuity strategies as well as enhance our total retirement suite through robust nonqualified plans in closing im excited about the tremendous longterm growth opportunities ahead i remain optimistic about our future despite continued global macroeconomic volatility im proud of our dedicated employees who continuously demonstrate their ability to execute on our strategy its their commitment to meeting the needs of our customers that will continue to successfully drive the company forward terry terrance j lillis  chief financial officer  executive vice president thanks dan this morning ill focus my comments on operating earnings for the quarter net income including performance of the investment portfolio and an update on capital deployment third quarter continued to build on the momentum from the first half of  as the fundamentals of our business remained strong however results were masked by ongoing macroeconomic headwinds operating earnings for the quarter were negatively impacted by the combination of the strengthening us dollar negative equity markets and lower interest rates the impact was partially offset by our annual actuarial model and assumption review in addition on a total company basis variable investment income was down compared to the prior year period due to lower than expected prepayments on us investments total company reported operating earnings were  million or  per share slide  shows the normalizing items for the quarter as we typically do in the third quarter we completed our annual review of actuarial models and assumptions the review resulted in a net benefit to operating earnings of  per share notable impacts of the review include reducing interest rate assumptions other assumption updates and model refinements other normalizing items for the quarter include a  negative impact from additional expense recognition in full service accumulation and individual annuities due to market declines as well as lower variable investment income in individual annuities and a net  negative impact to principal internationals earnings per share due to lower than expected encaje returns and an impairment resulting from the review of specific intangibles associated with our  purchase of claritas our brazilian mutual fund operation these were partially offset by higher than expected latin american inflation and variable investment income in chile on a normalized basis earnings per share were  down  from the normalized third quarter  after adjusting for foreign exchange third quarter earnings per share grew  over the year ago quarter additional detail about the actuarial review and intangible asset impairment is outlined on slide  at the end of the third quarter return on equity excluding aoci was  when we adjust the average equity for exchange rate movements the return on equity was  now ill discuss business unit results the accumulation businesses within retirement and investor services reported operating earnings of  million on a normalized basis operating earnings were  million for the third quarter  flat compared to the year ago quarter slide  shows that quarterly net revenue was up  compared to third quarter  and up  on a trailing month basis adjusting for the actuarial assumption review trailing months pretax return on net revenue was  this margin remains attractive and is within our guided range normalized full service accumulation operating earnings were  million down  from the year ago quarter due to lower revenue and slightly higher expenses net cash flows for full service accumulation were slightly negative for the quarter as we continued to balance growth and profitability yeartodate flows were a positive  billion and were still on track to end  within our targeted  to  of beginning year account values principal funds third quarter operating earnings were a record  million an increase of  over the prior year the trailing month pretax return on revenue continues to improve as we grow scale strong investment performance and flows contributed to account values of  billion at quarter end for the total principal funds complex individual annuities normalized operating earnings were  million for the quarter an  increase over the prior year quarter we continue to believe that the run rate for this business is in the  million to  million range in normal operating conditions looking at slide  operating earnings for the guaranteed businesses within retirement and investor services were  million full service payout had adverse mortality in the quarter that was within our expected range of fluctuations in the third quarter we had almost  million of full service payout sales bringing the yeartodate total to  billion we continue to approach our guaranteed businesses opportunistically turning to slide  principal global investors quarterly operating earnings were  million a  increase over the year ago quarter trailing month pretax margin was  an increase of  basis points over the same period a year ago net cash flows of  billion during the quarter highlight the confidence investors have in our diversified solutions the net cash flows have been driven by our yieldoriented products and are a direct result of our investment in our global distribution platform assets under management for principal global investors increased  over the prior year quarter to  billion unaffiliated assets under management ended the quarter at  billion also a  increase over the year ago quarter slide  shows normalized quarterly operating earnings for principal international of  million third quarter operating earnings were negatively impacted by  million due to foreign exchange on a quarteroverquarter comparison on a local currency basis principal international drove yearoveryear growth in the midteens included in the normalization is the  million impairment of intangibles in claritas our mutual fund operation in brazil the impairment recognizes the loss of some specific assets under management and distribution in force at the time of our  acquisition as investors sentiment shifted to less volatile fixed income investments claritas has largely maintained its assets under management by continuing to develop marketdriven investment solutions often leveraging the principals global asset management capabilities this global synergy is becoming a strong competitive advantage given recent regulatory changes allowing more brazilians access to overseas investments we remain committed to offering a broad lineup of appropriate longterm investments to our customers and claritas remains a critical piece of our latin american strategy as shown on slide  individual life reported  million of operating earnings in the third quarter reflecting a benefit from the actuarial assumption review and model enhancements the adjustments better reflect actual experience and are predominantly prior year experience adjustments normalized individual life operating earnings were  million for the quarter a  increase over a normalized prior year period helped by favorable claims experience on a trailing month basis the normalized operating margin was within our targeted range moving to slide  specialty benefits reported operating earnings were  million reflecting the benefit of the actuarial model enhancements normalized quarterly operating earnings were a record  million an  increase over the prior year quarter the normalized loss ratio for the quarter was  well within our expected range the normalized trailing month pretax operating margin remains strong and within our targeted range corporate operating losses were  million this includes expenses associated with the closing of the acquisition of axas pension business in hong kong we still anticipate fullyear  corporate operating losses to be in the previously announced range of  million to  million for the quarter total company net income was  million a strong result reflecting the benefit of our diversified business model net credit related losses were  million for the quarter and continue to be below our longterm expectations our capital deployment strategy remains balanced as we leverage multiple options to increase longterm value for shareholders slide  shows that yeartodate we have deployed  million of excess capital in the third quarter we closed on the axa acquisition paid a  common stock dividend and opportunistically repurchased  million of our shares yesterday we announced a  common stock dividend payable in the fourth quarter bringing our full year common stock dividend to  per share a  increase over the fullyear  common stock dividend with the fourth quarter dividend our  capital deployment amount will be nearly  billion additionally yesterday we announced that our board of directors authorized a  million share repurchase program with the recent completion of our previously  million authorization this new authorization is an acceleration of our  capital deployment plan and allows us to continue to repurchase shares opportunistically in closing this quarter demonstrates that our diversified business model positions us well for future growth in various economic environments this concludes our prepared remarks operators please open the call for questions questionandanswer session operator the first question comes from john nadel from piper jaffray john m nadel  piper jaffray  co broker good morning everybody dan i guess a question to start with the change in management recognizing that theres likely very little if any change in strategy just a question for you about capital deployment i realize that the longer term track record here on the acquisition side remains very sound but given the recent intangible impairments when you look at liongate and claritas i am curious whether you might have a different view about the method of deploying free cash flow and capital as we look forward daniel joseph houston  president chief executive officer  director yeah john thank you for the question just a couple of comments and ive got to appreciate your perspective but our capital strategy will remain the same its going to be a very balanced approach increasingly we become more driven by our fee businesses which gives us frankly more flexibility we can demonstrate through a lot of jims operations when i think about wm funds and morley and spectrum and origin and finisterre hsbc mexico these are really really strong results when i look at the luis cuprum axa brasilprev and the exclusive distribution agreement that was added to weve got actually a very strong track record of executing on successfully integrating companies that weve acquired supplementing our organic growth strategies having said that in the case of liongate that you cited liongate i think is a oneoff it was an asset class that our timing wasnt good the performance was underwhelming and caused us to lose a lot of the assets we recognized that we did our due diligence we did our look back and certainly understand perhaps how we could go about acquiring an asset like that in the future and frankly i would even put claritas in the same category thats a different sort of impairment on an intangible and maybe with that ill ask terry to provide some additional comments but again i would say john we remain quite confident about our ability to successfully execute our capital strategy terry terrance j lillis  chief financial officer  executive vice president hi john its terry john m nadel  piper jaffray  co broker no i – sorry terry yeah terrance j lillis  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah this is terry as you know each quarter we take a look at all of our assumptions but in the third quarter of each year we do a thorough review of the intangibles the goodwill as well for each of our businesses and thats similar to the actuarial model and assumption review that we also do and we look at all the tangibles as well as intangibles whether theyre finite lived or infinite lived and in this case in particular with claritas we reviewed it this quarter and we looked at the particular fund at the time of the purchase when we acquired claritas and the macroeconomic conditions have really changed and become much more challenging for the mutual fund business within brazil and as a result associated with this one particular fund that went out of favor and we had to impair the intangibles that were associated with it these were related to the investment management contract that we had the value of the customers in the fund the distribution agreements these all moved away from us and so we had to impair those specific impairments associated with that and we had to impact in the current quarter now thats about  million for the  of which we had  of that impairment now because of the timing of this we also looked at it in terms of the goodwill associated with claritas and we did not impair that which is probably more important to us in terms of the longterm as dan noted its a significant player in our latin american strategy both on the asset management side as well as on principal international and theyve proven themselves theyve actually replaced much of the assets under management by developing some other market driven investment solutions that have been very strong by leveraging as i mentioned earlier in the call principal global asset management capabilities and so it still has a competitive advantage for our product so we didnt feel that there was an impairment there now that being said and where the question would go is are there other impairments out there of goodwill or of an intangible but we do as we do with actuarial review and assumptions we do a thorough scrubbing of the goodwill and were seeing a strong cushion on all the remaining intangibles as well as goodwill hopefully that helps daniel joseph houston  president chief executive officer  director john did you have a followup question john m nadel  piper jaffray  co broker i appreciate that yeah i wanted to ask a question about principal international in particular i guess i wanted to focus on latin america obviously flows remain positive but net flows slowed down and i dont think thats that surprising but i was wondering if we could get an update on conditions locally particularly in areas such as brazil chile and maybe even mexico where clearly the economies are weaker and in the case of brazil in particular theres been a lot of press about the very worried state of the pension market there and what a mess that is economically for the country and im wondering what you think it might mean for principals opportunities daniel joseph houston  president chief executive officer  director yeah really good question john so i appreciate that and ill make a couple of overarching comments and then flip it over to luis to add some color its an important driver for pfg it represents roughly  of our earnings and i would just remind everyone on the call weve got  consecutive quarters of positive net cash flow that are being driven by principal international and id also say that we have tremendous partners i think about china construction bank and banco do brasil who are very much entrenched in these local markets and add enormous firepower to our ability to distribute our products and when we do our look back on places like china and india and brazil and mexico and chile some things havent changed theyre still a very significant emerging class growing these are middle income investors and people who will save for retirement aging the demographics are even more severe than they are here in the us so they need these products they need these solutions we know government is not in a position to take over these responsibilities in any of these countries and we know that to date theyve embraced very much a private sector approach to solving the problems but with that let me throw it over to luis to add some additional color john on those specific countries you cited john m nadel  piper jaffray  co broker thank you dan luis valdés  presidentprincipal international thanks dan john a very good question indeed particularly talking about mexico brazil and chile and where they are at three different countries three different problems totally different in brazil essentially what we have we have a country which is certainly fixable that the political crisis is obstructing the economys recovery and meanwhile were going to live within this economic – political turmoil its going to be very difficult that the fiscal adjustment that is really needed is going to go through so probably were going to have another year year and a half that were going to see this political turmoil that certainly the brazilians are going to be able to fix this whatever is going to be that solution if the minister of finance currently levy he knows very well what they have to do but politically speaking he has to be unleash in order to fix the problem as i am saying brazil is fixable what dan said is very important the fundamentals in brazil there will remain and the proof of that is that that strong and big and large middle class is the one that is keeping our net customer cash flows in a very positive environment month after month and quarter after quarter and we continue growing and if you are looking our results coming from brazil and you particularly are paying attention brasilprev is putting in nominal terms and in us terms its demonstrating a flat result yearoveryear in the nine months period ended it means it has been able to grow at  plus yearoveryear the situation for mexico is a little bit different the situation is a much more stable economy very tied to the us economy so we have to pay a lot of attention about what is going to happen to the us economy and then were going to have some conclusions about mexico unfortunately they went through very important reforms particularly the energy reform the most important reform wrong timing but we will see what is going to happen but mexico we are not – mexico is in a total different stage chile they have to readjust their economy a little bit they are highly dependent on the commodity cycle they have to readjust their macroeconomics but chile is still a double a minus country so they have the highest rating among the emerging countries in latin america so our strategy – we remain very clear with our strategy is the right combination between voluntary money and compulsory money and has been proved that is a very solid and sound and successful strategy and we see that we dont have any reason to start changing our strategy and we remain very confident about the future of our operations in latin america daniel joseph houston  president chief executive officer  director very good thanks john for your question john m nadel  piper jaffray  co broker really really appreciate the color thank you so much daniel joseph houston  president chief executive officer  director very good operator your next question is from ryan krueger from kbw ryan j krueger  keefe bruyette  woods inc hi thanks good morning first just a separate followup on the international business it looked like china earnings were up pretty significantly i was just hoping you could give a little bit of an update on whats going on there and if thats sustainable daniel joseph houston  president chief executive officer  director yeah ryan thank you and yeah youre right this is a quarter that weve called that out it has increasingly become significant both from a profitability perspective net cash flow as well as sales and so luis you want to go ahead and provide some additional color luis valdés  presidentprincipal international yes absolutely ryan i mean – and again this is the result of our own strategy as we have said were very much more patient oriented longterm saving oriented so our offering and value proposition in all of those markets is in that sense so as long as we start having this kind of choppy road in china and very volatile market essentially what is happening is customers are flying into – they fly to quality and they are looking for a safe harbor and that is exactly what were offering there so were perceived in our jv attached to the ccb which is the second largest bank in china we are perceived as a safe harbor and we have had this tremendous amount of net customer cash flow so that in essence in one year we doubled the size of our company so were running a company with  billion in total aums and we think that were going to continue looking and facing that kind of reality so all these kind of things that happened in china the wealth management products and the shadow banking system it seems to me that money is playing away from that kind of solutions and looking for very serious managers and partners like we are in china ryan j krueger  keefe bruyette  woods inc thanks yeah very helpful thank you and just shifting to fsa can you talk about the pipeline as well as just generally what youre seeing in terms of plan sponsors and proposal activity and retention levels daniel joseph houston  president chief executive officer  director yeah very good ill make a couple overarching comments and then throw that over to nora everett to answer some questions i was reflecting on this in preparation of the call just a couple of weeks ago we hosted roughly  of our clients down in florida this would have been larger clients and its an opportunity to sit down face to face with our client council it also is an opportunity to spend a couple of days just getting to know them better and to hear their candid views and i walked away with a few one was they value what we do significantly we are making a difference they increasingly look at us as an outsourced partner to handle matters related to their benefits and in particular as it relates to the retirement plan i was reminded about how much the relationships matter in this they are very close to their relationship managers and we have a longtenured group of professionals out there that work with our clients every day then i also couldnt help but notice during our session regarding investment choice and performance jim was there and presented along with other peers or his contemporaries to present our platform and as you know we have very strong investment performance which is well received by our clients and then lastly it seems like most of the conversation isnt around the funds and fees it was around what can we help them with as it relates to plan design to get to better outcomes and maybe with that ill just throw it over to nora to help answer specific questions on the pipeline and outlook for fsa nora mary everett  presidentretirement  investor services sure good morning ryan were actually really pleased with the growth and momentum in our pipeline as you know we dont give sales guidance but were seeing double digit increase in that pipeline now remember the lifecycle the sales cycle here can be rather long so a lot of that well see impact in  but were particularly happy to see that our core smb and the core smb space were seeing that pipeline build and we expect typically over half of our new sales av account values to be in that smb space so continued success with our alliance firms continued success with our tpa channel and in particular this total retirement suite differentiator of ours we see that on the sales front and continue to see pretty significant build around that trs suite so even though were not giving sales guidance i would point you to net cash flow we expect to meet the guidance weve given between  and  beginning of the year account value i would say that given what we see today it will likely be the lower end of that range and theres always the caveat in our business that one or two plan decisions whether its timing or something else can shift that number a bit so were always a little bit careful about trying to predict but with that said were really pleased with the growth and momentum in that sales pipeline daniel joseph houston  president chief executive officer  director ryan thanks for your question ryan j krueger  keefe bruyette  woods inc thank you operator your next question comes from tom gallagher from credit suisse thomas george gallagher  credit suisse securities usa llc broker hi first question is on the actuarial review and the  basis point reduction in interest rates can you comment on the long end of the curve where does that put you from an absolute standpoint what is the absolute rate assumption that youre now using thats question number one and then just relatedly can you talk about the mechanics that resulted in no net charge and the fact that it was favorable overall what were the other offsets within the assumptions that more than offset the negative impact of interest rates daniel joseph houston  president chief executive officer  director very good thanks tom for those questions ill just have terry go ahead and respond terrance j lillis  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah tom this is terry on the long end of the interest rates we look at the  years out plus and as you can do with any actuarial reserve we try to make our current best estimate of whats going to happen in the future and none of us have a clear crystal ball in it but what we do is we look out and see what the trends are and then make some adjustments back in  we looked at the longterm interest rate and lowered it as well and also changed the trajectory of it but now were seeing that that interest rate environment is staying longer and longer out into the future so we looked out  years and we lowered our longterm rate by  basis points now that is meaningful probably most for the life insurance business the other businesses have a shorter duration so when we look at the trajectory to get to that longer term rate we also took an impact on that and smoothed out or reduced that shortterm rate so the impact that we saw was probably closer in that  million to  million range offsetting that though as i mentioned before we have to look at our current best estimate on all the actuarial balances reserve dac we have to look at what else is out there in terms of other refinements on how we recognize reinsurance premium mortality improvement we looked at revenues et cetera and so – and margin out into the future anything that might affect egp so there were more than positive offsets that we have reflected to our experience on the business that weve written in the past and predominantly in the life area most of that has been due to prior year experiences so the current guidance current gaap guidance that were utilizing is to come up with our best estimate where we think itll be in the future and as a result we took a reduction in longterm interest rate but we backed up these others so it created a huge amount of noise this quarter and it varied by different business units but in large part the lower interest rate environment was a negative more than offset by our experience adjustments in terms of mortality and other model enhancements hopefully that helps thomas george gallagher  credit suisse securities usa llc broker that was helpful terry so after making the  basis point reduction and i heard you on the life insurance side that was the most impacted business what is the actual level you are now at when you look at the very long duration interest rate assumption what is the absolute level right now terrance j lillis  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah the absolute level we probably – were not going to share that in terms of the absolute level because theres multiple parts to it there is the risk free rate we could use a year treasury as an example of that we also look at the spreads that we would price for and what were getting on our investments default rates credit analysis et cetera so there is a lot of things that come into it which were not going to share in terms of what we think were the absolute rate would be but just to give you a little bit of color little color as i mentioned earlier the longer term end of the curve that probably affects the life business the most some of our other businesses have shorter durations so the shape of the yield curve is very important as well so if you were to say right now we would say and just used as a riskfree rate of return for our businesses just as a proxy but you have to look all along the yield curve use the year treasury where it currently is right now and a year treasury is around that  range at what we look out into the future is over the next  years it would grade up to probably maybe  basis points a year for the next  years thomas george gallagher  credit suisse securities usa llc broker right terrance j lillis  chief financial officer  executive vice president and your guess is as good as ours and then it probably remains flat thereafter so that kind of gives you an idea where were looking out  years but then on top of that you have to put our pricing assumptions or spreads that were getting et cetera so that gives you a little bit of a basis point was that helpful thomas george gallagher  credit suisse securities usa llc broker okay okay thanks and then just – and just one followup question just on hong kong i saw earnings came down a bit and i know you have the acquisition going on there but i believe you mentioned the restructuring or costs associated with integration were flowing through corporate other so can you give a little help on the earnings progression that were going to see from axa hong kong and timing around that how thats going to earn in from an earnings contribution standpoint daniel joseph houston  president chief executive officer  director yeah very good luis can give you some color on that luis valdés  presidentprincipal international okay tom essentially meanwhile we are going through the integration of axa for the next quarter axa is going to be neutral if not a little bit negative for hong kong next year were expecting something in the range of  million to  million total impact in our aftertax oe for hong kong does that help thomas george gallagher  credit suisse securities usa llc broker yes thank you terrance j lillis  chief financial officer  executive vice president tom this is terry im going to add just a little bit you mentioned in the corporate segment this quarter we only included the closing costs associated with that and then the rest of it in the future will come through principal international thomas george gallagher  credit suisse securities usa llc broker got you thank you daniel joseph houston  president chief executive officer  director okay thanks for calling in tom operator our next question is from sean dargan from macquarie sean dargan  macquarie capital usa inc thanks and good morning i have a question about your capital deployment strategy last year we saw three different dividend raises over the course of the calendar year its been flat at  over the four quarters this year youve talked about getting to a  payout ratio im just wondering if anythings changed in your thinking daniel joseph houston  president chief executive officer  director no not at all sean and again thanks for calling in this morning our commitment still remains the same relative to our dividend payout if you look at it over a trailing month basis its up  the targeted payout still is right at  i think if you did your math its somewhere around  today so its right well within the range and that over the course of the next couple of years we would expect to have the dividend securely at that  absent something dramatic happening so hopefully that helps sean dargan  macquarie capital usa inc it does thanks and coming back to principal international the underlying trends have been okay i guess considering whats been going on in the local markets but the us gaap results are obviously being obfuscated by the fx headwinds have you given any thought to hedging the income statement impact of fx or is it just too expensive now daniel joseph houston  president chief executive officer  director yeah with that maybe ill have terry go ahead and tackle that question terrance j lillis  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah sean this is terry as we look at this we see this as more of a translation issue the revenue thats generated in the international companies also has expense associated with it at the same currency rate and so were really translating it back to the us so if we were to try to hedge this first off it would be very expensive because were in multiple countries second we wouldnt get hedge accounting treatment so wed just create some additional volatility we just see that this is a translation so thats why we provide the information on a local currency basis as well as try to give the impact of what it would be in terms of midteen growth rate were probably mid to upper teen growth rate in terms of this business on a local currency basis now thats translation but when it comes to an economic impact where we actually are moving capital from one jurisdiction to another well make a call and actually hedge that flows so that we do not lose the value at the time that the earnings are generated so we do make a call in terms of hedging money but as youve seen weve generated a lot of earnings outside the us and an example of it is in the latin america as you pointed out or as pointed out before and doing the axa acquisition in hong kong the money never even got back to the us so well make sure that the capital gets appropriately hedged as it goes from jurisdiction to jurisdiction but in terms of operating earnings were just trying to provide a little bit more clarity on a local currency basis and not incur the additional cost for the translation i hope that helps sean dargan  macquarie capital usa inc it does terry thank you daniel joseph houston  president chief executive officer  director sean we do spend a lot of time internally modeling these sorts of potential ideas to either hedge or not to hedge its not by accident or lack of a lot of thought that gets us to where were at with our current policies and strategies and if the dollar should ever weaken and we should see these foreign currencies gain some strength there is certainly some upside and some tailwind so thanks for the question operator your next question is from michael kovac from goldman sachs mike e kovac  goldman sachs  co great thanks for taking my question im just wondering given the multiples that weve seen come down in asset managers across the board how does this change any sort of opportunities that you might see for future ma daniel joseph houston  president chief executive officer  director yeah very good and i appreciate that let me make a couple of comments then flip it to jim we do keep a very active list of those asset classes that we think that could be complementary to our existing platform we look for potential strategies that would be uncorrelated that would support our global platform whether thats for retail or retirement or institutional investors and again i think our track record speaks for itself as it relates to our ability to leverage that into either separate accounts or mutual funds institutionally managed accounts separately managed accounts collective investment trust and so with that maybe jim you could provide some color on valuations of these properties and where youre going james p mccaughan  president global asset management  chief executive officer principal global investors yes michael you are right that multiples on many of the transactions over the last few years have been very high and if youd asked me three years ago about the balance between organic and growth by acquisitions i would have thought three years ago wed have done more acquisitions but in fact with the high multiples we have been extremely focused on organic growth and hopefully that will continue to come through the numbers as regards to one or two recent transactions that lower multiples and the talk of lower multiples yes thats something well be watching i would say though that the lower multiples have tended to be on firms that dont really have the kind of growth edge that were looking for in an acquisition were looking as dan said for complementary capabilities that we can really work with our clients to use whichever clients youre talking about whether its insurance full service the mutual fund company the international distribution and were not seeing that a lot in the companies that are coming through at cheaper multiples so i dont think its a step change but well be watching it and i think on balance the next three years could see a bit more acquisition opportunities in asset management than the last three did but i dont feel that its necessary for us to grow i think our organic story is sufficiently strong on its own daniel joseph houston  president chief executive officer  director michael hopefully youll be able to join us on our investor workshop on november  jim will probably get into some of those details with more depth and understanding and some of the obvious questions are how are you able to maintain such positive net cash flow in an environment where so many of the dollars are going to passive and i think it has a lot to do with the strategies that were created within the funds business and with jims institutional asset management business to work the edges as opposed to going right down the middle on some of these large cap strategies that are tending to migrate towards passive so again hopefully you can join us for that meeting on the th of november mike e kovac  goldman sachs  co yes great looking forward to that daniel joseph houston  president chief executive officer  director okay thank you michael for the call operator your next question comes from erik bass from citigroup erik j bass  citigroup global markets inc broker hi thank you i just had a couple of followup questions on principal international first on the axa acquisition i just want to make sure i followed on luis comment correctly about the earnings expectations for next year was that  million to  million after tax the expectation for the full year or on a quarterly run rate and thinking that youre putting up about  million of capital if thats the full year impact it seems like a relatively low roe daniel joseph houston  president chief executive officer  director okay thanks erik luis luis valdés  presidentprincipal international yes erik thats a good question next year were not going to be able to enjoy all the synergies that were going to enjoy particularly in  and this is due to many contracts that are tied to the axa block of business particularly with best serve and other asset managers so were going to transition that block of business in the very first six months of  so in essence my answer for you is that were going to enjoy just  of those synergies in the first year and full synergies in  erik erik j bass  citigroup global markets inc broker got it thank you that helps and then terry just wanted to follow up on your comments around the impairments so i think were you speaking specifically about claritas of no future impairments that you see on the horizon or was that about all international acquisitions broadly and one thing to just clarify there im assuming when you do your test its all based on local currency results and currency is not a factor is that correct terrance j lillis  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah thats correct erik this is terry the impairments that we did we look at all the intangibles and goodwill across all of our entities not just claritas claritas is the one where we actually found an impairment this quarter but weve looked at every one of them we scrub every one of them and we do scrub them on a local currency basis as well as you pointed out but across all of our goodwill all of our intangibles we found that we have a significant cushion that we are not looking to impair any of those other entities across them that goes back to entities that we acquired many years ago erik j bass  citigroup global markets inc broker got it thank you and just a final thing just following up on the good response to seans question how much of the  to  of earnings that you talk about is deployable capital how much of that is contributed from the international business at this point i guess thinking about it how much of the cash flow actually gets to the holding company daniel joseph houston  president chief executive officer  director terry you want to terrance j lillis  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah yeah if i look at principal international it goes to different holding companies we have a uk holding company we also have a us holding company and most of the earnings that are generated out of principal international come up through that uk holding company or entities there so for example the earnings that are generated in the  million or above well use some of that for organic growth within those businesses and we also have a large portion of it available for acquisitions to fund their own acquisitions within principal international so id say that it mirrors – the international business mirrors the total companys position in terms of available capital in that twothirds of the earnings associated with it the rest is supporting the organic growth thats going on in the different entities member companies hopefully that helps erik j bass  citigroup global markets inc broker got it it does thank you very much daniel joseph houston  president chief executive officer  director erik thanks for calling in operator your next question is from suneet kamath from ubs daniel joseph houston  president chief executive officer  director good morning suneet suneet l kamath  ubs securities llc thanks hey good morning guys so terry i just want to get back to your  normalized number just a couple of things kind of jumped out at me as i was sort of trying to think through the baseline for model projection going forward it looked like in fsa the tax rate was once again negative even if i make the adjustments for the actuarial review and then the market driven expenses and i thought on the last call you had kind of guided to more of a  to  tax rate so as we think about kind of trending this i guess how should we be thinking about getting back to that  to  over what sort of period of time terrance j lillis  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah thanks suneet first off i want to say what you need to do in terms of a tax rate you need to look at the total company thats where we really focus our attentions and its really over a longer period of time than just simply some quarter by quarter distortions that may occur now that being said the total company effective tax rate is in that  to  range as we talked about before but if you go down to one of the biggest reasons for that drop is the dividend benefit that we receive now most of that is concentrated within the full service accumulation line in this quarter there was a significant negative effective tax rate as you pointed out however if you look at it over a period of time and you adjust for the unlocking as you said before the trueups in the prior year youre still at a negative rate on a yeartodate basis albeit its much lower than – its just barely negative in terms of an effective tax rate for the full year so look at it over a longer period of time now that being said one of the reasons its negative right now is because youve seen some higher growth or faster growth in the dividend received benefit that we get in full service accumulation than on a pretax earnings basis now theres a lot of adjustments that you can make in order to get the earnings growth on a pretax basis in  we saw a significant benefit for variable investment income that was at a much higher rate than what were currently seeing this year now why is that well in large part you look at what was the sentiment back in  that was a rising interest rate environment so you saw a lot of prepayment activity going on in  that were not seeing in  so therefore the pretax earnings basis isnt growing as fast as the dividend received basis now as you go into the future you tell me whats going to happen in terms of the economic environment in terms of the equity market thats down on a total return basis of – down about  excuse me down  where we would have expected it to be up  so youve got a good point that weve got a negative effective tax rate at this point in time albeit i think that it can turn around very quickly and get into that  to  so again we take a longer look at it dont let the current periods distort it and then that  to  is probably still a pretty good number for fsa suneet l kamath  ubs securities llc got it daniel joseph houston  president chief executive officer  director thanks terry and thank you suneet for the question suneet l kamath  ubs securities llc i had one followup if you have a second daniel joseph houston  president chief executive officer  director oh please go ahead suneet l kamath  ubs securities llc yeah thanks again on the normalizing numbers i just want to make sure were kind of keeping score consistently here because if i think about that  that youre sort of adding back from weak markets when i go back and look at prior periods where you had favorable markets i would have thought we would have seen an adjustment going the other way and based on the way that we track this i didnt see it so is there something unusual in this quarter that the reason that youre calling out those two or in periods of prior strong equity markets did you have an expense adjustment kind of going the other way that maybe wasnt called out terrance j lillis  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah exactly suneet this is terry again youre absolutely right one of the things that we try to do in terms of what we call out is we try to get the end number to what we believe is the appropriate run rate for that business given a more normal environment there will be periods where well have higher variable investment income because of positive markets and there will be higher expenses that offset that so we try not to get quite granular as we did this quarter with all the different noise items this is probably the most adjustments that ive been associated with in any one particular quarter but we do try to keep that total run rate where were trying to net to get to an appropriate number now to the point that you made about this quarter being highly unusual well we saw the sp as a proxy for the market being down nearly  this quarter that had an adverse impact on the dac amortization for both the individual annuity area as well as the full service accumulation area the full service accumulation is a little bit more abnormal than what we would have normally seen because weve been having volatility in that business albeit its not been the magnitude that we saw this quarter and in large part that is one of the model enhancements that we actually have made at the dac model on a goforward basis that had an impact – more than normal adverse impact in this quarter in terms of a reversion to more of a mean rate over a longer period of time so yeah there was some unusual higher than expected but i would not expect to see that kind of volatility on the full service accumulation line in the future now that said for the individual annuity line with the variable annuity which is still a relatively small block of business out of the  billion of assets under management were talking maybe a  billion of variable annuity there is some volatility associated with that that will continue but netnetnet were trying to get you back to a number that we think whether we can agree to disagree on this what we think is the appropriate run rate for the business in a particular quarter given the economic environment that were seeing and where we would expect future quarters to evolve – come from daniel joseph houston  president chief executive officer  director and suneet what i would just say is in closing here running out of time is that the  negative performance in the quarter for the sp  when we would have anticipated a plus  thats a delta of  we think thats worth calling out i do think weve tried to bring that out in previous calls but well try to be more consistent for you in doing that where we see outperformance that really does fall out of a significant range and so well tighten that up for you in the future so again thank you for the call suneet l kamath  ubs securities llc yeah much appreciated thanks daniel joseph houston  president chief executive officer  director id just like to thank everyone for joining us today on the call and appreciate your good questions and your interest and support we still remain very optimistic about the growth and the strategy here at principal we remain confident that the strategy that we have around retirement investment management and protection will serve our longterm shareholders for many years to come
