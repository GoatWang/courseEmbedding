español merrill lynch hedge fund investors offered opportunity to exit the endowment fund with substantial losses posted march th  according to recent sec filings the endowment master fund lp has offered investors an exit strategy from the hedge fund offering a new fund through a private placement memorandum ppm which will be used to liquidate the fund  the endowment master fund lp was marketed heavily by wall street firms including merrill lynch  the ppm describes the offer as a likekind exchange of investors’ prorata interest of the portfolio holdings into a new pmf fund lp   according to the sec filings dated february   “the pmf fund lp and the endowment master fund lp will be managed differently with the pmf fund lp managed for purposes of orderly liquidation” for investors the offer provides little certainty because investors must choose whether to liquidate now without knowing the true value of the fund which will be determined at a later date  the offer for the likekind exchange expires march   which requires more than a leap of faith for investors in a hedge fund that has languished far behind the market returns  investors must make an investment decision without knowledge of the value exchanged and how much will be realized during the liquidation period  according to the new york times article after weak returns the endowment fund limits withdrawals the hedge fund “began to struggle in  suffering losses of about  percent after fees compared with a gain of  percent by the sp ”  on february   a thomson reuters article underscores the effects of the substantial hedge fund costs on the funds dismal performance “even for investors who stay with the fund there will be high costs  they will not be permitted to ask for any money back this year  they will also be charged a  percent management fee and a  percent servicing fee  on top of that there will be the fund’s underlying managers’  percent management fee and a  percent of profits as an incentive fee”  the article points to the hedge fund underperformance in  “with the fund earning only  percent last year dramatically trailing the standard  poor’s  percent gain”  for merrill lynch customer’s “if investors accessed the endowment fund through merrill lynch they will have paid as much as a  percent upfront charge” with these costs in mind retail investors are discovering that these fees and costs can evaporate any real or potential profits they can earn  retail investor liquidity concerns make investments in the endowment fund suitable only when they have long enough investment time horizon over multiple market cycles  because of the uncertainties outlined in the pmf fund ppm investors who were advised to invest in the hedge fund now appreciate the risks associated with illiquidity when the funds experience such under performance  fullservice brokerage firms such as merrill lynch are responsible for conducting adequate due diligence concerning the investment vehicles they recommend and whether these investments are suitable for their customers  however with multiple layers of fees costs and incentive bonuses these alternative investments are quickly becoming wall street’s favorite investment products to sell the silver law group has martindale hubbell “av” preeminent peer review™ rated lawyers committed to the advocacy of investor
