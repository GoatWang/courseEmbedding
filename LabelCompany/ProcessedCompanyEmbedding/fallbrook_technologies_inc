introduces nftm a commercial grade bicycle groupset feb   nuvinci cycling a division of fallbrook technologies introduced nf  the ultimate rental and commercial grade bicycle groupset the nf provides durability like no other transmission due to the specifically designed hardware components with a ratio range of  a maximum continuous torque of nm and kg maximum permissible vehicle weight this transmission is specifically designed for usage in the bike share and commercial environment throughout the product lifecycle it offers the best value compared to existing solutions this value is predominantly provided by nf reducing service and maintenance costs compared to noncommercial grade competitive products common pain points for operators of bike share programs and commercial bicycle fleets include the misuse or even abuse of the bicycle by its user high maintenance costs and unpredictable service cyclesthese pain points are addressed with the launch of nf riding a nf nuvinci optimized™ bicycle means concentrating less on operating the bike and more on whats important such as traffic road hazards or the scenery stepless shifting works whether the user is freewheeling shifting under load or waiting at a traffic light interruption of the ride caused by locked gears or even a brokendown bike is now a thing of the past the nf transmission includes an individual threepawl freewheel which ensures even pawl engagement for higher durability increasing the overall strength of the transmission also the group offers a three millimeter offset sprocket this enables the use of a oneeighth inch chain which lasts longer than regular chains the padprinted logo preserves and extends the highend look of the product the associated new cf controller features a specificallydesigned rubber material which ensures comfort a better ride and a longer grip life the new cable locking screw four millimeters offers an extremely durable overdrive cable end fixture and

set forth on the front cover of this prospectus would increase or decrease our expected net proceeds by approximately   assuming the number of shares offered by us as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus remains the same and after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us we expect to use any additional net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes suppliers of drive train components in the bicycle industry currently include two dominant companies shimano corporation japan and sram corporation chicago il usa commonly cited problems in the industry include limited flexibility long lead time supply and long term purchase commitments these two primary competitors produce bicycle drive train products in derailleur and internal geared hub form of these two companies shimano has the largest market share which is currently estimated to be above  of the world’s drivetrain requirements and competes on quality and price these shimano geared systems are well known products that consumers use in everyday riding we expect to compete successfully in this market by offering products with features that are not available in the products of our competitors namely an infinite number of gear ratios or speeds from low to high without any shocks jerking or misshifting as we increase our sales we expect to reduce the market share of these competitors as described above the nuvinci technology should be addressing several applications that currently do not utilize cvts however our plans include the sale of products into the automotive market which has a mature competitive base while we will not directly compete with automakers or automotive suppliers on similar products we may be competing with the incumbent product manufacturers of alternators and other accessories that may see our products as a threat to their higher margin products in the lawn and garden equipment end market we will be replacing existing hydrostatic transmissions with our own products while our licensee hydrogear is a significant manufacturer of hydrostatic transmissions there are other manufacturers of hydrostatic transmissions that produce products against which our products will compete for automotive primary transmissions jatco a subsidiary of nissan is recognized as the cvt market leader many of our current or potential competitors have greater market presence longer operating histories stronger name recognition larger customer bases and significantly greater financial technical sales and marketing manufacturing and other resources than we have moreover if one or more of our competitors were to merge or partner with another of our competitors the change in the competitive landscape could adversely affect our customer relationships and competitive position or otherwise affect our ability to compete effectively notwithstanding the presence of jatco as the market leader we expect to compete with them in the automotive industry through introduction of products for end market applications that are not currently offered by jatco and which we believe its products cannot effectively address our cvad products take advantage of the unique packaging and geometry of our nuvinci technology to allow packaging a cvt as a drive for accessories in the very limited space available in an engine compartment company description we are a company that has developed and that markets manufactures and distributes a patented technology sold under the “ nuvinci ” brand we have operations in california and texas as well as contract manufacturing capability in china our technology which is currently only commercially available for bicycles consists of a new type of continuously variable transmission cvt that we believe can be used in a wide variety of end market applications a transmission is a mechanical device that provides speed and torque conversion from a rotating power source using gear ratios or speeds a cvt is a transmission that effectively has an infinite number of gear ratios or speeds between its lowest and highest speeds our nuvinci technology is designed to improve the overall efficiency and performance of vehicles and equipment that operate at various speeds such as bicycles automobile accessories wind turbines and lawn mowers our nuvinci technology provides smooth continuous progression from one speed to another through its range with no breaks or jerks allowing the transmission output speed to change while the engine or motor speed stays at its speed of peak efficiency or power we sell or plan to sell our products directly to vehicle and equipment manufacturers and aftermarket products distributors in some end markets we license our products to other companies to manufacture and sell in their respective industries from which we derive licensing fees or royalties on the sales of their products in other end marketswe intend to enter joint ventures with development partners that would manufacture and market our products we anticipate that we will share in the sales of such products we also provide engineering and support services to vehicle and equipment manufacturers to help them implement our technology in their products our technology is currently available in the global market for bicycle transmissions through bicycle manufacturers aftermarket equipment distributor and retailers where it has been used to replace the rear wheel gear changing assembly or derailleur and is currently the only commercially available cvt for bicycles we are also currently developing applications of our core technology for a number of other target end markets that we believe based on our research have nearterm commercial potential these include alternators air conditioning compressors power steering pumps and superchargers for the automotive accessory drive market where the cvt will allow the accessory to operate at a constant speed regardless of the varying engine speed and primary transmissions for the electric vehicle small wind turbine and lawn care equipment markets where the cvt will provide variable drive speed to the wind turbines or vehicles to date we have primarily been an early stage development company focused on the development of our core technology and formation of initial commercial partnerships we have raised approximately  million in financing to develop and patent our core technology design and produce prototypes to test the application of our technology in products for our customers and develop the operational capabilities needed to support targeted sales of our products we have developed a patent portfolio covering our core technology and end market applications of our technology that includes over  patents and pending applications around the world we have established a sales presence in europe where we have a branch office for sales and customer support we also have a contract manufacturing relationship with a manufacturer in china and have begun establishing an office in shanghai to oversee the activities of that manufacturer and support exploration of other opportunities in china we currently plan to expand our sales efforts to support increased sales in  and  in  we earned  in total revenues from products sales and services at a total net loss of  during the six

day is super flexible to your needsopportunity  in a company that is growing as rapidly as fallbrook there is opportunity around every corner combine that with the cross functional nature of the company and you get exposure to new aspects of business that make you a better more qualified individual for the futureculture – fallbrook is just plain fun to work for the environment is relaxing overall there isn’t unnecessary pressure coming from upper management to portray the company as something it’s not through needless dress codes and universally required work hours when the going gets tough everyone buckles down as a team to get the project complete and when it’s finally finished we celebrate as a team granted it hasn’t always been this way however the past year has shown a complete shift in the company wide atmosphere and hr is making leaps and strides to make it better and betterbottomline i’m proud to work for fallbrook technologiesconsthe majority of cons i would potentially list here are being continually improved upon which i consider a pro however one area i’m not seeing as much improvement in is individual employee recognitionemployee recognition – there just isn’t a whole lot of recognition for some of the incredible work the individuals do for the company fallbrook is great at giving credit where credit is due when it comes to big companywide wins however individual accomplishments are often unacknowledged and internal promotions tremendously rareadvice to managementkeep doing what you’re doing the attitude shift of hr and upper management over the past year is truly making an incredible difference in the daily activities within the company fallbrook is genuinely a joy to work for and a worthy cause to pour my life intoshare on facebookshare
