price index cpi with this inflation picture the federal reserve board raised the federal funds target rate from  to  and said it would continue to undertake appropriate monetary policy action at a measured pace compared with the rise in shortterm interest rates longterm interest rates remained relatively stable supporting overall robust housing and commercial real estate activity which contributed to economic growth many businesses enjoyed their widest profit margins on record propelled largely by productivity gains the labor market firmed as employment increased and the unemployment rate dropped from  to  during the reporting period personal income rose and hiring rebounded in many industries bolstered by healthy business spending however late in the period consumer sentiment fell amid concerns about rising energy costs real estate securities continued to perform well during the six months under review industry fundamentals improved in certain property types such as office and multifamily units and remained strong in retail the residential market continued to post impressive growth despite concerns of a potential housing bubble however the steady rise in

share prices higher among the notable transactions that occurred during the period and contributed to fund performance were prologis acquisition of catellus development and ventas purchase of provident senior living prologis is now considered the worlds largest network of distribution facilities and services with more than  million square feet in over  facilities the company was recently estimated to have more than  million square feet of development potential in international markets and should benefit from a growing global economy also contributing to fund performance was the funds position in avalonbay communities one of the premier multifamily unit operators in the us avalonbay shares appreciated  during the review period the fund also had some detractors from performance including its stake in mortgage finance operator doral financial during the period dorals shares came under pressure after the company announced it would have to restate its financial results for the past five years however at periodend we still owned a considerable stake in doral as we believed the franchise remained intact other holdings that negatively affected fund performance were fannie mae

distribution and service b fees and other fund expenses all mutual funds have ongoing costs sometimes referred to as operating expenses the following table shows ongoing costs of investing in the fund and can help you understand these costs and compare them with those of other mutual funds the table assumes a  investment held for the six months indicated actual fund expenses the first line actual for each share class listed in the table below provides actual account values and expenses the ending account value is derived from the funds actual return which includes the effect of fund expenses

if an account had an  value then       multiply the result by the number under the heading expenses paid during period if expenses paid during period were  then  x    in this illustration the estimated expenses paid this period are  hypothetical example for comparison with other funds information in the second line hypothetical for each class in the table can help you compare ongoing costs of investing in the fund with those of other mutual funds this information may not be used to estimate the actual ending account balance or expenses you paid during the period the hypothetical ending account value is based on the actual expense ratio for each class and an assumed  annual rate of return before expenses which does not represent the funds actual return the figure under the heading expenses paid during period shows the hypothetical expenses your account would have incurred under this scenario you can compare this figure with the  hypothetical examples that appear in shareholder reports of other funds semiannual report   your funds expenses continued please note that expenses shown in the table are meant to highlight ongoing costs and do not reflect any transaction costs such as sales charges or redemption fees therefore the second line for each class is useful in comparing ongoing costs only and will not help you compare total costs of owning different funds in addition

the nature and duration of restrictions on the disposition of the securities due to the inherent uncertainty of valuations of such securities the fair values may differ significantly from the values

executive and senior financial officers i covered officers and purpose of the code this code of ethics the code applies to the principal executive officers principal financial officer and principal accounting officer the covered officers each of whom is set forth in exhibit a of each investment company advised by a franklin resources subsidiary and that is registered with the united states securities  exchange commission sec collectively ft funds for the purpose of promoting o honest and ethical conduct including the ethical resolution of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships o full fair accurate timely and understandable disclosure in reports and documents that a registrant files with or submits to the sec and in other public communications made by or on behalf of the ft funds o compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations o the prompt internal reporting of violations of the code to an appropriate person or persons identified in the code and o accountability for adherence to the code each covered officer will be expected to adhere to a high standard of business ethics and must be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as well as apparent conflicts of interest ii other policies and procedures this code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the funds for purposes of section  of the sarbanesoxley act and the rules and forms applicable to registered investment companies thereunder franklin resources inc has separately adopted the code of ethics and business conduct business conduct which is applicable to all officers directors and employees of franklin resources inc including covered officers it summarizes the values principles and business practices that guide the employees business conduct and also provides a set of basic principles to guide officers directors and employees regarding the minimum ethical requirements expected of them it supplements the values principles and business conduct identified in the code and other existing employee policies additionally the franklin templeton funds have separately adopted the code of ethics and policy statement on insider trading governing personal securities trading and other related matters the code for insider trading provides for separate requirements that apply to the covered officers and others and therefore is not part of this code insofar as other policies or procedures of franklin resources inc the funds the funds adviser principal underwriter or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior or activities of the covered officers who are subject to this code they are superceded by this code to the extent that they overlap or conflict with the provisions of this code please review these other documents or consult with the legal department if have questions regarding the applicability of these policies to you iii covered officers should handle ethically actual and apparent conflicts of interest overview a conflict of interest occurs when a covered officers private interest interferes with the interests of or his or her service to the ft funds for example a conflict of interest would arise if a covered officer or a member of his family receives improper personal benefits as a result of apposition with the ft funds certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between covered officers and the ft funds and already are subject to conflict of interest provisions in the investment company act of  investment company act and the investment advisers act of  investment advisers act for example covered officers may not individually engage in certain transactions such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property with the ft funds because of their status as affiliated persons of the ft funds the ft funds and the investment advisers compliance programs and procedures are designed to prevent or identify and correct violations of these provisions this code does not and is not intended to repeat or replace these programs and procedures and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this code although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal benefit conflicts arise from or as a result of the contractual relationship between the ft funds the investment advisers and the fund administrator of which the covered officers are also officers or employees as a result this code recognizes that the covered officers will in the normal course of their duties whether formally for the ft funds for the adviser the administrator or for all three be involved in establishing policies and implementing decisions that will have different effects on the adviser administrator and the ft funds the participation of the covered officers in such activities is inherent in the contractual relationship between the ft funds the adviser and the administrator and is consistent with the performance by the covered officers of their duties as officers of the ft funds thus if performed in conformity with the provisions of the investment company act and the investment advisers act such activities will be deemed to have been handled ethically in addition it is recognized by the ft funds boards of directors boards that the covered officers may also be officers or employees of one or more other investment companies covered by this or other codes other conflicts of interest are covered by the code even if such conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the investment company act and the investment advisers act the following list provides examples of conflicts of interest under the code but covered officers should keep in mind that these examples are not exhaustive the overarching principle is that the personal interest of a covered officer should not be placed improperly before the interest of the ft funds each covered officer must o not use his or her personal influence or personal relationships improperly to influence investment decisions orfinancial reporting by the ft funds whereby the covered officer would benefit personally to the detriment of the ft funds o not cause the ft funds to take action or fail to take action for the individual personal benefit of the covered officer rather than the benefit the ft funds o not retaliate against any other covered officer or any employee of the ft funds or their affiliated persons for reports of potential violations that are made in good faith o report at least annually the following affiliations or other relationships  o all directorships for public companies and all companies that are required to file reports with the sec o any direct or indirect business relationship with any independent directors of the ft funds o any direct or indirect business relationship with any independent public accounting firm which are not related to the routine issues related to the firms service as the covered persons accountant and o any direct or indirect interest in any transaction with any ft fund that will benefit the officer not including benefits derived from the advisory subadvisory distribution or service agreements with affiliates of franklin resources these reports will be reviewed by the legal department for compliance with the code there are some conflict of interest situations that should always be approved in writing by franklin resources general counsel or deputy general counsel if material examples of these include o service as a director on the board of any public or private company o the receipt of any gifts in excess of  from any person from any corporation or association o the receipt of any entertainment from any company with which the ft funds has current or prospective business dealings unless such entertainment is business related reasonable in cost appropriate as to time and place and not so frequent as to raise any question of impropriety notwithstanding the foregoing the covered officers must obtain prior approval from the franklin resources general counsel for any entertainment with a value in excess of  o any ownership interest in or any consulting or employment relationship with any of the ft funds service providers other than an investment adviser principal underwriter administrator or any affiliated person thereof  reporting of these affiliations or other relationships shall be made by completing the annual directors and officers questionnaire and returning the questionnaire to franklin resources inc general counsel or deputy general counsel  any activity or relationship that would present a conflict for a covered officer may also present a conflict for the covered officer if a member of the covered officers immediate family engages in such an activity or has such a relationship the cover person should also obtain written approval by fts general counsel in such situations o a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions transaction charges or spreads paid by the ft funds for effecting portfolio transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other than an interest arising from the covered officers employment such as compensation or equity ownership franklin resources general counsel or deputy general counsel will provide a report to the ft funds audit committee of any approvals granted at the next regularly scheduled meeting iv disclosure and compliance o each covered officer should familiarize himself with the disclosure requirements generally applicable to the ft funds o each covered officer should not knowingly misrepresent or cause others to misrepresent facts about the ft funds to others whether within or outside the ft funds including to the ft funds directors and auditors and to governmental regulators and selfregulatory organizations o each covered officer should to the extent appropriate within his or her area of responsibility consult with other officers

performance compared to the  funds within its morningstar category how is it determined the overall morningstar ratingtm for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its   and year if applicable morningstar rating metrics which are based on riskadjusted returns as of the date stated  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds what does it mean a funds morningstar rating is a quantitative assessment of a funds past performance that accounts for both risk and return with funds earning between  and  stars as always this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process a high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision returns low avg high below average this fund scores below average because it delivered returns that were in the bottom  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category top   high next   above average middle   average next   below average bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk expenses low avg high above average this funds expenses are rated as above average because they fall between the th and th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category how is it calculated this morningstar data point compares the funds net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its morningstar category grouping what does it mean excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance while you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios a funds expense structure may be one factor to consider risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk of the category in addition to risk you should evaluate a funds investment objective strategy fees and other characteristics

values or economic downturns can have a significant negative effect on issuers in the real estate industry stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer political regulatory market economic or other developments these risks may be magnified in foreign markets sector funds can be more volatile because of their narrow concentration in a specific industry in general the bond market is volatile and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk as interest rates rise bond prices usually fall and vice versa this effect is usually more pronounced for longerterm securities fixed income securities also carry inflation risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties unlike individual bonds most bond funds do not

has rated its risk between the th and th percentiles when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated risk is calculated using the sharpe ratio which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to us treasury bonds relative to the funds overall volatility for this measure morningstar has compared the sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in its morningstar category what does it mean a higher sharpe implies better riskadjusted returns therefore if a fund has a sharpe ratio higher than its category average its returns relative to its risk were better than other similar funds if its sharpe ratio is lower thats usually a sign that the riskadjusted returns were lower than other similar funds returns low avg high below average this fund scores below average because it delivered returns that were in the bottom  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category top   high next   above average middle   average next   below average bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk of the category in addition to risk you should evaluate a funds investment objective strategy fees and other characteristics
