years of research and writing it celebrates the life and work of the man who made an indelible mark on the west of imagination and reality author james h nottage examines edward bohlins personal voyage from his departure from sweden as a cabin boy aboard a freighter to his apprenticeship as a cowboy in montana to the opening of his first saddle shop in cody wyoming to the growth of his shops in hollywood in the process he situates bohlin in his own time and in the history of the american westas a youngster in sweden he dreamed of the wild west of buffalo bill cody as an adult he associated with the likes of artists charles russell and ed borem author and pinkerton detective charlie siringo and with hollywood heroes ranging from tom mix and will rogers to clark gable and roy

the north west company inc first quarter results i would now like to turn the meeting over to mr edward kennedy president and chief executive officer mr kennedy please go ahead edward kennedy hi good afternoon and welcome to our first quarter conference call before i begin with the overview im going to ask paulina hiebert to read our disclosure statement on forwardlooking and other disclosure paulina hiebert thank you edward before we begin ill remind you that certain information presented today may constitute forwardlooking statements such statements reflect north wests current expectations estimates projections and assumptions these forwardlooking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks which could cause actual performance and financial results in the future to vary materially from those contemplated in the forwardlooking statements for more information on these risks please see north wests annual information form and its mda under the heading risk factors edward kennedy thanks paulina so i’d like to go to the quarter there may be more questions because of the adjusted earnings and ebitda presentation which was a bigger factor in the quarter stock base comp options specifically and the rtw acquisition transaction cost stamp this page to the bbi government but i want to leave that for a minute because on the core operating side the quarter was pretty good and when we look at the net effect of rtw and the improvement in our northern canada business im encourage that we’ve got some good trends and momentum going so let me start with northern canada this is an area that gets a lot of attention especially for our top market and top category work that youve heard a lot about in over the three years or so and what were finding is in the top markets we’ve got  completed projects the other  or so are now all grouped together so we track them not because they got capital because we’re tracking the processes and the merchandize assortment and our effectiveness on all the noncapital areas in the store the  that received capital are out preferring our other stores as we would have hoped they would because they are gaining new services and sometimes expanded selling space but a complete rebuild of often the store inside so based on our projections and we approved the capital these stores are on track and thats an improvement over the sort of mixed results early on where you heard me describe our challenges with expenses and the food service sort of the culture of the company needed to be fully formed so we can deliver this product on a costeffective basis a consistent basis so we now have lots of learnings  stores worth and even more if we consider nontop markets that have food service introduced so were gaining the benefit of those learnings and adjustment more importantly with the blend shift to food service to our convenience category theyre starting to show up in a more pronounced way in our food business in northern canada it was certainly a big factor in growing our food gross profit despite the offset of some pretty serious margin compression and our giant tiger markets we continue to see with these still difficult communities in alberta and saskatchewan the additional competitive store footage towards hard discount the role of price reduction last fall early fall by sobeys safeway and cycling through all that makes for a very dynamic but a pretty tough market for food in western canada so giant tiger is half of the business but food has felt that effect when we get great weather like last two weeks we shoot the lights out of sales on the higher market part of the business the general merchandise and fashion but we still have to sort of bear that burden of staying lower food gp gross profit at least till weve cycled through say september last year maybe even a bit into more into q so im just spending time on that because even though that happened we still drove improvement in our canadian business i think it also puts in perspective that if we get things right in northern canada both brand execution at the gross profit line we can offset a lot of other factors in the business further on northern canada we had great general merchandise sales gp gross profit not so much the blend shift there was more to big ticket i think thats a great sign though on incomes in the north mostly government transfer related but whether its motorized or furniture we had some very very impressive results looking at the motorized side we don’t get the same gross profit but its still gross profit dollars we had some higher mark downs in other seasonal categories little happy about that but we were high coming out of winter and we had to deal with that looking forward with our northern canada business again just at the gross profit line we see quite good momentum on both food and general merchandise and we think our margin rates in general merchandise will firm up as markdowns come down and well see more of the improvement that weve seen on the blend shift side in food so we add all that together and we think the prospects in northern canada top line are pretty solid the other leverage factor for us going back to my point about our costs and top markets is really managing our staff and payroll productivity and you can imagine we had sort of high water mark actually in q of last year of very good sales and were now bringing that down consistently q was a beginning and q its happened again and we can go lower as we do that it tumbles to the bottom so we do expect to see more of that type of positive performance out of our northern canada business as far as giant tiger goes if we can  we had a great seasonal assortment we had two great weeks this weekends going to be cold in the west its already cold in regina saskatchewan saskatoon could be a tougher week weve got a couple more and then were at the july markdowns but we should do better in q in giant tiger on the general merchandise side overall it wasnt the best weather to sell seasonal fashion in q and then we move on so i just want to put in perspective we are in canada the other big thing and ill come back to that actually is the acquisition of north star eric so staying on the retail front and moving to international again we were overall pleased with the quarter when you take out the noise of the transaction costs largely the stamp duties that we pay to the bbi government that aren’t capitalized theyre just expensed tied to that acquisition the rtw acquisition was the weekend to our fiscal year and we actually took ownership of our controlling position so in accordance gone well there we’ve improved the in stock conditions in rtw we’ve done a lot of initial assessment integration work we’ve negotiated lower costs both logistics and our suppliers were continuing to work on that but we’re now we announced in our agm today that we’re going to be cutting costs by  million on key items both for our wholesale and our retail customers that will take affect by the end of june and we think that’s going to be another very big momentum builder to keep as we experienced in both barbados and cayman when we put our stores there that we start to bring dollars back to the island that might be leaking offshore because people are looking to save more money so we can do that we feel and help deal with our retail economy because we also lack wholesaler on the island and that will be real interesting investments in pricing and we did commit that we would when we found cost savings we would look towards and best see that in price and sat down with the bbi government and talked about getting a business license to have this transaction approved so that’s right way the rest of cost plus business is a bit of mix bag and we got a very strong ireland and continue to do well on cayman islands for example we tend to find the higher end responders ph to do better the others are a little more sluggish a little more margin pressure in barbados and we had this time last year still a very solid market for us now that’s stores mature in totality if i look at international indiscernible should continue ex our acquisition to be a growing bottomline business this year even though we have constrained fiscal situations going on in alaska they came through nicely in the quarter and they continue to prove to us as a division that they can manage costs really focus on our consumable business the things that are again cstore categories fresh categories and high end in stock so you’re always there as a convenient store and if your customer doesn’t have the money to buy big tickets at least youre there for their basic everyday needs and that seems to be coming to the front right now at ac so not a dynamic environment economically but we’re able to whether it so far and the year has started out pretty good for alaska turning to the north star acquisition we expect to complete that this week were closing the schedule for tomorrow actually once thats in place as i announced today and gave more detail on in my remarks we’re going to be moving quickly to effectively double the size of north stars business by converting routes and freight and we move through other carriers to north star and eastern ontario probably northeast ontario west side of indiscernible bay actually northern manitoba and the central arctic which is tibloc so we got that mapped out we are having to invest in equipment for capacity so we talked about the basler aircraft that we’re adding requiring fifth plane and we’re leasing a fourth and i talk a bit about how the basler is a low cost simple to run although at first look it appears to be somewhat antiquated plane using a dc airframe but the state of the art avionics and turbo charged engines make it an ideal plane for northern flying and we think the top plane actually for this kind of cargo that we’re going to be using it for and i also commented that the north star acquisition is really about the people knowledge and skill the culture of the airline how it syncs up with ours is it enterprises is it customer driven and these people that folks that run and work at north star they live and running better aligned to the best of their ability and do a very very good job so we’re very very excited about moving that service culture and operational standard into the other regions that i mentioned we are pretty fast paced to make this work so right way first four months of right way acquisition where we’re head down on sort of the quick wins are early things we needed to accomplish we expected the next four months and be really busy with an indiscernible and then we’ll step back and take a pause and see how we’re doing probably over the next year or so and our model is unfolding both with respect to the logistic advantage for our own freight and advantages for any thirdparty freight that we decide to carry so overall i think a lot more positives in the quarter and we’re still in not the best economic environment but i like the fact that we’re taking control of our situation and some of the things that we start  that we did basically back a couple of years ago on the food side are our improving our gross profit rate and in driving the bottom line with expense control come into place i like the early start to the right way acquisition and with north star air well report as we get into the next few quarters of the year but we’re ready to go and our plans are in place assuming that we close the shareholders approve the variable volume ph structure and we’re looking forward to the next chapter and their development under our ownership there aren’t too many to many changes to the outlook for the year if you noticed in the report to shareholders it’s  we haven’t said too many different things about the way the year is unfolding that way veryvery intense price competition in western canada we think are going to be some  cycling through that as we anniversary last year but economically saskatchewan and alberta not out of the woods at all yet so we have to face that reality northern canada are really picking up some good momentum alaska holding up despite the condition cost less on puts and takes but we’re on top of that business and we expect it to be net contributor in terms of growth this year at the bottom line and that we have rtw kicking in as far as our growth agenda beyond our key initiatives for the rest of the year we do have some integration to do here and as you know northwest we don’t do a couple of acquisition like this in the first half for the year is a lot already but we are committed to continuing to work and the caribbean with other owners of stores and island that we’re targeting and really developing further those relationships so we’re going to optimistic on this nothing eminent but it is part of our growth plan for the next three years to continue to look at island higher end tourist islands preferably but also reinvesting either to additional stores or expansion and some of our best proven markets in the caribbean as we continue to build scale there and basically grow the business i think that covers the high level and just a quick update we have a  million it project of product enterprise its moving along our board members said today almost really how smooth it is is there an unknown unknown i don’t think so but than it would be unknown unknown i wouldn’t know that and  but it is removing smoothly and we  or an implementation of our pos and work force management are granted the more complex implementation is still to come on our merchandize management system and that begins in the fall but we’re happy with the cadence of the project in the way it’s being managed okay with that operator i like to turn the conference to the questions over the questions questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions the first question is from michael van aelst from td securities please go ahead michael van aelst a few clarifications just to start so when you look at your adjusted ebitda thats the first time i think youve been publishing that but why did you choose to only back out the portion of the stock based compensation tie to options rather than the indiscernible edward kennedy well michael when i looked at the option expense first of all that was the most significant portion of share based compensation that was driving the variant but when you look at the components of our share base compensation there is psus or is deferred share units and those kinds of things they tend to be a pretty consistent within other public company but i think separates northwest as a differentiator and share base compensation is the accounting treatment for our options and they are accounted for as a liability and there is a marktomarket of that expenses so our optioned expense is subject to more volatility than what a typical or a vanilla type option would be so it was that component that i highlighted to add back the rest of it is clearly an explanation within the quarter i think the total delta on share based comp was close to  million  million expense this year versus an  recovery last year but the auction component of that was  in the quarter compared to a  million recovery last year michael van aelst the dsus and the psus did they move around with the share price as well unidentified company representative yes they do absolutely edward kennedy maybe ill just jump in when john was looking at this and we thought okay this might be the quarter when we should break it out a little more clearly its so material but is it different like whats different about us whats different is with our growth and yield incentives to management we have a declining strike price option which means as we keep the dividend yield up we get a credit from part of that yield against the strike price of the option that declining strike price features what characterizes our i guess you can paying to the option and requires the quarterly marktomarket that the only thing thats unique about us the rest the psus the director dsus which are also marktomarket yeah theyre volatile if you have the swinging share price down  as we had but theyre not different than anybody else so thats where john drew the line michael van aelst okay i mean just as far as i know most other companies would just adjust for the full amount edward kennedy oh they would well were not  well i guess well get feedback but im just giving you the rationale we were reluctant to do it in the first place but its such a big number we felt we had to do something michael van aelst its good to look through it just to see how youre doing operationally right i mean edward kennedy right exactly michael van aelst okay just on the other topics then the right way acquisition can you quantify the contribution on a sale on ebitda level edward kennedy no were not going to segment that we were positive in our international business without it and we were of course more positive with it so thats all i would say michael van aelst okay so you did grow though without international business in local currency without right way edward kennedy yes michael van aelst okay and then in your other comments on the infrastructure spending on the north it seems like you’re more positive on some of that hitting in  than you were in the last couple of conference calls can you update us on that edward kennedy yeah i dont think i even used the word infrastructure though it seems like  i think really whats happened that it’s income programs like the child tax benefit improvement some social assistance in the way its been paid and done right now i think were benefiting from that more than anything else and the current share notarized our focus points for us and the customers have money through that i dont have  if youve indiscernible but the infrastructure piece i think is largely still to come i mean we  there is a lot schools still to be built there is peace treaties to be done and other things to happen but why dont try and connect the dots especially by the way in q when its a light construction timing year anyway for infrastructure so we expect it to be a better year again ill use the proxy of our shipping business it should be a pretty busy shipping year for us but were talking about being indiscernible and then it gets mobilized to start a construction product in the fall so what youre hearing today i mean what im talking about with ncr is really more core government transfers to individuals living in the north and our focus of going after our share of that spending and there have been improvements like we talked about the child benefit payments going up and there were some social systems improvements in nunavut and theyve just announced another one where theyre going to allow individual and social assistance to retain more of their social assistance so theyre not discouraged that dollarfordollar takeaway to enter the workforce michael van aelst okay and on the cost you last say you talked about some in stock performance issues on the general merchandise side what happened there and whats being done to make sure that doesnt happen again edward kennedy its merchandise planning we’ve changed people we have a new vice president of general merchandise whos just joined the company at the beginning of april pardon me of may and i think its been a hit and miss proposition for us i think behind the scenes weve not been happy for some time with the performance in cost this is a push model totally so there are qualifying by store indiscernible so it’s a complete cross stock operation we don’t use warehouses because ph stores are effectively a warehouse store but you have to get the flow right because you’re  weeks on the water just to get to gwam ph and so the algorithms are there but the category managers have to be on top of that and to me it came down to the people and the focus of the business and it was certainly frustrated to see because youd like to think were comstock ph but to answer your question we have made people changes and it’s going to take some time for the new individual to get fully up to speed but we’re optimistically made this change for right for good reasons i mean we have very good person coming into the company to manage that side of the business operator the next question is from matt bank from cibc please go ahead matt bank first just a followup on the adjusted ebitda was would adjusted ebitda have been for  as a whole based on this new definition  edward kennedy well matt if you go to into the report to shareholders there is a nongaap section and actually reconcile right back and provides all the details on the numbers so the adjusted ebitda in  is  and  is  matt bank right i’ve got that the reason i’m asking because share based comp was a pretty big number for q to q so figure out the yearoveryear how last year is going to come in when you displaced yearoveryear over the next three quarters edward kennedy okay so i missed that question matt sorry you want to know what the impact to share based compensation is for all of  and what the adjustment is matt bank yes edward kennedy i have to get that let me find the number it’s in our annual report we disclose that number right about our notes okay so i can send you that note reference i don’t have it right here but we do disclose our share based compensation and the individual components of that within in notes matt bank and then just a clarification on samestore sales because in the mda the worlds were a bit confusing it looks in the wording like indiscernible include in samestore sales but i don’t think it was edward kennedy no it is not matt bank okay that makes sense and then can you just give a bit more detail on the strength in canadian food samestore sales despite the weakness of west edward kennedy yes i mean which again we don’t break that out but our indiscernible is up  so i don’t know what exactly tell to you that they were very healthy gains in northern canada but i’m not going to say what the number is there was less than  but still very very good operator the next question is from jim durran from barclays please go ahead jim durran you have this thing focused on the food comp store sales number so are you not experiencing any of the deflation that more popular food retail markets are seeing edward kennedy big types unidentified company representative yes edward kennedy i mean that’s are the story that we narrowed it at  and samestore basis we’ve got a big number in ncr and a very very small number in giant tiger ncr meaning northern canada retail and it’s deflation in giant tiger and a little bit of freight inflation in northern canada offsetting and less of that competitive dynamic that’s affecting our business in western canada with giant tiger jim durran so from infrance then you’re actually seeing pretty significant volume performance in the market edward kennedy we’re seeing volume tonnage increases in northern canada and tonnage decreases in giant tiger jim durran and in your reporting structure here i assume you’re including food service in your food comp store sales number edward kennedy we do yes jim durran so how meaningful or contributor would that be at this point you mentioned that you’ve got like  locations or some other qsr ph locations right edward kennedy okay well it’s actually a little more than that because the  just in the top markets and i know it can be following a bouncing ball here but top categories go everywhere so we’ve got i’m going  food service operations of which beyond the  another  would be tim horton’s but that have been added over the last two years so they’re driving sales inside the store there is some lunch shift you could have a coffee program before  or just coffee or substitution i should say even within the store we made sale more prepared foods and sale last selling prepared foods in the store but that’s not being for sure and we’re taking share in the local convenience business because and all those categories to battle single serve pop chips fuel are anything that has to do extended store hours is growing the business as well so there are all concerns to the mix and then we tend to be challenged i mean we’re holding our own i mean tonnage was up in center store grocery is slightly down in center store of nonfood grocery but all the other permitted departments and the convenience when i just described are making up the difference to get tonnage growth jim durran and are you seeing the deflation trend though ease the way we’ve heard from some of the other retailers edward kennedy no i mean what we’re thinking now is we can get the depress about this especially in the urban environment because you’re losing basis points on your promo spend that’s where it seems to be really hitting us and i’m assuming hitting everyone else because we’re  i’ve explain before and i’m talking about giant tiger were a price taker and to protect the brand and i get concern that we aren’t being aggressive enough to do that if we don’t keep our traffic up its going somewhere else but i know that we’re sharp on our promotions we do keep our traffic some of that is converting to our higher margin gm business and storing at the whole point is to blend out our gross but as far as an outlook i think are optimistic and hope as much as wishful it’s not happening today but we think remind ourselves that it was last august when indiscernible dropped hundreds of thousands of prices we will circle through that so it will stabilize put it that way so monthovermonth yearoveryear deflation i can’t see it i can see it stopping as we get into the fall but it hasn’t happened yet jim durran okay that’s helpful i mean rw business you talked this cost savings number  million edward kennedy yes jim durran do you expect that all to go into price or do you expect some of that to fallthrough the bottomline edward kennedy this tranche is going to price it’s not a legally binding commitment to anybody and it’s a fine line because one of the questions the government had and some of the other competitors on the arms that we would disrupt the market and put someone out of business it hasnt happened in the cayman it didn’t happen in barbados and we assured that we wouldn’t and it’s not predatory pricing but because we’re a big wholesaler like volumes retailers are our customers too they will get their share of the cost reductions and it’s something that we’re very comfortable doing we know there is going to be more efficiencies but out of the gates the things that we found that are more scale driven ie on freight and some of this it skill and knowledge driven in terms of sitting across vendor and knowing what the cost should be weve chosen to invest and we have our record that help us that we can grow that way we think that rtw can grow tonnage they can keep again dollars on it and they will make it up on gp dollars very different in investing in price in giant tiger where you’re working off of a real challenge margin to begin with perhaps in a higher discount sense of the word in a right way this is kind of found money and i think it belongs to the customer jim durran and no negative surprises on the acquisition at this point it sounds like it’s been fairly positive edward kennedy no i’m happy with the reporting structure this is going to this is kind of detail and how we’re setting the up we have the evg who chief indiscernible officer and has not had aligned in this unit before but is running that some for the time being and i like the focus i like the team i guess we’re starting under resourced yet and i hope we’re not over resourcing either having a lot of good people go down there and work on the procurement and logistics and all they are finding actually is more and more opportunity than we might have been imagined and when you do think about a pretty well run but companies steeped in tradition privately own by the same individual and group of shareholders for all almost  years they just things that you can look at differently so i think it may not be all this year i mean maybe to your question because were putting this saving stock into the trying to grow the top line and make the business sustainable longer i think it will get through the year with i think positive results but itll be more into the next couple of years that we start to make changes that would really grow the business and have an even a more dramatic effect on the bottom line but its been solid and we knew we were going to do it that it was a pretty stable business and had a very privileged market position so we dont see a lot of downside this year and no surprises negative ones anyway jim durran alright thats helpful last question just take a little zika virus do you have a better handle now on what you think it’s role is going to be on the business edward kennedy i think when it shakes  when i looking at the number of cases the usdi is going to continue to be a problem the usdi government had said that their gdp could drop by  tied to tourism arrivals because of zika and we actually had a great quarter indiscernible but for the wrong kind of reason it was ahead of this putting syntaxes in so we had a bunch of stock up on we sell a lot liquor in those markets it could be a tougher tourist season next year if that forecast is right if the zika cases are still rising cayman is not a real factor bbi is not a factor st martin is but then its crowded by the type of tourist that the european tourist thats distressed a bit and that applies to barbados the us tourist is great canadian tourist no because of their dollar and then the us tourist will be shy about st martin so cayman bbi barbados should be good st martin for a number of reasons could be soft with tourist and then the usdi is at risk because of zika thats when we hear the most about i mean you hear about puerto rico but it seems to be quite regional where the incident rates are really not epidemic like but theyre enough that people are worried about their tourism and then the pacific is not a factor so thats the context of zika it’s very local to islands and the rate of incidence varies quite dramatically depending on how good they were at preventing it in the first place and then we have a hard time sometimes separating like a st martin is it because of the economy its in europe the dollar values in europe and canadian dollar is that affecting st martin or is it zika related jim durran i dont know if youre able to give me this number but if im trying to wrap my head around how meaningful  risk might be for those markets that you do think might be exposed to that if it was to happen can you give us directionally like what percent of that business it might represent edward kennedy well st thomas is one of our bigger stores but if youre talking about process overall were talking about maybe  of the bottom line jim durran no thats helpful great thank you operator thank you the following question is from neil lindsell from industrial alliance securities please go ahead neil lindsell you mentioned the top  markets you know  stores completed and you mentioned youve learned a lot how is what you learned on the first half of this project going to influence what youre doing on the second half edward kennedy okay so in order its going to be the fact of adjustments we make on labor were going to be coming out of the gates with the right labor rates and food service whereas at the beginning we weren’t two is the capital spend we were a little generous on the overall size of some of these projects i dont think we oversize stores but were going to be tighter on the spend per square foot of selling space and be very careful that were not replacing departments that really dont need to be replaced and im talking about end of life cycle so i think weve learned that i think were pretty disciplined on our capital spending its a rule but i think we got a little sloppy on some of these projects and everybody wanted to throw in the baby with the bathwater going to spend money and all these needs come out of the woodwork now were coming back and said whats really essentially here to solidify the market as far as the blend of what were really focused on were probably looking at  this in a little more detail but in the fresh category a very critical constructively critical on how much space we putting to say produce tables which are low density and some other food service categories like bakery and deli and saying okay guys this looks pretty but we don’t do businesses we’ve got to go more vertical we can  so we go horizontal at  a foot to bill and now we got a dpp out of that selling space so those are some other learning i’d say the other one is on the convenient business so just getting more and more confident that the convenience part of the store either the storm size of the store with separate hours and separate entrance or just the assortment gets pulled out and called out more and we get higher goals for performance weather its store hours or sales and margins and then finally i guess tied back to staffing as a structure of the store that we try to be more realistic and then we don’t also to bringing a food service specialist but in fact retrain or skill some of the existing roles that they are accountable for food service and we don’t overstaff the top end of the store those are the some of the learnings that come out of it the other one i’d say is finally is furniture we’ve add mix results out of our furniture selling space we just came out of fantastic quarter for selling big ticket but it’s made me question how much dedicates selling space we put in the furniture it’s nice to have it displayed out every day but the customers need to be paused to spend their money like everyone doesn’t furniture right you buy it on special that perpetual some of that indiscernible machine on kind of stuff but you got to promote it with credit you got promote it with an event were probably leaning more back where we rent the arena and have an arena sale or truckload sale and reflects that space more than have it as a dedicated selling space so those are some of the things that we would be adjusting going forward neil lindsell okay so is there specifically on the costs and labor is it going to be  less expensive to do the renovations on subsequent stores say edward kennedy well we forecasted because we were pretty big and we’ve got a couple of or we still to do account so when i said today it was  stores to go out  million and that sounds like to you were before about  million a store but in indiscernible it could be  to  so we take indiscernible out of the picture your number is pretty big on we’ve been expecting to save or reduce the cost per store by about  neil lindsell okay and is it too early obviously you’re saying you’re getting good performance number out of this is it too early to say what would happen was you finish this program are there lessons and learnings you should go and renovate other stores outside of the top  markets edward kennedy it’s little early but it’s certainly on our mind again we look at the delta between those stores and the others we want okay those are top  what about the next  and how much more can you drive in terms of sales and ultimate bottomline and i think the answer will be yes i think the quick as long if accretive and cost is justifying know that that we would look at another tranche of stores and what does that mean for capex well if those stores if those divisions grow their ebitda and their sales fund at kind of capex because the other problem or challenge we have of course is it does accelerate your sustaining capex because you’ve got to go to store and do something you might have waited to go just to get the growth capex into it so that’s certainly on our mind if the numbers are looking like they’re looking and that’s keep parsing them down and saying should we do more stores i think our plates full right now i mean not and we’re not to the point yet where we’d accelerate that and start to add more the medium size stores within the next three years but we’ll do the analysis to sure and if there is an roi then we would been capital faster the bars are very complex and the lead times are long so there is a bit of a bandwidth here as well within that construction team so we’ve got to keep that in mind there is so many good contractors like the airline business we don’t have a lot of choices so we got a keep mixture we’re not going to compromise quality if we look put more projects under especially medium if there will be more mediumones than large ones by definition operator operator instructions the next question is from stephen macleod from bmo capital markets please go ahead stephen macleod just coming back to the top market initiatives edward you mentioned that you’ve seen sort of great better sales growth in your  the  projects where you’ve seen crunching markets you have seen the projects completed can you talk a little bit about what kind of sales lift you’re seeing in those specific markets relative to the preproject numbers edward kennedy yes i mean the fact that the control group is the rest of the stores thats another way to look at it i suppose but we would see and again depends on the mix that how many new programs you’re putting in but  to  basis points of sales lift across the whole store and of course some programs are very new or else brand new if you put it at tims but it’s not just the tims it’s the entire store any top category in a top market store would tend to be outperforming the rest of the chain so i think that’s the spread right now that we’re seeing is about between  to  versus the rest of the chain stephen macleod and if you had to break the buckets down into key drivers of that is there any way to generalize or is it pretty store and market specific edward kennedy well if you look at my slide from agm remarks i took baker lake which three years we started i used that as an example to start what we plan to do and so now we’ve actually done it was actually in  and we did but that was a good set of hypothetical or theoretical store to look at and we only added  selling space to that store but we changed a whole bunch of things so as the numbers are up in that store in every department we touched and you say what where the biggest drivers well the cstore okay but cstore looks like for us interesting and they get an extra million bucks anther add or more maybe you put tim’s in that were  to  expanding your produce you put it in a big club tag section how is that doing you got a furniture section i already explain that i think that still other one of the furniture dedicated space is worth to  you put a pharmacy in its really getting great traction the town never had a pharmacy before in community pharmacy that is so it’s a good question on which one drives the most i think if you have put the numbers together i’d work back from the cstore and food service i’d go over to pharmacy and then i probably go to the fresh categories and say that’s where the most the growth is coming from and then the work comps ph or the leverage with the effective storage structurecost would make it all happen but even a small thing like we would post out to the back of the store which gets a better flow of customer right to the store is that helping other categories probably is and because theyre all up in the store but the heavy lifters are the ones that i mentioned stephen macleod okay and the most of the raining markets have the capacity for cstores sorry cstores in other food service edward kennedy yeah what i said i actually don’t know if i mentioned in my remarks but i what i did say we have  sites that were spend it our cstores or in store we could double that that could be  more so and that because beyond top market so for example top markets at st thomas is the aspi so we’re going to expand our store at st thomas we’re not putting a cstore into a costless format so there is stores like that that don’t aren’t even eligible for a cstore assortment but there is a whole bunch of others that aren’t top markets they just great opportunities for cstore so for example we’re looking at acquiring the cstore in happy valley new finland labrador and wherever possible we’re in the market to tuckin cstores so it’s a combination of top markets at just good locations for cstores including cstore within a store and we don’t disclose the blend of that but just like the top markets top i called it in my agm remarks i called convenience as super top category and it has the same kind of sales spread to the rest of the business as the top markets do in terms of growth or yearoveryear so we want to do more of those and you know what dramatically or you’d say strategically we’ve for some time have been trying to derisk our business from the easiest shopping categories or ecommerce categories and we know that how to consumable cstore categories are really great they don’t get out shaft or ecommerce and next best after that are perishables at the end of the spectrum its big ticket that’s big in both it need to be sold on credit that we can sort of how to offer to our customers so those things haven’t changed but we don’t you know to be fair we dont break that out except i could just tell you that were happy with the way those priority categories have gone and you know back to center store its not a disaster for us but were not you know the tonnage there tend to be flat in fact we do have some catalysation if we sell more prepared food in some stores weve seen some of our center store drop because people have switched to prepared food consumption stephen macleod okay thats great and then just switching gears here to north star air you know obviously closed that deal yet can you provide us some information around ebitda and what you expect the run rate to be can you just provide a little bit of color around the top line like presumably some of the  youll benefit more on ebitda than you will on the top line i guess in terms of the post close run rate once youve completed your investment edward kennedy i think the revenue rate is about  million now and were going to double that size but then it’s going to be  to north west on request so were going to have the intercompany elimination but from a size of enterprise standpoint were still doubling in size stephen macleod right i see okay edward kennedy and thats our phase thats for this year and from there well look at other opportunities stephen macleod you mean other  edward kennedy was two parts to that the other opportunities in third party freight and other regions stephen macleod right end logistics in there edward kennedy and air cargo stephen macleod okay thats great and then finally just on the capex can you talk a little about what you expect when you include right way and north star heading into  for the balance of the year edward kennedy on capex right way would be nominal they might have  million in their capex plan and theyre wrapping up the store project right now theres no other new major stores north star we have a basler aircraft thats going to be acquired shortly after closing thats it right now and thats in the i think its cad million or is it cad million stephen macleod okay thats great thank you operator thank you next question is from michael van aelst from td securities michael van aelst on the annual meeting you said that your ecommerce was on the verge of becoming much more significant over the next i guess over the next few years or so or lot more youre on the verge of doing a lot more ecommerce in general so can you give us an idea of where you think you can take ecommerce edward kennedy yeah well first ill say is that were behind we need to get the right structure in the organization to turn this on more at the i guess ill just call it the basic national organization of that initiative whats working for us and i want to answer the question but just going to give you an update on what we’ve done so far this year so we are moving forward with our pacificalaska wholesale bc bb its a direct business today but not that strong digitally it doesn’t have the platform we want and were putting a platform in and were using a with a new distribution center that we built or basically took over a building and then got it at the anchorage airport were setting up now a dark store thats our picking configuration and well be launching that think the target datas the beginning of september so thatll be our biggest focus work in ecom and itll about selling food key volume items five days faster than amazon at or below their price coming out of anchorage as opposed out of their seattle warehouse and having a dc right on the airplane apron so that the plane lead us right up to the door thats food and there is versions of that that we can envision in northern canada you know thats some catalysation in the sense that other customers whod switched to our ecom offers or the instore one but the way we look at it it’s going to happen for those customers regardless but thats still to unfold what were behind in digitizing our general merchandise offer so we have to digitize our motorized machine catalogue digitize our specialty general merchandise that cant go to all stores and the timeline for that is a little up in the air as i mentioned we just replaced our general merchandise vice president what i like about the deal individual but he comes with a strong retail supplier and but stock goods supplier but also technology background so he is very conversant in the need in the opportunity so we just put the pieces together to get that and by the way most this is not it’s more of a shop ph by approach and we just get into business in these different lines and get them out there there are some brands concern that we get the right brand but i think we’re going to find with north west and we will help multiple ecommerce brands the one we have up in alaska for pacificalaska wholesale different of course in the one we have in northern canada now even within northern canada we may have subbrands depending on the lines of merchandise we sell so for example north west motorsports is our brand for motorsports and that’s what’s known by our customers and we may be selling north west motorsports parts or machines in the markets we don’t even have stores so it took to the ecom the big picture here for us is that we need to find ways to be so differentiated that people will themselves to our sites for the total delivered value of the ecom offer and by that industry gets back at the logistics we have been able to demonstrate that we’re going to be able to shift product maybe on our financial credit but to that customer more reliably and i keep saying that it’s pretty important and our shipping lanes faster and that equal or better costs and if we can apply that to their existing spend keep in our retail ecosystem than i think we’ve got a fair shot here to take good chunks of categories that today are out short and even shifts of our in floor or on the floor selling space to this digital channel that’s the idea and they applies not just the food of course as i said it can apply to even big ticket bulky categories that you would normally bringing sealift we have the mattresses work that way but people still want to order the furniture they really want to buy in terms of fabric selection and theyll pay the extra freight as long as you get it there in reasonable time and it doesn’t arrived damaged that kind of a retailer who i think we are already but if we enhance our logistics aspect to the offer than i think we have simply compelling so that kind of that’s the bigger picture for us and where we think it can go but we just need to put more irons in the fire and start learning from our mistakes and successes so the first one is pacificalaska wholesale in the fall we will have some of our merchandise up in the fall as well but we won’t have learnt enough to talked more about intelligently and of course with nsa we considered that to be enabler we’re just getting going on there so the pieces are there some stuff we put into the puzzle but i think it’s going to be more into learning into next year and that also making sure we have the people on our team who can drive this on top of we’re doing already in the rest of the business michael van aelst and two other shorter questions one when does the new food supply agreement kick in with metro edward kennedy it’s started three weeks ago michael van aelst and then in alaska you talk about the top economic conditions so what would you say is helped you get off to a good start regardless edward kennedy regardless i think our  we’ve got some money in the market some government relief tax money has come in tax refund money it hasn’t been desire i mean as we kind of suspected like the worst case was that we were going to have cuts to state employment in there have been some but i think that the base core income of our customers is more core than working for the state government and a lot of our customers are work in the state government they’re receiving transfer payment so the snap program still there that’s the nutrition allowance one although the trump administration proposed to cut it by third i think i don’t think thatll get through congress so i think were defining as the core income still in alaska the competitive situation hasn’t change better or worse and we’ve run a pretty type business expense wise so we’ve shown before that we can  might not  the bottomline by more than  but it’s not the bad year for us in alaska that’s okay operator there are no further questions registered at this time i will now like to turn the meeting back over to mr kennedy edward kennedy okay thank you very much for your questions we look forward to being on the line with you and september were going to be cambridge bay where the new indiscernible research station or center that open surely after our board meeting up there in september and we’ll look forward to updating on our acquisitions what the pricing situation is with our giant tiger stores and our momentum in northern canada before i wrap up i want to just acknowledge and let you know that paulina hiebert our vp and legal and corporate secretary is retiring so she will not be on this call unless i extended her retirement further but i have done already to the middle of august so there’ll be another individual a very capable it’s hard to replace paulina we recognized just recently for our governance which was which group was that gave us the  paulina hiebert canadian corporate governance edward kennedy canadian corporate governance so and we’ve to reflect on this is our board i know maybe it doesn’t interesting to investors and analyst but i think you do appreciate good governance and i think north west tries hard to that respect but behind the scene when paulina joined us  years ago we weren’t logging at the wilderness we were okay but it was we didn’t have legal department at all and we didn’t have the expertise that paulina brought to the table we build a very strong legal team here and just want to let you know what paulina has gone but she’s helped us a lot and whoever is coming next will continue our governance practices and try to make it even better so with that i’m going to wrap up and again thanks everyone we’ll look forward to speaking with you after q and if you have any
