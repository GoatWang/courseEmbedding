support helped blackberry devices gain increased usage by governments and businesses during fiscal  total assets declared in the rims balance sheet grew eightfold due to massive capacity expansion global expansion and competition –edit rim soon began to introduce blackberry devices aimed towards the consumer market as well beginning with the blackberry pearl —the first blackberry phone to include multimedia features such as a camera the introduction of the pearl series was highly successful as was the subsequent curve  series and bold  extensive carrier partnerships fuelled the rapid expansion of blackberry users globally in both enterprise and consumer markets despite the arrival of the first apple iphone in  blackberry sustained unprecedented market share growth well into  the introduction of apples iphone on the att network in the fall of  in the united states prompted rim to produce its first touchscreen smartphone for the competing network in —the blackberry storm the storm sold well but suffered from mixed to poor reviews and poor customer satisfaction the iphone initially lagged behind the blackberry in both shipments and active users due to rims head start and larger carrier distribution network in the united states the blackberry user base peaked at approximately  million users in the fall of  that quarter the companys global subscriber base stood at  million users as the iphone and google android accelerated growth in the united states the blackberry began to turn to other smartphone platforms nonetheless the blackberry line as a whole continued to enjoy success spurred on by strong international growth as of december   the company had  million blackberry users globally with only  million remaining in the united states even as the company continued to grow worldwide investors and media became increasingly alarmed about the companys ability to compete with devices from rival mobile operating systems ios and android analysts were also worried about the strategic direction of the coceos management structure in june  cnn released an article citing blackberry as one of six endangered uscanadian brands following numerous attempts to upgrade their existing java platform the company made numerous acquisitions to help it create a new more powerful blackberry platform centered around its recently acquired realtime operating system qnx in march  research in motion ltd’s thencoceo jim balsillie suggested during a conference call that the launch of some powerful new blackberrys eventually released as blackberry  would be in early  however analysts were worried that promoting the mysterious supposedly gamechanging devices too early might hurt sales of existing blackberrys similar to the osborne effect the initial launch date was seen in retrospect as too ambitious and hurt the companys credibility at a time when its existing aging products steadily lost market share on september   rim announced the longrumoured blackberry playbook tablet the first product running on the new qnx platform known as blackberry tablet os the blackberry playbook was officially released to us and canadian consumers on april   the playbook was criticized for being rushed to market in an incomplete state and sold poorly following the shipments of  tablets during its first three quarters on market slow sales and inventory pileups prompted the company to reduce prices and to write down the inventory value by  million primary competitionedit the primary competitors of the blackberry are smartphones running android and the apple iphone with microsofts windows phone platform emerging as a more recent competitor for a number of years the blackberry was the leading smartphone in many markets particularly the united states the arrival of the apple iphone and later googles android platform caused a slowdown in blackberry growth and a decline in sales in some markets most notably the united states this led to negative media and analyst sentiment over the companys ability to continue as an independent company when apples iphone was first introduced in  it generated substantial media attention with numerous media outlets calling it a blackberry killer while blackberry sales continued to grow the newer iphone grew at a faster rate and the  percent drop in blackberrys stock price between  and  is primarily attributed to the performance of the iphone handset the first three models of the iphone introduced in  generally lagged behind the blackberry in sales as rim had major advantages in carrier and enterprise support however apple continued gaining market share in october  apple briefly passed rim in quarterly sales when they announced they had sold  million iphones to the  million sold by rim comparing partially overlapping quarters between the companies though apples iphone sales declined to  million in the subsequent quarter and rims increased to  million for some investors this indicated a sign of weakness apples iphone began to sell more phones quarterly than the blackberry in  brought on by the release of the iphone  in the united states the blackberry hit its peak in september  when almost  million users or  of the  million american smartphone users at the time were using a blackberry blackberry then began to decline in use in the united states with apples installed base in the united states finally passing blackberry in april  sales of the iphone continued to accelerate as did the smartphone market while the blackberry began to lose users continuously in the united states by february  only  million  of the  million smartphone users in the united states were running blackberry compared to  million  on an iphone googles android mobile operating system running on hardware by a range of manufacturers including sony motorola htc samsung lg and many others ramped up the competition for blackberry in january  barely  million  of the  million smartphones in use at the time in the united states were running android compared to  million blackberry devices  within a single year android had passed the installed base of the blackberry in the united states by february  only  million  of the  million smartphone users in the united states were running blackberry compared to  million  running android while rims secure encrypted network was attractive to corporate customers their handsets were sometimes considered less attractive to consumers than iphone and android smartphones developers often developed consumer applications for those platforms and not the blackberry during s even enterprise customers had begun to adopt byod policies due to employee feedback the company also faced criticism that its hardware and operating system were outdated and unappealing compared to the competition and that the browsing capabilities were poorer strategic changes and restructuring –presentedit slowing growth prompted the company to undertake a layoff of  employees in the summer of  in september  the companys blackberry internet service suffered a massive outage impacting millions of customers for several days the outage embarrassingly occurred as apple prepared to launch the iphone s causing fears of mass defections from the platform shortly afterwards in october  rim unveiled bbx a new platform for future blackberry smartphones that would be based on the same qnxbased platform as the playbook however due to an accusation of trademark infringement regarding the name bbx the platform was renamed blackberry  the task proved to be daunting with the company delaying the launch in december  to some time in  on january   mike lazaridis and jim balsillie resigned as the ceos of the company handing the reins over to executive thorsten heins on march   the company

launch which the company expected would rise to  by the time the device made its debut in the united states in support of the launch the company aired its first super bowl television advertisement in the us and canada during super bowl xlvii in discussing the decision to create a proprietary operating system instead of adopting an offtheshelf platform such as android heins noted if you look at other suppliers ability to differentiate theres very little wiggle room we looked at it seriously—but if you understand what the promise of blackberry is to its user base its all about getting stuff done games media we have to be good at it but we have to support those guys who are ahead of the game very little time to consume and enjoy content—if you stay true to that purpose you have to build on that basis and if we want to serve that segment we cant do it on a metoo approach chief operating officer kristian tear remarked we want to regain our position as the number one in the world while chief marketing officer frank boulben proclaimed it could be the greatest comeback in tech history the carriers are behind us they dont want a duopoly referring to apple and samsung during the blackberry  launch event the company also announced that it would change its public brand from research in motion to blackberry the name change was made to put the blackberry brand at the centre of

the incorporation of encryption and smime support helped blackberry devices gain increased usage by governments and businesses during fiscal  total assets declared in the rims balance sheet grew eightfold due to massive capacity expansion global expansion and competition –edit rim soon began to introduce blackberry devices aimed towards the consumer market as well beginning with the blackberry pearl —the first blackberry phone to include multimedia features such as a camera the introduction of the pearl series was highly successful as was the subsequent curve  series and bold  extensive carrier partnerships fuelled the rapid expansion of blackberry users globally in both enterprise and consumer markets despite the arrival of the first apple iphone in  blackberry sustained unprecedented market share growth well into  the introduction of apples iphone on the att network in the fall of  in the united states prompted rim to produce its first touchscreen smartphone for the competing network in —the blackberry storm the storm sold well but suffered from mixed to poor reviews and poor customer satisfaction the iphone initially lagged behind the blackberry in both shipments and active users due to rims head start and larger carrier distribution network in the united states the blackberry user base peaked at approximately  million users in the fall of  that quarter the companys global subscriber base stood at  million users as the iphone and google android accelerated growth in the united states the blackberry began to turn to other smartphone platforms nonetheless the blackberry line as a whole continued to enjoy success spurred on by strong international growth as of december   the company had  million blackberry users globally with only  million remaining in the united states even as the company continued to grow worldwide investors and media became increasingly alarmed about the companys ability to compete with devices from rival mobile operating systems ios and android analysts were also worried about the strategic direction of the coceos management structure in june  cnn released an article citing blackberry as one of six endangered uscanadian brands following numerous attempts to upgrade their existing java platform the company made numerous acquisitions to help it create a new more powerful blackberry platform centered around its recently acquired realtime operating system qnx in march  research in motion ltd’s thencoceo jim balsillie suggested during a conference call that the launch of some powerful new blackberrys eventually released as blackberry  would be in early  however analysts were worried that promoting the mysterious supposedly gamechanging devices too early might hurt sales of existing blackberrys similar to the osborne effect the initial launch date was seen in retrospect as too ambitious and hurt the companys credibility at a time when its existing aging products steadily lost market share on september   rim announced the longrumoured blackberry playbook tablet the first product running on the new qnx platform known as blackberry tablet os the blackberry playbook was officially released to us and canadian consumers on april   the playbook was criticized for being rushed to market in an incomplete state and sold poorly following the shipments of  tablets during its first three quarters on market slow sales and inventory pileups prompted the company to reduce prices and to write down the inventory value by  million primary competitionedit the primary competitors of the blackberry are smartphones running android and the apple iphone with microsofts windows phone platform emerging as a more recent competitor for a number of years the blackberry was the leading smartphone in many markets particularly the united states the arrival of the apple iphone and later googles android platform caused a slowdown in blackberry growth and a decline in sales in some markets most notably the united states this led to negative media and analyst sentiment over the companys ability to continue as an independent company when apples iphone was first introduced in  it generated substantial media attention with numerous media outlets calling it a blackberry killer while blackberry sales continued to grow the newer iphone grew at a faster rate and the  percent drop in blackberrys stock price between  and  is primarily attributed to the performance of the iphone handset the first three models of the iphone introduced in  generally lagged behind the blackberry in sales as rim had major advantages in carrier and enterprise support however apple continued gaining market share in october  apple briefly passed rim in quarterly sales when they announced they had sold  million iphones to the  million sold by rim comparing partially overlapping quarters between the companies though apples iphone sales declined to  million in the subsequent quarter and rims increased to  million for some investors this indicated a sign of weakness apples iphone began to sell more phones quarterly than the blackberry in  brought on by the release of the iphone  in the united states the blackberry hit its peak in september  when almost  million users or  of the  million american smartphone users at the time were using a blackberry blackberry then began to decline in use in the united states with apples installed base in the united states finally passing blackberry in april  sales of the iphone continued to accelerate as did the smartphone market while the blackberry began to lose users continuously in the united states by february  only  million  of the  million smartphone users in the united states were running blackberry compared to  million  on an iphone googles android mobile operating system running on hardware by a range of manufacturers including sony motorola htc samsung lg and many others ramped up the competition for blackberry in january  barely  million  of the  million smartphones in use at the time in the united states were running android compared to  million blackberry devices  within a single year android had passed the installed base of the blackberry in the united states by february  only  million  of the  million smartphone users in the united states were running blackberry compared to  million  running android while rims secure encrypted network was attractive to corporate customers their handsets were sometimes considered less attractive to consumers than iphone and android smartphones developers often developed consumer applications for those platforms and not the blackberry during s even enterprise customers had begun to adopt byod policies due to employee feedback the company also faced criticism that its hardware and operating system were outdated and unappealing compared to the competition and that the browsing capabilities were poorer strategic changes and restructuring –presentedit slowing growth prompted the company to undertake a layoff of  employees in the summer of  in september  the companys blackberry internet service suffered a massive outage impacting millions of customers for several days the outage embarrassingly occurred as apple prepared to launch the iphone s causing fears of mass defections from the platform shortly afterwards in october  rim unveiled bbx a new platform for future blackberry smartphones that would be based on the same qnxbased platform as the playbook however due to an accusation of trademark infringement regarding the name bbx the platform was renamed blackberry  the task proved to be daunting with the company delaying the launch in december  to some time in  on january   mike lazaridis and jim balsillie resigned as the ceos of the company handing the reins over to executive thorsten heins on march   the company reported its first net loss in years heins set about the task of restructuring the company including announcing plans to lay off  employees replacing numerous executives and delaying the new qnxbased operating system for phones blackberry  a second time into january  blackberry edit after much criticism and numerous delays rim officially launched blackberry  and two new smartphones based off the platform the blackberry z and q on january   the blackberry z the first blackberry smartphone running blackberry  debuted worldwide in january  going on sale immediately in the uk with other countries following a marked departure from previous blackberry phones the z featured a fully touchbased design a dualcore processor and a highdefinition display blackberry  had  applications available at launch which the company expected would rise to  by the time the device made its debut in the united states in support of the launch the company aired its first super bowl television advertisement in the us and canada during super bowl xlvii in discussing the decision to create a proprietary operating system instead of adopting an offtheshelf platform such as android heins noted if you look at other suppliers ability to differentiate theres very little wiggle room we looked at it seriously—but if you understand what the promise of blackberry is to its user base its all about getting stuff done games media we have to be good at it but we have to support those guys who are ahead of the game very little time to consume and enjoy content—if you stay true to that purpose you have to build on that basis and if we want to serve that segment we cant do it on a metoo approach chief operating officer kristian tear remarked we want to regain our position as the number one in the world while chief marketing officer frank boulben proclaimed it could be the greatest comeback in tech history the carriers are behind us they dont want a duopoly referring to apple and samsung during the blackberry  launch event the company also announced that it would change its public brand from research in motion to blackberry the name change was made to put the blackberry brand at the centre of the companys diverse brands and because customers in some markets already know the company as blackberry while a shareholder vote

to shift the organization’s focus to services and software an analyst with londons abi research said john chen is just sustaining the handset business as he sorts out the way ahead as part of the localization effort for the promotion of the z the handsets back panel was engraved with the word jakarta but skepticism still emerged as the handset was still more than twice as expensive as android

future enterpriseoriented products from the company such as the blackberry  in april  the first blackberry smartphone the blackberry os platform and bes continued to increase in functionality—while the incorporation of encryption and smime support helped blackberry devices gain increased usage by governments and businesses during fiscal  total assets declared in the rims balance sheet grew eightfold due to massive capacity expansion global expansion and competition –edit rim soon began to introduce blackberry devices aimed towards the consumer market as well beginning with the blackberry pearl —the first blackberry phone to include multimedia features such as a camera the introduction of the pearl series was highly successful as was the subsequent curve  series and bold  extensive carrier partnerships fuelled the rapid expansion of blackberry users globally in both enterprise and consumer markets despite the arrival of the first apple iphone in  blackberry sustained unprecedented market share growth well into  the introduction of apples iphone on the att network in the fall of  in the united states prompted rim to produce its first touchscreen smartphone for the competing network in —the blackberry storm the storm sold well but suffered from mixed to poor reviews and poor customer satisfaction the iphone initially lagged behind the blackberry in both shipments and active users due to rims head start and larger carrier distribution network in the united states the blackberry user base peaked at approximately  million users in the fall of  that quarter the companys global subscriber base stood at  million users as the iphone and google android accelerated growth in the united states the blackberry began to turn to other smartphone platforms nonetheless the blackberry line as a whole continued to enjoy success spurred on by strong international growth as of december   the company had  million blackberry users globally with only  million remaining in the united states even as the company continued to grow worldwide investors and media became increasingly alarmed about the companys ability to compete with devices from rival mobile operating systems ios and android analysts were also worried about the strategic direction of the coceos management structure in june  cnn released an article citing blackberry as one of six endangered uscanadian brands following numerous attempts to upgrade their existing java platform the company made numerous acquisitions to help it create a new more powerful blackberry platform centered around its recently acquired realtime operating system qnx in march  research in motion ltd’s thencoceo jim balsillie suggested during a conference call that the launch of some powerful new blackberrys eventually released as blackberry  would be in early  however analysts were worried that promoting the mysterious supposedly gamechanging devices too early might hurt sales of existing blackberrys similar to the osborne effect the initial launch date was seen in retrospect as too ambitious and hurt the companys credibility at a time when its existing aging products steadily lost market share on september   rim announced the longrumoured blackberry playbook tablet the first product running on the new qnx platform known as blackberry tablet os the blackberry playbook was officially released to us and canadian consumers on april   the playbook was criticized for being rushed to market in an incomplete state and sold poorly following the shipments of  tablets during its first three quarters on market slow sales and inventory pileups prompted the company to reduce prices and to write down the inventory value by  million primary competitionedit the primary competitors of the blackberry are smartphones running android and the apple iphone with microsofts windows phone platform emerging as a more recent competitor for a number of years the blackberry was the leading smartphone in many markets particularly the united states the arrival of the apple iphone and later googles android platform caused a slowdown in blackberry growth and a decline in sales in some markets most notably the united states this led to negative media and analyst sentiment over the companys ability to continue as an independent company when apples iphone was first introduced in  it generated substantial media attention with numerous media outlets calling it a blackberry killer while blackberry sales continued to grow the newer iphone grew at a faster rate and the  percent drop in blackberrys stock price between  and  is primarily attributed to the performance of the iphone handset the first three models of the iphone introduced in  generally lagged behind the blackberry in sales as rim had major advantages in carrier and enterprise support however apple continued gaining market share in october  apple briefly passed rim in quarterly sales when they announced they had sold  million iphones to the  million sold by rim comparing partially overlapping quarters between the companies though apples iphone sales declined to  million in the subsequent quarter and rims increased to  million for some investors this indicated a sign of weakness apples iphone began to sell more phones quarterly than the blackberry in  brought on by the release of the iphone  in the united states the blackberry hit its peak in september  when almost  million users or  of the  million american smartphone users at the time were using a blackberry blackberry then began to decline in use in the united states with apples installed base in the united states finally passing blackberry in april  sales of the iphone continued to accelerate as did the smartphone market while the blackberry began to lose users continuously in the united states by february  only  million  of the  million smartphone users in the united states were running blackberry compared to  million  on an iphone googles android mobile operating system running on hardware by a range of manufacturers including sony motorola htc samsung lg and many others ramped up the competition for blackberry in january  barely  million  of the  million smartphones in use at the time in the united states were running android compared to  million blackberry devices  within a single year android had passed the installed base of the blackberry in the united states by february  only  million  of the  million smartphone users in the united states were running blackberry compared to  million  running android while rims secure encrypted network was attractive to corporate customers their handsets were sometimes considered less attractive to consumers than iphone and android smartphones developers often developed consumer applications for those platforms and not the blackberry during s even enterprise customers had begun to adopt byod policies due to employee feedback the company also faced criticism that its hardware and operating system were outdated and unappealing compared to the competition and that the browsing capabilities were poorer strategic changes and restructuring –presentedit slowing growth prompted the company to undertake a layoff of  employees in the summer of  in september  the companys blackberry internet service suffered a massive outage impacting millions of customers for several days the outage embarrassingly occurred as apple prepared to launch the iphone s causing fears of mass defections from the platform shortly afterwards in october  rim unveiled bbx a new platform for future blackberry smartphones that would be based on the same qnxbased platform as the playbook however due to an accusation of trademark infringement regarding the name bbx the platform was renamed blackberry  the task proved to be daunting with the company delaying the launch in december  to some time in  on january   mike lazaridis and jim balsillie resigned as the ceos of the company handing the reins over to executive thorsten heins on march   the company reported its first net loss in years heins set about the task of restructuring the company including announcing plans to lay off  employees replacing numerous executives and delaying the new qnxbased operating system for phones blackberry  a second time into january  blackberry edit after much criticism and numerous delays rim officially launched blackberry  and two new smartphones based off the platform the blackberry z and q on january   the blackberry z the first blackberry smartphone running blackberry  debuted worldwide in january  going on sale immediately in the uk with other countries following a marked departure from previous blackberry phones the z featured a fully touchbased design a dualcore processor and a highdefinition display blackberry  had  applications available at launch which the company expected would rise to  by the time the device made its debut in the united states in support of the launch the company aired its first super bowl television advertisement in the us and canada during super bowl xlvii in discussing the decision to create a proprietary operating system instead of adopting an offtheshelf platform such as android heins noted if you look at other suppliers ability to differentiate theres very little wiggle room we looked at it seriously—but if you understand what the promise of blackberry is to its user base its all about getting stuff done games media we have to be good at it but we have to support those guys who are ahead of the game very little time to consume and enjoy content—if you stay true to that purpose you have to build on that basis and if we want to serve that segment we cant do it on a metoo approach chief operating officer kristian tear remarked we want to regain our position as the number one in the world while chief marketing officer frank boulben proclaimed it could be the greatest comeback in tech history the carriers are behind us they dont want a duopoly referring to apple and samsung during the blackberry  launch event the company also announced that it would change its public brand from research in motion to blackberry the name change was made to put the blackberry brand at the centre of the companys diverse brands and because customers in some markets already know the company as blackberry while a shareholder vote on an official name change to blackberry limited will be held at its next annual general meeting its ticker symbols on the tsx and nasdaq changed to bb and bbry respectively on february   on august   the company announced that it was open to being purchased and stated in an official news release to canada’s securities administrators the company’s board of directors has formed a special committee

blackberrys largest shareholder had in the company at the same time blackberry installed john chen as ceo to replace the laidoff heins according to the globe and mail blackberrys hope was that chen

summit in july  in may  the lowcost blackberry z was introduced onto the indonesian market where the brand had been particularly popular the budget handset was produced in partnership with taiwanese manufacturer foxconn technology group which handled the design and distribution of the product a new york times analysis stated that the model was an attempt by chen to generate revenue while he tried to shift the organization’s focus to services and software an analyst with londons abi research said john chen is just sustaining the handset business as he sorts out the way ahead as part of the localization effort for the promotion of the z the handsets back panel was engraved with the word jakarta but skepticism still emerged as the handset was still more than twice as expensive as android

future enterpriseoriented products from the company such as the blackberry  in april  the first blackberry smartphone the blackberry os platform and bes continued to increase in functionality—while the incorporation of encryption and smime support helped blackberry devices gain increased usage by governments and businesses during fiscal  total assets declared in the rims balance sheet grew eightfold due to massive capacity expansion global expansion and competition –edit rim soon began to introduce blackberry devices aimed towards the consumer market as well beginning with the blackberry pearl —the first blackberry phone to include multimedia features such as a camera the introduction of the pearl series was highly successful as was the subsequent curve  series and bold  extensive carrier partnerships fuelled the rapid expansion of blackberry users globally in both enterprise and consumer markets despite the arrival of the first apple iphone in  blackberry sustained unprecedented market share growth well into  the introduction of apples iphone on the att network in the fall of  in the united states prompted rim to produce its first touchscreen smartphone for the competing network in —the blackberry storm the storm sold well but suffered from mixed to poor reviews and poor customer satisfaction the iphone initially lagged behind the blackberry in both shipments and active users due to rims head start and larger carrier distribution network in the united states the blackberry user base peaked at approximately  million users in the fall of  that quarter the companys global subscriber base stood at  million users as the iphone and google android accelerated growth in the united states the blackberry began to turn to other smartphone platforms nonetheless the blackberry line as a whole continued to enjoy success spurred on by strong international growth as of december   the company had  million blackberry users globally with only  million remaining in the united states even as the company continued to grow worldwide investors and media became increasingly alarmed about the companys ability to compete with devices from rival mobile operating systems ios and android analysts were also worried about the strategic direction of the coceos management structure in june  cnn released an article citing blackberry as one of six endangered uscanadian brands following numerous attempts to upgrade their existing java platform the company made numerous acquisitions to help it create a new more powerful blackberry platform centered around its recently acquired realtime operating system qnx in march  research in motion ltd’s thencoceo jim balsillie suggested during a conference call that the launch of some powerful new blackberrys eventually released as blackberry  would be in early  however analysts were worried that promoting the mysterious supposedly gamechanging devices too early might hurt sales of existing blackberrys similar to the osborne effect the initial launch date was seen in retrospect as too ambitious and hurt the companys credibility at a time when its existing aging products steadily lost market share on september   rim announced the longrumoured blackberry playbook tablet the first product running on the new qnx platform known as blackberry tablet os the blackberry playbook was officially released to us and canadian consumers on april   the playbook was criticized for being rushed to market in an incomplete state and sold poorly following the shipments of  tablets during its first three quarters on market slow sales and inventory pileups prompted the company to reduce prices and to write down the inventory value by  million primary competitionedit the primary competitors of the blackberry are smartphones running android and the apple iphone with microsofts windows phone platform emerging as a more recent competitor for a number of years the blackberry was the leading smartphone in many markets particularly the united states the arrival of the apple iphone and later googles android platform caused a slowdown in blackberry growth and a decline in sales in some markets most notably the united states this led to negative media and analyst sentiment over the companys ability to continue as an independent company when apples iphone was first introduced in  it generated substantial media attention with numerous media outlets calling it a blackberry killer while blackberry sales continued to grow the newer iphone grew at a faster rate and the  percent drop in blackberrys stock price between  and  is primarily attributed to the performance of the iphone handset the first three models of the iphone introduced in  generally lagged behind the blackberry in sales as rim had major advantages in carrier and enterprise support however apple continued gaining market share in october  apple briefly passed rim in quarterly sales when they announced they had sold  million iphones to the  million sold by rim comparing partially overlapping quarters between the companies though apples iphone sales declined to  million in the subsequent quarter and rims increased to  million for some investors this indicated a sign of weakness apples iphone began to sell more phones quarterly than the blackberry in  brought on by the release of the iphone  in the united states the blackberry hit its peak in september  when almost  million users or  of the  million american smartphone users at the time were using a blackberry blackberry then began to decline in use in the united states with apples installed base in the united states finally passing blackberry in april  sales of the iphone continued to accelerate as did the smartphone market while the blackberry began to lose users continuously in the united states by february  only  million  of the  million smartphone users in the united states were running blackberry compared to  million  on an iphone googles android mobile operating system running on hardware by a range of manufacturers including sony motorola htc samsung lg and many others ramped up the competition for blackberry in january  barely  million  of the  million smartphones in use at the time in the united states were running android compared to  million blackberry devices  within a single year android had passed the installed base of the blackberry in the united states by february  only  million  of the  million smartphone users in the united states were running blackberry compared to  million  running android while rims secure encrypted network was attractive to corporate customers their handsets were sometimes considered less attractive to consumers than iphone and android smartphones developers often developed consumer applications for those platforms and not the blackberry during s even enterprise customers had begun to adopt byod policies due to employee feedback the company also faced criticism that its hardware and operating system were outdated and unappealing compared to the competition and that the browsing capabilities were poorer strategic changes and restructuring –presentedit slowing growth prompted the company to undertake a layoff of  employees in the summer of  in september  the companys blackberry internet service suffered a massive outage impacting millions of customers for several days the outage embarrassingly occurred as apple prepared to launch the iphone s causing fears of mass defections from the platform shortly afterwards in october  rim unveiled bbx a new platform for future blackberry smartphones that would be based on the same qnxbased platform as the playbook however due to an accusation of trademark infringement regarding the name bbx the platform was renamed blackberry  the task proved to be daunting with the company delaying the launch in december  to some time in  on january   mike lazaridis and jim balsillie resigned as the ceos of the company handing the reins over to executive thorsten heins on march   the company reported its first net loss in years heins set about the task of restructuring the company including announcing plans to lay off  employees replacing numerous executives and delaying the new qnxbased operating system for phones blackberry  a second time into january  blackberry edit after much criticism and numerous delays rim officially launched blackberry  and two new smartphones based off the platform the blackberry z and q on january   the blackberry z the first blackberry smartphone running blackberry  debuted worldwide in january  going on sale immediately in the uk with other countries following a marked departure from previous blackberry phones the z featured a fully touchbased design a dualcore processor and a highdefinition display blackberry  had  applications available at launch which the company expected would rise to  by the time the device made its debut in the united states in support of the launch the company aired its first super bowl television advertisement in the us and canada during super bowl xlvii in discussing the decision to create a proprietary operating system instead of adopting an offtheshelf platform such as android heins noted if you look at other suppliers ability to differentiate theres very little wiggle room we looked at it seriously—but if you understand what the promise of blackberry is to its user base its all about getting stuff done games media we have to be good at it but we have to support those guys who are ahead of the game very little time to consume and enjoy content—if you stay true to that purpose you have to build on that basis and if we want to serve that segment we cant do it on a metoo approach chief operating officer kristian tear remarked we want to regain our position as the number one in the world while chief marketing officer frank boulben proclaimed it could be the greatest comeback in tech history the carriers are behind us they dont want a duopoly referring to apple and samsung during the blackberry  launch event the company also announced that it would change its public brand from research in motion to blackberry the name change was made to put the blackberry brand at the centre of the companys diverse brands and because customers in some markets already know the company as blackberry while a shareholder vote on an official name change to blackberry limited will be held at its next annual general meeting its ticker symbols on the tsx and nasdaq changed to bb and bbry respectively on february   on august   the company announced that it was open to being purchased and stated in an official news release to canada’s securities administrators the company’s board of directors has formed a special committee to explore strategic alternatives to enhance value and increase scale in order to accelerate blackberry  deployment these alternatives could include among others possible joint ventures strategic

in blackberry if the company became private also on august   foremost shareholder prem watsa resigned from blackberrys board on september   the company announced it would lay off  staff and take a cad billion operating loss three days later the company announced that it had signed a letter of intent to be acquired by a consortium led by prem watsaowned fairfax financial holdings for a  per share deal this deal was also confirmed by watsa on september   the company began operating a direct sales model for customers in the united states where unlocked q and z smartphones were sold directly from the blackberry website on october   the company published an open letter in  publications in nine countries to reassure customers that blackberry would continue to operate anthony michael sabino st john’s university business professor stated in the washington post this is blackberry’s last ditch attempt to simply survive in the face of crushing competition in a market it essentially invented john chen joins blackberryedit on november   the fairfax prem watsa deal was scrapped in favor of a us billion cash injection which according to one analyst represented the level of confidence blackberrys largest shareholder had in the company at the same time blackberry installed john chen as ceo to replace the laidoff heins according to the globe and mail blackberrys hope was that chen with his reputation as a turnaround artist could save the company john chen knows how to manage a mobile company and perhaps most importantly can make things happen in the industry j gold associates principal analyst jack gold told the publication we have begun moving the company to embrace a multiplatform byod world by adopting a new mobility management platform and a new device strategy chen explained in an open letter published shortly after his appointment i believe in the value of this brand with the right team and the right strategy in place i am confident that we will rebuild

companies in regulated industries such as healthcare financial and legal services he later clarified that blackberrys device division remained part of his strategy and that his company was also looking to invest in emerging solutions such as machine to machine technologies that will help power the backbone of the internet of things he would later expand on this idea at a blackberry security summit in july  in may  the lowcost blackberry z was introduced onto the indonesian market where the brand had been particularly popular the budget handset was produced in partnership with taiwanese manufacturer foxconn technology group which handled the design and distribution of the product a new york times analysis stated that the model was an attempt by chen to generate revenue while he tried to shift the organization’s focus to services and software an analyst with londons abi research said john chen is just sustaining the handset business as he sorts out the way ahead as part of the localization effort for the promotion of the z the handsets back panel was engraved with the word jakarta but skepticism still emerged as the handset was still more than twice as expensive as android models in indonesia at the time of release software transition presentedit in the first quarter of the  fiscal year chen stated this is of course the very beginning of our task and we hope that we will be able to report better results going forward  we feel pretty good about where we are quartz reported that stock was up by  percent compared to the same period in the previous year while chen

twoway paging and wireless email network pivotal in this development was the release of the interctive pager  which started shipping in august  about the size of a bar of soap this device competed against the skytel twoway paging network developed by motorola in  rim introduced the blackberry  pager named in reference to the resemblance of its keyboards keys to the druplets of the blackberry

future enterpriseoriented products from the company such as the blackberry  in april  the first blackberry smartphone the blackberry os platform and bes continued to increase in functionality—while the incorporation of encryption and smime support helped blackberry devices gain increased usage by governments and businesses during fiscal  total assets declared in the rims balance sheet grew eightfold due to massive capacity expansion global expansion and competition –edit rim soon began to introduce blackberry devices aimed towards the consumer market as well beginning with the blackberry pearl —the first blackberry phone to include multimedia features such as a camera the introduction of the pearl series was highly successful as was the subsequent curve  series and bold  extensive carrier partnerships fuelled the rapid expansion of blackberry users globally in both enterprise and consumer markets despite the arrival of the first apple iphone in  blackberry sustained unprecedented market share growth well into  the introduction of apples iphone on the att network in the fall of  in the united states prompted rim to produce its first touchscreen smartphone for the competing network in —the blackberry storm the storm sold well but suffered from mixed to poor reviews and poor customer satisfaction the iphone initially lagged behind the blackberry in both shipments and active users due to rims head start and larger carrier distribution network in the united states the blackberry user base peaked at approximately  million users in the fall of  that quarter the companys global subscriber base stood at  million users as the iphone and google android accelerated growth in the united states the blackberry began to turn to other smartphone platforms nonetheless the blackberry line as a whole continued to enjoy success spurred on by strong international growth as of december   the company had  million blackberry users globally with only  million remaining in the united states even as the company continued to grow worldwide investors and media became increasingly alarmed about the companys ability to compete with devices from rival mobile operating systems ios and android analysts were also worried about the strategic direction of the coceos management structure in june  cnn released an article citing blackberry as one of six endangered uscanadian brands following numerous attempts to upgrade their existing java platform the company made numerous acquisitions to help it create a new more powerful blackberry platform centered around its recently acquired realtime operating system qnx in march  research in motion ltd’s thencoceo jim balsillie suggested during a conference call that the launch of some powerful new blackberrys eventually released as blackberry  would be in early  however analysts were worried that promoting the mysterious supposedly gamechanging devices too early might hurt sales of existing blackberrys similar to the osborne effect the initial launch date was seen in retrospect as too ambitious and hurt the companys credibility at a time when its existing aging products steadily lost market share on september   rim announced the longrumoured blackberry playbook tablet the first product running on the new qnx platform known as blackberry tablet os the blackberry playbook was officially released to us and canadian consumers on april   the playbook was criticized for being rushed to market in an incomplete state and sold poorly following the shipments of  tablets during its first three quarters on market slow sales and inventory pileups prompted the company to reduce prices and to write down the inventory value by  million primary competitionedit the primary competitors of the blackberry are smartphones running android and the apple iphone with microsofts windows phone platform emerging as a more recent competitor for a number of years the blackberry was the leading smartphone in many markets particularly the united states the arrival of the apple iphone and later googles android platform caused a slowdown in blackberry growth and a decline in sales in some markets most notably the united states this led to negative media and analyst sentiment over the companys ability to continue as an independent company when apples iphone was first introduced in  it generated substantial media attention with numerous media outlets calling it a blackberry killer while blackberry sales continued to grow the newer iphone grew at a faster rate and the  percent drop in blackberrys stock price between  and  is primarily attributed to the performance of the iphone handset the first three models of the iphone introduced in  generally lagged behind the blackberry in sales as rim had major advantages in carrier and enterprise support however apple continued gaining market share in october  apple briefly passed rim in quarterly sales when they announced they had sold  million iphones to the  million sold by rim comparing partially overlapping quarters between the companies though apples iphone sales declined to  million in the subsequent quarter and rims increased to  million for some investors this indicated a sign of weakness apples iphone began to sell more phones quarterly than the blackberry in  brought on by the release of the iphone  in the united states the blackberry hit its peak in september  when almost  million users or  of the  million american smartphone users at the time were using a blackberry blackberry then began to decline in use in the united states with apples installed base in the united states finally passing blackberry in april  sales of the iphone continued to accelerate as did the smartphone market while the blackberry began to lose users continuously in the united states by february  only  million  of the  million smartphone users in the united states were running blackberry compared to  million  on an iphone googles android mobile operating system running on hardware by a range of manufacturers including sony motorola htc samsung lg and many others ramped up the competition for blackberry in january  barely  million  of the  million smartphones in use at the time in the united states were running android compared to  million blackberry devices  within a single year android had passed the installed base of the blackberry in the united states by february  only  million  of the  million smartphone users in the united states were running blackberry compared to  million  running android while rims secure encrypted network was attractive to corporate customers their handsets were sometimes considered less attractive to consumers than iphone and android smartphones developers often developed consumer applications for those platforms and not the blackberry during s even enterprise customers had begun to adopt byod policies due to employee feedback the company also faced criticism that its hardware and operating system were outdated and unappealing compared to the competition and that the browsing capabilities were poorer strategic changes and restructuring –presentedit slowing growth prompted the company to undertake a layoff of  employees in the summer of  in september  the companys blackberry internet service suffered a massive outage impacting millions of customers for several days the outage embarrassingly occurred as apple prepared to launch the iphone s causing fears of mass defections from the platform shortly afterwards in october  rim unveiled bbx a new platform for future blackberry smartphones that would be based on the same qnxbased platform as the playbook however due to an accusation of trademark infringement regarding the name bbx the platform was renamed blackberry  the task proved to be daunting with the company delaying the launch in december  to some time in  on january   mike lazaridis and jim balsillie resigned as the ceos of the company handing the reins over to executive thorsten heins on march   the company reported its first net loss in years heins set about the task of restructuring the company including announcing plans to lay off  employees replacing numerous executives and delaying the new qnxbased operating system for phones blackberry  a second time into january  blackberry edit after much criticism and numerous delays rim officially launched blackberry  and two new smartphones based off the platform the blackberry z and q on january   the blackberry z the first blackberry smartphone running blackberry  debuted worldwide in january  going on sale immediately in the uk with other countries following a marked departure from previous blackberry phones the z featured a fully touchbased design a dualcore processor and a highdefinition display blackberry  had  applications available at launch which the company expected would rise to  by the time the device made its debut in the united states in support of the launch the company aired its first super bowl television advertisement in the us and canada during super bowl xlvii in discussing the decision to create a proprietary operating system instead of adopting an offtheshelf platform such as android heins noted if you look at other suppliers ability to differentiate theres very little wiggle room we looked at it seriously—but if you understand what the promise of blackberry is to its user base its all about getting stuff done games media we have to be good at it but we have to support those guys who are ahead of the game very little time to consume and enjoy content—if you stay true to that purpose you have to build on that basis and if we want to serve that segment we cant do it on a metoo approach chief operating officer kristian tear remarked we want to regain our position as the number one in the world while chief marketing officer frank boulben proclaimed it could be the greatest comeback in tech history the carriers are behind us they dont want a duopoly referring to apple and samsung during the blackberry  launch event the company also announced that it would change its public brand from research in motion to blackberry the name change was made to put the blackberry brand at the centre of the companys diverse brands and because customers in some markets already know the company as blackberry while a shareholder vote on an official name change to blackberry limited will be held at its next annual general meeting its ticker symbols on the tsx and nasdaq changed to bb and bbry respectively on february   on august   the company announced that it was open to being purchased and stated in an official news release to canada’s securities administrators the company’s board of directors has formed a special committee to explore strategic alternatives to enhance value and increase scale in order to accelerate blackberry  deployment these alternatives could include among others possible joint ventures strategic partnerships or alliances a sale of the company or other possible transactions premwatsafairfax dealedit canada pension plan investment board’s ceo mark wiseman stated that he would consider investing in blackberry if the company became private also on august   foremost shareholder prem watsa resigned from blackberrys board on september   the company announced it would lay off  staff and take a cad billion operating loss three days later the company announced that it had signed a letter of intent to be acquired by a consortium led by prem watsaowned fairfax financial holdings for a  per share deal this deal was also confirmed by watsa on september   the company began operating a direct sales model for customers in the united states where unlocked q and z smartphones were sold directly from the blackberry website on october   the company published an open letter in  publications in nine countries to reassure customers that blackberry would continue to operate anthony michael sabino st john’s university business professor stated in the washington post this is blackberry’s last ditch attempt to simply survive in the face of crushing competition in a market it essentially invented john chen joins blackberryedit on november   the fairfax prem watsa deal was scrapped in favor of a us billion cash injection which according to one analyst represented the level of confidence blackberrys largest shareholder had in the company at the same time blackberry installed john chen as ceo to replace the laidoff heins according to the globe and mail blackberrys hope was that chen with his reputation as a turnaround artist could save the company john chen knows how to manage a mobile company and perhaps most importantly can make things happen in the industry j gold associates principal analyst jack gold told the publication we have begun moving the company to embrace a multiplatform byod world by adopting a new mobility management platform and a new device strategy chen explained in an open letter published shortly after his appointment i believe in the value of this brand with the right team and the right strategy in place i am confident that we will rebuild blackberry for the benefit of all our constituencies  in april  chen spoke of his turnaround strategy in an interview with reuters explaining that he intended to invest in or partner with other companies in regulated industries such as healthcare financial and legal services he later clarified that blackberrys device division remained part of his strategy and that his company was also looking to invest in emerging solutions such as machine to machine technologies that will help power the backbone of the internet of things he would later expand on this idea at a blackberry security summit in july  in may  the lowcost blackberry z was introduced onto the indonesian market where the brand had been particularly popular the budget handset was produced in partnership with taiwanese manufacturer foxconn technology group which handled the design and distribution of the product a new york times analysis stated that the model was an attempt by chen to generate revenue while he tried to shift the organization’s focus to services and software an analyst with londons abi research said john chen is just sustaining the handset business as he sorts out the way ahead as part of the localization effort for the promotion of the z the handsets back panel was engraved with the word jakarta but skepticism still emerged as the handset was still more than twice as expensive as android models in indonesia at the time of release software transition presentedit in the first quarter of the  fiscal year chen stated this is of course the very beginning of our task and we hope that we will be able to report better results going forward  we feel pretty good about where we are quartz reported that stock was up by  percent compared to the same period in the previous year while chen expressed enthusiasm for the release of two new handsets both with keyboards and touch screens in the second half of  chen did not provide sales figures for the z phone in indonesia in september  chen

support and bring in a relatively large and diverse customer base while also helping drive incremental revenue growth it also noted that the acquisition  the largest in blackberrys history  indicated the companys commitment to a softwarefocused turnaround plan it remained ambivalent about the companys outlook overall in january  chen stated that blackberry did not plan on developing any new

productjun  about blackberry ltd bbry jay wei research analyst activist investor special situations longshort equitysummaryblackberry has always had a hardware of sorts that best used its software developments a strategy throughout its research in motion days and right up to its initial smartphone successhaving a hardware operation to aid its software business again something conceivable when considering the growing enterprisecloudinfrastructure environment blackberry may have a real chance to get back to its heydayssome have bet on blackberrys qnx for a real comeback but thats again in a computing space where the upcoming apple and googles automotive software may well dominate again bbry data by ycharts throughout its history blackberry ltd nasdaqbbry has always had a hardware of sorts to go along with its software developments early gadgets during its research in motion days range from its first film keycode reader different converters and modems to wireless pointofsale terminals the twoway messaging pager and an emailwireless network all embodiment of the companys wireless data and connectivity technologies the hardware manifestation of its software capabilities culminated with the introduction of the first blackberry smartphone although it failed later amid unprecedented competition from the iphone and android blackberry should have gone back to the drawing board for its next piece of hardware not necessarily another smartphone using hardware to project its software underpinnings is almost a hallmark for the company instead blackberry is now retreating from hardware and has decided to become a focused software and services company trying to sell its software and services without a hardware product to carry the load theres no clear indication that the new blackberry can come out better than the old one that followed the business model of channeling software through hardware it bears repeating the blackberry smartphone was actually an initial success because the company was able to sell a popular hardware that monetized its software knowhow the blackberry smartphone didnt fail on the hardware nor on the software in the true sense it lost to the iphone and android because it didnt have the kind of ecosystem apple inc nasdaqaapl and alphabet incs nasdaqgoog google were able to develop a key to gaining user loyalty think about it if you cant even get a decent dating app or popular business news app on a blackberry the device is practically useless for savvier users the blackberry smartphone could have made it if it wasnt for the pervasive developments of apple and google ecosystems over time the blame for its eventual loss lies within blackberrys failure to come up with its own ecosystem but its too late to litigate all that again which we did write a piece about in late  around the time of the companys reorganization with its current leadership obviously the company has come to terms with letting its blackberry smartphone quietly go away the disappearance of blackberrys hardware business has had a devastating effect on the companys financials the dramatic losses in total sales not making any money since at least fiscal  and an overwhelming shrinkage in shareholders equity almost by  over that period but the underlying business issue faced by todays blackberry is that it hasnt been able to show credible ways to grow its software and services without the help from some companion hardware blackberry saw consecutive quarterly sales growth in software and services only once over  quarters since fiscal  predictably any pickup in the sales of software and services was outpaced by the loss of sales in hardware the company reported sales of hardware and other legacy operations declining by close to  in fiscal  while it managed to increase software and services sales by about  too little to make up for hardware losses relying solely on selling software and services to enterprise customers and currently grossing sales about one tenth of what it was bringing in only five years ago blackberry may never get back to its heydays not by a long shot the nature of the companys products that is computing application software makes divorcing from hardware a flawed business proposition for companies selling operating software or business applications they dont have to worry about whether to tie their software with hardware while operating software is automatically paired onto hardware no single business application can be universally useful to all users and thus wont be preinstalled and sold through hardware however when it comes to computing application software or mobile security software in blackberrys case the marriage between software and hardware can be a better selling point for interested users if microsoft corp nasdaqmsft can have azure to help more effectively channel through its software products blackberry could certainly have some kind of cloud operation of its own to provide hardware uses that feature its common software functions such as security protection and mobile management including device and content the key here is to leverage a popular welladopted hardware backed by a companys proprietary software to increase sales potentially many fold larger its a business strategy blackberry has employed successfully in the past aside from blackberrys enterprise software and services the companys technology solutions such as its qnx for automotive seem to be providing the kind of hope for a blackberry comeback the qnx platform for autonomous driving and connected cars has indeed attracted a lot of attention for blackberry but familiar names from earlier battles in the smartphone market are also here to compete namely apple and google google has already come up with a version of its android operating system for car consoles and infotainment systems it plunges deeper to the underlying software on the car than what it did earlier with its android auto a system that only connects the drivers android phone with the cars screen to project the phones content this has direct ramification for blackberrys qnx business the qnx will likely face the same competitive advantage from the android operating system as that present in the smartphone market before which is the androids ability to have preinstalled google applications and vast number of thirdparty apps available for the android platform unless blackberry starts populating its app world to build up its own ecosystem the same mistake that caused the company the smartphone market will come to haunt it again in automotive the market doesnt seem to be undervaluing blackberry stock especially given the companys declining equity level without credible ways to boost enterprise software sales and having yet to convince investors that it can compete head to head against apple and google in the new battle of automotive the company may see its stock remaining rangebound going forward this is to assume that it can consistently reduce losses and preserve its equity base somewhat disclosure iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to

blackberry radar tracks location temperature and other variables by ben ames comment smartphone pioneer blackberry ltd said today that it rolled out an assettracking tag that delivers near realtime data on the location and condition of truck trailers and containers trucking companies that subscribe to the blackberry radar system can improve ontime deliveries theft prevention and fuel efficiency by attaching the brickshaped wireless devices to their trailers and shipping containers derek kuhn senior vice president of internet of things iot for waterloo ontbased blackberry said in a conference call with reporters blackberry which is entering a crowded field of assettracking systems said it will differentiate itself by offering a lowpriced model that delivers data through cloudbased platforms without requiring expensive it infrastructure the blackberry radar product is a software and hardware combination that includes a wireless hub that sends data through cellular networks and a connection to blackberrys cloudbased internet of things iot platform users attach the tracking device by drilling three holes in a trailer door to accommodate two bolts and a cable kuhn said once its connected customers such as fleet operation managers load planners and dispatchers can track realtime data on each units location temperature humidity whether the trailer doors are open or closed and whether the trailers are empty or loaded according to blackberry accessing that data has been a longstanding goal for the caravan group of companies a canadian crossborder carrier that operates  tractortrailers caravan has installed  blackberry radar trackers and plans to add more the company said running a fleet of smart trailers has been a vision of ours for a while but it wasnt until we met with blackberry that we thought it could come to fruition john iwaniura president of oakville ontbased caravan said in a statement blackberry radars success will depend on its ability to deliver a seamless tracking solution at a low price according to one expert this technology has been around for years said tony wayda supply chain practice senior director and principal at boulder colo consulting firm scapath llc the only thing that can make blackberrys solution any different is price point and ease of installation sensors are cheap nowadays blackberry could find an eager market among carriers of highvalue and temperaturecontrolled cargo as well as fleets that struggle to track their trailers between disparate yards wayda said for blackberry to make any ground here the price point needs to be attractive for the hardware app and data communication and the sensors will have to be ruggedized to survive the environment but easy to install wayda said the announcement is the latest in blackberrys efforts to reinvent itself as a wireless technology player in the transportation and logistics field it led the way in smartphone development in the consumer market but was
