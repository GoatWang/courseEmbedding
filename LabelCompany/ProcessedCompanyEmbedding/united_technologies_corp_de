united technologies corp utx outlines growth strategy  things investors should consider new united technologies ceo gregory hayes recently updated investors on the companys strategic direction and hinted at a future major acquisition here is what he said lee samaha tmfsaintgermain feb   at pm united technologies corp nyseutx investors can expect some changes in  not least because the company appears to be shaping up for a major acquisition in addition recently appointed ceo gregory hayes is actively reviewing the companys portfolio of businesses united technologies sikorsky manufactures the black hawk helicopter source sikorsky website hayes discussed such matters at the recent barclays industrial select conference lets take a closer look at what he said can we draw any conclusions about what can investors expect in   three things to look at with united technologies ever since louis chenevert abruptly retired as ceo in november analysts have been speculating on what direction hayes would take the company as he stepped up from cfo in this article im going to focus on three talking points from his recent presentation the future of its military and commercial helicopter segment sikorsky acquisition plans scale and nature change in strategic or operational direction the future of sikorsky  best known as being the manufacturer of black hawk helicopters  has long been a moot point with speculation rife that management would be willing to sell or spin off the business its not hard to see the logic behind a potential sale unlike the other two aerospace segments sikorsky has heavy exposure to military spending with  of its sales going to the us government alone in  the other two aerospacefocused segments pratt  whitney and utc aerospace systems have less exposure with  and  of sales going to the us government in  moreover sikorsky has the lowest operating profit margin of all its segments  suggesting management could sell it and use resources to focus on generating synergies within the overall companys commercial aerospace operations  source united technologies k filing with that said some investors might have been disappointed when hayes stated we are not going to sell sikorsky at the investor meeting in december however his emphasis seemed to change albeit subtly at the recent barclays conference he consistently referred to commercial aerospace and building as the companys core activities amid making it clear that he was reviewing the portfolio and seeing if there were pieces of the portfolio that didnt fit might sikorsky be sold after all acquisition plans hayes also spoke about his willingness to make an acquisition for more than  billion its a large amount but as he pointed out a company of united technologies size needs scale in order to efficiently use management resources and generate significant synergies from a deal he also outlined the intent of not doing something outside of its core commercial aerospace and buildings operations while highlighting the strengths of being in two separate industries for example the buildings operations generated the cash flow to enable pratt  whitney to invest in developing the geared turbofan engine therefore investors shouldnt be too hopeful of the company splitting into two separate parts aerospace and buildings within aerospace he pretty much ruled out an acquisition in avionics  an area of strength for its rival honeywell international nysehon  because the opportunity to generate cost synergies with united technologies in existing aerospace business wasnt obvious however hayes stated that he would look at companies with mechanically actuated systems one company long associated as a potential target is uk aerospace company meggitt lsemggt with a market cap of around  billion it has the scale to attract united technologies and it already manufactures parts for sikorsky military rotorcraft meggitt currently generates  of its revenue from civil aerospace and its aircraft braking systems  of firsthalf  revenue and control systems  of firsthalf revenue appear to be a good fit for united technologies moreover around  of meggitts military revenue already goes to the us increasing productivity indeed in a previous article on united technologies readers saw a breakout of its segmental return on assets or roa updated chart below which suggested that management could look to increase the roa generated with utc aerospace systems  source united technologies k filing furthermore a dupont analysis comparing united technologies with honeywell international shows how united technologies asset utilization fell after the acquisition of goodrich in  also honeywells aerospace segment roa is significantly higher than united technologies cutting out unnecessary costs for utc aerospace is obviously a focus in january management announced plans to eliminate utc propulsion  aerospace systems or pas pratt  whitney and utc aerospace used to operate under the pas structure hayes outlined that this move would help cut costs by  million to  million moreover he stressed the need to make the organization leaner  classic stuff from a former cfo where next for united technologies its possible that sikorsky could be soldsomething the market would welcome in my opinion potential upside could also come from the acquisition of a company like meggitt not least because united technologies could generate cost synergies from such a deal all told united technologies investors should prepare themselves for an active year in  and management
