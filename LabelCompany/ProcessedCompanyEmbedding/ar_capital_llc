about us careers support search costarcom login       headlines archivecostar advisor newslettermost viewed ar capital suspends capital raising putting  billion of properties in limbo fundraising to be cut off for trio of nontraded reits with about  million in pending acquisitions by mark heschmeyer november   email print alternative asset manager ar capital llc one of the largest sponsors of nontraded reits that has raised nearly  billion through more than a dozen such investment entities announced this week it was suspending capital raising at the end of this year on a handful of offerings the company said its ability to raise investor money had been negatively affected by regulatory and market uncertainty affecting capital raising for both new and existing offerings in the direct investment industry the decision follows a particularly tough week for ar capital on nov  apollo global management called off an agreement to acquire a controlling interest in a newly formed company that would have owned a majority of the ar capitals asset management business and then on nov  the enforcement section of the massachusetts securities division filed an administrative complaint against realty capital securities llc rcs an entity controlled by ar capital alleging that rcs had fabricated shareholder proxy votes related to the apollo deal the decision to stop creating new investment products and close existing ones to new investors will cut off fundraising for four arc reits currently in the offering stage and one business development fund three of the reits hold billions in property and debt and have more acquisitions pending the suspension of fundraising puts the investment programs and owned properties in limbo and could put the reits in default on pending deals the three reits expected to be primarily affected by the decision to stop fundraising are american realty capital hospitality trust with  billion in properties american realty capital global trust ii with  million in properties and american realty capital healthcare trust iii with  million in properties also expected to be impacted by the decision are american realty capital new york city reit ii and business development corporation of america ii although neither has yet to raise enough funds to break escrow and begin their investment programs in regulatory filings each of the entities involved said there is no assurance as to when or if their offerings would be resumed or that they would be able to obtain the additional capital they require from other sources in addition they said the failure to raise adequate capital and suspending their offerings could adversely impact the value of investments in their common stock american realty capital hospitality trust one the arc reits affected is arc hospitality trust which commenced its initial public offering of up to  million shares in january  it has raised more than  million under its offering scheduled to end jan   the reit has several potential acquisitions pending that are now thrown into doubt in june  it agreed to acquire  hotels from three different sellers for  million in the last few weeks it completed the first two closings from those agreements totaling  million it is scheduled to complete the remaining acquisitions in six separate closings during the fourth quarter of  and the first quarter of  through nov   it had made  million in deposits with respect to the closings that have not yet occurred funded with proceeds from its offering it also had entered into a term loan agreement for up to  million secured by mortgages on the hotels to be acquired our failure to obtain the funds required to complete the pending acquisitions through proceeds from this offering advances under the term loan agreement or from another source could cause us to default under the related agreements and as a result forfeit all or a part of the  million in aggregate deposits the reit disclosed in a regulatory filing arc hospitality trust previously acquired some other sizeable hotel portfolios in march  it acquired the barceló portfolio for  million the portfolio consists of the baltimore courtyard inner harbor hotel the courtyard providence downtown hotel and the homewood suites by hilton stratford as well as one leased asset the georgia tech hotel  conference center and equity interests in two joint ventures that separately own the westin virginia beach and the hilton garden inn blacksburg va in february  it acquired the grace portfolio for  billion the hotel portfolio was acquired from subsidiaries of goldman sachs whitehall real estate funds american realty capital global trust ii arc global trust ii commenced its initial public offering in august  raising nearly  million through september  it too has pending acquisitions that could cause it to be in default if the deals do not go through the reit acquired its largest property for  million last month an office building in reading uk known as the foster wheeler energy office property the squarefoot building is  masterleased to foster wheeler energy limited the lease expires in august  american realty capital healthcare trust iii arc healthcare trust iii commenced its initial public offering in august  as of nov  it had raised more than  million in gross proceeds the offering wasn’t scheduled to end until august  formed to acquire a diversified portfolio of healthcarerelated assets including medical office buildings seniors housing communities and other healthcarerelated facilities arc healthcare trust iii currently owns  properties its most recent acquisition was also its largest and closed on sept   when it acquired a medical office building in woodbury mn for  million the woodlake office center contains  rentable square feet and was  leased to summit orthopedics ltd reasons for the suspension ar capital cited regulatory and market uncertainty affecting capital raising for both new and existing offerings in the direct investment industry as the reason for suspending all fundraising activity however the move also follows two blows the company received last week on nov  apollo global management llc terminated its agreement to acquire a controlling interest in a newly formed company that would have owned a majority of the ar capitals asset management business then on nov  the enforcement section of the massachusetts securities division filed an administrative complaint against realty capital securities llc rcs an entity controlled by ar capital and sponsor of the reits impacted by the suspension the administrative complaint alleges that employees of rcs fabricated numerous shareholder proxy votes across multiple entities sponsored by ar capital but did not specifically refer to any actions taken in connection with any of the reit’s proxy solicitations following the complaint ar capital directed realty capital securities to discontinue all proxy activities on behalf of all ar capitalsponsored companies although it has suspended all fundraising for the time being ar capital said it will continue to manage its  billion of investment programs as
