known as “lump” or vein graphite this highend clean graphite with its low sulphur content is highly sought after for important industrial applications and worldwide supply is constrained since it is available in only a few locations worldwide including our aukam site in namibia the company anticipates revenue from our existing inventory of unprocessed graphite to commence in the third quarter of  based on a recent letter of intent to initially purchase  tonnes of graphite this sale of unprocessed graphite from our site will precede the company going into production of its highgrade processed lump graphite in  the stage was set for this onsite production when the company entered into a joint venture agreement in  with a seasoned mining partner committed to building and paying for a graphite processing circuit facility at aukam construction is scheduled to commence the first quarter  production of highgrade processed graphite could begin as early as the end of  the aukam graphite mine was established in  in the current republic of namibia and has produced usd  million of graphite at todays prices the aukam property is estimated to still contain a significant amount of highgrade vein type graphitic material in  third party research laboratories validated the high quality of our onsite samples and an outside geologist report stated there are “an estimated  million tonnes of reserve of highgrade graphite from hydrothermal source” at aukam the current market value of the processed vein graphite samples at aukam is approximately    per tonne the global graphite market was valued at  billion in  and it is expected to grow at a cagr of  during the period    graphite demand is being driven by the development of new markets for clean and efficient energy

distribution located  miles from the port of luderitz underground water available on site view aukam graphite deposit  technical report accessibility climate local resources infrastructure and physiography accessibility access to the property farm gate is via a  km graded gravel road d and d from the main tar road b highway this road is accessible to conventional cars from the farm gate to the foot of the range that hosts the deposit another km is accessible by fourwheel drive gravel track but essentially allweather the mine site workings are on a rugged slope and there is limited access by a bulldozed road access to the upper adits and open pit is by foot climate the aukam graphite deposit is located in an area of southern namibia with both summer and winter rainfall in the austral summer daytime temperatures peak in the mid ° celsius while in winter temperatures can go as low as freezing rainfall in winter is generally light drizzle with occasional harder falls and sometimes flurries in summer the rainfall is associated with occasional thunderstorms and is of short duration but can be of very high intensity all of the streams within the area are ephemeral and can flow very strongly after summer rainfall average annual rainfall is  mm infrastructure the infrastructure in the area is good with access to the site possible throughout the year the aukam graphite deposit is relatively close to a main tar road and well graded so the only construction required would be a ± km long access road to site there is a national power grid that passes  km from the property a link would likely be required water is available in large amounts from underground aquifers there is an old pump station at the foot of the mountain which was used previously to supply operations with water the nearest rail link is located next to the main highway some  km from site suitable areas for tailings dams and flotation plants are available dependent on eventual plant design the nearest town of aus is some  km away by road the area is very arid farmland  physiography the aukam graphite deposit lies at an elevation between m and m above sea level the surrounding area is up until m above sea level at the highest point the area is rugged with steep sided valleys and abrupt changes in local relief caused by differential erosion geological setting the aukam graphite deposit daylights in an erosional window incised through the hard layers of sedimentary rocks that mantle southern namibia the older hosting rocks known as the namaqualand complex are assemblage of gneisses marbles schists quartzites amphibolites with nested intrusive rocks including granite and gabbros this suite of rocks indicates that the entire complex was once deeply buried intrusive events of charnockites have been dated between  and  million years ago kroner and blignault  steep dipping shear zones are common and some are dated by joubert  around  million years ago a prominent flatlying and resistant sediment layer overlies the erosional unconformity at the top of the namaqualand complex the specific formation has yet to be confirmed however it is likely to be the lowest most member of the nama group dabis formation this figure shows the regional geological setting above the unconformity and identifies the dabis formation as the lowest most member above the namaqua complex hydrothermal alteration is common to some rocks in the window as is pegmatite veining both are evidence of hot water flowing through the rock the graphite occurs at one such site where overpressured hot waters evidently carrying carbon dioxide and maybe methane mineralized carbon into a zone of broken rock this hosting “shear zone” is exposed for  m reimer  identified the sheared host rock at aukam as proterozoic granite hydrothermally altered to kaolinite and speculated on a biogenic origin to the graphite however he also considers mueller’s  opinion that veins from an unspecified location in namibia sounding like aukam was an “inorganic derivation of the hydrocarbons” schneider and genis  have published a brief description of the graphite deposit “the zone comprises three parallel lodes veins lenses and pockets of ore several centimeters wide dip  to  degrees to the south the graphite which is of the fineflakey to lumpy type usually contains malachite specs while sulphur occurs along cracks the graphite veins are flanked by a palegreen highly epidotized and kaolinized granite which is soft and highly decomposed” the grayish rock and lineaments in the aukam shear zone are clearly visible in satellite imagery an inspection of the satellite data has yet to find a similar structure although there are multiple locations demonstrating alteration
