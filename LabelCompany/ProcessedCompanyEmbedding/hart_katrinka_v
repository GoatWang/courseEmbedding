which caused reliance to the detriment of the person relying upon it biberstine v new york blower co  ned  indctapp reh denied joint dismissal of transfer granted defendants contend harts did not sufficiently prove that paul reasonably relied upon the  original federal tax return in making his offer to purchase defendants point to pauls testimony in which he stated he could not remember the exact date on which he and rochon viewed the return at dell hendersons office however there was sufficient evidence from which the trier of fact could find that paul did in fact view the return before april   on crossexamination paul testified that he believed he reviewed the  tax return sometime between march  and march   although he could not remember the exact date paul testified that he believed this was so because on an intermediate offer made on march  he had removed his contingency of a satisfactory review of the financial books paul testified that he would only have removed the contingency after he had actually reviewed the  financial information thus the evidence  was sufficient to support a finding that paul had reviewed the  tax return before he made the april   offer ii defendants contend the trial court erred in ordering the contract rescinded fraud in the inducement of a contract is a basis for rescission indiana  michigan elec co v harlan  ned  indct app reh

benefits received and be returned to the status quo id if he elects to rescind the contract he may not recover general damages but is only entitled to be returned to the status quo which usually necessitates a return of money or other things received or paid under the contract plus reimbursement as special damages for any reasonable expenditures incurred as a proximate result of the fraudulent conduct id the rescinding party must also restore all benefits received under the contract id a plaintiff seeking to rescind a contract bears the burden of proving his right to rescission and that he is able to return in specie any property received under the contract or its reasonable value if a return in specie is impossible grissom v moran  indapp   ned   applications for rescission are addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court kruse kruse  miklosko v beedy  indapp   ned   a party appealing from the trial courts grant of rescission has the burden of showing that the trial courts decision was erroneous defendants argue that rescission was inappropriate in this case because the parties could not be returned to the status quo the parties contracted for the sale of the assets of steel products for  the price was composed as follows   cash paid to broker  assumption of existing accounts payable  assumption of existing obligations on equipment  note payable to scales   total as the contract was ordered rescinded harts were entitled to a return of their consideration actually paid the trial court awarded harts  this sum was made up of the  in accounts payables that harts had assumed and  in additional capital contributions  made by harts and  made by another investor paid into the business after harts had purchased it defendants argue the  in additional capital contributions cannot properly be characterized as consideration paid for the business because they are actually equity investments in the business however the fact that additional equity was invested in the business does not make those contributions not recoverable harts purchased the assets of steel products those assets included land buildings and equipment accounts receivable inventory goodwill etc out of the revenues generated by these assets hart steel had to pay its operating expenses as harts soon discovered after closing the deal however there was an insufficient revenue stream to cover the operating expenses this necessitated that harts pay hart steels creditors out of their own pockets the additional capital contributions had the effect of keeping the value of hart steels assets at a level that they would not have been but for the payments by harts as the contract was rescinded this increased value of the assets because harts paid company bills personally and not out of company revenues is being transferred back to steel products as such defendants should pay harts for the amount of their payments  because it is those payments which caused the assets to have a greater value than they otherwise would have had in a related argument defendants also contend there is no way of knowing whether the additional capital contributions are being held by hart steel as retained earnings which would not be transferred to steel products upon rescission of the contract see markham v prutsman mirror co  ned  indctapp where one corporation purchases the assets of another the buyer does not assume the debts and liabilities of the seller however even if the funds were held by hart steel as retained earnings there necessarily would be a corresponding increase in hart steels assets assets  liabilities  stockholders equity thus contrary to defendants contention the judgment ordering defendants to pay harts for their  equity investment does not result in a windfall to plaintiffs it merely restores the status quo in fact if the trial court did not order reimbursement of the equity investment it would be defendants who actually would be receiving a windfall because the assets returned to steel products would be inflated by the  that harts personally paid to the companys creditors defendants additionally argue the judgment is erroneous because it includes a return of the  in accounts payable assumed by harts and that harts had not in fact paid this entire amount defendants are correct upon rescission of the contract a party is entitled only to the return of the consideration actually paid grissom  indapp at   ned at  the evidence adduced at trial was that harts actually paid only  of the  they assumed in accounts payable we therefore must remand to the trial court to decrease the judgment by  defendants also argue rescission of the contract was inappropriate because they presented evidence that some of the equipment which made up the sale was no longer in existence however return of the actual property is not necessary horine v greencastle production credit assn  ned  indctapp upon seeking rescission of a contract a party must return the property received or the reasonable value thereof if return of the property is impossible grissom  indapp at   ned at  thus any property that defendants proved missing can be valued and credited against the consideration actually paid by harts at trial defendants introduced evidence that a trailer with a  gallon gas tank on it was stolen and that hart steel maintained no insurance on the trailer the result of harts failure to maintain insurance on the equipment is that the total assets of the company have been reduced by the fair market value of the trailer thus defendants are entitled to a credit against the judgment for the fair market value of the trailer defendants also argue they are entitled to a credit for a  ½ ton truck no longer owned by hart steel paul testified that the trucks engine seized up and it was then sold however the difference between this instance and the foregoing is that assets have not been reduced by the fair market value of the truck it is the truck itself which has a lesser fair market value hart steel received the fair market value of the ½ ton truck upon its sale defendants presented no evidence that the proceeds received from the sale were not deposited into the corporations accounts defendants are not entitled to a credit for the value of the ½ ton truck lastly defendants argue the trial court erred by not entering judgment against harts on the promissory note payable to scales and which was in default however as the contract was properly rescinded the parties are not entitled to any benefits received under the contract but are only entitled to a return of their consideration actually paid harlan  ned at  there was no error iii defendants contend the trial court erred in piercing steel products corporate veil and holding scales individually liable for return of the consideration paid a  corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from its shareholders and officers winkler v vg reed  sons inc  ned  ind as such corporate officers and shareholders acting on behalf of the corporation are generally not liable for the contractual obligations of the corporation id indiana courts are reluctant to disregard the corporate entity id however the corporate form will be disregarded to prevent fraud or unfairness to a third party id when a court exercises its equitable power to pierce the corporate veil it engages in a highly factsensitive inquiry hinds v mcnair  ind   ned   the burden is on the party seeking to pierce the corporate veil to prove that the corporate form was so ignored controlled or manipulated that it was merely an instrumentality of another and that the misuse of the corporate form would constitute a fraud or promote injustice aronson v price  ned  ind reh denied in determining whether a party has met this burden a court considers whether evidence has been presented showing  undercapitalization  absence of corporate records  fraudulent representations by corporate shareholders or directors  use of the corporation to promote fraud injustice or illegal activities  payment by the corporation of individual obligations  commingling of assets and affairs  failure to observe required corporate formalities or  other shareholder acts or conduct ignoring controlling or manipulating the corporate form id here the trial court found that rochon an agent of steel products committed fraud by misrepresenting to harts that steel products had income of  in  when he in fact knew that steel products actually incurred a loss of  had harts known the true financial position of steel products they would have paid substantially less for the companys assets rochons conduct alone is sufficient to disregard the corporate veil and hold scales as the sole shareholder and beneficiary of the asset sale personally liable for the return of the consideration in addition to the finding of fraud steel products was significantly undercapitalized the  financial statements which were presented to harts showed that steel products had stockholders equity of  however the information on the  amended federal tax return which was withheld from harts showed that steel products actually had negative stockholders equity of  recognition of the corporate entity by indiana courts has been conditioned on the requirement that the corporation be established on an adequate financial basis state v mckinney  ned  indct app reh denied trans denied the evidence introduced at trial showed that steel products was continuously undercapitalized from its inception up throughout the sale to harts in  steel products had negative stockholders equity of  in  steel products had stockholders equity of  in  steel products had negative stockholders equity of  to permit scales to hide behind the corporate form would allow her to retain an amount of consideration paid based not upon the fair value of the steel products assets but upon fraudulently misstated figures such a result would work a manifest injustice there was no error in piercing steel products corporate veil iv harts contend the trial court erred in failing to award punitive damages punitive damages are appropriate only where it is proved by clear and convincing evidence that a party acted with malice fraud gross negligence or oppressiveness which was not the result of a mistake of fact or law honest error of judgment overzealousness mere negligence or other human failing budget car sales v stott  ned  ind when reviewing the denial of an award of punitive damages we do not reweigh the evidence or judge the credibility of the witnesses watson v thibodeau  ned  indctapp rather we consider whether a reasonable trier of fact considering only the probative evidence and reasonable inferences drawn therefrom which support the judgment could find such damages proved by clear and convincing evidence id upon a finding of civil fraud it is within the discretion of the factfinder to  award punitive damages finney v relphorde  ned  indctapp an award of punitive damages is not mandatory upon a finding of civil fraud id the purpose of punitive damages is to punish the wrongdoer and thereby deter others from engaging in similar conduct bright v kuehl  ned  indctapp reh denied trans denied the public interest must be served by the imposition of punitive damages breeck v city of madison  ned  indctapp trans denied where the factfinder fails to make an award of punitive damages that decision is subject to review only upon a clear showing of abuse of discretion continental casualty co v novy  ned  indct app here although the finding of fraud could support an award of punitive damages there are no findings concerning the relevant factors of whether an award of punitive damages would deter others from engaging in similar conduct or whether such an award would serve the public interest generally when the trial courts findings of fact do not cover all the issues remand is appropriate for the entry of specific findings on the omitted issues however in this case the trial court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law upon its own motion when a trial court does so the specific findings will control as to only those issues which they cover and a general judgment will control as to the issues upon which the court has not expressly found in re marriage of loeb  ned  indctapp applying this standard of review we must presume that the trial court considered the relevant factors surrounding an award of punitive damages and found that the weight of the evidence did not support an award of such damages the trial court did not abuse its discretion in failing to award punitive damages affirmed in part reversed and remanded in part darden and hoffman jj concur notes  at trial harts introduced an exhibit listing the monies they sought returned the exhibit included  paid to scales on the  note linda hart testified that all payments to scales on the note were made out of the assets of the business however the debt to scales was not a debt of the business but a debt of harts in reality the payments to scales out of the business assets were in substance either a dividend or a capital distribution by the company to harts who then in turn paid scales as such the trial court correctly excluded this amount as a part of the consideration paid
