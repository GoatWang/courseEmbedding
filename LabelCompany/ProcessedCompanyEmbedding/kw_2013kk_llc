provider action needed the centers for medicare  medicaid services cms issued change request cr  to limit the use of modifiers kk kg ku and kw on dmepos claims billed under the competitive bidding program to only those uses allowed by current policy this will reduce the number of overpayments made as a result of improper use by suppliers make sure your billing staffs are aware of these changes background congress mandated the dmepos competitive bidding program through the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of  mma the statute requires that medicare replace the current fee schedule payment methodology for selected dmepos items with a competitive bid process the intent is to improve the effectiveness of the medicare methodology for setting dmepos payment amounts which will reduce beneficiary outofpocket expenses and save the medicare program money while ensuring beneficiary access to quality items and services under the program a competition among suppliers who operate in a particular competitive bidding area is conducted suppliers are required to submit a bid for selected products not all products or items are subject to competitive bidding bids are submitted electronically through a webbased application process and required documents are mailed bids are evaluated based on the suppliers eligibility its financial stability and the bid price contracts are awarded to the medicare suppliers who offer the best price and meet applicable quality and financial standards contract suppliers must agree to accept assignment on all claims for bid items and will be paid the bid price amount the amount is derived from the median of all winning bids for an item the competitive bidding modifiers were created to identify a healthcare common procedure coding system hcpcs supply or accessory code that is considered both a competitive bid item and a noncompetitive bid item in the same competitive bidding area cba competitive bid items are
