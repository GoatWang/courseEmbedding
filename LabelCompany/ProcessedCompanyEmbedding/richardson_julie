tasty cake i purchased this cookbook about one month ago and was able to try one of her delicious recipes i made the ozark pudding cake and my guests had it eaten in about  minutes i substituted appleswalnuts for the pearsalmonds and followed the easy recipe im planning on making the pink cake recipe next ive been baking for many years and this cookbook brought back some memories of cakes from my childhood you wont be sorry if you buy this lovely book thank you julie your book is a true labor of love  gorgeous and practical baking book i am more of a savory than a sweet cook but i was completely taken by this beautiful and useful book of vintage cakes the author has a great tone and the recipes are well written and seem easy to follow i think this will make an excellent gift for my baking friendsas well as have a new permanent home on my cook book shelf  i love this book ive always struggled with cakes always last night i made the kentucky bourbon cake from this wonderful cookbook and it worked next up is the texas sheet cake because i love chocolate and need something thats simple and fast to cut up and store in the freezer for lunch right on qvc i love this book  nofail best of delicious vintage baking i ordered  of these books  as gifts cus like richardsons recipes they are nofail because i have used her rustic fruit desserts book over the past couple of years and her easy to follow recipes and delicious results always make me look and feel like a baking rockstar i love that this book includes gotos like the classic cake which i expect to use often as well as new ideas like the unique lemon cup cake i predict well be seeing a lot of that one on pinterest baking boardsbut davids hilarious happy dance said it all plus she was so nice on his show and knowing that normal home bakers tested her recipes makes me feel confident to take on a few thing normally outside of my repetoire my husbands th is coming up and i think the kentucky bourbon cake will have to make an appearance  no what i had hope just got this book on yesterday and will be returning not at all what i had hope for maybe this is too vintage for me sorry   of  your browser does
