outsourced product design the effectiveness of alternative integration mechanisms anderson edward g jr and davisblake alison and parker geoffrey g  managing outsourced product design the effectiveness of alternative integration mechanisms industry studies working paperkbabstractmany firms have moved from outsourcing only manufacturing and staff support activities eg janitorial services to outsourcing more complex and central activities such as product and process development outsourcing these more complex nuanced and timesensitive activities increases the difficulties of coordinating with suppliers we examine the frequency with which firms use various interorganizational integration mechanisms and project coordination tools to coordinate outsourced product development we further examine the impact of these mechanisms and tools on project performance we report descriptive and some preliminary regression statistics from the first three years of a fouryear multifirm multiindustry research project these preliminary results suggest that nearly all firms employ personnel dedicated to managing the outsourcing relationship however firms also use other integration modalities concomitantly specifically firms initially rely on ad hoc facetoface communication rather than colocation to manage the interface with outsourcing partners however over time firms move to colocation to manage relationships with nondomestic suppliers surprisingly firms make relatively little use of either sophisticated information technology or modular product designs we find that the effects of a single integration mechanism or tool can vary dramatically across different outcomes for example colocating employees appears to improve product quality but are associated with poor schedule peformance given the frequency with which firms employ dedicated individuals to manage the interface we also present some preliminary evidence on the skills and training of these individuals this evidence suggests that  they have received little formal training in key skills and that firms rely solely on experiential learning to train these individuals and  for the training they have received whether they received it from their university training or from companysponsored initiatives may have differential effects on project outcomesindustry studies series item typeindustry studies

views may     alison davisblake the dean of the university of michigan’s ross school of business today may  said she plans to step down from the job once her first fiveyear term ends on june   “after much consideration and consultation with my closest advisers friends and family i have decided that i want to turn the focus of my professional service to the broader problems and opportunities facing universities” she said in a memo to the ross community her fouryear tenure as dean has been somewhat controversial especially among the school’s old guard faculty since her arrival in  several of michigan’s academic stars left the school including karl e weick a world renown organizational behavior expert and claes fornell one of the most influential academics in customer satisfaction measurement and robert kennedy who had been executive director of the school’s william davidson institute a leader in research into emerging market economies it’s unclear whether her decision not to seek a second term was at least partially motivated by faculty complaints to the university administration about her leadership style since the start of her term in  the top two leaders of the university–president mary sue coleman and provost phil hanlon who hired davisblake–have since left their jobs acceptance rates to ross’ fulltime mba program hit a record high under the dean during her stint as dean ross’ fulltime mba program has had something of a roller coaster ride the school’s ranking has improved to th among the best us mba programs in poetsquants’ composite list from th when she arrived at ross but in  the school’s acceptance rate for its fulltime program hit a record high —well above any other prestige public university business school the spike was caused when the school shut down its cosigner loan program for international students ross admitted more candidates to offset the expected decline in offers from admits who decided not to go to michigan because of the loan issue while ross has since brought its acceptance rate down to  last year it is still higher—if not substantially higher—than berkeley ucla virginia texas and indiana university even though michigan has reduced the size of its class to  last year from  in  ross was the only us school in the top  that failed to provide acceptance data to us news  world report for its latest annual ranking published in january applications to its mba program last year fell to  from  a year earlier an mba in last year’s graduating class told poetsquants that today’s news is “bittersweet” “she did get a lot of money and helped cut down the class size but she was never very engaged with the students” the alum said “i never saw her come down from her office to shake a hand in the winter garden and ask how the classes were going her involvement with the section leaders was minimal and mostly patronizing” ‘eager to contribute solutions to the university’s larger challenges’ she took over the deanship of ross at a difficult time the school was in the red largely a result of the then still lingering impact of the great recession which forced two of the big three us automakers in detroit into bankruptcy the economic mess particularly wrecked havoc with ross’ executive education business which insiders say saw revenues plunge from roughly  million annually to close to a low of  million because ross’ exec ed profits go entirely to the school the collapse of those offerings plunged the entire institution into a deficit in her memo davisblake said her team has restored the school to a “healthy financial position” after a  increase in executive education revenue and a return to the school of nearly  million this year davisblake noted that the  academic year would mark her tenth year as a business school dean at both ross and the university of minnesota’s carlson school of management “during the past decade i have learned that i particularly enjoy working with faculty staff and students to stabilize challenging situations and then create momentum towards extraordinary positive performance” she said “together we have created that momentum at the ross school beyond the business school realm there are significant challenges that face all universities in both professional and liberal education i find myself eager to contribute solutions to these larger challenges during what will surely be a time of significant change in higher education” the dean said she was letting the ross community know about her decision a full year earlier “to facilitate an orderly dean transition that will allow the ross school to maintain its positive momentum i have discussed my decision with provost martha pollack who will convene a search committee to select the next dean i am confident that with your help and support provost pollack and president mark schlissel will be able to conduct a very successful search” page  of » tagged alison davisblake michigan ross school
