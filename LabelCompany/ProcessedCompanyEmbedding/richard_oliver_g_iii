email address got it got it by martha m hamilton by martha m hamilton may   rubin was talking about how to make markets transparent and about russia it was a little bit over my head said oliver g richard iii describing with awe a recent lunch with treasury secretary robert e rubin and executives of exxon cargill and texas instruments and then i realized  he was talking about our program in toledo richard went on to say that when natural gas competition came to the ohio town where columbia energy group owns the gas utility there was no way for consumers to do comparison shopping until the local newspaper began publishing power rates that was the beginning of price transparency for smaller customers said richard chairman of columbia energy group for richard almost everything comes back to the issue that has consumed most of his professional life  creating competition in the markets for natural gas and electricity richard is engaged now in a battle that may determine whether columbia survives that competition or is acquired as consolidation continues in the  billion utility industry last month columbia made an unsolicited takeover bid for consolidated natural gas of pittsburgh which had agreed to be acquired by dominion resources inc of richmond richard is an exuberant chief executive at  he is boyish in appearance enthusiasm and style he connects with people easily  within minutes of a photographers arrival the two are talking about cameras richard was a photographer for the newspaper at louisiana state university loudoun county landmarks football and baseball his monthly column in the companys employee magazine is called ram ram bullagator after an oklahoma high school cheer that his mother taught him i am a cheerleader for columbia he said and on a shelf in his office is this message a good scout always leaves his campsite in better shape than he found it but richards demeanor should not be mistaken for naivete said j bennett johnston a member of columbias board of directors and richards mentor theres not a naive bone in his body its almost an aw shucks  its a winning quality actually johnston said its not naivete its an openness that is unusual for a person of that status johnston was a powerful democratic senator from louisiana when he hired richard from law school in  on the recommendation of an old friend who described the graduate as the best and the brightest rick shone immediately johnston remembered richard worked on energy issues as johnstons legislative assistant then in  he was named a member of the federal energy regulatory commission which oversees gas and electric utilities at  he was the youngest commission member ever richard was the driving force at ferc in changing a rule that essentially required customers to buy gas from the company that controlled the pipeline that delivered it  helping to change the role of pipelines to that of common carriers delivering a product available from competing suppliers said david cook former general counsel of ferc that was the thing that started to open up markets from there richard went on to work as vice president of a gas trading subsidiary for tenneco inc as chief executive of a major pipeline subsidiary of enron and as chairman and chief executive of new jersey resources corp richard took over the columbia gas system inc as it was known then in april  as the company was preparing to emerge from bankruptcy it had filed for protection from its creditors in  when it found itself locked into longterm contracts to pay higher prices for gas than it earned by reselling it formerly with headquarters in wilmington del the company moved to reston in  and has built a headquarters in herndon that richard helped design columbia transports most of the natural gas used in the washington area through its pipelines and explores for and produces natural gas and sells it to homes and businesses through its utility companies in maryland virginia kentucky ohio and pennsylvania richard has had a phenomenal run in terms of restoring columbia to financial health and improving its stock price performance said curt n launer an analyst with donaldson lufkin  jenrette securities corp launer noted that richard has moved to greater and greater levels of experience with larger and larger companies at each step of his career each step on the way has prepared him to be very successful in a combined columbiacng if there is going to be one thats not to say there havent been missteps in its fourth quarter last year columbia lost  million when one of the companys commodity traders misstated prices on some natural gas futures contracts the trader was fired and the company adopted more stringent auditing processes as a result and columbias joint venture with a unit of american airlines sabre group inc which operates americans sophisticated computer reservations system to design a system on which customers could shop for natural gas has been put on hold we were a little ahead of our time richard said richard grew up around the energy industry in lake charles la his father worked in plastics research and later in the polyethylene lab at the cities service refinery there and his fatherinlaw was a member of the oil chemical  atomic workers union in addition his uncle was an executive vice president of conoco who was involved in building refineries and in marketing his mother was a school health nurse his whole career has been about the movement from regulation to deregulation and he understands it to his fingertips said daniel yergin head of cambridge energy research associates and the author of the prize a history of the oil industry there are few other utility executives who have had the breadth of experience that he has yergin said he really brings a very broad historical framework to thinking not only about the utility business but about the world hes very definitely an innovator    he wants to be on the front end of the curve now is a heady time to be in the energy business with an added frisson for executives who dont know whether they will survive the shakeout in the once highly regulated monopoly utility business some analysts have said they view its bid for cng as an attempt by columbia to avoid becoming a takeover target itself richard said he thinks columbia and cng are a good fit our cultures are so close he said we have people around the system who live on the same streets the other benefit  for investors  of the proposed merger is that because the two companies are similar they could save money immediately by eliminating duplicative functions richard said that would allow the new company to take the cash and reinvest richard said that as a boy he played with toy dinosaurs gesturing with his hands as if moving pretend reptiles around he said the smaller dinosaurs sometimes got their licks in against the bigger ones even in the dance of the dinosaurs some are a little

    columbia gas system used to be known as an ossified giant of the regulated natural gas giant industry known primarily for its gas pipelines moving gas from the gulf of mexico into the midwest as well as regulated distribution subsidiaries in ohio pennsylvania maryland and virginia the company once suffered from bad management high takeorpay claims from producers irate customers who sued the company for fraud and abuse and a chapter  bankruptcy filing in the wake of natural gas deregulation     but investors who pulled up stakes when times got tough may live to regret it the company is now moving into the forefront of the energy marketin both natural gas and electricitythanks to a ceo who has completely restructured the corporation columbia energy group set a record net income in  of  million or  per share up  million from the previous year since  columbias stock has gone from low  to mid  range all thanks to the companys massive restructuring     oliver g rick richard iii took the reins of the battered giant in  brought fresh faces to senior management including the first woman to head a major natural gas pipeline company moved the companys headquarters from wilmington delaware to the washington dc suburb of herndon and firmly placed the company on a competitive track richard is well known in the natural gas community having been the youngest commissioner ever appointed to the federal energy regulatory commission as well as serving in senior management positions at tenngasco enrons northern natural gas company and new jersey resources corp     the results of the shakeup have paid off thanks to richard the company has now moved out of bankruptcy and into the hightech competitive arena the company recently announced plans to build three new power plants totaling  megawatts in northeast north america with canada as one possible site the proposal is a  joint venture with westcoast energy inc of vancouver british columbia and will no doubt take advantage of columbias massive natural gas pipeline and storage system now undergoing a massive seven percent expansion to meet increased marker demand with westcoasts experienced constructing and operating gasfired power plants to compete in one of the most competitive emerging electric markets in north america     the power generation deal followed on the heels of another announcement in early january that columbia gas system had changed its name to columbia energy group if this were just a name change we could have issued a press release said richard although not the result of a merger or acquisition the new moniker does reflect the fundamental changes that he has brought to the company     columbia energy group is ready for change said richard indeed we intend to accelerate change in the retail marketplace because those that adapt survive those that dont dont insider trading history of richard oliver g iii at buckeye partners l p insider monitor realtime insider buys
