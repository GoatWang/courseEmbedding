to £ million  per cent on actual exchange rate basis and net cash remittances of £ million were up  per cent   our life business strategy is centred on asias rapidly growing life insurance markets with a focus on regular premium protection orientated policies distributed primarily through high quality agency and bank partners we have over  million customers across the region one of the largest and most productive agency sales forces a wellestablished bancassurance franchise and leadership positions in  out of  markets despite our strong progress over the last decade insurance penetration in the markets in which we operate remains low and the demand for savings health and protection products from a growing middle class continues to be high our scale and scope in the region combined with proven operational expertise enables us to execute on strategic growth opportunities invest in building the business through the economic cycle and remain flexible to resist market pressure for products we consider to be less attractive this approach will from time to time lead to fluctuations in ape sales at a country level but allows us to conserve value without compromising the overall regional delivery   in  new business ape sales increased by  per cent driven by  per cent growth in regular premium new business which contributes  per cent of our ape sales offsetting the  per cent reduction in single premiums which are more susceptible to softer economic conditions our sales performance continues to benefit from our broadbased multichannel distribution platform new product launches and continued actions to improve both distribution scale and productivity agency ape sales were  per cent higher across the region reflecting continued investment in agency manpower and an improvement in average agent productivity of  per cent our core bank partnerships continue to make good progress led by standard chartered bank where ape sales rose by  per cent new business profit was up  per cent at £ million and outpaced the ape sales growth of  per cent   in hong kong ape sales grew  per cent driven by increases in agency headcount and productivity and also from our successful inroads into hong kongs broker network during  we have also seen acceleration in demand from mainland chinabased customers with around  per cent of this business having an annual premium below us we remain well placed to satisfy the growing demand for savings and protection products from both domestic and mainland chinese customers   our joint venture with citic in china continues to perform well with ape sales growth of  per cent and operations now in  cities the second half of the year was marked by significantly higher levels of volatility in investment markets which impacted single premium business through the bancassurance channel however regular premium sales remain strong with growth of  per cent in the fourth quarter and  per cent for the year furthermore sales of health and protection business nearly doubled during the year contributing over  per cent of our ape sales in china we are well prepared for the implementation in  of chinas risk oriented solvency system cross and we do not expect this to cause any issues for our business   in singapore we continue to lead the market for regular premium products with a market share of  per cent and the largest agency force in the industry during  we have focused on growing regular premium agencysourced protection sales which has enhanced the mix of business and contributed to a  per cent increase in new business profit through this channel reflecting our proactive deemphasis of universal life sales and the effect of cessation of distribution relationships with maybank and singpost total ape sales were  per cent lower in    indonesia continues to generate material levels of new business value for our asia business and the recurring regular premium nature of our inforce portfolio has driven a  per cent increase in ifrs operating profit our sales performance reflects both softer market conditions and the impact of deliberate proactive actions to further improve the quality of our distribution while this might affect shorterterm sales progression it conserves value and positions us well to capitalise on the eventual upturn market conditions for new business sales remain challenging with suppressed consumer sentiment making it harder to close sales reflected in ape sales  per cent lower at £ million however average agency case sizes increased by  per cent in  we remain confident about our longterm prospects in indonesia given the low insurance penetration levels and we are continuing to invest in building our agency force nationwide   in malaysia we have seen continued success from our strategy to increase our penetration of the bumi sector where we are the largest provider with a  per cent share of the takaful market in addition to growing the agency force by  per cent we have also increased our activity in bancassurance with ape sales from this channel up  per cent overall ape sales increased by  per cent in the year   all of our other markets have delivered good quality growth in the philippines we have continued to focus on the agency channel with increased manpower and higher average case sizes driving ape sales growth of  per cent in this channel overall ape sales were up  per cent reflecting our decision of being selective in how we participate in bancassurance thailands ape sales were up  per cent driven by strong growth from our main bancassurance partners united overseas bank and thanachart vietnam had an excellent year with ape sales growing  per cent on higher levels of agency activity our green field operations in cambodia continue to move ahead well with ape sales up  per cent  while our larger more established markets are progressing well our ability to execute across the spectrum covering markets at different stages of development is key to driving longterm profitable growth in the region   our joint venture with icici bank in india remains the leader in the private sector with a market share of  per cent and ape sales growth of  per cent in taiwan and korea we remain selective in our participation and as a result we are content to tolerate fluctuations in new business volumes both businesses have generated a higher level of ifrs operating profit   despite significant volatility in capital markets eastspring investments our asia asset management business delivered strong results in  with record thirdparty net inflows of £ billion up  per cent on  the businesses benefited from robust inflows into equity funds including asian equity funds in japan good investment performance in korea and india driving excellent domestic flows and healthy net inflows into bond funds from our joint ventures in china and india total funds under management at  december  were a record £ billion up  per

positions to be able to deliver longterm profitable growth   us our us business delivered a strong performance in  with total ifrs operating profit of £ million up  per cent  per cent on an actual exchange rate basis jacksons life ifrs operating profit grew  per cent  per cent on an actual exchange rate basis to £ million driven by increased fee income from higher levels of separate account

continue to take a disciplined approach to capital management and have implemented a number of measures over the last few years to enable us to make our capital work more efficiently for the group our solvency ii outcome following approval by the prudential regulation authority of our internal model in december  underscores the strength and resilience of the groups capital position at  december  group solvency ii capital surplus was estimated at £ billion which is equivalent to a group solvency ii capital ratio of  per cent   based on the insurance groups directive solvency measure our surplus position at  december  was estimated at £ billion  december  £ billion equivalent to a cover of  times   in july  prudential plc was listed by the financial stability board as one of nine companies to be designated as a global systemically important insurer a classification that was reaffirmed in november  prudential is monitoring the development and potential impact of the related framework of policy measures and is engaging closely with the prudential regulation authority on the implications of this designation   dividend   the board has decided to increase the fullyear ordinary dividend by  per cent to  pence per share reflecting the continued strong financial performance of the group in  in line with this the directors have approved a second interim ordinary dividend of  pence per share  final dividend of  pence which brings the total ordinary dividend for the year to  pence   pence in addition the board has decided to award a special dividend of  pence per share reflecting the additional contribution to earnings from the specific management actions taken to position the balance sheet more efficiently under the new solvency ii regime   although the board has been able to approve a special dividend of  pence per share in  the groups dividend policy remains unchanged the board will maintain its focus on delivering a growing ordinary dividend which will continue to be determined after taking into account the groups financial flexibility and our assessment of opportunities to generate attractive returns by investing in specific areas of the business the board believes that in the medium term a dividend cover of around two times is appropriate   outlook   the strength of our  results demonstrates the successful execution of our strategy and our distinctive ability to deliver profitable growth across the cycle asia remains at the heart of the group and our progress this year is underlined by the strong growth that we have delivered across sales earnings and cash from the region this has been well complemented by our disciplined progress in our more mature markets of the us and the uk   the current significant macroeconomic uncertainty and market instability is resulting in a more unpredictable nearterm outlook for global growth prospects while this creates a headwind for our feebased businesses our progress continues to remain underpinned by the structural demand for regular premium savings and protection products in asia through proactive management of our product mix and balance sheet and the growing scale of stable recurring income from our inforce portfolio the group has the flexibility and resilience to adapt to changes in the market and deliver robust earnings and shareholder value   the groups strategy remains centred on the longterm opportunity of servicing an increasingly selfreliant middle class through the provision of savings globally and health and protection in asia we have premium franchises in our chosen markets of asia the us and the uk with significant structural competitive advantages to deliver effectively conservative products to protect our consumers health and wealth and provide absolute and good relative returns to our shareholders   in asia the growing savings and protection needs of a rapidly emerging and increasingly wealthy population underpin our longterm structural growth prospects in the region the high quality recurring nature of our income and the scale and diversity of our panregional platform position us well to smooth out the inevitable country level fluctuations to deliver value across the cycle   in the us our business is focused on the provision of products for the savings and income needs of the baby boomers entering retirement while the proposed department of labor regulations are likely to reduce the access to valuable retirement products and services to the american middle class our competitive advantages of superior product performance low costs and strong commercialisation skills align the business well to meet these growing needs in the new landscape we are in the advanced stages of executing our contingency plans which are designed to underpin our future prospects for both earnings and cash   in the uk our life business is proving adept at navigating the significant changes brought about by pension reforms and is successfully extending its product offering to meet evolving consumer needs in asset management mg is currently experiencing headwinds but benefits from its scale and the diversity of its asset base our wellregarded brands investment performance track record and strong market positioning are key attributes that support our execution in this market   we remain well capitalised with a

highlighting the advantages of increased scale as we build our business while maintaining control of costs   in the second half of  and ahead of securing solvency ii internal model approval a number of specific management actions were taken by our uk life business to position the balance sheet more efficiently under the new regime these actions included extending the reinsurance of longevity risk to cover £ billion of annuity liabilities by the end of  end programme covered £ billion of liabilities it also included repositioning of the fixed income asset portfolio increasing to  per cent the

compared to just  per cent only  years ago   in the us life ifrs operating profit increased by  per cent to £ million primarily as a result of an  per cent increase in fee income which is now jacksons

valued in all cases jackson designs its hedge programme to protect the economics of the business from large movements in investment markets and therefore accepts variability in the accounting results the negative shortterm fluctuations of £ million in  were primarily attributable to the net value movement in the year of the hedge instruments held to manage market exposures   negative shortterm

rates during the year   ifrs effective tax rates in  the effective tax rate on ifrs operating profit based on longerterm investment returns was  per cent   per cent the reduction is due to lower

our new business investment  per cent higher at £ million lower than the  per cent increase in ape sales reflecting changes to product mix in the us new business investment increased to £ million

driven by  operating experience of £ billion generated by inforce business and new business written in  and included £ billion of benefit from the specific management actions taken in the second half of the year to position the balance sheet more efficiently under the new solvency ii regime  nonoperating experience of £ billion mainly arising from negative market experience during the year and  other capital movements comprising an increase in capital from subordinated debt issuance positive foreign currency translation effects offset by a reduction in surplus from payment of the  final and  first interim dividend   the methodology and calibration changes arose as part of the internal model approval process and related to  a £ billion reduction in surplus due to an increase in the solvency capital requirement from strengthening of internal model calibrations mainly relating to longevity risk operational risk credit risk and correlations and a corresponding increase in the risk margin which is partially offset by uk transitionals and  a £ billion reduction in surplus due to the negative impact of solvency ii rules for contract boundaries and a reduction in the capital surplus of the groups asian life operations as agreed with the prudential regulation authority   solvency ii as a measure of regulatory capital is more volatile than under the previous solvency i regime at  december  the estimated sensitivity of the group solvency ii capital surplus to significant changes in market conditions is as set out below  an instantaneous  per cent fall in equity markets would reduce surplus by £ billion and reduce the solvency ratio to  per cent  a  per cent fall in equity markets comprising an instantaneous  per cent fall followed by a further  per cent fall

the group aims to help customers achieve their long term financial goals by providing and promoting a range of products and services that meet customer needs are easy to understand and deliver real value we recognise that we are implicitly committing to customers that we will maintain a healthy company and are there to meet our long term commitments to them   from the shareholders perspective we generate value by selectively taking exposures to risks that are adequately rewarded and that can be appropriately quantified and managed the groups approach is to retain risks where doing so contributes to value creation the group is able to withstand the impact of an adverse outcome and has the necessary capabilities expertise processes and controls to manage appropriately the risk   in my report i seek to explain the main risks inherent in our business and how we manage those risks with the aim of ensuring we maintain an appropriate risk profile   principles and objective prudential defines risk as the uncertainty that prudential faces in successfully implementing its strategies and objectives this includes all internal or external events acts or omissions that have the potential to threaten the success and survival of prudential as such material risks will be retained only where this is consistent with the groups risk appetite framework and its philosophy towards risktaking   risk governance the organisational structures reporting relationships delegation of authority and roles and responsibilities that group head office and the business units establish to make decisions and control their activities on risk related matters form the foundation of prudentials risk governance effective risk governance encompasses individuals groupwide functions and committees involved in the management of risk   risk framework the groups risk framework has been developed to monitor and manage the risk of the business at all levels and is owned by the board the aggregate group exposure to market credit insurance liquidity and operational risks is monitored and managed by the group risk function whose responsibility it is to seek to ensure the maintenance of an adequate risk exposure and solvency position from the group economic regulatory and ratings perspectives   our group risk framework requires that all our businesses and functions establish processes for identifying evaluating and managing the key risks faced by the group and is based on the concept of the three lines of defence these comprise risk taking and management risk control and oversight and independent assurance   the key risks inherent in the insurance and capital management operations of prudentials business   risks from our investments risks from our products risks from our business operations   uncertainty around investment returns can arise through credit risk via the potential of defaults and market risks resulting from the volatility of asset values as a result of fluctuations in equity prices interest rates foreign exchange and property prices liquidity risk is also a key area of focus regular stress testing is undertaken to ensure the group is able to generate sufficient cash resources to meet financial obligations as they fall due in business as usual and in stress scenarios insurance risk the processes of determining the price of our products and reporting the results of our longterm business operations require us to make a number of assumptions   in common with other life insurers  the profitability of our businesses depends on a mix of factors including mortality and morbidity levels and trends persistency and claim inflation operational risk as a group we are dependent on the successful processing of a large number of transactions utilising various it systems and platforms across numerous and diverse products we also operate under the everevolving requirements set out by different regulatory and legal regimes including tax as well as utilising a significant number of third parties to distribute products and to support business operations all of which add to the complexity of the operating model if not properly managed   risk mitigation and

inadequate senior management processes for the development and implementation of business strategy in relation to the business environment and the groups capabilities   the drivers of each of the key risks vary by business unit and depend primarily on the value of locally held products    market risk investment risk   in prudential uk investment risk arising out of the assets in the withprofits fund impacts the shareholders interest in future transfers and is driven predominantly by equities in the fund as well as by other investments such as property and bonds the value of the future transfers is partially protected against equity falls by hedging conducted outside of the fund the funds large inherited estate  estimated at £ billion as at  december  on a solvency ii basis  can absorb market fluctuations and protect the funds solvency the inherited estate is partially protected against falls in equity markets through an active hedging programme within the fund   in asia our shareholder exposure to equities arises from unitlinked products where revenue is linked to funds under management and on its withprofits businesses where bonuses declared are broadly based on historical and current rates of return on equity   in jackson investment risk arises in relation to the assets backing the policies in the case of spread business including fixed annuities these assets are generally bonds and our shareholder exposure comes from the minimum asset return required to be generated to meet the guaranteed rates of return offered to policyholders for the variable annuity business these assets include equities as well as other assets such as bonds in this case the impact on the shareholder comes from the guarantees on return on investments embedded in variable annuity products shareholders exposure to these guarantees is mitigated through a hedging programme as well as reinsurance further measures have been undertaken including repricing initiatives and the introduction of variable annuities without guarantees furthermore it is our philosophy not to compete on price rather we seek to sell at a price sufficient to fund the cost incurred to hedge or reinsure the risks and to achieve an acceptable return   jackson hedges the guarantees on its variable annuity book on an economic basis and thus accepts variability in its accounting results in the short term in order to achieve the appropriate economic result in particular under prudentials group ifrs reporting the measurement of the jackson variable annuity guarantees is typically less sensitive to market movements than the corresponding hedging derivatives which are held at market value however depending on the level of hedging conducted regarding a particular risk type certain market movements can drive volatility in the economic result which may be either more or less significant under ifrs reporting the jackson ifrs shareholders equity and us statutory capital are also sensitive to the effects of policyholder behaviour on the valuation of guarantees   interest rate risk   longterm rates remain close to historic lows products that we offer are sensitive to movements in interest rates we have already taken a number of actions to derisk the inforce business as well as reprice and restructure new business offerings in response to historically low interest rates however this remains an area of sensitivity and persistently low rates may impact policyholders savings patterns and behaviour   interest rate risk arises in our uk business from the need to match cash flows for annuity payments with those from investments movements in interest rates may have an impact on profits where durations are not perfectly matched as a result we aim to match the duration of assets and liabilities as closely as possible and the position is monitored regularly under the european unions solvency ii directive additional interest rate exposure is created due to the nature of the construction of this balance sheet such as the inclusion of the risk margin the uk business continually assesses the need for any derivative overlays in managing this sensitivity the withprofits business is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of underlying guarantees such risk is largely borne by the withprofits fund but shareholder support may be required in extremis   in asia exposure to interest rate risk arises from the guarantees of some nonunitlinked investment products this exposure arises because it may not be possible to hold assets which will provide cash flows to match exactly those relating to policyholder liabilities while this residual assetliability mismatch risk can be managed it cannot be eliminated   jackson is exposed to interest rate risk in its fixed fixed index and variable annuity books movements in interest rates can influence the cost of guarantees in such products in particular the cost of guarantees may increase when interest rates fall   interest rate risk across the entire business is managed through the use of interest rate swaps interest rate options and hybrid options options protecting against simultaneous decreases in equity values and interest rates   foreign exchange risk   we principally operate in asia the us and the uk the geographical diversity of our businesses means that we are inevitably subject to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations our operations in the us and asia which represent a significant proportion of our operating profit and shareholders funds generally write policies and invest in assets denominated in local currencies although this practice limits the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on local operating results it can lead to significant fluctuations in our consolidated financial statements when results are expressed in uk sterling   we retain revenues locally to support the growth of our business and capital is held in the local currency of the business to meet local regulatory and market requirements accepting the accounting balance sheet translation risks this can produce however in cases where a surplus arising in an overseas operation supports group capital or where a significant cash remittance is due from an overseas subsidiary to the group this exposure is hedged where we believe it is economically optimal to do so we do not have appetite for significant shareholder exposure to foreign exchange risks in currencies outside the local territory where this arises currency borrowings swaps and other derivatives are used to manage exposures   credit risk   we invest in fixed income assets in order to match policyholder liabilities and enter into reinsurance and derivative contracts to mitigate various types of risk as a result we are exposed to credit and counterparty credit risk across our business we employ a number of risk management tools to manage credit risk including limits defined on an issuercounterparty basis as well as on average credit quality to seek to ensure the diversification of the portfolio and have in place collateral arrangements in derivative transactions the group credit risk committee oversees credit and counterparty credit risk across the group and conducts sector andor name specific reviews as required in particular in  it has conducted sector reviews in the banking commodities and energy sectors   debt and loan portfolio   our uk business is primarily exposed to credit risk in the shareholderbacked portfolio with fixed income assets of £ billion credit risk arising from a further £ billion of fixed income assets is largely borne by the withprofits fund although in extremis shareholder support may be required should the withprofits fund become unable to meet its liabilities   the debt portfolio of our asia business totalled £ billion at  december  of this approximately  per cent was in unitlinked and withprofits funds with minimal shareholder risk the remaining  per cent is shareholder exposure   credit risk arises in the general account of our us business where £ billion of fixed income assets back shareholder liabilities including those arising from fixed annuities fixed index annuities and life insurance   the shareholderowned debt and loan portfolio of the groups asset management operations of £ billion as at  december  is principally related to prudential capital operations prudential capital generates revenue by providing bridging finance managing investments and operating a securities lending and cash management business for the prudential group and our clients   certain sectors have seen specific pressure during  and into early  the groups credit exposure to the oil and gas sector represents approximately  per cent or £ billion of the shareholder credit portfolio prolonged depressed oil prices are expected to exert downward rating pressure within the sector which is being monitored closely through group risk processes and the group credit risk committee the groups credit exposure to the metal and mining sector represents  per cent of the total shareholder debt portfolio £ billion similarly this sector is subject to ongoing monitoring and regular management information reporting to the groups risk committees   further details of the composition and quality of our debt portfolio and exposure to loans can be found in the ifrs financial statements   group sovereign debt   sovereign debt represented  per cent or £ billion of the debt portfolio backing shareholder business at  december   december   per cent or £ billion

debt was £ million  per cent of this was aaa rated  december   per cent aaa rated we do not have any sovereign debt exposure to greece   bank debt exposure and counterparty credit risk   our bank exposure is a function of our core investment business as well as of the hedging and other activities undertaken to manage our various financial risks given the importance of our relationship with our banks exposure to the banking sector is a key focus of management information provided to the groups risk committees and the board   the exposures held by the shareholderbacked business and withprofits funds in sovereign debt and bank debt securities at  december  are given in note cf of the groups ifrs financial statements   our exposure to derivative counterparty and reinsurance counterparty credit risk is managed using an array of risk management tools including a comprehensive system of limits   where appropriate we reduce our exposure purchase credit protection or make use of additional collateral arrangements to control our levels of counterparty credit risk at  december  shareholders exposure to corporate debt by rating and sector is shown below   ·       per cent of the shareholder portfolio is investment grade rated in particular  per cent of the portfolio is rated a and above ·      the groups shareholder portfolio is well diversified no individual sector makes up more than  per cent of the total portfolio excluding the financial and utilities sectors   insurance risk   insurance risk constitutes a sizeable proportion of the groups exposure the profitability of our businesses depends on a mix of factors including mortality and morbidity levels and trends persistency investment performance and claim inflation   longevity risk peoples propensity to live longer is a significant contributor to our insurance risk exposure and is also capital intensive under the solvency ii regime one tool used to manage this risk is reinsurance during  we completed deals on a number of tranches of bulk and retail annuity liabilities when terms were sufficiently attractive and aligned with our risk management framework the recently enhanced pensions freedoms in the uk have greatly reduced the demand for retail annuities and further liberalisation is anticipated  however given our significant uk annuity portfolio the assumptions that we make about future rates of mortality improvement will remain key to the measurement of insurance liabilities and to the assessment of any subsequent reinsurance transactions   we continue to conduct research into longevity risk using both experience from our annuity portfolio and industry data although the general consensus in recent years is that people are living longer there remains considerable volatility in yearonyear longevity experience which is why we need expert judgement in setting our longevity assumptions   morbidity risk is mitigated by appropriate underwriting when policies are issued and claims are received our morbidity assumptions reflect our recent experience and expectation of future trends for each relevant line of business   in asia a key assumption is the rate of medical inflation typically in excess of general price inflation this is the risk that the expenses of medical treatment increase more than expected so that the medical claim cost passed on to prudential is much higher medical expense inflation risk is best mitigated through retaining the right to reprice our products each year and by having suitable overall claim limits within our policies either limits per type of claim or in aggregate across policies   our persistency assumptions similarly reflect recent experience for each relevant line of business and future expectations persistency risk is mitigated by appropriate training and sales processes and managed locally postsale through regular experience monitoring and the identification of common characteristics of poor persistency business where appropriate allowance is also made for the relationship  either assumed or historically observed  between persistency and investment returns and for the resulting additional risk modelling this dynamic policyholder behaviour is particularly important when assessing the likely takeup rate of options embedded within product features   liquidity risk   the group has significant internal sources of liquidity which are sufficient to meet all of its expected requirements for a period of at least  months from the date the financial statements are approved without having to make use of external funding in aggregate the group currently has £ billion of undrawn committed facilities expiring in  in addition the group has access to liquidity via the debt capital markets we also have in place an unlimited commercial paper programme and have maintained a consistent presence as an issuer in this market for the last decade   liquidity uses and sources have been assessed at the group and at a business unit level under base case and stressed assumptions the liquidity resources available and the subsequent liquidity coverage ratio are regularly monitored and are assessed to be sufficient   operational risk   the group does not actively seek to take operational risk to generate returns instead it accepts a level of risk whereby the controls in place should prevent material losses but should also not excessively restrict business activities direct andor indirect financial losses are likely to arise if there is a failure to develop implement and monitor appropriate controls   for each business unit accountabilities for operational risk management and oversight are based on the principles of the three lines of defence model of risk taking and management risk control and oversight and independent assurance the approach adopted is proportional to the size nature and complexity of the business unit and the risks it manages   we have an operational risk management framework in place that facilitates both the qualitative and quantitative analysis of operational risk exposures the output of this framework in particular management information on key operational risk and control assessments scenario analysis internal incidents and external incidents is reported by the business units and presented to the group operational risk committee   this information also supports business decisionmaking and lessonslearned activities the ongoing improvement of the control environment and determination of the adequacy of our corporate insurance programme   top operational risks key areas of focus within the operational risk framework are ·      the risk of noncompliance due to the momentum of regulatory change in both our developed and developing markets as well as recognising that prudentials designation as a global systemically important insurer which requires the group to comply with additional policy measures including enhanced groupwide supervision ·      the risk of improper or misselling of prudential products and the resulting risk of censure from local regulators ·      the risk of regulatory censure due to poor conduct or weaknesses in systems and controls ·      the risk of censure for money laundering sanctions or antibribery and corruption failures ·      the risk that reliance on it infrastructures which support core activitiesprocesses of the business could fail or otherwise negatively impact business continuity and scalability needed to support the growth and changing needs of the business ·      the risk of a significant failure of a thirdparty provider impacting critical services ·      the risk of trading transacting or modelling errors having a material cost across group ·      the risk of the group failing to attract and retain quality senior managers and other key employees ·      the risk that key people processes and systems are unable to operate thus impacting the ongoing operation of the business due to a significant unexpected external event occurring eg a pandemic terrorist attack natural disaster political unrest and ·      the risk of losses resulting from damage to the firms reputation this can be either real or perceived reputational damage but which could nevertheless diminish the standing of the organisation in the eyes of key stakeholders eg customers shareholders destroy shareholder value adversely impact revenues or result in significant costs to rectify   cyber security cyber security is an increasingly important risk facing the group the risk is that a member of the group could be the target of a cyberrelated attack which could result in disruption to the key operations make it difficult to recover critical services damage assets and compromise data both corporate and customer this is a global issue which is rising in prominence across the financial services industry as a result of prudentials increasing market profile the  growing interest by customers to interact with their insurance provider and asset manager through the internet and social media improved brand awareness and the classification of prudential as a global systemically important insurer there is an increased likelihood of prudential being considered a target by cyber criminals a number of industry companywide and local business unitspecific initiatives are underway in response to this risk   business environment and strategic risks   global regulatory and political risk there are a number of ongoing policy initiatives and regulatory developments that are having and will continue to have an impact on the way prudential is supervised these include addressing financial conduct authority reviews ongoing engagement with the prudential regulation authority and includes the work of the financial stability board and standardsetting institutions such as the international association of insurance supervisors   the international association of insurance supervisors has various initiatives on  july  it published a methodology for identifying global systemically important insurers and a set of policy measures that will apply to them which the financial stability board endorsed groups designated as a global systemically important insurer are subject to additional regulatory requirements including enhanced groupwide supervision effective resolution planning development of a systemic risk management plan a recovery plan and a liquidity risk management plan prudentials designation as a global systemically important insurer was reaffirmed on  november  prudential is monitoring the development and potential impact of the policy measures and is continuing to engage with the prudential regulation authority on the implications of the policy measures and prudentials designation as a global systemically important insurer   the global systemically important insurer regime also introduces two types of capital requirements the first a basic capital requirement is designed to act as a minimum group capital requirement and the second a higher loss absorption requirement reflects the drivers of the assessment of global systemically important insurer designation the international association of insurance supervisors intends for these requirements to take effect from january  but global systemically important insurers will be expected to report privately to their groupwide supervisors in the interim   the international association of insurance supervisors is also developing a common framework comframe which is focused on the supervision of large and complex internationally active insurance groups comframe will establish a set of common principles and standards designed to assist regulators in addressing risks that arise from insurance groups with operations in multiple jurisdictions as part of this work is underway to develop a global insurance capital standard that would apply to internationally active insurance groups once the development of the insurance capital standard has been concluded it is intended to replace the basic capital requirement as the minimum group capital requirement for global systemically important insurers further consultations on the insurance capital standard are expected over the coming years and a version of the insurance capital standard is expected to be adopted as part of comframe in late    the international association of insurance supervisors insurance core principles which provide a globally accepted framework for the supervision of the insurance sector and comframe evolution are expected to create continued development in both prudential and conduct regulations over the next two to three years particularly in the emerging markets of asia   the european unions solvency ii directive came into effect on  january  the european commission will review elements of the solvency ii legislation from  onwards including a review of the long term guarantee measures by  january    similar national and regional efforts to curb systemic risk and promote financial stability are also underway in certain jurisdictions in which prudential operates including the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act  in the us and other european union legislation related to the financial services industry   the uk government has committed to holding a remainleave  referendum on eu membership which will be held on  june  the possible withdrawal of the uk from the eu would have political legal and economic ramifications for both the uk and the eu although these are expected to be more pronounced on the uk   in the us the implementation of the department of labor proposal to introduce new fiduciary obligations for distributors of investment products to holders of regulated accounts would dramatically reshape the distribution of retirement products if approved the final rule could be in place in  jacksons strong relationships with distributors history of product innovation and efficient operations should help mitigate any impacts   emerging risks   generally emerging risks are qualitative in nature and are not amenable to modelling using statistical techniques the emerging risk identification process at prudential seeks to leverage the expertise of the organisation through a combination of topdown and bottomup assessments of risks following two years of development the emerging risk identification process is now wellembedded across the group   the use of brainstorming sessions at various levels of the organisation is used as a central pillar of the emerging risk identification process to identify develop and challenge potential emerging risks input is also taken from external speakers forums and databases   the group has also sought to maintain contacts with industry experts and peers to benchmark and refine the emerging risk management process for example prudential has been a member of the emerging risk initiative at the cro forum for two years and chaired this initiative for    risk factors   our disclosures covering risk factors can be found at the end of this document   risk management cycle and governance   our group risk framework requires that all our businesses and functions establish processes for identifying evaluating and managing the key risks faced by the group the framework is based on the concept of three lines of defence comprising risk taking and management risk control and oversight and independent assurance   risk identification   the groups risk profile is a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the group including those that would threaten its business model future performance solvency or liquidity the risk profile is a key output from the risk identification and risk measurement processes and is used as a basis for setting groupwide limits management information assessment of solvency needs and determining appropriate stress and scenario testing   an annual topdown identification of our key risks assesses the risks that have the greatest potential to impact the groups operating results and financial condition the bottom up approach of risk identification is more granular and refers to the processes by which the business units identify assess and document risks with the appropriate coordination and challenge from the risk functions   the group own risk and solvency assessment report pulls together the analysis performed by a number of risk and capital management processes which are embedded across the group and provides quantitative and qualitative assessments of the groups risk profile risk management and solvency needs on a forward looking basis the scope of the group own risk and solvency assessment report covers the full known risk universe of the group   in accordance with provision c of the uk corporate governance code the directors have performed robust assessment of the principal risks facing the company through the group own risk and solvency assessment report and the risk assessments completed as part of the business planning review including how they are managed and mitigated given in this chief risk officers report   insurers are also required to undertake reverse stress testing which requires firms to work backwards from an assumed point of business model failure to identify the stress scenarios that could result in such adverse outcomes each firm must then consider whether the likelihood of these scenarios taking into account likely management actions is consistent with its risk appetite and if not must initiate actions to address any inconsistencies the actions considered form a part of our recovery plan   risk measurement and assessment   all identified risks are assessed based on an appropriate methodology for that risk all quantifiable risks which are material and mitigated by holding capital are modelled in the groups internal model which is used to determine capital requirements under the solvency ii pillar  and economic capital bases governance arrangements are in place to support the internal model this includes independent validation and process and controls around model changes and limitations   manage and control   the control procedures and systems established within the group are designed to manage the risk of failing to meet business objectives this can of course only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss they focus on aligning the levels of risktaking with the achievement of business objectives   the management and control of risks are set out in the group risk policies these risk policies define ·      the groups risk appetite in respect of material risks and the framework under which the groups exposure to those risks is limited ·      the processes to enable group senior management to effect the measurement and management of the group material risk profile in a consistent and coherent way and ·      the flows of management information required to support the measurement and management of the group material risk profile and to meet the needs of external stakeholders   monitoring and reporting   the management information received by the group risk committees and the board is tailored around the risks identified in the annual topdown process and also covers ongoing developments in other key and emerging risks   risk appetite and limits   the extent to which the group is willing to take risk in the pursuit of its objective to create shareholder value is defined by a number of risk appetite statements operationalised through measures such as limits triggers and indicators   risk appetite has been set at a group aggregate level and by risk type and covers all risks to shareholders including those from participating and third party business the qualitative statements are operationalised down to the local business units through measures such as limits triggers and indicators and cover the most significant exposures to the group particularly those that could impact the groups aggregate risk appetite metrics   the group risk function is responsible for reviewing the scope and operation of these measures at least annually to determine that they remain relevant on the recommendation of the group risk committee the board approves all changes made to the groups risk appetite framework   we define and monitor aggregate risk limits based on financial and nonfinancial stresses for our earnings volatility liquidity and capital requirements as follows   earnings volatility the objectives of the aggregate risk limits seek to manage that ·      the volatility of earnings is consistent with the expectations of stakeholders ·      the group has adequate earnings and cash flows to service debt expected dividends and to withstand unexpected shocks and ·      earnings and cash flows are managed properly across geographies and are consistent with funding strategies the two measures used to monitor the volatility of earnings are ifrs operating profit and eev operating profit although ifrs and eev total profits are also considered liquidity the objective is to monitor that the group is able to generate sufficient cash resources to meet financial obligations as they fall due in business as usual and stressed scenarios   capital requirements the limits aim to manage that ·      the group meets its internal economic capital requirements ·      the group achieves its desired target rating to meet its business objectives and ·      supervisory intervention is avoided   the two measures used to define the limits are solvency ii capital requirements and internal economic capital requirements in addition outside the uk capital requirements are monitored on local statutory bases   we use an internal economic capital assessment calibrated on a multiterm basis to monitor our capital requirements across the group this approach considers by risk drivers the timeframe over which each risk can threaten the ability of the group to meet claims as they fall due allowing for realistic diversification benefits this assessment provides valuable insights into our risk profile and for continuing to maintain a strong capital position   with the introduction of solvency ii the existing european union insurance group directives risk appetite statement has been replaced with a solvency ii pillar  risk appetite as part of our annual business planning cycle the risk appetite framework plays an integral role the group risk committee is responsible for reviewing the risks inherent in the groups business plan and for providing the board with input on the riskreward tradeoffs implicit therein this review is supported by the group risk function which uses submissions from our local business units to calculate the groups aggregated position allowing for diversification effects between local business units relative to the aggregate risk limits   risk policies   risk policies set out specific requirements for the management of and articulate the risk appetite for key risk types there are core risk policies for credit market insurance liquidity and operational risks and a number of internal control policies covering internal model risk underwriting dealing controls and tax risk management they form part of the group governance manual which was developed to make a key contribution to the sound system of internal control that we maintain in line with the uk corporate governance code and the hong kong code on corporate governance practices   risk culture   the increasing regulatory focus on market participants instilling corporate cultures that support prudent management and outcomes for consumers is indelibly linked to what we do and how we do it the risk culture as a subset of the broader business culture is reflected in the values and behaviours the group displays when managing risk it therefore permeates throughout the groups risk framework and governance processes   the group promotes a responsible risk culture in three main ways ·      by the leadership and behaviours demonstrated by management ·      by building skills and capabilities to support risk management and ·      by including risk management through the balance of risk with profitability and growth in the performance evaluation of individuals   senior management leadership senior management promote a responsible culture of risk management by emphasising the importance of balancing risk with profitability and growth in decision making while seeking to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and internal policies as part of this they encourage all employees to be riskaware and to take personal responsibility for identifying and helping to address risk issues   building skills and capabilities the group works to build skills and capabilities in risk management which are needed by both senior management and risk management specialists while attempting to allocate scarce resources appropriately   performance management the group includes risk management measures that balances risk taken with profitability and growth achieved in the performance evaluation of key individuals including both senior management and those directly responsible for risk management objectives may be quantitative or qualitative as appropriate   the remuneration strategy at prudential is designed to be consistent with its risk appetite and the group chief risk officer advises the group remuneration committee on adherence to our risk framework and appetite   notes  representing solvency ii own funds of the uk withprofit funds  excludes groups proportionate share in joint ventures and unitlinked assets and holdings of consolidated unit rust and similar funds  in the shareholder exposure by rating   per cent of nonrated assets are internally rated privately held loans     corporate governance   the board confirms that it has complied with all relevant provisions set out in the hong kong code on corporate governance practices the hk code throughout the accounting period with respect to code provision bd of the hk code the responsibilities of the remuneration committee do not include making recommendations to the board on the remuneration of nonexecutive directors in line with the principles of the uk code fees for nonexecutive directors are determined by the board   the directors also confirm that the financial results contained in this document have been reviewed by the group audit committee   the company confirms that it has adopted a code of conduct regarding securities transactions by directors on terms no less exacting than

a higher demand for pension and retirement products datamonitor  since prudentials products and marketing range are mainly targeted at those aged over  this change in demographics is very crucial to the companys overall growth datamonitor  it is therefore essential for prudential to support the ageing population by providing products that meet the customers changing needs there is a distinct loss of confidence amongst consumers to opt for financial services as a result of misselling of some products in the uk complexity in the financial services environment and poor performance of equity markets prudential plc website  research reveals that there is an estimated savings gap of £ billion per year in the uk furthermore the government has estimated that approximately  million people in

analysis of the financial services industry threat of substitute products and services there are few close substitutes to financial services and products and the threat is determined as weak investment in gold jewellery antiques and other collectibles might be considered as substitutes for investment in mutual funds equities and other forms of savings investment in property is also seen as alternate to investment in pension schemes to provide income and capital for oldage consequently leading to a rapid growth in the buytolet market ennew et al  level of competition there is considerable competition within the financial services industry despite having few close substitutes most companies in this industry operate on a large scale with wide geographical coverage and strong buying power thereby fostering strong rivalry between the players datamonitor  competition has been fuelled by the liberalisation of financial markets and reduced barriers between different institutional types bancassurance and diversification of specialised insurance companies into banking are typical examples of this companies in the industry try to maintain their competitive edge by diversifying and offering a wide range of financial services and products to its target audience ennew and waite  for example prudential ventured into the online banking industry through its online bank egg through which it offered a range of traditional banking products at very competitive terms and conditions however this venture was sold to citibank in  prudential plc website  threat of new entrants the threat of new entrants is low this can be attributed to high entry barriers caused by strong brand identity for prudential its product differentiation customer loyalty and moreover high switching costs moreover to be able to enter the market and be successful new entrants would need highly specialised knowledge and expertise along with huge financial resources to compete with an established brands in the industry dess lumpkin eisner    there are some government regulations in place by bodies such as the financial services authority fsa in the uk which limit the entry of other financial firms into the market datamonitor november  moreover the likelihood of new entrants in the industry has been reduced with the current global economic situation causing reduction in consumers confidence in the industry increased merger and acquisitions amongst key players and government bailouts for large institutions datamonitor december  bargaining power of buyers is moderate for individual consumers as there are many in number and the impact of losing one customer is low however buying power is higher for corporate clients as they usually pay huge premiums and loosing highmargin clients will have a negative impact on the companys revenues there are plenty of alternatives in the industry but the switching cost is relatively high for consumers as changing players will involve surrendering or ending a policy before it matures which will have cost and tax implications for them existence of price comparison websites and financial services consultants boost buyer power as they empower buyers to shoparound for the best deal available due to the importance of the product offered with the economic downturn buyers disposable incomes have also been reduced this has an indirect impact on their buyer behaviour as they may choose not to invest in financial services as they might not come across as necessities datamonitor november  bargaining power of suppliers overall bargaining power of suppliers is strong this is because companies operating in this market require a reliable and secure ict infrastructure to help conduct vital backoffice and clientfacing functions such as online equity trading and online banking studies conducted by datamonitor  indicate that complex hardware and software requirements by major players in the industry lead to few suppliers which can offer suitable solutions to them and these tend to be large organisations such as ibm or microsoft this consequently strengthens the bargaining position of suppliers such as it consultants hardware and software suppliers and internet service providers moreover large firms tend to be committed to one supplier thereby imposing high switching costs on themselves additionally large firms with extensive branches face high staffing costs because of the need for skilled employees datamonitor december  swot analysis strengths strong market position in asia europe and the us
