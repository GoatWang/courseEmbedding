transport ready for release and participated in the initial group sessions on a new application network initiative that eventually grew into uanucmupm as the technical lead for eai within expert services i worked with a group of  other specialists ensuring that we kept up to date with both technology and best practice enhancements i also worked with a number of large customers during this tiem to develop their audit requirements and solutions providing runtime event based read audit three years before it was available in the main productin  i moved from expert services to siebel professional services although on my first day there the name changed to oracle consulting i worked as a solution architect within the uk practice still specialising in integration audit business and technical architectures but also providing project and programme management support to a number of projects and sales support to the consultign sales teamsin  i moved from oracle consulting to product management in order to assume responsibility for the siebel integration and siebel audit trail functional areas within the siebel core technology team until august  this function has been associated with a traditional waterfall development methodology and i was responsible for requirements gathering producing market requirements documents mrds and prioritizing defects for resolution through fix
