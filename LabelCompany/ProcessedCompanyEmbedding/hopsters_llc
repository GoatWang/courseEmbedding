awareness and enhance peoples experience with craft beer as you know we are expanding into the downtown boston seaport area and i wanted to take some time to share with you our thoughts and feelings about hopsters since we opened in  we have had  guests brew beer with us some of our guests are experienced home brewers the vast majority are not however they have all taken away an experience that enhances their connection with their community and local craft beer hopsters is brew pub a restaurant and a place where you can experience craft beer to the fullest many people just pull up to the bar chat with our welcoming staff have a bite to eat and enjoy our house brewed beer everyone is curious about the beer making experience and many come back to try it either with friends or with colleagues as part of a corporate event if you love craft beer you love hopsters everyone that visits us especially our guests that participate in the beer making experience have a big smile of their face it’s so much fun with a glass of beer in hand to get the malts hops and grains and mix it all up in the kettle knowing that in two weeks you get to come back to bottle label and drink your hand crafted beer we’ve hosted hundreds of th birthday parties infact we have one going on upstairs as i’m writing this corporate events wedding rehearsal dinners community sports teams along with teachers group outings in fact if you think of a reason to get together with friends hopsters has probably hosted it i truly believe there will be a hopsters in most major cities in the us in the coming years our mission why we get out of bed in the mornings is to increase people’s awareness of craft beer we value and care about learning so you make the best most informed choices to this aim we have made it a priority to support our community to enhance the place we live by supporting fundraising for local schools and initiatives we keep our attention local because beer is best when it’s brewed in your community and on fun because life is crazy  beer shouldn’t be i’m asking you to invest in your community support local produced products learn about craft beer and have some fun along the way to this aim we are excited to announce that we will be opening in the spring a hopsters in the downtown boston seaport area hopsters in its three short years has become a phenomenal success way beyond

pub what that means is you come in we ask you what beer you like to drink then we help you make  cases of your own handcrafted beer it takes about  hours its a fun experience you can do it with friends as a corporate group team building or by yourself during those  hours when you are brewing we have a full restaurant so you can eat and drink while you are making your own beer how did hopsters get its start i was looking for a new career and i was interested in owning my own business i was making my own homebrewed beer and i got rave reviews so i always thought it would be fun to have a career that involves beer in some way i never really thought that was going to happen because i did a little bit of research and quite frankly unless you have a significant amount of up front capital its very difficult to run a brewery that makes any significant amount of cash with two kids a family and living in the suburbs i needed to create a significant income for myself i didn’t think that owning a brewery with the vast amount of capital was going to make the money that i need to be successful i also didnt have a lot of experience putting together a commercial brewery on my travels i found these places that you can go and brew your own beer i visited one with some friends of mine and as we were going through the experience of brewing our own beer we came to the conclusion that it was great to be able to brew your own beer and get to hang out with other people during the process with the downtime while you wait for the beer to brew we thought it would be great if the place had a restaurant so we could eat while we waited that was really the start of the genesis of the business after looking into the numbers i realized you could actually make some serious money doing this it’s fun to have a restaurant and a bar and a brewing aspect i did more research and found that there are only two places that that did this both in ohio one in columbus and one just outside columbus ohio i didnt really find anything else around that i had a few ideas that focused on the beer making piece of it the places that i visited seemed to want to be a bar and a brewery but they weren’t focused on the brewery aspect and used kettles twice the size as we use with them you brew six cases of beer and for a lot of people that is too much our concept uses a smaller kettle and allows you to brew three cases another thing i noticed is that these places were dingy and more like a warehouse type of setting i realized that the demographic that was into craft beer was young professionals who are looking for an upscale experience along with using less beer in the kettles we decided to provide a really fun cool upscale environment that catered to young urban professionals who were really moving and embracing the whole craft beer movementthat’s the of the idea for this concept after about a year or so we decided that we wanted to really brew our own beer and become a brewpub so we got a brewpub license and we have pretty much been exclusively offering our beer at hopsters for the last year we wanted to be authentic and if we were going to have others brew their own beer we wanted to be known as a place that produces great beer what is hopsters’ mission and what are your core values our mission is to enhance craft beer awareness for people in our community we want them know more about craft beer whether its tasting brewing we want people to experience and we want to enhance their experience for craft beer that is what we get out of bed every morning to do i have to say that hopsters offers the best craft beer experience in the states right now we also value the learning process so when people come in they can learn as much as they want they can totally immerse themselves or just ask a couple of questions all while enjoying the great selection of beer and menu items that we have in our restaurant it’s a complete experience that they can enjoy we like to call the learning process selfdirected edutainment the craft beer culture can sometimes get a little snobby much like the wine culture and we wanted to take that whole snobbishness out of beer where i grew up in england beer is a working mans drink and we want to create that easy going fun relaxing environment we have four core values the first three are learning keeping local and community involvement we really want to be involved in our community even if we can’t give a lot of money within the community we do like to donate kettles so that they can auction them out for community charities we are able to do that for not a lot of money so we do a significant amount of charity work within the community being a part of the community is very important to us craft beer if anything is local people want to drink local fresh beer most people dont want their beer to come from  miles away if given the choice the last value that we have is for the locals is fun so we really try to provide a culture around beer that is fun and lets people get away from their day to day life we really feel that weve been able to bring those four aspects together because people are always having fun they are drinking and making beer everyone that comes into hopsters just has a really good time by asking the community to put money into this fundraiser we are giving our community a piece of hopsters they will have a stake in the business and can come to hopsters drink a beer and say “i own a piece of this” it’s a circle of support in a way we support the community that will be supporting us what is the experience when someone comes into hopsters what is the process our system has  kettles that are all connected you can brew one kettle which most people do or you can come in with some friends and do  or  or  kettles each kettle is a different style of beer when you come in you will be assigned a brewmaster and a number of our staff and they will help choose the kind of beer that you would like to brew that is usually a quick  minute conversation we have a whole selection of  different recipes that we have developed over the years of  different styles of beer if you have a little bit of experience and you want to customize the beer with maybe different hop choices or certain things youd like to add to the beer as long as we have those ingredients and its not going to make your beer taste awful we are happy to accommodate that we offer a “flight of beers” that you can order to taste so you can get accustomed to the different flavor and different styles of beer if you are not a big craft beer drinker for example you may want to sample a belgian beer because you have never had it you can get a sample and that will help you to fine tune your beer choice once youve chosen a beer to brew we take you to our ingredients room we have canisters on the wall where you get your different types of grains you will choose your hops and the various malts that go into your beer in fact you will get a laminated recipe card and the brewmaster will help you select those different types of ingredients once you have all the ingredients that you need for the brew you will go over to your kettle and start making your three cases of beer which is about  gallons of beer you get  oz bottles or you can mix and match of bottles and cans our cans are oz  pints if you are making a big strong belgian ale you probably dont want to can that so you will probably fill up bottles when they come back later the process takes about  hours and moves in sections the first section selecting the beer getting the ingredients etc takes up to about  minutes then you will be boiling the beer for about an hour which is when we will be keeping an eye on your beer there may be times during that hour where you need add hops or some other adjuncts into the beer if you are making spice beer you might be putting some cloves in or if you’re making a pumpkin beer you put in pumpkin for the most part you have about  minutes of down time and in that time we encourage you to order some food from the restaurant and get yourself a beer then you will go over to the kettles and we are going to transfer that beer into your fermenter which takes about  minutes what we are basically doing is taking your kettle of beer and we are getting it down to room temperature through the heat exchanger it’s a fancy bit of equipment in the brewery and it’s really easy to do we kind of walk you through that process the fermenter is a  gallon drum once youve filled up your beer you are going to add the yeast into your beerthat is when we get some details from you to tie down your beer and take it downstairs to our fermentation room the beer takes about a week to ferment at this point you can either keep drinking and having fun at hopsters or go home when you come back two weeks later you get to try out the beer that you brewed the great thing is that with all of our recipes and our processes the beer is going to be pretty good a lot better than if you were going to homebrew for the first time people are usually quite pleased with the beer that they get at this point you get to bottle your beer in the bottling line there you sanitize your bottles and fill them through our bottling machines once again you go home and that is when we send you an email with a link to our site where you can upload the design you would like for your labels it is all included in the price when you come back to get your beer you will get to place your  labels onto your beer and people have a lot of fun with that basically thats it once youve bottled your beer its good to drink so you take it home and drink it how much does the process cost what is the split in the cost between the restaurant the bar and the brewing experience it costs anywhere from  to  depending on the style of beer that you want a pale ale is  and a belgian trippel is  that price difference is for the ingredients you need more product to get stronger beers and more hops to get hoppier beer if you are coming as a corporate group you are going to pay  per person for that price we bottle the beers for you we stick the labels on it and we drop it off at your company address for you to give to the people what are your margins we are coming in around  net profit we have an  gross margin how has the growth progressed and what is the ceiling on a location of that size the newton location is a  sq ft location and our sales ar not really going to grow significantly in newton we are maxed out we did m in  and looks like well do close to m this year we are closed on mondays and don’t open for lunch so we could change that but would still only increase revenues a small portion one thing that is pretty low is our salary our salary comes in around  which in most restaurants is in the s especially for the check average that we have people here spend what they would spend at a fine dining restaurant checks on average are around  when someone brews obviously the check is much higher how have your priorities and goals evolved over the years at hopsters the first year in our business we wondered if it was going to work and if the concept was viable we had done a significant amount of sales and had a lot of fun and spent a lot of money the second year of business  was really about sales we looked at our product differentiation our pricing and focusing on the restaurant and brewing our own beer we thought about how to drive sales we knew we worked because people wanted to come to hopsters our new focus was on finding ways to get more people to come into hopsters and ultimately increase the cost of the average check the third year has really about sales and foot traffic and how to manage the cost of goods we want to lower cost of goods we also have been looking at how to consolidate  has really been about focusing on a couple things one has really been working on the pl and cutting costs being effective with labor costs and really driving in on managing that to have a strong pl whereby we are not wasting money or spending money on things vision thats what this is and what weve been all about we have also been spending time on the expansion why did you choose newton for your location what is next for you in terms of growth no one had done this on the east coast new england and weve been the first people to do that we wanted a place that was affordable and that had good visibility on a main road so people could see it you are never going to be successful doing something like this in the back alley the hopsters brewery in newton weve only got  sq ft one of the biggest challenges is that we had  corporate groups this week generating revenue anywhere from  to  dollars for a  sq ft location that is a significant amount of money however because it is so small we had to shut down to the public we also often receive calls from people saying we want to come in with  of my friends we love your brewpub and we love your food we really want to celebrate an occasion here but we are not really interested in brewing which is fine not everyone has to brew we have to turn those people away because otherwise we have to shut down to the public and we are not using our kettle its almost like someone showing up at a bowling alley with  people and saying we want to hangout in the bowling alley and drink and eat but we dont want to bowl its not really an option right bigger locations will enable us to have a bar area a restaurant area where people can drink and dine and also run a large corporate event without shutting down or run a nice party that doesnt want to brew but also at the same time have people come in and brew and even drink thats why we are expanding and we feel our margins and our sales will be that much higher what are the specifics of the expansion what are you trying to do and why are you raising money we are raising  million to open a location in boston the spot is about  sq ft and its what we need the cost of the build out is going to be about  per sq ftthe landlord is giving us  per sq ft which is just over half a million dollars that means that our total build out cost is  the equipment costs for things like signs and awnings and tables and chairs and pos systems and things like that are approximately  we have a brewing package as part of the systems that we have to put in place and to install that is about  we need to get the kettles which are  the boiler that heats the kettles to boil your beer is about  that total cost is approximately  so we are at  million there will be miscellaneous costs as well we need our beer and wine license in massachusetts which is about  and professional fees and things like that which is going to come to about  why did you choose the boston area we chose seaport which is a new area in central boston it is the hippest fastest growing place in the city as a matter of fact ge is opening up their world headquarters there as well there are also a large amount of software companies there making the district very innovative and there is development going on everywhere condos and a nightclub so we will be right in the middle of all of it also there is a brewery there called trillium you may have heard of harpoon their brewery is not too far away as well its a great location to be in in fact we have been looking for a location there for probably a good year or two and we are really excited about the location that we have now the location carries our target demographicyoung professionals we are right next door the the financial district and of course a lot of offices so weve got our corporate business its going to be significant for corporate events right downtown pwc just moved in and there are a lot of other cool young innovative businesses and its a perfect demographic for us who makes up your team and how are you qualified to do this who do you surround yourself with and why does everyone want to grow hopsters the core team is my wife and i i take the lead on the strategy and focus on how we drive revenue my wife is takes the lead on marketing social media and how to get people in there to spend money i’m also pretty good at figuring out how to make it all cool fun as well as how to take our values and achieve our mission while making money what ive learned from the last few years is really about how to fine tune the business karen focuses on the operations side she manages the inbound relationships with people that want to come in on the corporate piece for example this year we are doing about  in corporate sales where last year we did like  karen has really focused on managing the relationships and managing the contracts and the administrative aspects of the business on the corporate side we have an amazing chef whos been with us for about  months now and we are really working on providing a beercentric menu for people not only do we suggest pairings but we are always looking at ways to add beer to the food for example this fall we are having a beer fondue and a steak and ale pie we have a very craft beer focused menu hes been a chef for the last  years went to culinary school and hes owned his own restaurant his role will be managing the restaurant here and staffing and managing the large restaurant in downtown boston when we open in seaport in terms of managing our beverage program in the front of the house that falls to our front of house and bar manager john he has a hospitality degree from bu hes been in the beer trade business and the beverage business for many years he will be running our beverage program down in boston he will also be managing front of house aspects of seaport we recently hired cassidy as our head brewer he came to us as a brewer with sam adams he will be responsible for overall brewing operations in newton and expanding into the seaportour brewer is  tim he is responsible with my direction for implementing the beer that we brew he also does recipe development he came up through the ranks at hopsters starting off as a homebrewer like myself then he was brewing with the customers and then doing competitive brewing when we move to seaport we have brewers masterbrewers waitstaff and bar staff the core team will move to boston and they will pass between newton and boston the strategic management and the weekly operations for newton will also fall to the staff in boston we are not going to brew our own beer in boston we are going to do that here in newton and double the capacity of the brewery there then we will send our beer down to the boston location we dont want to use our  sq ft to brew beer we want to use it for the restaurant the bar and the customers we will be looking for a general manager in boston we are looking for someone who has a restaurant background but who knows that we are not simply a restaurant we want to provide more of a restaurant menu however which is why we want someone who has that experience who can help us grow from hopsters       as soon as we turn the leaf and close on the funding we will be doing a fairly extensive search for a general manager how will you make money since jan  and going forward when combined with store the prototype for growth we have  revenue streams in various levels of maturity beerliquor sales both house brewed and guest accounts for approx  of revenue food sales approximately  of revenue beer brewing with corporate groups public groups or small group kettle sales approx  off premise sales  and contract brewing aprox  how do you acquire customers we have a significant online social media presence that includes k facebook followers online advertising outbound corporate sales executive inbound sales executive and inbound media executive media relations whats new about what youre making how is it different nobody does what we do on the east coast and we have virtually no competition nationally we are unique in the fact that we have the brew your own experience with the emphasis on corporate events as well as an upscale brew pub restaurantbar think foodertainmentdave  busters etc how big is the market we believe there should be at least one or two hopsters in every us urban area and potentially overseas if you are over  and looking for a fun experience with friends work or family then hopsters is for you who are your competitors how are you different no competition you cannot brew beer drink craft beer and eat anywhere on the east coast however for corporate business people have other options such as kings bowling and f formula racing however no brewing alternative what do you understand about your business that others dont get our model yields tremendous profitability while we are a restaurant the majority of our revenues come from higher margin business so we do not face the business financial challenges of a restaurant we have much lower costs and much higher margins whats your biggest risk what keeps you up at night its about execution every single day and as we grow we will need to continue to bring in great colleagues getting the capital to open  which will be the prototype for growth licensing is always a challenge as each jurisdiction has different rules and regulations read all answers view all
