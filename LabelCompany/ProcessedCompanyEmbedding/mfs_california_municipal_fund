interest rates rise the price of equity securities may rise or fall because of changes in the broad market or changes in a companys financial condition sometimes rapidly or unpredictably equity securities are subject to stock market risk meaning that stock prices in general may decline over short or extended periods of time international investing involves a greater degree of risk and increased volatility changes in currency exchange rates and differences in accounting and taxation policies outside the us can raise or lower returns also some overseas markets may not be as politically and economically stable as the united states and other nations investments in emerging markets can be more volatile real estate investments may be subject to a higher degree of market risk because of concentration in a specific industry sector or geographical sector real estate investments may be subject to risks including but not limited to declines in the value of real estate risks related to general and economic conditions changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trust and defaults by borrower investments in commodities may have greater volatility than investments in traditional securities particularly if the instruments involve leverage the value of commoditylinked derivative instruments may be affected by changes in overall market movements commodity index volatility changes in interest rates or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity such as drought floods weather livestock disease embargoes tariffs and international economic political and regulatory developments use of leveraged commoditylinked derivatives creates an opportunity for increased return but at the same time creates the possibility for greater loss derivatives may be riskier than other types of investments because they may be more sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions than other types of investments and could result in losses that significantly exceed the original investment the use of derivatives may not be successful resulting in investment losses and the cost of such strategies may reduce investment returns there is no

decline in value as the result of declines in the credit quality of the issuer borrower counterparty or other entity responsible for payment underlying collateral or changes in economic political issuerspecific or other conditions certain types of debt instruments can be more sensitive to these factors and therefore more volatile in addition debt instruments entail interest rate risk as interest rates rise prices usually fall therefore the funds share price may decline during rising rates funds that consist of debt instruments with longer durations are generally more sensitive to a rise in interest rates than those with shorter durations at times and particularly during periods of market turmoil all or a large portion of segments of the market may not have an active trading market as a result it may be difficult to value these investments and it may not be possible to sell a particular investment or type of investment at any particular time or at an acceptable price the price of an instrument trading at a negative interest rate responds to interest rate changes like other debt instruments however an instrument purchased at a negative interest rate is expected to produce a negative return if held to maturity investments in derivatives can be used to take both long and short positions be highly volatile involve leverage which can magnify losses and involve risks in addition to the risks of the underlying indicators on which the derivative is based such as counterparty and liquidity risk investments in below investment grade quality debt instruments can be more volatile and have greater risk of default or already be in default than higherquality debt instruments investments in municipal instruments can be volatile and significantly affected by adverse tax or court rulings legislative or political changes market and economic conditions issuer industryspecific including the credit quality of municipal insurers and other conditions the fund’s performance could be closely tied to the economic political and other conditions in the states and us territories and possessions in which the fund invests and could be more volatile than the

with at least a threeyear history exchangetraded funds and openended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes it is calculated based on a morningstar riskadjusted

threeyear rating for  months of total returns and  year rating fiveyear rating threeyear rating for  or more months of total returns while the year overall star rating formula seems to give the most

money on your investment in the fund investments in debt instruments may decline in value as the result of declines in the credit quality of the issuer borrower counterparty or other entity responsible for payment underlying collateral or changes in economic political issuerspecific or other conditions certain types of debt instruments can be more sensitive to these factors and therefore more volatile in addition debt instruments entail interest rate risk as interest rates rise prices usually fall therefore the funds share price may decline during rising rates funds that consist of debt instruments with longer durations are generally more sensitive to a rise in interest rates than those with shorter durations at times and particularly during periods of market turmoil all or a large portion of segments of the market may not have an active trading market as a result it may be difficult to value these investments and it may not be possible to sell a particular investment or type of investment at any particular time or at an acceptable price the price of an instrument trading at a negative interest rate responds to interest rate changes like other debt instruments however an instrument purchased at a negative interest rate is expected to produce a negative return if held to maturity investments in derivatives can be used to take both long and short positions be highly volatile involve leverage which can magnify losses and involve risks in addition to the risks of the underlying indicators on which the derivative is based such as counterparty and liquidity risk investments in below investment grade quality debt instruments can be more volatile and have greater risk of default or already be in default than higherquality debt instruments investments in municipal instruments can be volatile and significantly affected by adverse tax or court rulings legislative or political changes market and economic conditions issuer industryspecific including the credit quality of municipal insurers and other conditions the fund’s performance could be closely tied to the economic political and other conditions in the states and us territories and possessions

the morningstar rating for funds or star rating is calculated for funds with at least a threeyear history exchangetraded funds and openended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes it is calculated based on a morningstar riskadjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a funds monthly excess performance placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance the top  of products in each product category receive  stars the next  receive  stars the next  receive  stars the next  receive  stars and the bottom  receive  star the overall morningstar rating for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three five and year if applicable morningstar rating metrics the weights are  threeyear rating for  months of total returns  fiveyear rating threeyear rating for  months of total returns and  year rating fiveyear rating threeyear rating for  or more months of total returns while the year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the year period the most recent threeyear period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods morningstar rankings may vary among share classes and are based on historical total returns which are not indicative of future results class a share star ratings do not include any frontend sales load and are intended for those investors who have access to such purchase terms eg plan participants of a defined contribution plan therefore morningstar strongly encourages

morningstar rating metrics which are based on riskadjusted returns as of the date stated  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds what does it mean a funds morningstar rating is a quantitative assessment of a funds past performance that accounts for both risk and return with funds earning between  and  stars as always this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process a high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision returns low avg high above average this fund scores above average because it delivered returns that were in the top  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category� top   high� next   above average� middle   average� next   below average� bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk expenses low avg high below average this funds expenses are rated as below average because they fall between the th and th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category how is it calculated this morningstar data point compares the funds net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its morningstar category grouping what does it mean excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance while you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios a funds expense structure may be one factor to consider risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk

objective the investment seeks total return with an emphasis on income exempt from federal income tax and personal income tax if any of california but also considering capital appreciation strategy the fund invests under normal market conditions at least  of its net assets in securities and other investments the interest on which is exempt from federal income tax and personal income tax if any of california interest from the funds investments may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax the adviser normally invests the funds assets primarily in municipal instruments risk the municipal market can be affected by adverse tax legislative or political changes and the financial condition of the issuers of municipal securities municipal funds carry interest rate risk as interest rates rise bond prices usually fall and vice versa this effect is usually more pronounced for longerterm securities they also carry inflation risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties unlike individual bonds most bond funds do not have a maturity date so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible although statespecific municipal funds seek to provide interest dividends exempt from both federal and state income taxes and some of these funds may seek to generate income that is also exempt from federal alternative minimum tax outcomes cannot be guaranteed and the funds may generate some income subject to these taxes residency in the state is usually required for the state income tax exemption generally municipal securities are not appropriate for taxadvantaged accounts such as iras and ks additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials if

while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk of the category in addition to risk you should evaluate a funds investment objective strategy fees and other

condition of the issuers of municipal securities municipal funds carry interest rate risk as interest rates rise bond prices usually fall and vice versa this effect is usually more pronounced for longerterm securities they also carry inflation risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties unlike individual bonds most bond funds do not have a maturity date so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible although statespecific municipal funds seek to provide interest dividends exempt from both federal and state income taxes and some of these funds may seek to generate income that is also exempt from federal alternative minimum tax outcomes cannot be guaranteed and the funds may generate some income subject to these taxes residency in the state is usually required for the state income tax exemption generally municipal securities are not appropriate for taxadvantaged accounts such as iras and ks additional risk

achieve its objective andor you could lose money on your investment in the fund investments in debt instruments may decline in value as the result of declines in the credit quality of the issuer borrower counterparty or other entity responsible for payment underlying collateral or changes in economic political issuerspecific or other conditions certain types of debt instruments can be more sensitive to these factors and therefore more volatile in addition debt instruments entail interest rate risk as interest rates rise prices usually fall therefore the funds share price may decline during rising rates funds that consist of debt instruments with longer durations are generally more sensitive to a rise in interest rates than those with shorter durations at times and particularly during periods of market turmoil all or a large portion of segments of the market may not have an active trading market as a result it may be difficult to value these investments and it may not be possible to sell a particular investment or type of investment at any particular time or at an acceptable price the price of an instrument trading at a negative interest rate responds to interest rate changes like other debt instruments however an instrument purchased at a negative interest rate is expected to produce a negative return if held to maturity investments in derivatives can be used to take both long and short positions be highly volatile involve leverage which can magnify losses and involve risks in addition to the risks of the underlying indicators on which the derivative is based such as counterparty and liquidity risk investments in below investment grade quality debt instruments can be more volatile and have greater risk of default or already be in default than higherquality debt instruments the funds performance could be more volatile than the performance of more diversified funds investments in municipal instruments can be volatile and significantly affected by adverse tax or court rulings legislative or political changes market and economic conditions issuer industryspecific including the credit quality of municipal insurers and other conditions the fund’s performance could be closely tied to the economic political and other conditions in the states and us territories and possessions in which the fund invests and could be more volatile than the

with at least a threeyear history exchangetraded funds and openended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes it is calculated based on a morningstar riskadjusted

threeyear rating for  months of total returns and  year rating fiveyear rating threeyear rating for  or more months of total returns while the year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the year period the most recent threeyear period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods morningstar rankings may vary among share classes and are based on historical total returns which are not indicative of future results class a share star ratings do not include any frontend sales load and are intended for those investors who have access to such purchase terms eg plan participants of a defined contribution plan therefore morningstar strongly encourages investors to contact their investment professional to determine whether they are

results diversification does not guarantee investment returns and does not eliminate the risk of loss bonds are subject to interest rate risks bond prices generally fall when interest rates rise the price of equity securities may rise or fall because of changes in the broad market or changes in a companys financial condition sometimes rapidly or unpredictably equity securities are subject to stock market risk meaning that stock prices in general may decline over short or extended periods of time international investing involves a greater degree of risk and increased volatility changes in currency exchange rates and differences in accounting and taxation policies outside the us can raise or lower returns also some overseas markets may not be as politically and economically stable as the united states and other nations investments in emerging markets can be more volatile real estate investments may be subject to a higher degree of market risk because of concentration in a specific industry sector or geographical sector real estate investments may be subject to risks including but not limited to declines in the value of real estate risks related to general and economic conditions changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trust and defaults by borrower investments in commodities may have greater volatility than investments in traditional securities particularly if the instruments involve leverage the value of commoditylinked derivative instruments may be affected by changes in overall market movements commodity index volatility changes in interest rates or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity such as drought floods weather livestock disease embargoes tariffs and international economic political and regulatory developments use of leveraged commoditylinked derivatives creates an opportunity for increased return but at the same time creates the possibility for greater loss derivatives may be riskier than other types of investments because they may be more sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions than other types of investments and could result in losses that significantly exceed the original investment the use of derivatives may not be successful resulting in investment losses and the cost of such strategies may reduce investment returns there is no guarantee that the use of long and short positions will succeed in limiting an investors exposure to domestic stock market movements capitalization sector swings or other risk factors investing using long and short selling strategies may have higher portfolio turnover rates short selling involves certain risks including additional costs associated with covering short positions and a possibility of unlimited loss on
