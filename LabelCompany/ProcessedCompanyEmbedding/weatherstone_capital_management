that while investors are happy making money they are even more unhappy losing money  because of this weatherstone offers a tactical approach to managing your investments  this method is different from the strategic asset allocation  instead of rebalancing the portfolio on a quarterly or semiannual basis to a preset asset allocation weatherstone will monitor your investments as frequently as daily and adjust the asset allocation as needed  this approach incorporates a buy and sell discipline with the goal of reducing the severity of market losses while still allowing the portfolios to shift into the markets to participate in the advances view our tactical programs a strategic approach to investing is designed to capture the broad market moves which over a longer time horizon has delivered strong return potential to investors who adhere to the discipline  the strategic or “buyandhold” approach advocate for a more efficient market where new information is instantly accounted for  broad diversification is a key element of the weatherstone strategic portfolios given that the asset allocation does not change frequently  this diversification spreads the market risk which helps take emotion out of the equation for investors nervous about changing conditions view our strategic programs     login menu financial advisors helping you do what you love most if you are like
