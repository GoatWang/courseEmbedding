florida real estate quick hits if youre planning to buy a home do it now because prices are going up for the next few years investments in singlefamily rental properties have good potential more quick hits if youre planning to buy a home do it now because prices are going up for the next few years investments in singlefamily rental properties have good potential in broward county apartment developments have the best potential in miamidade mortgages have higher risk even though prices are rising best bets for investments in retail or restaurants are in palm beach county which also needs medical office space with a large number of second homes and condos south florida is prone to boom and bust cycles that stem more from investment hopes than housing needs add an expanding latino population and waves of babyboomers  two million retiring every year  and you get both risks and opportunities demand for florida housing is always growing but is it growing slower or faster than the supply the percentage of second homes increases as you head north from miami to  percent in palm beach county this large pool of empty properties is the swing vote in home prices it can swamp supply during a downturn but also represents the desire of future retirees  and south american investors  to buy while they can getty the economy of miami itself is diversified  with an important finance sector  but as you go up the coast more jobs are in retail and services healthcare is the largest creator of jobs in all three counties and growing rapidly home prices were strong in the last three years  up  percent  and i expect theyll keep rising  percent a year but how much of that  percent was from speculation in foreclosed condos how much from real demand there are strong reasons to believe that from here on we are looking at prices going higher than they should  especially in broward county  in other words a miniboom that will fizzle after a few years if youre looking to buy for the longterm do it now if youre looking for a shortterm investment be very very careful because rents held up better than home prices during the recession buying a property to rent out is an attractive option despite the recent rise in prices less so in palm beach county more so in miamidade and broward almost half of households in miami are renters with most the new healthcare and retail jobs paying low wages the renting population will increase in urban areas it makes sense to buy a singlefamily house and split it into rental units apartment buildings are a good option in miami  at the right price mortgages are a difficult investment right now because home prices will keep rising the next few years the equity cushion for new mortgages will grow quickly on the other hand prices are almost too high in broward and miamidade already which means these mortgages will have a rising risk of default just because the last bust is over doesnt mean a new one isnt around the corner lenders should back away from high loantovalue mortgages during this period the same is true for construction loans new projects should be financed in very careful stages population is growing at an uneven pace slower in miami faster as you move up the coast over the next three years i expect a  percent increase in housing needs in palm beach county   owner properties and  apartments i expect  of each in broward and in miami  houses and  apartments the climate for investments in retail businesses and restaurants is best in palm beach county where demand has grown quickly the last two years and average income is the highest all three counties but especially palm beach will need office space for the growing number of healthcare workers less real estate resources for fort myersnaples fl nearby
