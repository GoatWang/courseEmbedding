about our firm  underhill investment management llc about our firm underhill investment management underhill investment management llc is an employeeowned sec registered investment advisory firm underhill manages separate accounts in which we implement longonly investment strategies underhill manages individual and institutional accounts including corporate pension and profit sharing plans charitable foundations and academic endowments the principals of underhill investment management founded in  have a combined investment experience of more than  years in both bull and bear markets they have managed investments for hundreds of portfolios and researched hundreds of mostly american companies across many industries as potential investments all this experience is brought to bear on opportunities amidst the issues of the st century in a focused collaborative research effort   underhill investment management principals the principals of underhill investment management are roland underhill principal managing director michael tannenbaum managing director benjamin miller managing director and bonnie g george chief operating officer roland benjamin and michael act as a team that collaboratively researches mainly domestic common stocks and bonds   registration does not imply a certain level of skill or training sell discipline  underhill investment management llc sell discipline most investors if asked would say that knowing when to sell is much more difficult than knowing when to buy we agree we have defined criteria for selling although we retain conviction in owning great companies for long periods of time despite what happened to stocks in the s the s and in the severe downdraft of  there are numerous companies whose earnings streams have expanded powerfully over decades and have made large amounts of money for their long term shareholders despite our wish to reduce risk and to avoid loss of principal we remind investors that being largely in cash is a terrible way to face the prospect of the risk of inflation that will likely be the result of the enormous jumps in government deficit spending and the expansion of the monetary base by the federal reserve under similar circumstances cash became worthless in s germany the value of the  us dollar is about  cents we therefore remain advocates of owning important amounts of equities notwithstanding the need to hold a prudent degree of other liquid assets whether it is bonds or other liquid short term assets nonetheless there are times to sell stocks certainly stocks of companies in more cyclical industries need to be trimmed or sold when times are ebullient and such stocks have one of their typical cyclical big advances in earnings otherwise like sisyphus it will be the investors fate to push the descended stone back up the hill again industries such as autos housing steel mining and chemicals fit this category normally we have only limited exposure to companies in these fields because they do not generally possess the investment criteria we seek for example sustainably strong roic or operating margins high barriers to entry and lots of free cash flow among other things are not found abundantly in these industries stocks can become overpriced just as they can occasionally become undervalued for long periods of time we do not concern ourselves if a stock we like experiences modest overvaluation a  overvaluation does not bother us much to exit a stock for a short time and to try to reenter a few points lower is too much like trading and cannot be done consistently by anyone we know on the other hand when a stock is discounting earnings expectations several years into the future or where the pe ratio is substantially higher than its historical range we may cut back the position materially or completely exit the stock then sometimes our judgment is just plain faulty and we have to admit a mistake was made in the initial analysis and decision to invest this tends to happen where the research we have done missed some important consideration or we missed a change in competitive conditions in such instances we will cut our losses to live for another day of course sometimes we come up with a new idea that is better than something we already own we footnote this discussion with the statement that in decades of investing the opportunity cost of exiting stocks too early has far outdistanced the losses sustained in owning stocks that simply went down after we invested patience is still a necessary ingredient of successful investing underhills investment process  underhill investment management llc the investment process portfolio managers are research analysts we do not have a typical investment management industry hierarchical structure of portfolio managers supported by a layer of junior analysts that do most of the actual research work visiting the companies and reporting back to headquarters too many things are lost in the handoff in such a structure in which the portfolio manager never gets his hands dirty such structures are frequently seen as necessary in large or even medium sized investment management companies how else can they try to stay on top of 0 companies they seem to think are necessary for proper diversification it is not the quantity of researchers that lead to good performance otherwise the large investment managers would have the best numbers clearly that is not the case there is no correlation between size of an investment organization and results research driven over the last several decades the portfolio managers at underhill investment management have examined hundreds of companies we make sure we visit most of the companies we own many on a regular basis and of course we supplement this coverage with phone calls conference calls and by attending investment conferences and various trade shows visiting companies and getting to know their people gives us a better understanding of the company and allows the management of the company to gradually become more comfortable with us we also develop our own detailed financial models on each holding over the years we have built extensive rolodexes of contacts across various industries as well as long relationships with a number of especially outstanding analysts on wall street who we utilize as sanity checks concentrated portfolios we concentrate our clients investment monies and do not overdiversify it has been shown that once a portfolio of common stocks gets much beyond  or so companies without having more than one stock in any industry adding one position reduces risk from concentration by less than  focusing on three or four handfuls of stocks allows us to know our companies better we believe overdiversification is a major cause of mediocre performance long time horizon when we find a truly great company we tend to hold the stock for a very long time thereby giving management the years to fully exploit its competitive advantages and allowing the magic of compounding to impact the portfolio for several years or more some of our holdings we started to buy in the last century investment criteria our  and  investment criteria in importance are high barriers to entry and a durable competitive advantage usually you dont get one without the other a distinct competitive leg up may come in many forms from proprietary oneofakind products to a superior distribution set up to low cost producer status but it is nearly always accompanied by or leads to a high barrier to entry and the ideal of most businesses  limited competition such a situation will not last long if the barriers to entry fall and the competitive advantages erode other important criteria include        openended growing markets        a leadership brand franchise like heinz in catsup coca cola in soft drinks or fritolay in snack foods        being first into a market like federal express        a long time proven track record        cash flow well in excess of capital spending        the ability to selffinance growth        management that allocates capital well and that owns goodly amounts of the stock or whose compensation is highly dependent on growing earnings        consistently above average returns on invested capital and operating margins        pricing power of the companys products      little or no debt      a rising dividend margin of safety the key to our pricing discipline our pricing discipline is based on the standard margin of safety concept which ben graham and warren buffett among many other successful investors have called amongst the most important ideas in investing margin of safety is our key to pricing discipline in buying low and also in reducing risk by margin of safety we mean a cushion or discount should exist between our assessment of fair or intrinsic value and what is paid for a stock we believe a major cause of mediocre performance is not just poor stock selection but investing in otherwise terrific companies at high or nonbargain prices gains from holding some very good companies thus become average unless the stocks are bought at those rare times such as the mids   0  etc when great company stocks become a bargain anyone knows that pepsico proctor  gamble and schlumberger are fine companies but the question is when to buy them the traditional stock pricing mechanism in our business is to project earnings  years into the future good luck and then discount those earnings by a chosen discount percentage to arrive at a valuation one is willing to pay for a stock a terminal value is also assumed this approach involves too many estimates and too many guesses in our opinion historically earnings multiples tend to eventually approximate the return on invested capital roic of a particular company the purchase of a highgrade stock at a discount to the roic thus tends to greatly reduce the risk of common stock investing via taking advantage of a temporary mispricing this approach takes historic roic and requires an earnings multiple at a discount the larger the better return on invested capital is merely net income after taxes divided by the total of long term debt plus common and preferred equity this methodology uses primarily historic and audited numbers not much in the way of guesswork such a margin of safety doesnt guarantee success but we believe it greatly reduces market risk and enlarges appreciation potential downloadable documents  underhill investment management llc fact sheet for underhill investment management llc

investment management llc form adv part a underhill investment management llc form adv part b underhills investment philosophy  underhill investment management llc our investment philosophy our singular devotion to traditional investment in stocks and bonds means that we exclude all sorts of other lately popular and exotic vehicles such as venture capital private equity commodities and derivatives the portfolios of our various clients will have a large number of stocks in common but the portfolios are nevertheless tailored according to our clients specific objectives income requirements and risk profiles with this careful traditional philosophy practiced for many years we are steadfast and accomplished in our endeavor to deliver long term value for our clients the seven cornerstones of the underhill investment philosophy allcapitalization we are an allcap manager tending to shift our emphasis to where we find value be it large mid or small capitalization companies being an allcap manager we do not confine our investments to boxes like large cap growth or small cap value that may become overpriced for long periods of time garp we describe ourselves as garp investors growth at a reasonable price we are growth oriented but we do not buy growth stocks at any price just because the story is exciting the latter approach has been tried and found wanting a great deal of performance derives from keeping the price one pays for a stock the denominator low by doing that the numerator the amount the stock can appreciate has more potential upside keeping the denominator low also reduces quantitative or market risk more on that topic will be discussed in a later section we are not so doctrinaire toward growth stocks that we dont occasionally buy socalled value stocks or depressed cyclical companies stocks when the price is right and we can see change coming concentrated since we focus on  above average american companies we can find at our price we can afford to be very selective using only our best ideas we do not have to reach for marginal ideas in order to fill out a portfolio we can be quite selective by focusing our research on a few outstanding companies we can spend the time to know our portfolio companies well we believe managers of overdiversified mutual funds or portfolios with 0 stocks have an almost impossible job keeping up with that many companies while simultaneously researching new ideas low turnover our turnover is low because our holding period is generally several years high turnover of 0 is also typical of many managers and makes focusing on any one company very difficult such high turnover results in excessive commissions and frictional costs that tend to erode capital and performance although traditional buy and hold investing has not been a reliable strategy over the past few years it has stood the test of time for most of the last 0 years it is a strategy we understand and with which we are comfortable stockpickers we are old fashioned bottom up stock pickers in that we use fundamental research which relies mostly on our own work and network of contacts we visit and speak with various companies around the country and their respective competitors suppliers and customers we are not market timers nor are we top down thinkers although we do pay attention to the macroeconomic picture and particularly now to shifts in government regulation historically market timing has performed poorly verses individual stock selection to exit markets adroitly and to reenter on a timely basis is an ideal that is rarely accomplished however many american fortunes including the majority of those in the forbes 00 have been achieved by buying and holding a few great companies for many years quality holdings typically our top holdings have an average return on capital net income divided by the total of long term debt and shareholders equity of over  and an average operating profit margin in the high teens well over half of our portfolio companies have little or no debt we have saved our clients a lot of money over the years by avoiding companies with leveraged or complicated balance sheets another advantage of closely following a few outstanding companies capital preservation our highest investment priority is to preserve capital that is not to dent principal as it can take years of growth to make up a year or two of negative results of course we want to build capital over time which we seek to do by not overpaying for a few outstanding companies we seek to identify superbly managed unique businesses with limited competition sound balance sheets usually debtfree or nearly so and plenty of free cash flow that retain their edge over the competition we like companies with proven track records durably high returns on capital high barriers to entry and the kind of management with which you would enjoy working with this careful approach practiced for many years we hope to outperform the general market averages not every year but more often than not and certainly in the  year time frame no one not even warren buffett outperforms the market every year but to do it over time is our incessant goal when available at reasonable or bargain prices such firms as described above provide the core of a portfolio that becomes a long term weapon in what the legendary ef hutton
