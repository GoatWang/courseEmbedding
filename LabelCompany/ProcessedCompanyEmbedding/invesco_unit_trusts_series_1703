more  kb fund documents prospectus and fund reports fact sheet  about risk changing fixed income market conditions risk the current historically low interest rate environment was created in part by the federal reserve board frb and certain foreign central banks keeping the federal funds and equivalent foreign rates at or near zero there is a risk that interest rates will rise when the frb and central banks raise these rates this risk is heightened due to the completion of the frbs quantitative easing program and the tapering of other similar foreign central bank actions this eventual increase in the federal funds and equivalent foreign rates may expose fixed income markets to heightened volatility and reduced liquidity for certain fixed income investments particularly those with longer maturities in addition decreases in fixed income dealer marketmaking capacity may also potentially lead to heightened volatility and reduced liquidity in the fixed income markets as a result the value of the funds investments and share price may decline changes in central bank policies could also result in higher than normal shareholder redemptions which could potentially increase portfolio turnover and the funds transaction costs debt securities risk the prices of debt securities held by the fund will be affected by changes in interest rates the creditworthiness of the issuer and other factors an increase in prevailing interest rates typically causes the value of existing debt securities to fall and often has a greater impact on longerduration debt securities and higher quality debt securities falling interest rates will cause the fund to reinvest the proceeds of debt securities that have been repaid by the issuer at lower interest rates falling interest rates may also reduce the funds distributable income because interest payments on floating rate debt instruments held by the fund will decline the fund could lose money on investments in debt securities if the issuer or borrower fails to meet its obligations to make interest payments andor to repay principal in a timely manner changes in an issuers financial strength the markets perception of such strength or in the credit rating of the issuer or the security may affect the value of debt securities the advisers credit analysis may fail to anticipate such changes which could result in buying a debt security at an inopportune time or failing to sell a debt security in advance of a price decline or other credit event derivatives risk the value of a derivative instrument depends largely on and is derived from the value of an underlying security currency commodity interest rate index or other asset each referred to as an underlying asset in addition to risks relating to the underlying assets the use of derivatives may include other possibly greater risks including counterparty leverage and liquidity risks counterparty risk is the risk that the counterparty to the derivative contract will default on its obligation to pay the fund the amount owed or otherwise perform under the derivative contract derivatives create leverage risk because they do not require payment up front equal to the economic exposure created by owning the derivative as a result an adverse change in the value of the underlying asset could result in the fund sustaining a loss that is substantially greater than the amount invested in the derivative which may make the funds returns more volatile and increase the risk of loss derivative instruments may also be less liquid than more traditional investments and the fund may be unable to sell or close out its derivative positions at a desirable time or price this risk may be more acute under adverse market conditions during which the fund may be most in need of liquidating its derivative positions derivatives may also be harder to value less tax efficient and subject to changing government regulation that could impact the funds ability to use certain derivatives or their cost also derivatives used for hedging or to gain or limit exposure to a particular market segment may not provide the expected benefits particularly during adverse market conditions indexing risk the fund is operated as a passively managed index fund and therefore the adverse performance of a particular security necessarily will not result in the elimination of the security from the funds portfolio ordinarily the adviser will not sell the funds portfolio securities except to reflect additions or deletions of the securities that comprise the index or as may be necessary to raise cash to pay fund shareholders who sell fund shares as such the fund will be negatively affected by declines in the securities represented by the index also there is no guarantee that the adviser will be able to correlate the funds performance with that of the index inflationindexed securities risk the values of inflationindexed securities generally fluctuate in response to changes in real interest rates and the funds income from its investments in these securities is likely to fluctuate considerably more than the income distributions of its investments in more traditional fixedincome securities inflationindexed securities tax risk any increase in the principal amount of an inflationindexed security may be included for tax purposes in the funds gross income even though no cash attributable to such gross income has been received by the fund in such event the fund may be required to make annual distributions to shareholders that exceed the cash it has otherwise received in order to pay such distributions the fund may be required to raise cash by selling portfolio investments the sale of such investments could result in capital gains to the fund and additional capital gain distributions to shareholders in addition adjustments during the taxable year for deflation to an inflationindexed bond held by the fund may cause amounts previously distributed to shareholders in the taxable year as income to be characterized as a return of capital market risk the market values of the funds investments and therefore the value of the funds shares will go up and down sometimes rapidly or unpredictably market risk ma y affect a single issuer industry or section of the economy or it may affect the market as a whole individual stock prices tend to go up and down more dramatically than those of certain other types of investments such as bonds during a general downturn in the financial markets multiple asset classes may decline in value when markets perform well there can be no assurance that specific investments held by the fund will rise in value sampling risk the funds use of a representative sampling approach will result in its holding a smaller number of securities than are in the index and in the fund holding securities not included in the index as a result an adverse development respecting an issuer of securities held by the fund could result in a greater decline in the funds nav than would be the case if all of the securities in the index were held the funds use of a representative sampling approach may also include the risk that it may not track the return of the index as well as it would have if the fund held all of the securities in the index us government obligations risk obligations of us government agencies and authorities receive varying levels of support and may not be backed by the full faith and credit of the us government which could affect the funds ability to recover should they default no assurance can be given that the us government will provide financial support to its agencies and authorities if it is not obligated by law to do so whenissued delayed delivery and forward commitment risks whenissued and delayed delivery transactions subject the fund to market risk because the value or yield of a security at delivery may be more or less than the purchase price or yield generally available when delivery occurs and counterparty risk because the fund relies on the buyer or seller as the case may be to consummate the transaction these transactions also have a leveraging effect on the fund because the fund commits to purchase securities that it does not have to pay for until a later date which increases the funds overall investment exposure and as a result its volatility as of
