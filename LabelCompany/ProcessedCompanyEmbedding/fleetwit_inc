subheadings and the rest of the content on the pagefleetwitcom currently has  html header tags each page should have one and only one h tag use keywords in your headings with your most important keywords in the top level and be sure to maintain the h to h hierarchywhile it is important to ensure every page has an h tag only include more than one per page if youre using html instead use multiple h  h tags add the important keywords in h headings alt attribute medium impact easy to solve no images with missing alt attributes were found  alternative text allows you to add a description to an image since search engine crawlers cannot see images they rely on alternative text attributes to determine relevance to a search query alternative text also helps makes an image more likely to appear in a google image search and is used by screen readers to provide context for visually impaired usersit looks like most or all of your images have alternative text check the images on your

write more content broken links high impact easy to solve no broken links were found on this web page  broken links send users to nonexistent web pages they hurt a sites usability and reputation which impacts seofortunately your page doesnt contain any broken links be proactive in checking your pages to make sure they dont have any broken links fix or delete broken links  www resolve high impact easy to solve warning no  redirects are in place to redirect traffic to your preferred domain pages that load successfully both with and without www are treated as duplicate content  search engines see wwwfleetwitcom and fleetwitcom as two different websites with the same content this causes them to see a lot of duplicate content which they dont likeright now your website is not directing traffic to wwwfleetwitcom and fleetwitcom to the same url it is crucial that you fix thisset a preferred domain in google search console and use a  redirect to divert traffic from your secondary domain redirect nonwww to www  robotstxt medium impact easy to solve missing  a robotstxt file allows you to restrict the access of search engine crawlers to prevent them from accessing specific pages or directories they also point the web crawler to your page’s xml sitemap filewe checked fleetwitcomrobotstxt didnt find a robotstxt file use google search console to submit and test your robottxt file you can also test individual pages to make sure google isnt crawling any restricted files add a robotstxt file  xml sitemap medium impact easy to solve missing  we checked fleetwitcom but couldnt find an xml sitemapxml sitemaps contain the list of your urls that are available to index and allows the search engines to read your pages more intelligently they can also include information like your site’s latest updates frequency of changes and the importance of urlsyour site is currently missing an xml sitemap we recommend you generate one for your site and submit it through both google search console and bing webmaster tools normally your xml sitemap would be found at fleetwitcomsitemapmake sure to only include the pages you want search engines to crawl so leave out any that have been blocked in a robotstxt file avoid using any urls that cause redirects or error codes and be consistent in using your preferred urls with or without www correct protocols http vs https and trailing slashes you should also use your robotstxt file to point search engine crawlers to the location of your sitemap add and optimize your xml sitemap url parameters good the urls look clean  url parameters are used to track user behaviors on site session ids traffic sources referrer ids or to give users control over the content on the page sorting and filtering the issue with url parameters is that google sees each unique parameter value as a new url hosting the same thing  meaning you could have a duplicate content problem sometimes it’s able to recognize these urls and group them together it then algorithmically decides which url is the best representation of the group and uses it to consolidate ranking signals and display in search results you can help google recognize the best url by using the rel”canonical” taguse the url parameters tool in google search console to tell google how your url parameters affect page content and how to to crawl urls with parameters use this tool very carefully  you can easily prevent google from crawling pages you want indexed through overly restrictive crawling settings especially if you have urls with multiple parameters rewrite your urls and clean them up underscores in the urls low impact hard to solve great you are not using ‪underscores theseareunderscores in your urls  great you arent using ‪underscores
