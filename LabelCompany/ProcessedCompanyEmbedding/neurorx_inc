peerreviewed and published results from two phase ii clinical studies have demonstrated a significant decline in symptoms of depression following administration of dcycloserine one of the active

more than a  reduction in symptoms of depression and a  reduction in suicidal ideation when ketamine and dcycloserine were added to their treatment regimen the therapeutic effect for these patients was sustained for eight weeks or longer   findings from the other study were published in the international journal of neuropsychopharmacology in  these trial results provided the first proof of concept evidence that high doses of dcycloserine induce antidepressant effects and reduces the severity of major depressive disorder   additionally preclinical data showing that the combination of lurasidone and other hta antagonists and dcycloserine led to a significant reduction in akathisia compared to control and to lurasidone alone these findings are described in detail in several us and

depression news provided by neurorx inc jan    et share this article san francisco jan   prnewswire  biotech showcase at the jp morgan healthcare conference neurorx a clinical stage biopharma company developing the first oral therapy for acute suicidal ideation and behavior asib in bipolar depression has received fda clearance to proceed with its phase b study protocol under an investigational new drug ind application and is now enrolling study sites for its clinical trial of nrx  the clinical trial details of which are posted on wwwclinicaltrialsgov seeks to demonstrate that nrx is safe and effective in maintaining remission from asib and depression following initial stabilization with ketamine nrx is a fixed dose combination of dcycloserine a glycine site nmda antagonist and lurasidone a hta antagonist  the mass general clinical trials network and institute will provide leadership for the clinical trial and prof andrew nierenberg md director of bipolar research in the department of psychiatry at massachusetts general hospital will serve as the studys principal investigator  initial study sites will be posted shortly nrx is the first oral drug to target asib a lifethreatening condition that kills more than  americans a day and over  worldwide  today there is no approved medicine to treat increased suicidal ideation ssrisnris bear a warning about the risk of potential for increased suicidal ideation  the current standard of care as published by the american psychiatric association consists of voluntary or forced admission to a psychiatric hospital and electroconvulsive therapy ect  although ect is associated with a decrease in suicide deaths it requires  –  sessions of general anesthesia and is known to cause memory loss and confusion ketamine – a potent nmda blocker  is used offlabel for treatment resistant depression and suicidal ideation but is known to cause hallucinations and other dissociative side effects recently released information on intranasal ketamine additionally showed a  incidence of vomiting last month the fda issued a warning about neurotoxicity associated with prolonged or repeated use of ketamine particularly in those under  years of age and pregnant women  neurorx recently completed a preclinical study in which nrx showed no detectable neurotoxicity at any of the studied doses meeting the requirement of at least a fold safety margin of the maximum human dose in the latest issue of the american journal of psychiatry information published by dr joshua kantrowitz and colleagues at the new york state psychiatric institute nyspi showed that the neurochemical ie biomarker effect of nrx can be evaluated using magnetic resonance spectroscopy to observe the levels of glutamateglutamine glx in the brain  this noninvasive technique akin to the mri that is familiar to the public has previously shown that patients with severe depression have markedly reduced levels of glx in the brain  ect has been associated with increased glx levels in those who experience clinical remission from depression  comparable effects have not been seen with traditional ssri antidepressants  these findings in aggregate make glx a potentially a promising biomarker to monitor the effect of nrx kantrowitz and colleagues reported that dcycloserine a component of nrx was shown to raise brain glx levels in normal volunteers  this effect has similarly been demonstrated with ketamine suggesting that drugs which target the brains nmda pathway unlike ssri antidepressants may achieve some of the beneficial effects of ect without the undesirable side effects of ect such as memory loss  in addition to the pivotal study just announced ongoing studies will explore the effect of nrx on brain glx to demonstrate a biomarker effect

class of drugs targeted towards rapidly reducing symptoms of depression and suicidality in patients with bipolar disorder and maintaining that effect over time the peerreviewed open label study in  patients elements of which were published today in the journal of clinical psychiatry demonstrated a  reduction in symptoms of depression and a  reduction in suicidality in patients with treatmentresistant bipolar depression while the use of ketamine for rapid reversal of depression is known though not yet approved by fda its effect is known to be shortlived this is the first clinical report showing that the ketamine effect can potentially be sustained for two months with additional agents elements of this study were presented earlier at the american college of neuropsychopharmacology despite extensive evidence that  to  of those with bipolar depression attempt suicide and far too many succeed there is currently no fdaapproved treatment for active suicidality in bipolar depression said jonathan javitt md mph ceo javitt has previously been instrumental in developing highimpact drugs for merck pfizer pharmacia and allergan and was appointed by presidents clinton and bush to serve as a white house healthcare advisor an fdaapproved treatment for bipolar depression with suicidality would address a critical unmet medical need and would bring hope to both patients and their loved ones around the world said wayne pines a former associate commissioner of the us food and drug administration fda the study was authored by drs kantrowitz halberstam and gangwisch who were neither funded by nor associated with neurorx as stated by the authors these findings provide proofofconcept for further study of combined treatment with nmdar antagonists and fdaapproved medications for bipolar depression unlike most conventional antidepressant drugs which target the brains serotonin pathway ketamine and dcycloserine target the brain nmda receptor a receptor first characterized by the inventor prof daniel javitt md phd in conjunction with psychiatric illness in  and characterized over  years of academic research neurorx inc is pioneering a staged treatment approach in which ketamine administration is followed by a combination of dcycloserine and an fdaapproved mood stabilizer in order to maintain the ketamine effect the combination is trademarked cyclurad™ by the company and was described in a patent application filed in  this is the second peerreviewed human study in which dcycloserine has shown a statisticallysignificant antidepressant effect but the first to use this compound to as a followon to ketamine these firstinman data are very encouraging  if these findings can be confirmed in a larger scale study cyclurad could if approved by fda potentially achieve important benefits for people with bipolar depression and suicidality said chaim hurvitz a founding investor and director of neurorx the study was registered on clintrialsgov the results describe an investigational therapy that is not currently marketed for human use the individual elements of the treatment consist of drugs approved by fda for other indications and that are being investigated for use in bipolar depression and suicidality the next step is a larger scale clinical trial about bipolar depression  more than  million americans have bipolar depression sometimes known as manic depression a subset of whom have active suicidality those with bipolar depression are more than twice as likely to commit suicide compared with patients who have other forms of depression between  and  will attempt suicide at some point in their lives overall patients with treatment resistant depression from all causes cost the

combines dcycloserine an nmethyldaspartate nmda receptor modulator and lurasidone a hta receptor antagonist peerreviewed and published results from two phase ii clinical studies demonstrate a significant decline in symptoms of depression and suicidality following administration of dcycloserine findings from one of these studies found that bipolar patients who were already receiving a hta
