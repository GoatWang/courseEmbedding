disclosure obligations so that we remain in good standing with the state of nevada and maintain our status as a reporting issuer with the sec we operate in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties modernizing existing wells and marketing oil that is produced the majority of our competitors possess and employ financial technical and personnel resources substantially greater than ours which can be particularly important in the areas in which we plan to operate those companies may be able to pay more for productive properties and exploratory prospects and to evaluate bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial resources permit our ability to acquire additional prospects and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment also there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and natural gas industry current competitive factors in the domestic oil and gas industry are unique the actual price range of crude oil is largely established by major international producers pricing for natural gas is more regional however more favorable prices can usually be negotiated for larger quantities of oil andor gas product in this respect while we believe we have a price disadvantage when compared to larger producers we view our primary pricing risk to be related to a potential decline in international prices to a level which could render our production uneconomical we will be committed to use the services of the existing gathering companies in our present area of production this potentially gives such gathering companies certain shortterm relative monopolistic powers to set gathering and transportation costs because obtaining the services of an alternative gathering company may require substantial additional costs general competitive conditions may be substantially affected by various forms of energy legislation andor regulation introduced from time to time by the governments of the united states and other countries as well as factors beyond our control including international political conditions overall levels of supply and demand for oil and gas and the markets for synthetic fuels and alternative energy sources in the face of competition we may not be successful in acquiring exploring or developing profitable oil and gas properties or interests and we cannot give any assurance that suitable properties or interests will be available for our acquisition exploration or development despite this we hope to compete successfully in the industry by  keeping our costs low  relying on the strength of our managements contacts and  using our size and experience to our advantage by adapting quickly to changing market conditions or responding swiftly to potential opportunities company description we are an exploration stage
