report business and plan of operation extract pharmaceuticals inc the company or the issuer was organized under the laws of the state of delaware on march   under the name pacific media group enterprises inc the company was established as part of the implementation of the chapter  plan of reorganization of pacific shores development inc psd psd had been in the residential real estate development business and the predecessor of the issuer was a subsidiary of psd operating as an inhouse advertising agency to plan and create advertising and media planning and buying for its parent psd under psds plan of reorganization the company was incorporated to  receive and own the interest which psd had in the advertising business and  issue shares of its common stock to psds creditors in order to enhance the debtors distribution to its creditors management of psd agreed to use its best efforts to develop an active business within the company and to have the shares publicly traded on the overthecounter bulletin board market in order to provide an opportunity for liquidity to the creditors the company entered the mobile app business and became a reporting issuer in partial fulfillment of that commitment to the court and creditors subsequent to march   the name of the corporation and its business direction changed as discussed in footnote note  subsequent events of the footnotes to our financial statements in december  we completed initial development of the android version of our first mobile app and during the three months ended march   we worked on the ios version of that app as of march   the ios version was still not complete and therefore no marketing efforts had been undertaken and no revenues were realized further we did not anticipate any revenues until at the earliest late in calendar  this was because our plan was to offer the service free until such time as there was a substantial volume of users only at that point would we begin to charge the professional service providers for our service because of the long lead time to first revenues and the high cost of marketing the app the company decided on april   to pursue a different business direction as discussed in footnote note  subsequent events of the footnotes to our financial statements liquidity and capital resources as of march   we had assets of  and we had liabilities of  and

were for professional general and administrative expenses for the three months ended march   these totaled  and for the nine months ended march   these totaled  we had no revenues during the period in the three and nine months ended march   we had no expenses and no revenue our increase in liabilities from  at march   to  at march   was the result of general and administrative expenses arising from our registration as a reporting issuer with the sec and our setup with a licensed stock transfer agent we will in all likelihood sustain continued operating expenses without corresponding revenues until at least the fourth quarter of  until then we will continue to depend upon officers and directors to make loans to the company to meet any costs that may occur all such advances will be interestfree results of operations the company has not yet realized any revenues or earnings from operations however as noted above it incurs ongoing expenses related to its sec registration and status as a reporting issuer we completed development of the android version of our first mobile app in december  and during the three months ended march   we concentrated on developing the ios version of our first app all such efforts have since been abandoned and the companys future results will be based on its efforts to develop a chewing gum product for delivery of medicinal cannabis oils going concern the accompanying financial statements are presented on a going concern basis the companys financial condition raises substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a
