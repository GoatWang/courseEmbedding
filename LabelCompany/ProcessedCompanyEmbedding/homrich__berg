you to translate your financial planning goals and longterm cash flow analysis into an investment plan designed to put you on the track toward your unique goals the homrich berg investment committee with over  years of combined wealth management experience debates key investment strategy issues and recommends changes for investment strategies  the conversation starts with asset allocation and then moves to active vs passive manager selection and monitoring  these biweekly meetings are the culmination of the ongoing processes that drive the investment policies of the firm hb has a dedicated internal investments team not outsourced led by our chief investment officer that focuses on providing updates to the firm and clients on each asset class and the key issues affecting portfolios  the firm also provides commentaries and updates on portfolio allocation movements to clients in addition to traditional investments in each asset class many families utilize alternative investments funds and strategies generally not always available to the average retail investor to pursue additional diversification and potentially superior returns  hb has staff dedicated to sourcing analyzing and performing due diligence related to traditional and alternative investments  our status as a firm managing over  billion in assets helps us gain access to offerings from the institutional brand names as well as smaller niche players  we often push down the fees andor minimum investment levels for these investments and in some cases create pooled access fund vehicles to allow investors access to a diversified portfolio of alternative investments with of course no additional fee paid to hb so what does this mean for your portfolio and how we manage risks for you  your hb client service team will translate the firm’s investment perspectives to provide an investment strategy that can be aligned with your goals your tolerance for risk and our outlook for the financial markets  over time we will discuss the portfolio performance with you and discuss how your changing financial situation and plan goals may lead to potential changes in your investment strategy we always emphasize diversification as a critical part of managing risk  from our experience we believe that wealth is often created or lost by being highly concentrated – and preserved by being diversified  correlations between asset types and individual investments are evaluated as part of the overall portfolio strategy in order to manage volatility risk via diversification  we measure performance against benchmarks both on total return and volatility with a goal of providing higher returns and less volatility  hb has a long history of using a wide range of investments beyond basic stocks and bonds in order to achieve client goals rebalancing is also a key risk management tool and rebalancing of portfolios is managed on an ongoing basis with the aid of our internal software that monitors each allocation

comprehensive wealth management offerings in order to include bill pay services management of multiple houses and boats and aircraft and unique family governance and family education services many firms claim to be a “multifamily office” firm but may not have the true experience serving families at this depth of assistance  the key is not a certain level of assets but an appreciation for this

management call us  infohomrichbergcom browse or search website home  how to select an advisor how to select an advisor selecting a financial advisor is a very important decision  every client has a unique situation and needs but there are some good basic questions that you should consider when talking to potential advisors  we have provided our answers to these questions here and we encourage you to talk more with us about these questions or any others you may have compensation and conflicts will you manage my assets using the fiduciary or suitability standard homrich berg operates under the fiduciary standard meaning that we must put your interests first period homrich berg operates under the fiduciary standard meaning that we must put your interests first period  many brokers only operate under the suitability standard meaning that they can recommend an investment and accept financial incentives for that investment from the manager as long as the recommendation they are making is “suitable” for you not necessarily in your best interest but suitable this is a huge distinction that many people do not realize and we believe this is one key reason many longtime clients of brokerage firms and banks consider moving to a fiduciary independent advisor are you fee only or just fee based what about commissions or other payments homrich berg is fee only not fee based we are only paid by our clients homrich berg is fee only not fee based  we are only paid by our clients  most clients pay a fee calculated as a percentage of the assets we manage  some firms charge fees in a similar way…but then also collect commissions mutual fund fees incentive fees or other side payments from other business services leading them to call themselves “feebased”  some brokerage firms will try to tell you that their service “is not as expensive as those independent firms where you have to pay a fee” but they do not tell you that can often end up paying even more in commissions and mutual fund fees and hidden incentive payments – but you may not see that number anywhere on your monthly statements does your firm sell products or services besides wealth management some firms sell insurance mortgages accounting services estate planning legal services andor investment banking services some firms sell insurance mortgages accounting services estate planning legal services andor investment banking services  homrich berg does none of the above we believe this makes it easier for us to be your unbiased advisor across all parts of your financial life basic firm information does your firm offer investment management and financial planning expertise some firms focus mostly on planning as their true focus area while other firms are mostly asset managers focused on investments but not really helping their clients with their entire financial life some firms focus mostly on planning as their true focus area while other firms are mostly asset managers focused on investments but not really helping their clients with their entire financial life  homrich berg believes in the importance of combining both into one complete level of service for our clients and invests in

succession plan in place with a large staff that ensures continuity over time for your family  some firms have only been around a few years or have teams of people who have jumped around from firm to firm over time  we believe our longterm financial strength and growth through many ups and downs of the financial markets should give you comfort in our ability to work with your family for many years to come who owns your firm hb is owned by its principals we feel this independence allows us to focus on you as clients with our longterm strategy and investments hb is owned by its principals we feel this independence allows us to focus on you as clients with our longterm strategy and investments investments approach what is your approach to investing this is a lengthy discussion and we have a brochure solely focused on this topic this is a lengthy discussion and we have a brochure solely focused on this topic  key areas you should discuss with your potential advisor should include their thoughts on diversification asset allocation manager selection active vs passive strategies manager monitoring rebalancing and risk management  who is making the investment decisions and how often do they meet  how do they define investment success  how do they handle the ups and downs of financial markets  how do they judge whether they are successful or not  do they focus on tax implications and estate implications when building your plan  this is a good topic to spend some time reviewing in detail with your potential advisor does your firm have a dedicated investments staff many firms have their principals also doing the investment strategy many firms have their principals also doing the investment strategy  at hb we have a dedicated investment staff focused solely on investments research every day not on serving clients  but we mix in the client perspective and the experience of our partners by having both groups on our investment committee that makes our investment decisions do you use a third party custodian this is a critical question that should always be asked most independent firms like homrich berg will use a third party custodian like charles schwab or fidelity this is a critical question that should always be asked  most independent firms like homrich berg will use a third party custodian like charles schwab or fidelity  this provides you as the client an independent way to verify your assets outside of reports from your advisor the client relationship can you show me a consolidated performance report for all my investments some firms will send you monthly or quarterly account balance information but not true total return performance data some firms will send you monthly or quarterly account balance information but not true total return performance data  other firms may give you an overall portfolio view but no details on how individual managers or funds are performing vs benchmarks or what is driving your overall performance  hb gives you online access to your entire portfolio at any time with updated values net of fees and expenses who will work with me how big will my client service team be at hb you will typically have  people on your client service team and the culture of our firm is for the entire firm to serve you as a client at hb you will typically have  people on your client service team and the culture of our firm is for the entire firm to serve you as a client  some firms with sales oriented cultures do not really share ideas between teams and may be financially motivated not to get more people involved in serving you as a client  that is not our approach – we believe in a team approach will i feel comfortable with your team personal fit is important to us and we try to align our new clients with the best potential fit for their personality and needs among our hb team members personal fit is important to us and we try to align our new clients with the best potential fit for their personality and

we are comfortable working with your existing attorneys accountants insurance advisors and other key members of your overall advisory team  when appropriate we can help you find a new advisor if you

 million assets in its early years to approximately  billion the company ranks first on atlanta business chronicle’s  list of the top  national association of personal financial advisors feeonly investment advisers and th on the top  list of financial planning and advisory firms with clients in  states the firm has stayed true to its founding mission of providing objective feeonly financial planning and investment management services without relying on the sale of financial products for commissions “there were plenty of firms out there that were offering financial planning and investment advice but it was all tied to the sale of financial products and therefore there was an inherent conflict of interest” homrich said “we felt that there would be an opportunity to build a successful company where we sat on the same side of the table as the client” because hb works with clients on a feeonly basis and doesn’t generate commissions through product sales its success “really depends on the increase of value of assets of clients and making sure they are well taken care of” said william “bill” rich an estate planning attorney and partner with holland and knight who has been referring clients to hb since the mid’s blank was so satisfied with hb’s service that when he left the home depot in  and established his family office he asked homrich to join him and preside over his finance and investment matters “as we were building amb group — our investment management and support services company and now the parent company of our operating businesses — i wanted the company’s foundation to be built with the ‘best’ david is that” blank said “beyond his expertise and talents our relationship while he was at homrich berg was built on trust and understanding” in the summer of  in one of the most difficult decisions homrich said he’s ever made he decided to leave the company he and berg founded just as it was beginning to flourish “we’d just gotten about  million under management we were building the business nicely and the future looked very bright” homrich said “in the end i was very much attracted to the idea of joining forces with arthur and seeing what i could help the blank family build” today five partners including berg own hb despite the exit of his business partner berg credits much of the company’s success to the foundation laid by homrich in the early years “i think the heavy lifting was done in those early years and we just kind of took it from there” berg said “it was a very friendly parting and homrich and i are still close friends and we still do work for not only arthur but for many members of arthur’s family” maintaining strong relationships whether it’s with clients or former partners is part of hb’s corporate culture with clients these relationships involve assisting them with financial planning and investment needs throughout their life hb works in tandem with clients’ accountants estate attorneys mortgage brokers or bankers to ensure a client’s financial goals are fulfilled howard s hirsch of counsel in the atlanta office of baker donelson bearman caldwell  berkowitz pc whose practice focuses on real estate investment trusts securities law and commercial transactions has referred people to homrich berg “all their clients feel that they are getting oneonone attention” hirsch said individual customized service is important to highnetworth clients interested in preserving and growing wealth said michael smith shareholder in baker donelson’s atlanta office who concentrates on tax and corporate law “for this firm and some other ones the source of the income is either from wealthy families that have multigenerations of wealth they are trying to preserve and invest and other sources are from people that have become successful in business” smith said “they get a large sum of money when they sell their business and they like to diversify” as a client since  businessman charlie yates sits on hb’s client advisory board while hb does a good job managing client requests yates said the strategic framework and support for clients is hb’s ultimate strength “they are very good on the investment side but they are even better at making sure they understand your situation and customizing your investment program based on your personal needs your personal risk profile and they give great service to help manage affairs” yates said despite its strength hb like many others felt the pain of the recession rather than altering its business strategy during tough times however hb stayed the course and focused on being even more communicative with clients during the downturn in the end berg said the recession helped strengthen the firm’s client relationships “we had conviction in our asset allocation and were committed not to change course in the end that strategy benefited our clients” berg said hb should be able to continue to grow through client referrals homrich said “i think they are in a very good spot and i think they will continue to do well as long as they continue to remain focused on taking care of the client and client’s needs ahead of their own” he said about homrich
