continue reading the main story if sheer assets were the benchmark for success in the fund business then the move of brian s posner to warburg pincus asset management would have been a humbling oneat fidelity investments he built his reputation as a value investor at the equityincome ii fund which had  billion in assets when he left by contrast his new fund assignment warburg pincus growth and income had less than onethirtieth of that amount under  million when he took overof course mr posner and other people at at warburg pincus dont measure success that way they point to performance since he joined the firm as a partner and portfolio manager in january  mr posner has raised the performance of the growth and income fund formerly a laggard to the top quartile among its peers in the last  months and its assets have grown to almost  billionmr posners presence is being felt throughout warburg pincus which manages  billion in retail and institutional assets as he takes on increasing management responsibilities he is now director of largecapitalization domestic stock research and head of the firms global asset allocation committee advertisement continue reading the main story he has reinvigorated people here with his commitment to excellence said arnold m reichman chief operating officer of warburg pincus a private firm that began selling its funds to the public only in  continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story known for his personable nature mr posner has encouraged a less formal exchange of ideas among analysts that in turn has helped warburg pincus portfolio managers gain insights into companies that otherwise may have remained only scribbles in an analysts notebookive always found the more you can get analysts to talk about companies the more ideas that get generated mr posner said the warburg pincus balanced fund which mr posner plans to help run will also draw on the largecap domestic stock research as funds like strategic value and capital appreciation already domr posner  said he had longed to play a bigger role in building a business at fidelity he said my opportunities did not go much beyond running a fundso how is growth and income performing under mr posner since he took over it has returned  percent annualized through april  according to morningstar inc the financial publisher in chicago that beats the  percent return for the average largecapitalization value stock fund though it lags behind the standard  poors stock index at  percentbut if history is a guide mr posners fund will close the gap with the s p over time while taking on less risk fidelity equityincome ii had an annualized total return of  percent during mr posners tenure from april  to december  just shy of the  percent for the s p but the funds pricetoearnings and pricetobook ratios were typically far below those of the index and mr posner figures that the fund was only  percent as risky and equityincome ii easily beat its average peer fund which returned just  percent annualized over that period under mr posners successor the veteran fidelity manager bettina doulton equityincome ii has continued to do well returning an annualized  percent though april mr posner is running the growth and income fund much as he did fidelity equityincome ii one difference he said is that he does not have to compete with other fidelity managers when he buys a stock if he likes something he can buy as much as he wants another is that growth and income is smaller so he can own fewer stocks there are about  companies in growth and income equityincome ii had about  he saidthe core of his approach is what mr posner likes to call absolute valuation it is a combination of fundamental kickthetires talktomanagement analysis and valuation analysis which weighs earnings as well as present and future return and risk a key measure is free cash which in effect is earnings that can be reinvested or passed on to

isolation i can make money on this company mr posner said advertisement continue reading the main story mr posner is nothing if not patient he may pore over numbers for years before he takes the plunge on a stock a favorite example is british petroleum the company was in dire straits during the early s and announced a major restructuring in august  mr posner made a few trips to britain to explore the situation and quickly began buying the american depositary receipts then trading at about shortly thereafter it became one of my largest positions mr posner said the adrs are now at he still likes bp which makes up  percent of growth and incomes portfolio the company has announced a major share buyback and plans to increase production by  percent over the next five years mr posner thinks the stock may climb as high as  a share in the next  monthsanother longterm favorite is unova inc a  billion industrial technology company based in beverly hills calif that was spun off last october by western atlas an oilservices concern unova traded as low as  a share in january and is now at  or under  times  pershare earnings estimates mr posner describes unova as the proverbial eightcylinder car running on four cylinders that will soon take off and could hit the high s in the near termthe company designs and builds manufacturing lines for engine makers as well as barcode systems for various commercial uses last year the companys bar code business had to digest acquisitions depressing operating marginsmr posner however focused on the companys ability to generate free cash which he expects to climb to  a share in  from about  a share in  and on its ability to eventually expand its businessesnot all of mr posners stocks are holdovers from his fidelity days his new analysts have brought some new stocks to his attention like gulfstream aerospace the maker of private jetsmr posner was convinced by his defense and aerospace analyst that the gv gulfstreams newest jet would be introduced on time and on budget moreover he estimated that gulfstreams free cash could hit  to  a share in  versus  a share in  he bought the stock last spring when it was trading at about  it is now at mr posner also keeps his eye on the portfolio mix balancing volatile and steady stocks to keep the funds risk in check but as stock prices have climbed mr posner has had more difficulty finding stocks he likes he is looking into semiconductor equipment makers and disk drive manufacturers though he is not convinced that any are worth buying yet advertisement continue reading the main story in general mr posner says this is a time to exercise caution in the market and not to swing for the fences in this environment consistent with the diversification in the portfolio and risk management its about doubles and singles and moving the runners and not striking out he said continue reading the main story we’re interested in your feedback on this page tell us
