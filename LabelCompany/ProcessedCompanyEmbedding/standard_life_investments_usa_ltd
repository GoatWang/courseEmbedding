insightour house view   our house view the house view process provides a consistent macroeconomic framework to analysing global financial markets it creates a clear forwardlooking strategic direction for all of our investment decisions particularly asset allocation within the traditional balanced funds but it also underpins our absolute return strategies the house view is formed by the global investment group gig on the basis of internal research from the global strategy team covering a range of macroeconomic behavioural liquidity and structural drivers in each of the major economies and markets government bonds corporate bonds equities real estate other assets cash   july  the following portfolio is based upon a global investor with access to all the major asset classes if you prefer you can access a textonly version of our house view government bonds us treasuries tighter labour markets and rising wages give the federal reserve the rationale to continue tightening policy markets are not fully pricing in inflation pressures moved to light european bonds bonds are not as well supported as the improvement in economic growth could force the ecb into tightening policy while political pressures could resurface markets however are overpricing inflationary pressures light uk gilts the bank of england has delivered significant easing measures as the impact of rising inflation on household incomes should cause the economy to slow longterm valuations are expensive especially after the recent sterling moves neutral japanese bonds the central bank is attempting to reflate the economy with its quantitative easing and yield curve control policy alongside negative shortterm rates the absence of yield makes this asset class relatively unattractive light global inflationlinked debt while we see inflation as generally well contained globally there are varying opportunities in different markets in particular uk breakeven rates look relatively high and us rates relatively low neutral global emerging market debt local currency yields are more attractive due to emerging markets sensitivity to the pickup in global growth us dollardenominated debt is supported by attractive spreads over treasury debt heavy back to top   corporate bonds investment grade debt qe supports uk bonds but it has driven european yields to unattractive levels us credit spreads are less attractive as treasury yields increase and we prefer riskier assets light high yield debt the hunt for yield has driven investors to this asset class although overcrowding remains a risk in some sectors especially in the us when monetary policy is being tightened or oil prices are under pressure neutral back to top   equities us equities equities have rallied on the back of improved global economic conditions and potential fiscal easing and deregulation while dividends and buybacks are supportive risks valuations are fairly full heavy european equities corporate earnings are improving on the back of a widespread pickup in economic growth across the region while investor sentiment becomes more positive concerns remain over some banking systems and the lack of strong credit growth heavy japanese equities the market looks more attractive as easy monetary policy and fiscal stimulus for  are helped by efforts to improve corporate governance share buybacks and business investment neutral uk equities the uk economy is weakening and brexit remains a longerterm threat sterling remains the primary driver of the relative attractiveness of uk companies with overseas exposure neutral developed asian equities the improvement in the global economy supports this market but chinese tightening risks curbing property demand which is a large driver for the region neutral emerging market equities while emerging markets are attractive in the face of a global economic pickup the current chinese tightening bias makes us neutral on this asset class neutral back to top   real estate uk the uk real estate cycle is at a mature stage and expectations of further capital growth are limited income remains attractive although risks are elevated should conditions turn recessionary or political uncertainty persists neutral european european property continues to perform well in a global context yield compression is essentially over as spreads have tightened while stronger economic growth and low levels of supply are supporting healthy income growth heavy north american the us market has low vacancies across most sectors and markets with the notable exception of retail malls and construction is mostly in check providing a prolonged window for rental growth heavy asia pacific an attractive yield margin remains but yields have bottomed in most markets income returns are driven by modest rental growth on the back of low vacancy healthy tenant demand and resilient economies neutral back to top   other assets foreign exchange better global growth tends to encourage flows out of the us dollar the euro is no longer a sell while the yen is cheap sterling acts as a shock absorber for brexit heavy ¥ neutral  € £ global commodities while global growth generally supports commodities they are very sensitive to chinese policy and some commodities particularly oil face excess supply neutral back to top   cash with global yields still extremely low we still see better opportunities in risk assets light back to top     key issues the global economy continues to expand as shown by positive trends in trade capital spending and hiring helped by still supportive monetary and fiscal policies while central banks in the us canada and china are raising interest rates and qe programmes should be restrained in the us and europe into  it is clear that central banks will be cautious in their monetary tightening underlying inflation pressures look restrained by the degree of spare capacity as well as the impact of technological developments political risk remains high in most regions summarised by the degree of uncertainty about whether the us government pushes ahead with material changes to tax trade or foreign policies we balance a desire for selected growth opportunities with a focus on sustainable yield as the profits outlook appears better we have accepted more equity risk us stocks appear well supported especially if the government lowers corporate taxes albeit they command high valuations europe japan and selected emerging markets look set to benefit from higher operating leverage to global growth among the major currencies we have a small overweight position in the japanese yen and small underweight positions in the us dollar and sterling this is partly on valuation grounds and partly to act as diversifiers – for example the yen usually benefits when investor uncertainty falls elsewhere the house view remains overweight in incomeproducing assets such as real estate and emerging market debt we expect only modest returns from government bonds in  although the downside is limited by the lack of major inflation pressure valuations on corporate bonds have become stretched in real estate we find better opportunities outside the uk in the us and europe yields are attractive rental growth is positive and commercial development remains constrained meanwhile there are some decent prospects in parts of asia property combines yield with some growth which is a sweet spot in terms of investment preferences where foresight meets conviction whatever your involvement in the financial markets you will understand that they present ongoing neverending challenges that’s why we’re focused firmly on the future  anticipating and identifying the next compelling investment opportunities for our clients our house view provides a clear forwardlooking strategic direction for our investment decisions it’s the crux of all our investment insights taking into account the many factors that shape the outlook for the major asset classes it ensures we have a consistent approach to managing market risk across our product range and acts as a bedrock for the decisions our investment teams take on a daily basis how the process works the global investment group is the team that collates our house view after indepth analysis the gig forms a broad view of asset allocation based on current market drivers and economic forecasts
