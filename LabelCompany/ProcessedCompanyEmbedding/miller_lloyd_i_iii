company makes an important strategic move such an acquisition or a share offering he hopes for the best possible outcome he hopes that the company shareholders will think that the move is an excellent one demonstrating the ceo�s management skill that the share price will rise and the course of time that everyone will ultimately be awed at his genius in leading the company in this direction what vision how he gambled that the acquisition would be successful won the whole pot and made the shareholders happy but the word �shareholders� covers many kinds of investors large institutions small institutions us investors israeli investors in the case of israeli companies involved investors and uninterested ones longterm investors and investors seeking a quick buck obviously it�s impossible to satisfy them all one man who has personally undergone this problem in recent weeks is pharmos corp nasdaq pars chairman and ceo dr haim aviv well you might say criticism from investors is nothing new for aviv especially since the shattering failure in late  of dexanabinol the head trauma treatment meant for a billiondollar market the hope had been to create an international commercial biopharmaceutical company but that dream is gone criticism also came in the form of class action suits that pharmos is still dealing with however this time the criticism is not reflected in the sale of pharmos shares or lawsuits there is an investor making a lot of noise please meet lloyd miller iii of florida the agenda of the �new leadership committee� pharmos is a drug discovery and development company with a focus on neurology and inflammations although without revenue for many months the company has said that it is actively seeking pharmaceutical activities for acquisition the hope is to find a drug undergoing promising phase ii clinical trials in order to increase the chance of achieving commercialization more quickly in midmarch  pharmos announced that it had found what it was looking for in vela pharmaceuticals inc of new jersey pharmos will acquire vela for an initial payment of  million in cash plus the issue of  million pharmos shares at  per share for a total of  million later pharmos will issue  million additional shares contingent on achieving specific clinical milestones pharmos has a market cap of  million vela develops drugs for the treatment of intestinal syndromes especially irritated bowel syndrome in contrast to other drugs vela�s drug treats this problem via the brain and central nervous system rather than directly treating the intestine in the next few weeks the company will commence phase iib clinical trials of its drug following the successful completion of phase iia trials conducted under pharmos�s guidance the companies hope for a market of hundreds of millions of dollars maybe even a blockbuster so who is lloyd miller last february aviv didn�t know him either on february  miller first filed an scd report with the us securities and exchange commission sec stating that he had acquired  of pharmos with this purchase he became the largest shareholder in the company aviv owns  and no other shareholder owns more than  investment institutions have lost interest in the company and sold their holdings and its current value has not attracted new blood in the form of institutions willing to take a risk pharmos president and coo alan rubino met miller and tried to understand his plans but miller apparently said nothing in march miller announced that he now owned  of the company in other words he was amassing shares the scd form states �miller is an advisor to the trustee of trust a� as far as we can tell this is family money for which he is the trustee miller�s scd from march states that he planned to oppose pharmos�s merger with vela announced a few days previously rubino was again dispatched to talk with miller and again got the impression that except for the acquisition miller had no plans to do anything meanwhile miller continued to amass pharmos shares he can reach a maximum of  of the company�s share capital because if he buys more pharmos�s board can activate a poison pill created in october  miller has not sat by silently on friday he exercised his threat sending to the sec a proxy on his behalf and on behalf of two other pharmos shareholders dr raymond mckee and dr gerard soula the three men own  of the company altogether  million shares in other words mckee and soula own  the three men joined forces to create a bloc that calls itself �the committee for new leadership� a name that clearly defines the agenda they want to dictate for pharmos they are urging shareholders to block the acquisition of vela at pharmos�s next general shareholders meeting scheduled for the summer because the three men do not care for this acquisition they also want to be appointed directors replacing three current directors including aviv because �the service of the current directors is characterized by cash burning and a dramatic fall in the share price� �the acquisition has a devastating impact� factually regardless of whether miller is right or not vela�s condition is far from excellent on march  the company�s auditor ernst  young reported that the company had an operating loss a huge cumulative deficit negative shareholders� equity and a negative cash flow from current operations under these circumstances ernst  young doubted vela�s ability to survive as a going concern a merger with pharmos is vela�s lifeline vela lost  million in  and burned  million cash if the merger goes ahead vela shareholders jp morgan partners llc will get  of pharmos venrock associates will get  and new enterprise associates will get  miller and his associates claim that vela shareholders especially the three mentioned above will benefit at the expense of pharmos shareholders since pharmos will probably issue up to   million shares for them which will greatly dilute the holdings of the company�s existing shareholders given vela�s weak financial performance and balance sheet miller and his associates claim that the new pharmos  including vela  will suffer from an even faster and heavier cash burn rate which is unquestionably bad for shareholders they claim that vela failed to raise additional capital on its own until the arrival of pharmos miller and his associates also assert that vela�s shareholders will own  of pharmos and if pharmos issues new shares on the basis of achieving certain milestones vela�s shareholders will own over half of pharmos  ie they will gain control miller and his associates claim �not only has pharmos�s board saved vela from severe financial distress but by doing so it jeopardizes your investment in the company we�re fed up standing aside and watching the share price fall under the leadership of the current board it�s time for change just look at the share graph which is appended this deal needlessly dilutes current shareholders and the acquisition of vela has a devastating impact on pharmos� current shareholders� unfortunately for aviv he and mony bendor and dr abraham sartani were supposed to be reelected to pharmos�s board at the next general shareholders meeting however miller wants these three seats for himself and his two associates they promise to cut pharmos�s cash burn rate sign cooperation agreements with other companies and increase value for shareholders miller  is an investment advisor who has been a member of the chicago mercantile exchange nysecme and its stock market he is currently a director on the boards of several companies none of which as far as i can see is a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company mckee  the second member of miller�s trio was appointed pharmos vp business development in  and was vp investor relations and business development between  and march  when he was fired he previously served as vp at collguard biopharmaceuticals ltd soula  the third member of miller�s trio was a cofounder of flamel technologies sa nasdaqflml a drug development company that specializes in polymer chemistry and which was the second french company to be listed on nasdaq the company has a market cap of  million miller and his associates estimate that they have spent  in their proxy fight at pharmos and are prepared to spend another  they say they intend for the company to repay these expenses �miller has a fixation� what does aviv have to say on saturday night he sounded hurt and taken aback �miller said he wouldn�t do anything and suddenly he has filed documents with the sec although i don�t know the third partner soula it�s clear to me that if this group includes mckee whom i know very well they�re not seeking a takeover miller as far as we�re aware has no management experience and certainly not in the life sciences his game is to buy shares whose market price is less than their cash value but there�s a difference between a technology and a company of our kind the deal with vela is excellent but we�re seeing him throw mud in all directions and his claims are superficial we�re still studying the material and i already feel that now i�ve said too much but it�s clear to us that pharmos has something to offer its shareholders much more than miller can offer to win support� �globes� miller claims that you�re giving away control of pharmos aviv we�ve taken great care not to surrender control first of all we appoint three of pharmos�s nine directors and we�re giving about a third of shares over  months as for the additional  million shares i�d be pleased to give them to the shareholders if they meet the milestones inshallah we�ll get there because then we�ll know that the drugs are successful so what�s miller talking about i now have no other way to buy a drug and in this case we�ve made a special blend of cash and shares in our opinion we�ve got an excellent asset here what�s he worried about that we�ll lose control he says the shares are cheap so shareholders� stakes will be diluted at least on that i agree with him the shares are cheap �we think that the deal with vela is exceptional i met analysts and investors all of whom asked me how i closed this deal i know first hand that vela had a chance to get money from another source but they preferred to go with us they were impressed by what we have to offer and by our professional management everyone feels that this is precisely what we were waiting for and only miller has this fixation that this is a bad deal� as a practical matter what will you do �i was never involved in such a proxy fight so i�ll have to learn about it but i am so sure that what we did was right that i�ll find the ways to get this message to the public if investors think that this was a mistake and prefer miller and good luck to them please just note the group he�s formed especially mckee whom i�m certain wants to exact revenge on pharmos i don�t think that these are men from whom advice should be taken nonetheless i�m not downplaying this story but treating it seriously� how did miller become pharmos�s largest shareholder with you in second place �that�s one of the big problems we don�t have enough investment institutions which skews the distribution and gives miller great weight� �they�ve unjustifiably jumped on us� last week �globes� met aviv to get an impression about developments at pharmos before he knew about the blowup with miller pharmos now rests on three legs the first is inhouse development of synthetic cannabinoid compounds the most advanced product in this group is cannabinor for the treatment of pain which will begin phase ii clinical trials in a few weeks pharmos is also examining the development of synthetic cannabinoid compounds for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis multiple sclerosis and autoimmune system failure �there are several kinds of pain� says aviv in explaining cannabinor�s expected uniqueness �one is acute pain such as when you�re stabbed or in surgery the second is neuropathic pain which lasts for a long time another pain is inflammatory which is linked to inflammations and can be either acute or neuropathic the pain market is large  half the population suffers from pain for which there is no relief some treatments have severe side effects such as a sharp drop in blood pressure in acute pain trials we�ll test through an examination after wisdom tooth surgery we�ll test  patients although acute pain isn�t our direction we�ll go in the direction of neuropathic pain which we�ll begin studying on  healthy volunteers in a few weeks we create pain by exposing them to capsaicin found in chili peppers in this way we�ll examine cannabinor�s treatment window� pharmos�s second leg is vela although its growth now seems more problematic the third leg is in the direction of licensing of nanoemulsion announced last year nanoemulsion is a nanotechnology mechanism of focused drug delivery using a special formula that pharmos claims can deliver drugs directly to the desired tissue aviv says �the risk levels here are lower than for drugs and the timetomarket is shorter for drugs timetomarket is five to six years where it�s three years for nanoemulsion and at lower cost� pharmos has other technologies of this kind such as a method of preventing drug delivery to the brain through chemical medication �we now know we have to reduce pharmos�s risk by diversification� says aviv this is news to you after all it�s obvious you should reduce risk �it�s not new conceptually but we didn�t have the means to this before so it�s new in a practical manner we knew this even before the failure of dexanabinol we just couldn�t do it we examined dozens of acquisition opportunities before reaching vela through rbc and its israeli partner tamir fishman  co but most of the opportunities fell through if the product was undergoing phase i clinical trials it was too undeveloped and wouldn�t help us to know if the product had a chance if it was undergoing phase ii it wasn�t always enough �we met with a great many companies including israeli ones which claimed they had good clinical data but it wasn�t the case we also examined companies in the phase iii stage but their asking prices were astronomical vela had very good results for its trials on irritated bowel syndrome which will have a  billion market in  we naturally don�t expect such a volume but it�s an indication� what will your costs be if all goes according to plan �phase iib clinical trials will take us  months and we�ll invest  million phase iii clinical trials will take about the same amount of time and will require  million we plan that phase ii will be big enough to effectively serve as a kind of phase iii trial but we haven�t yet settled this� the market sees assets and company management at zero values �true and i really don�t understand the market�s rationale we were a disappointment investors were burned and talk badly about pharmos but more sophisticated investors are more positive we hope to soon add value to the company from our new directions the acquisition of vela and progress in clinical trials for cannabinor and in other areas will help investors realize this� dexanabinol damaged your reputation have you thought of quitting �we provided no guarantees that�s certainly true but the attack on us seems unjustified we made a real professional and honest effort and i was hurt by the attack on me but i�m strong enough to withstand it after all it would have been the easiest thing for me to say �i tried it failed goodbye� how many more drugs will i be able to develop in my lifetime quite a few of my colleagues in the us told me �what do you need this for sell your business get some money and leave� i could make a living i believe even without this but i insisted that that pharmos�s amazing abilities would move on to the next generations i still hope that we�ll do this and build an international company i don�t want to say how long it will take but you see i haven�t retreated into my shell in any case i�m sure that i wouldn�t change my career even if i were  years younger� published by globes

via yahoo finance newport beach calif–business wire–lamassu holdings llc “lamassu” has sent the following letter to the board of directors of ditech networks inc nasdaqditc – news “ditech networks” members of the board over the past month a significant number of shareholders have either publicly through filings or privately rejected your leadership by expressing their support for lamassu’s director nominees instead of listening to these shareholders and correcting your course you push forward spending as though ditech networks has money to burn adding to the amount of money you have already lost for shareholders during your tenure your recent decision to tie executive compensation to a level of investment associated with mstagetoktok an unproven technology that to date has produced no revenues and has no immediate prospects is outrageous and limits management’s ability to make the hard but intelligent decisions to reduce investment in that technology if its prospects for revenue continue to be elusive with this measure we believe you have aggressively overstepped the bounds of good corporate governance and have clearly violated your fiduciary responsibility investors in ditech networks nasdaq ditc – news are not venture capitalists and did not sign up for this type of speculative investing with such a large portion of the company’s assets management needs to have the latitude to make the decisions that are appropriate given the revenue prospects of each product and the board should ensure that no individual investment puts the company in as much jeopardy of total failure as the mstagetoktok investment does in addition given the level of support for lamassu’s slate of director nominees we remain completely perplexed by your apparent desire to engage in a pointless proxy fight and waste company resources to protect your own interests it is obvious shareholders will aggressively reject the idea of spending millions of dollars of their money in this manner when the addition of lamassu’s nominees to the board will clearly provide a much needed new perspective that is not steeped in the countless mistakes of the past or married to visions and dreams that produce little or nothing in the way of actual revenue for the sake of all investors we encourage you to radically alter your behavior and begin listening to shareholders as opposed to pursuing your own interests and extremely risky agendas while you personally will not be significantly harmed if mstagetoktok is unsuccessful and ditech networks ultimately fails many investors are

investment thesis posted in activist investors infocus corporation nasdaqinfs lloyd i miller iii nery capital partners stocks tagged activist investment infocus corporation nasdaqinfs liquidating value nery capital partners on february    comments » infocus corporation nasdaqinfs has released its results for the fourth quarter and full year ended december  and they are frankly nothing short of horrific as always greenbackd’s concern is primarily for the state of the balance sheet and the liquidation value of the company here the news is bad balance sheet total cash and restricted cash as of december   were  million a decrease of  million from the end of the third quarter the reduction in cash was primarily driven by changes in working capital the cash loss from operations and settlement on foreign exchange hedges inventories at the end of the fourth quarter were  million an increase of  million compared to the third quarter of  we generally don’t pay too much mind to earnings we welcome it when earnings fall off a cliff and drag stock along for the ride because it creates opportunities for investors like us who are focused on the balance sheet we do however take issue with a management burning through more than half of a company’s cash in quarter especially when that cash is set alight in the “settlement on foreign exchange hedges” an investor cannot have any confidence in a management that confronted with cash losses from operations not only neglects to fix operating cash flow but finds a new way to lose money remember infs’s adoption of a poison pill “to help ensure … our board of directors is able to conduct its review of strategic alternatives without the threat of coercive takeover or control tactics that do not offer shareholders a fair premium” surely that argument is at an end now management has failed it’s time for nery capital partners to bayonet the wounded and put infs’s stockholders out of their misery when we started coverage in december last year infs had a market capitalization of m we estimated its liquidating value to be more than  higher at m or  per share with nery capital partners and miller pushing the company to enhance its stock price we believed infs to be an attractive opportunity that seems to have been a mistake we don’t have a full q  k to review so we’ve adjusted our earlier model based on the information in the press release attached to the k described above based on that incomplete information we estimate that infs’s liquidation value could now be as low as m or  per share given that infs closed yesterday at  our reason for holding the stock is gone accordingly we have to close out the position we opened it at  so our infs position is down  on an absolute basis the sp  index closed at  on december   and closed yesterday at  that’s a return of  for the index and means we’re off  on a relative basis in all a bitterly disappointing outcome if you have the stomach for it you can read a summary of the whole sorry tale below looking back it seems that there were a number of portentous steps taken by management that should have tipped us off after we opened our position on december  last year infs announced that it would “restructure” we wrote that management “believes it will achieve profitable operations with an  gross margin target and operating expenses in the range of  million per quarter” we noted that projections about future profitability often don’t turn out as projected saying they are made by managements deaf to what the market is telling them about the company as a result we are much more interested in the company’s plans to unlock the value in the assets on that front the news is mixed infs has previously announced that it had retained an investment banking firm to provide “advisory services” the new announcement says that these advisory services include “advice concerning unsolicited offers from outside sources expressing interest in purchasing the company” this is a positive development the bad news is that the company has suspended the stock repurchase plan which is slightly disappointing we say “slightly disappointing” because a buy back of  million shares over a three year period does not have a meaningful effect on the per share value so cutting it makes almost no difference it does show however that management is ignoring obvious valueenhancing opportunities for stockholders there was a brief glimpse of light when we read a report that a group of “highpowered executives” including infs’s cofounder steve hix wanted to buy the company if they could get financing the executives planned to save infs from the “new york sharks” who wanted to liquidate the company for a quick profit said one of the group we’ve got some whispers that there’s a guy in new york looking at buying  percent of this company and he’ll liquidate it we are scared we don’t want that to happen to this company we’ve been working for nine months on a way to save it nery capital presumably one of the “new york sharks” then upped its stake to  of infs’s outstanding stock it seemed we might be in a competitive bid situation which would have been very good news for stockholders as it often presages a fully valued offer for the company unfortunately the news then took a decided turn for the worse when infs’s management adopted a poison pill which it euphemistically described as a “shareholder rights plan” we wrote that calling such an abomination a “shareholder rights plan” was pretty galling when its effect was to take rights away from shareholders and deliver them to management we were also unhappy with the suggestion that the board were the ones to determine what was “in the best interest of infs and its shareholders” and how much of a premium was “fair” given the level at which the stock languished when we wrote that the stock “languished” at  more than  higher than the level at which it languishes today tuesday’s results announcement is just the final nail in the coffin we care little for the tumble in earnings we do care that the company has burnt through more than half its cash in a single quarter in pursuit of “foreign exchange hedges” we’ve lost what little confidence we had in management’s ability to put shareholders first that wouldn’t ordinarily cause us to exit a position the accelerating destruction of value is however too much and we’ve closed out the position full disclosure  we have a holding in infs this is neither a recommendation to buy or sell any securities all information provided

unsolicited offers from outside sources expressing interest in purchasing the company” this is a positive development the bad news is that the company has suspended the stock repurchase plan which is slightly disappointing we say “slightly disappointing” because a buy back of  million shares over a three year period does not have a meaningful effect on the per share value so cutting it makes almost no difference it does show however that management is ignoring obvious valueenhancing opportunities for stockholders infs will host a conference call to discuss the announcement tomorrow

to vote for jps industries inc slate at annual meeting feb    et from lloyd i miller iii west palm beach fla feb   prnewswire  lloyd i miller iii today announced his intention to vote in favor of the companys slate for election at the annual meeting of jps industries inc otc pink jpst jps or the company to be held on february    mr miller strongly supports the companys slate and management for the reasons described below dissidents have conflicts of interest  mr miller notes that the dissident slate of nominees has been hand picked by steel partners holdings lp splp steel partners a large stockholder whose affiliate recently attempted to buy jps at an initial price of  which was later revised to  to  per share subject to deductions according to the companys proxy statement  based on the companys valuation estimate of  per share as described in their proxy statement mr miller does not believe that the offer of  per share by the affiliate of steel partners is in any way adequate setting aside all questions of whether or not their offer would in fact result in a transaction at that price  risk of premature sale  mr miller has been an investor in jps since   as a longterm investor he is open to all strategic alternatives that contribute to shareholder value including a possible sale of the company on favorable terms  he is opposed to a premature sale of the company at an inadequate price  mr miller is disappointed in the process that steel partners has pursued to date in seeking to purchase the company for  per share markedly less than the companys valuation estimate of  per share a gap of approximately   on that basis if an affiliate of steel partners later renews its bid for the company mr miller believes that the election of steels dissident nominees to control the jps board would not yield an optimal price for all shareholders excellent management  in particular mr miller is voting in favor of the companys slate to demonstrate his strong support for the ceo mr mikel h williams who is on the companys slate for his excellent management  mr miller commends mr williams for paying down company debt and pension obligations to the tune of  million which he views as a remarkable achievement  ceo proven track record  mr miller notes that ceo mikel williams has a track record in the industry of realizing value for shareholders  specifically as a large shareholder of ddi corp ddic in  when mr williams was ceo mr miller saw firsthand that mr williams not only excelled at running an industrial business similar to jps but also negotiated the sale of ddi at a premium price  with his outstanding skills and experience as ceo and a director mr williams is well positioned to pursue value for jps shareholders contact  eric fangmann  or
