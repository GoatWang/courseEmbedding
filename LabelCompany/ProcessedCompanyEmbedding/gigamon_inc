gigamon inc nysegimo  seeking alphasign in  join nowgo»gigamon a natural acquisition target by the essence of its businessmay  about gigamon inc gimo jay wei research analyst activist investor special situations longshort equitysummarygigamon has good products to sell but it spends too much on direct selling to end users and paying thirdparty distributors to channel to end users which squeezes marginswhile gigamons top line has been growing the company may have to scale up its business soon if it wants continued growth something its current level of internal capital cannot supportmerging with a larger network equipment maker or security software company can address both its capital needs for expansion and its sales efficiency via product integration with the acquirers offeringsgigamon inc nysegimo has a reputable technology and impressive products in network visibility and traffic monitoring but is being held back by its costly marketing efforts squeezing operating margins and reducing net earnings despite increased attention to cybersecurity not every network operator may include managing potential security threats as something essential to a networks functions the companys lower profit margins show that selling cybersecurityrelated products to one end user at a time proves to be no easy task to state specifically part of gigamons current sales structure involves selling directly to end users of network operators as a security addon to their existing network infrastructure this kind of retailing hasnt been the most efficient for the company given the level of marketing costs associated with it developing wholesale customers namely network equipment makers and security software companies or better yet becoming a part of them stands a better chance to realize gigamons sales and earnings potential with changes in its sales structure or an acquisition to provide integrated network security offerings its products could reach a far wider base of network operators and so would its stock potentially fetching a higher valuation technology companies are supposed to have highmargin operations if they dont squander too much on administrative and marketing expenses gigamon had a trailing month gross margin of  but its operating margin dropped deeply down to  based on data as of april   the companys sellinggenadmin expense excluding anything laborrelated was  as a percentage of sales in  suggesting heavy spending on sales and marketing although gigamons current marketing has worked to some extent its not most efficient to allow larger earnings sales grew from  million in  to  million in  an average growth rate of  over the fiveyear period its asset turnover ratio a measure of a companys ability to generate sales from its assets reached a high  in  calculated as sales over average total assets this means without some meaningful increases in capital investments to scale up its business further sales growth may be harder to come by the question would then be if the company has the financial resources to take up the task capital expenditures are best met with operating cash flow but gigamon doesnt seem to have plenty of that partly due to its relatively large cash outflow to sales and marketing spending as for financing the company has carried zero debt since at least  and is not likely to just start borrowing for expansion even if it did using the same sales and marketing technique would continue to constrict its margins running a business with prolonged low margins is certainly not how a company wants to deliver value to shareholders gigamons business may have progressed to a point whereby outside capital support becomes a logical next step to help it stay in a healthy growth path especially when the potential business combination can also address its currently less efficient sales structure gigamons visibility platform the companys underpinning product for the network visibility market functions as a layer or link between the network infrastructure and the suite of security management and analytical tools by extracting data traffic within the network and delivering that to each security tool for performance evaluation a network infrastructure without a traffic visibility product in place is hardly security integrationready while a security suite cannot augment its solutions and service without the aid of traffic visibility therefore its in the best interest of all parties in such an ecosystem  namely makers of network equipment security software companies and network visibility vendors  to work in close partnership with each other if traffic visibility products like gigamons are increasingly adopted by other parties in the ecosystem as part of their offerings end users of network operators will be able to provide their customers with integrated readytoimplement network and security solutions from the very start with elliott management recently taking an activist position in gigamon investors can expect changes to the companys current sales structure to take advantage of the unique market dynamic among network traffic visibility and monitoring network infrastructure and security management as of now the company markets and sells its products through what it calls a hybrid sales model its a combination of direct sales to end users of network operators and indirect reselling through thirdparty channel distributors that requires gigamons technical training and support handled by its own overlay channel sales team adding more to its marketing and sales cost gigamons current marketing efforts focus on driving enduse demand and rely on channel distributors to generate more than half of its revenue the company should have a lot of room for increasing the level of its work relationships with its ecosystem partners its likely that companies like cisco systems inc nasdaqcsco could have gigamons visibility platform directly integrated into their network equipment effectively giving gigamon a wholesaler with a far wider market reach than what the company itself could have as for cisco systems it also has a slew of cybersecurity products of its own including its visibility offering stealthwatch for monitoring traffic between branches that could benefit from the broader coverage of gigamons visibility products designed for deployment across a network giving gigamons leading visibility technology and the potential wider demand on this kind of security products investors just need to have their finger on the

the monitoring of your network infrastructure and improving security tool performance a range of applications are available to optimize the traffic sent from your network to the tools you rely upon to monitor manage and secure the network gigasmart’s highperformance advanced processing engine is available on gigavue® visibility appliances and can be accessed anywhere within the gigamon visibility platform without port or cardbased restrictions smart efficient effective traffic optimization gigasmart processing engines can be combined to manage higher traffic loads and optimized for specific applications applications can be combined or service chained so traffic benefits from multiple functions that can be achieved at once examples include generating netflow and other network metadata decrypting ssltls traffic after packet duplicates have been removed or stripping vlan headers before load balancing the traffic and sending it out to the appropriate tools gigasmart applications can be applied to any network or tool port on the chassis or the entire cluster allowing maximum flexibility in configuration and provisioning key features  benefits gigasmart adaptive packet filtering application session filtering deduplication erspan termination flowvue® gtp correlation ssltls decryption    load balancing masking netflow and metadata generation tunneling source port labeling adaptive packet filtering  identifies and filters matching content based on signature or patterns across any part of the packet including the payload application session filtering identifies and forwards traffic corresponding to application sessions to security appliances increasing their efficacy and performance deduplication and packet slicing  allows network monitoring tools to perform more efficiently by eliminating unwanted content erspan termination  terminates erspan tunnels to consolidate filter and forward relevant erspan traffic flowvue  flowaware sampling of active subscriber devices can selectively reduce traffic bound to monitoring and analytic tools can turn big data into manageable data with deterministic results at a fraction of the data rate gtp correlation  allows service providers to reliably filter and forward specified subscriber sessions both gtpc and gtpu to monitoring and analytic tools ssltls decryption  provides visibility into encrypted sessions sending decrypted packets to both inline and outofband security tools load balancing  allows distribution of traffic among multiple ports based on a variety of options hashing bandwidth cumulative traffic packet rate connections and round robin masking  allows network security teams to hide confidential information passwords financial accounts or medical data helping companies to comply with regulatory requirements password netflow and metadata generation  offloads this function to the gigamon visibility platform eliminating the risk of expending expensive production network resources in generating key analytics tunneling  forwards packets from remote sites to centralized monitoring tools via ipudp or lgre encapsulation and integrates virtualized tools
