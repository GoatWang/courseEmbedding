funds are also among the lowestcost target date mutual funds available to individual investors at  basis points  with only a  minimum investment  the new series includes funds with target retirement dates between  and  in fiveyear increments a complete list of schwab target date mutual funds including the new funds and their ticker symbols can be found here schwab target index funds are an important addition to schwabs wellestablished tdf suite first launched in  which includes mutual funds and collective trust funds open architecture construction and active and passive strategies today marks an important day of democratization for employers retirement plan participants and selfdirected individual investors said marie chandoha president and chief executive officer of charles schwab investment management with schwab target index funds every retirement plan gets the same low price with no investment minimums that means plan participants no longer have to pay for a more expensive target date fund just because they work at a smaller company on the retail side were proud to offer individual investors a professionally managed retirement solution at an exceptionally low price as the latest example of schwabs long history of driving down costs these new funds are important milestones for our industry and great news for retirement savers cost matters the underlying assets in schwab target index funds are primarily schwabs marketcap index etfs each of which has the lowest operating expenses in its respective lipper category  it is the result of this construction that allows csim to offer the new funds at such low prices the impact of keeping expenses down is enormous especially for products designed to be held over a long period of time to demonstrate that point csim has released a short motion graphic illustrating how lower fees alone can mean a significant increase in savings at retirement retirement plan participants appear to understand the impact of cost new data from schwab finds fees are top of mind when workers choose to invest in their plans tdfs second in importance only to the funds year performance record  at a time when some asset managers are inundating investors with confusing complex products were experiencing greater demand for our straightforward transparent products that deliver great value on their own or with professional management built in said chandoha schwab etfs function as key ingredients we draw on to develop affordable managed solutions like schwab target index funds we think this is uniquely powerful and relevant against

biagnostics toolkit for financial professionals overview insights analysis  commentary contact us insights from marie chandohapresident and ceo women in financial services – power in the pipeline may  here’s something you should know about me – my entry into financial services wasn’t really that deliberate i feel like i entered the industry somewhat accidentally there were signs of an interest in finance when i was young i liked to play monopoly i loved going to the bank with my mother i was interested in how money worked and i was really good at math and later on thought finance would be a good way to apply those skills in a career but i also know a lot of women who work in financial services yet never imagined they would do so when they were young the topic of evolving the complexion of the financial industry is something that i think about regularly the complexion of the industry continues to be out of kilter with the complexion of the clients we serve and our nation white men still represent the majority of those raising their hands to enter the financial services industry changing the complexion of our industry begins with building a more diverse pipeline last week i spent time at the university of akron at a symposium dedicated to building a more diverse pipeline in financial services and shared the following observations about what i believe can make a difference first we need to spread the word we need to get the word out that this is a great career path for diverse candidates a recent college graduate in my organization told me she had no idea this career path even existed she felt she had landed in her job by accident similar to my experience we are never going to change the complexion of this industry or build a pipeline by accident those of us in the industry need to reach out more consistently to universities other partners and career influencers to get the word out i have been impressed by organizations like girls who invest a nonprofit charles schwab investment management inc sponsors that spread the word among college women about careers in portfolio management provide training and help those women enter internships internships focused on bringing in more diverse candidates are also a terrific way to spread the word secondly as we start recruiting we need to build the confidence of women and other minorities that this career path is within reach people who experience bias in their lives often feel their confidence erode over time through their daily experiences being in this industry for over  years i continue to see a confidence gap between men and women in the workplace which i believe starts well before they ever enter the workforce studies show women tend not to apply for jobs unless they have the majority of the skills listed in the job description where men will apply for jobs even if they have only a few of the skills required finally we need to support our diverse candidates sometimes we attract diverse candidates but they end up dropping out i think firm culture plays a key role in fostering diversity diversity can thrive in respectful and inclusive cultures i frequently see our diverse candidates asking questions about the culture because they know it makes such a big difference in their ultimate success supporting diverse candidates through mentorship can also be effective for me i had many advisors along the way who helped me through difficult situations and made a big difference in my career and i am so grateful for that one thing that i do find exciting is the number of women who have risen up the ranks over the last decade when i started in this business there were few female role models in executive positions and when there were they didn’t seem to stay in their roles long today in the bay area there are four women ceos of asset management companies at charles schwab we have five female executives on our executive leadership team i can’t tell you how many times a woman has come up to me and said “wow you really give me hope that i can progress in my career” the fact that women are rising through the ranks as never before serves as an incredible beacon to young women considering their career choices if you can see it you can be it those of us fortunate enough to see beyond its complexion today know what a truly great industry this is at the end of the day the industry exists to serve others let’s rally together and help young women and minorities find their way within the financial services industry so we can serve the clients of the future in
