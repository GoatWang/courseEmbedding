receipt of the premium and do not refer to contract years if the premium receipt date is on the issue date of the contract then completed year  does not include the first contract anniversary the first contract anniversary begins completed year  and each successive contract anniversary the first contract year contract year  starts on the issue date and extends to but does not include the first contract anniversary subsequent contract years start on an anniversary date and extend to but do not include the next anniversary date if the premium receipt date is other than the issue date or a subsequent contract anniversary there is no correlation of the contract anniversary date and completed years for example if the issue date is january   and a premium payment is received on february   then although the first contract anniversary is january   the end of competed year  for that premium payment would be february   and february   begins completed year   the recapture charge percentage will be applied to the corresponding premium reflected in the amount withdrawn or the amount applied to income payments that remain subject to a recapture charge the corresponding premium is determined by treating amounts withdrawn as withdrawals first of earnings which bear no charge and then purchase payments oldest purchase payments first the amount recaptured will be taken from the investment divisions and the fixed account and the gmwb fixed account if applicable in the proportion their respective values bear to the contract value the dollar amount recaptured will never exceed the dollar amount of the contract enhancement added to the contract recapture charges will be applied upon electing to commence income payments even in a situation where the withdrawal charge is waived  the insurance companies do not assess the recapture charge on any payments paid out as death benefits withdrawals of earnings withdrawals taken under the free withdrawal provisions which allow for free withdrawals of up to  of remaining premium less earnings where a withdrawal is taken that exceeds the free withdrawal amount the recapture charge is imposed only on the excess amount above the free withdrawal amount withdrawals necessary to satisfy the required minimum distribution of the internal revenue code if the withdrawal requested exceeds the required minimum distribution the

connection with certain serious medical conditions specified in the contract this recapture charge waiver is not available under the jnlny contracts  the contract value will reflect any gains or losses attributable to a contract enhancement described above contract enhancements and any gains or losses attributable to a contract enhancement will be considered earnings under the contract for tax purposes and for purposes of calculating free withdrawal amounts  the jnl contracts have a “freelook” period of ten days twenty days for jnlny contracts after the owner receives the contract or any longer period required by state law contract value or premiums paid as may be required by state law less the full amount of any contract enhancements is returned upon exercise of freelook rights by an owner therefore  of the contract enhancement will be recaptured under all circumstances if an owner returns the contract during the freelook period but any gain or loss on investments of the contract enhancement would be retained by the owner the dollar amount recaptured will never exceed the dollar amount of the contract enhancement added to the contract a withdrawal charge will not be assessed upon exercise of free look rights  the withdrawal charges shown in the table below apply to differing versions of the jnl contracts the withdrawal charge schedules applicable to the jnlny contracts are provided later in this notice the amount of the withdrawal charge depends upon when the charge is imposed based on the completed years since the receipt of the related premium as follows

that section c of the act authorizes the commission to exempt any person security or transaction or any class or classes of persons securities or transactions from the provisions of the act and the rules promulgated thereunder if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act applicants request that the commission pursuant to section c of the act grant the exemptions requested below with respect to the contracts and any future contracts funded by the separate accounts or other accounts that are issued by the insurance companies and underwritten or distributed by the distributor or affiliated brokerdealers applicants undertake that future contracts funded by the separate accounts or other accounts in the future will be substantially similar in all material respects to the contracts applicants believe that the requested exemptions are appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act  applicants state that section  of the act regulates and imposes certain restrictions on the sales of periodic payment plan certificates issued by any registered investment company subsection i of section  of the act provides that section  does not apply to any registered separate account funding variable insurance contracts or to the sponsoring insurance company and principal underwriter of such account except as provided in paragraph  of the subsection paragraph  provides that it shall be unlawful for such a separate account or sponsoring insurance company to sell a contract funded by the registered separate account unless such contract is a redeemable security section a defines “redeemable security” as any security other than shortterm paper under the terms of which the holder upon presentation to the issuer is entitled to receive approximately his proportionate share of the issuers current net assets or the cash equivalent thereof  applicants submit that the recapture of the contract enhancement in the circumstances set forth in the application would not deprive an owner of his or her proportionate share of the issuers current net assets a contract owners interest in the amount of the contract enhancement allocated to his or her contract value upon the insurance companies receipt of a premium payment is not fully vested until five or seven complete years following a premium payment until or unless the amount of any contract enhancement is vested the insurance companies retain the right and interest in the contract enhancement amount although not in the earnings attributable to that amount thus applicants urge that when one of the insurance companies recaptures any contract enhancement it is simply retrieving its own assets and because a contract owners interest in the contract enhancement is not vested the contract owner has not been deprived of a proportionate share of the separate accounts assets ie a share of the separate accounts assets proportionate to the contract owners contract value  in addition applicants represent that it would be patently unfair to allow a contract owner exercising the freelook privilege to retain the contract enhancement amount under a contract that has been returned for a refund after a period of only a few days if the insurance companies could not recapture the contract enhancement individuals could purchase a contract with no intention of retaining it and simply return it for a quick profit furthermore applicants state that the recapture of the contract enhancement relating to withdrawals and to income payments within the first five or seven contract years is designed to protect the insurance companies against contract owners not holding the contract for a sufficient time period this recapture of the contract enhancement would provide the insurance companies with sufficient time to recover the cost of the contract enhancement and to avoid the financial detriment that would result from a shorter recapture period  applicants represent that it is not administratively feasible to track the contract enhancement amount in the separate accounts after the contract enhancements is applied accordingly the assetbased charges applicable to the separate accounts will be assessed against the entire amounts held in the separate accounts including any contract enhancement amounts as a result the aggregate assetbased charges assessed will be higher than those that would be charged if the contract owners contract value did not include any contract enhancement  applicants submit that the provisions for recapture of any contract enhancement under the contracts do not violate sections a and ia of the act sections e and i were added to the act to implement the purposes of the national securities markets improvement act of  and congressional intent the application of a contract enhancement to premium payments made under the contracts should not raise any questions as to compliance by the insurance companies with the provisions of section i however to avoid any uncertainty as to full compliance with the act applicants request an order providing an exemption from sections a and ia to the extent deemed necessary to permit the recapture of the contract enhancements under the circumstances described herein and in the application without the loss of relief from section  provided by section i  applicants state that section c of the act authorizes the commission to make rules and regulations applicable to registered investment companies and to principal underwriters of and dealers in the redeemable securities of any registered investment company to accomplish the same purposes as contemplated by section a rule c under the act prohibits a registered investment company issuing any redeemable security a person designated in such issuers prospectus as authorized to consummate transactions in any such security and a principal underwriter of or dealer in such security from selling redeeming or repurchasing any such security except at a price based on the current net asset value of such security which is next computed after receipt of a tender of such security for redemption or of an order to purchase or sell such security  applicants state that it is possible that someone might view the insurance companies recapture of the contract enhancements as resulting in the redemption of redeemable securities for a price other than one based on the current net asset value of the separate accounts applicants contend however that the recapture of the contract enhancement does not violate rule c the recapture of some or all of the contract enhancement does not involve either of the evils that section c and rule c were intended to eliminate or reduce as far as reasonably practicable namely i the dilution of the value of outstanding redeemable securities of registered investment companies through their sale at a price below net asset value or repurchase at a price above it and ii other unfair results including speculative trading practices to effect a recapture of a contract enhancement the insurance companies will redeem interests in a contract owners contract value at a price determined on the basis of the current net asset value of the jnl and jnlny separate accounts the amount recaptured will be less than or equal to the amount of the contract enhancement that the insurance companies paid out of its general account assets although contract owners will be entitled to retain any investment gains attributable to the contract enhancement and to bear any investment losses attributable to the contract enhancement the amount of such gains or losses will be determined on the basis of the current net asset values of the separate accounts thus no dilution will occur upon the recapture of the contract enhancement applicants also submit that the second harm that rule c was designed to address namely speculative trading practices calculated to take advantage of backward pricing will not occur as a result of the recapture of the contract enhancement because neither of the harms that rule c was meant to address is found in the recapture of the contract enhancement rule c should not apply to any contract enhancement however to avoid any uncertainty as to full compliance with rule c applicants request an order granting an exemption from the provisions of rule c to the extent deemed necessary to permit them to recapture the contract enhancement under the contracts  applicants submit that extending the requested relief to encompass future contracts and other accounts is appropriate in the public interest because it promotes competitiveness in the variable annuity market by eliminating the need to file redundant exemptive applications prior to introducing new variable annuity contracts investors would receive no benefit or additional protection by requiring applicants to repeatedly seek exemptive relief that would present no issues under the act not already addressed in the application  applicants submit for the reasons stated herein that their exemptive request meets the standards set out in section c of the act namely that the exemptions requested are appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act and that therefore the commission should grant the requested order for the commission by the division of investment management pursuant to delegated authority florence
