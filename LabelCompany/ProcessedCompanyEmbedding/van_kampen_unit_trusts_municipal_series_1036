portfolio investment objective the portfolio seeks total return consisting of high current income and potential capital appreciation principal investment strategy the portfolio seeks to achieve its objective by investing in a portfolio consisting of common stock of closedend investment companies known as closedend funds that invest significantly in equity or incomeproducing securities selected by cohen  steers capital management inc these closedend funds generally focus on incomeproducing securities sectors or strategies such as dividend strategies covered call option strategies total return strategies balanced strategies general equities including both dividend and nondividend paying equities convertible securities energy health care real estate utility and other incomeoriented strategies in selecting funds for the portfolio cohen  steers sought to identify funds that exhibited the following characteristics among others  daily trading volumes generally greater than  per day  closedend funds with market capitalization generally greater than  million  high current income  share prices at a discount to net asset value  undervalued funds where recent total return on market price trails recent total return on net asset value  strong fundamentals including liquidity income coverage and quality leveragerisk management cohen  steers believes that a conservative approach to leverage helps mitigate the effects of changes in interest rates  wellknown sponsors with experience managing the asset class  diversification of sector and asset class there can be no guarantee that a particular fund in the portfolio will satisfy the criteria set forth above cohen  steers believes that capital appreciation from equity and income focused closedend funds could come from three potential sources o a narrowing of fund share price discounts to net asset value assuming no change in fund net asset value o growth in fund share prices which mirrors growth in underlying portfolio net asset value with no change in the discount to net asset value and o increased dividenddistribution rates by closedend funds which attract investors and cause rising share prices cohen  steers believes that there is a compelling investment opportunity in the secondary market for closedend funds cohen  steers believes that five primary factors support this investment case including o rising demand for dividend income  cohen  steers believes that the potential for rising demand for dividend income exists due to the aging of america lower tax rates the inflation protection that may be offered by rising dividends and the low return environment of course there can be no assurance that the portfolio or the underlying funds will provide income in the future o growth in the number and types of closedend fund new issues  since  the closedend fund market has grown by over  billion to a total size in excess of  billion there are now over  listed closedend funds underlying asset classes have expanded to include significant volumes of funds focused on categories such as equity dividends covered call option writing reits utilities energy senior loan securities convertible securities and limited duration bonds o lack of research and institutional capital  historically activity in the closedend fund market has been dominated by individual investors with only a handful of professional investors and institutional sources of capital due to a variety of historical factors institutional participation in the closedend fund market currently remains low o need for professional selection  many investors and financial advisors do not have the time or resources to assess dividend quality leverage net asset value risk and historical market valuation to net asset value of closed end funds o discounts to net asset value  current discounts to net asset value in many funds and sectors may offer a timely opportunity to acquire attractive funds with income potential at a discount to their intrinsic value approximately  of the closedend funds in the portfolio are funds classified as nondiversified under the investment company act of  these funds have the ability to invest more than  of their assets in securities of a single issuer and may also own more than  of the outstanding voting securities of an issuer these factors could reduce diversification

other clients and the effect these activities may have on the securities in the portfolio principal risks as with all investments you can lose money by investing in this portfolio the portfolio also might not perform as well as you expect this can happen for reasons such as these o security prices will fluctuate the value of your investment may fall over time o a security issuer may be unwilling or unable to declare dividends in the future or may reduce the level of dividends declared this may reduce the level of dividends a closedend fund pays which would reduce your income and may cause the value of your units to fall o the financial condition of a security issuer may worsen or its credit ratings may drop resulting in a reduction in the value of your units this may occur at any point in time including during the primary offering period o the portfolio invests in shares of closedend funds you should understand the section titled closedend funds before you invest in particular shares

objective the portfolio seeks to provide high current income principal investment strategy the portfolio seeks to achieve its objective by investing in a portfolio primarily consisting of common stock of closedend investment companies known as closedend funds that invest in senior corporate loans or other debt securities of limited duration duration is a measure of the sensitivity of a debt securitys price to changes in interest rates expressed in years each year of duration represents an expected  percent change in the price of a security for every  percent change in interest rates ie a year duration means the security should fall about  percent in value if interest rates rise by  percent and vice versa higher durations signify greater price volatility approximately  of the closedend

primary offering period o the closedend funds held by the portfolio invest in senior loans although senior loans in which the closedend funds invest may be secured by specific collateral there can be no assurance that liquidation of collateral would satisfy the borrowers obligation in the event of nonpayment of scheduled principal or interest or that such collateral could be readily liquidated senior loans in which the closedend funds invest generally are of below investment grade credit quality may be unrated at the time of investment generally are not registered with the securities and

portfolio national series investment objective the portfolio seeks to provide income exempt from federal income tax principal investment strategy the portfolio seeks to achieve its objective by investing in a portfolio consisting of common stock of closedend investment companies known as closedend funds selected by cohen  steers capital management inc the portfolio consultant these closedend funds generally seek to invest in taxexempt municipal bonds income may be subject to the alternative minimum tax and state and local taxes the portfolio consultant sought to construct a welldiversified portfolio of leveraged closedend funds that have strong fundamentals and are sponsored by wellregarded managers in this asset class cohen  steers believes that the large number of national and single state municipal closedend funds  there are nearly  funds at this time  contribute to secondary market inefficiencies in this sector in selecting funds for the portfolio the portfolio consultant generally considered only funds with a tenday average daily trading volume greater than  and a market capitalization greater than  at the time of selection in general after screening out funds that did not meet the above criteria cohen  steers then applied a proprietary selection methodology for including funds in the portfolio the cohen  steers proprietary methodology evaluates a series of factors including but not limited to the following factors o current dividend yield o share price premiumdiscount to net asset value o amount and type of leverage in the capital structure o portfolio sensitivity to interest rate changes  theoretical and actual historical o use and percentage amount of interest rate swaps and other interest rate hedging strategies o estimate of fund earnings power o embedded dividend payment cushion o expense ratios o historical track record and o history with regard to dividend changes after evaluating each of the screened funds the portfolio consultant uses its proprietary valuation model to score each fund the cohen  steers closedend fund investment committee reviews the results of the screening process to select funds for inclusion in the portfolio funds advised by the sponsor the portfolio consultant and their affiliates were excluded from consideration for the portfolio in an effort to maintain independence in the portfolio selection process approximately  of the closedend funds in the portfolio are funds classified as nondiversified under the investment company act of  these funds have the ability to invest more than  of their assets in securities of a single issuer and may also own more than  of the outstanding voting securities of an issuer these factors could reduce diversification principal risks as with all investments you can lose money by investing in this portfolio the portfolio also might not perform as well as you expect this can happen for reasons such as these o security prices will fluctuate the value of your investment may fall over time o the value of the securities in the closedend funds will generally fall if interest rates in general rise no one can predict whether interest rates will rise or fall in the future o a security issuer may be unable to make interest andor principal payments in the future this may reduce the level of dividends a closedend fund pays which would reduce your income and cause the value of your units to fall o the financial condition of a security issuer may worsen or its credit ratings may drop resulting in a reduction in the value of your units this may occur at any point in time including during the primary offering period o the portfolio invests in shares of closedend funds you should understand the section titled closedend funds before you invest in particular shares of these funds tend to trade at a discount from their net asset value and are subject to risks related to factors such as the managers ability to achieve a funds

portfolios expenses but also the expenses of the underlying funds by investing in other funds the portfolio incurs greater expenses than you would incur if you invested directly in the funds o the closedend funds may invest in securities rated below investment grade and are considered to be junk securities these securities are considered to be speculative and are subject to greater market and credit risks accordingly the risk of default is higher than investment grade securities in addition these securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes and may be more likely to make early returns of principal o we do not actively manage the portfolio while the closedend funds have managed portfolios except in limited circumstances the portfolio will hold and continue to buy shares of

initial date of deposit provided that the additional deposits will be in amounts which will maintain as nearly as practicable the same percentage relationship among the number of shares of each security in the portfolio that existed immediately prior to the subsequent deposit investors may experience a dilution of their investments and a reduction in their anticipated income because of fluctuations in the prices of the securities between the time of the deposit and the purchase of the securities and because a portfolio will pay the associated brokerage or acquisition fees purchases and sales of securities by your portfolio may impact the value of the securities this may especially be the case during the initial offering of units upon portfolio termination and in the course of

prior to the initial date of deposit after the initial selection the securities may no longer meet the selection criteria should a security no longer meet the selection criteria we will generally not

securities in a portfolio taken as a whole which are represented by the units risk factors  all investments involve risk this section describes the main risks that can impact the value of the securities in your portfolio or in the underlying funds you should understand these risks before you invest if the value of the securities falls the value of your units will also fall we cannot guarantee that your portfolio will achieve its objective or that your investment return will be positive over any period market risk market risk is the risk that the value of the securities in your portfolio or in the underlying funds will fluctuate this could cause the value of your units to fall below your original purchase price market value fluctuates in response to various factors these can include changes in interest rates inflation the financial condition of a securitys issuer perceptions of the issuer or ratings on a security even though your portfolio is supervised you should remember that we do not manage your portfolio your portfolio will not sell a security solely because the market value falls as is possible in a managed fund dividend payment risk dividend payment risk is the risk that an issuer of a security is unwilling or unable to pay income on a security stocks represent ownership interests in the issuers and are not obligations of the issuers common stockholders have a right to receive dividends only after the company has provided for payment of its creditors bondholders and preferred stockholders common stocks do not assure dividend payments dividends are paid only when declared by an issuers board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk that the value of securities held by a closedend fund will fall if interest rates increase the securities held by the closedend funds typically fall in value when interest rates rise and rise in value when interest rates fall the securities held by the closedend funds with longer periods before maturity are often more sensitive to interest rate changes credit risk credit risk is the risk that a borrower is unable to meet its obligation to pay principal or interest on a security held by a closedend fund this may reduce the level of dividends a closedend fund pays which would reduce your income and could cause the value of your units to fall closedend funds each portfolio invests in shares of closedend funds you should understand the section titled closedend funds before you invest shares of closedend funds frequently trade at a discount from their net asset value in the secondary market this risk is separate and distinct from the risk that the net asset value of fund shares may decrease the amount of such discount from net asset value is subject to change from time to time in response to various factors closedend funds are subject to various risks including managements ability to meet the funds investment objective and to manage the fund portfolio when the underlying securities are redeemed or sold during periods of market turmoil and as investors perceptions regarding closedend funds or their underlying investments change the portfolios and the underlying funds have operating expenses you will bear not only your share of your portfolios expenses but also the expenses of the underlying funds by investing in other funds your portfolio incurs greater expenses than you would incur if you invested directly in the funds municipal bond risks each of the closedend funds held by the cohen  steers master municipal income portfolio  national series invests in taxexempt municipal bonds municipal bonds are debt obligations issued by states or by political subdivisions or authorities of states municipal bonds are typically designated as general obligation bonds which are general obligations of a governmental entity that are backed by the taxing power of such entity or revenue bonds which are payable from the income of a specific project or authority and are not supported by the issuers power to levy taxes municipal bonds are longterm fixed rate debt obligations that generally decline in value with increases in interest rates when an issuers financial condition worsens or when the rating on a bond is decreased many municipal bonds may be called or redeemed prior to their stated maturity an event which is more likely to occur when interest rates fall in such an occurrence a closedend fund may not be able to reinvest the money it receives in other bonds that have as high a yield or as long a maturity many municipal bonds are subject to continuing requirements as to the actual use of the bond proceeds or manner of operation of the project financed from bond proceeds that may affect the exemption of interest on such bonds from federal income taxation the market for municipal bonds is generally less liquid than for other securities and therefore the price of municipal bonds may be more volatile and subject to greater price fluctuations than securities with greater liquidity in addition an issuers ability to make income distributions generally depends on several factors including the financial condition of the issuer and general economic conditions any of these factors may negatively impact the price of municipal bonds held by a closedend fund and would therefore impact the price of both the fund shares and the units the funds invest primarily in municipal bonds that pay interest that is exempt from regular federal income tax and for statespecific funds from regular income tax of the applicable state notwithstanding the foregoing certain income from a fund may not qualify as taxexempt income and could be subject to federal state or local tax in addition income from the funds may be subject to the alternative minimum tax and may have other tax consequences eg they may affect the amount of social security benefits that are taxed capital gains and capital gain dividends if any will be subject to tax senior loans the closedend funds held by the senior loan and limited duration portfolio may invest in senior loans senior loans are issued by banks other financial institutions and other investors to corporations partnerships limited liability companies and other entities to finance leveraged buyouts recapitalizations mergers acquisitions stock repurchases debt refinancings and to a lesser extent for general operating and other purposes further information about senior loans appears in the following section entitled senior loan investments an investment by the closedend funds in senior loans involves risk that the borrowers under senior loans may default on their obligations to pay principal or interest when due although senior loans may be secured by specific collateral there can be no assurance that liquidation of collateral would satisfy the borrowers obligation in the event of nonpayment or that such collateral could be readily liquidated senior loans are typically structured as floating rate instruments in which the interest rate payable on the obligation fluctuates with interest rate changes as a result the yield on closedend funds investing in senior loans will generally decline in a falling interest rate environment and increase in a rising interest rate environment senior loans are generally below investment grade quality and may be unrated at the time of investment are generally not registered with the sec or state securities commissions and are generally not listed on any securities exchange in addition the amount of public information available on senior loans is generally less extensive than that available for other types of securities highyield security risk certain of the closedend funds held by the portfolios may invest in highyield securities or unrated securities highyield high risk securities are subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of loss than securities with higher investment ratings the value of these securities will decline significantly with increases in interest rates not only because increases in rates generally decrease values but also because increased rates may indicate an economic slowdown an economic slowdown or a reduction in an issuers creditworthiness may result in the issuer being unable to maintain earnings at a level sufficient to maintain interest and principal payments highyield or junk securities the generic names for securities rated below bbb by standard  poors or baa by moodys are frequently issued by corporations in the growth stage of their development or by established companies who are highly leveraged or whose operations or industries are depressed securities rated below bbb or baa are considered speculative as these ratings indicate a quality of less than investment grade because highyield securities are generally subordinated obligations and are perceived by investors to be riskier than higher rated securities their prices tend to fluctuate more than higher rated securities and are affected by shortterm credit developments to a greater degree the market for highyield securities is smaller and less liquid than that for investment grade securities highyield securities are generally not listed on a national securities exchange but trade in the overthecounter markets due to the smaller less liquid market for highyield securities the bidoffer spread on such securities is generally greater than it is for investment grade securities and the purchase or sale of such securities may take longer to complete foreign issuer risk some of the underlying securities held by certain of the closedend funds in your portfolio may be issued by foreign issuers this subjects your portfolio to more risks than if it only invested in closedend funds which invest solely in securities of domestic issuers risks of foreign issuers include restrictions on foreign investments and exchange of securities and inadequate financial information foreign securities may also be affected by market and political factors specific to the issuers country as well as fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates risks associated with investing in foreign securities may be more pronounced in emerging markets where the securities markets are substantially smaller less developed less liquid less regulated and more volatile than the securities markets of the us and developed foreign markets investments in debt securities of foreign governments present special risks including the fact that issuers may be unable or unwilling to repay principal andor interest when due in accordance with the terms of such debt or may be unable to make such repayments when due in the currency required under the terms of the debt political economic and social events also may have a greater impact on the price of debt securities issued by foreign governments than on the price of us securities in addition brokerage and other transaction costs on foreign securities exchanges are often higher than in the united states and there is generally less government supervision and regulation of exchanges brokers and issuers in foreign countries liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk that the value of a security will fall if trading in the security is limited or absent no one can guarantee that a liquid trading market will exist for any security no fdic guarantee an investment in your portfolio is not a deposit of any bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency senior loan investments  the senior loan and limited duration portfolio invests significantly in closedend funds that invest in secured senior loans to corporations partnerships and other business entities these loans are backed by a companys assets and have a senior position in a companys capital structure ahead of other types of debt securities as well as preferred and common stock additionally the interest rates on senior loans generally float over published interest rate indices which can move up or down with market rate movements senior secured loans generally hold the most senior position in a borrowers capital structure and are typically backed by assets such as inventory receivables real estate property buildings these assets can also include intellectual property such as patents or trademarks and even the stock of other companies or subsidiaries in addition while secured creditors generally receive greater protection in insolvency situations there is no assurance that collateral will be sufficient to repay interest andor principal in such situations secured senior loans have historically paid a higher rate of interest than most shortterm investments the underlying loan rates float above indices such as the prime rate offered by one or more major banks the london interbank offered rate libor or the certificate of deposit rate or other base lending rates used by commercial lenders as a result the interest rates realized by the closedend funds held by the portfolio will generally adjust up or down with changes in interest rates since secured senior loans generally have floating interest rates they are typically not as sensitive as fixedincome investments to price fluctuations due to changes in interest rates of course there is no guarantee that this will occur in the future closedend funds  closedend funds are a type of investment company that hold an actively managed portfolio of securities closedend funds issue shares in closedend offerings which generally trade on a stock exchange although some closedend fund shares are not listed on a securities exchange the funds in the portfolios all are currently listed on a securities exchange since closedend funds maintain a relatively fixed pool of investment capital portfolio managers may be better able to adhere to their investment philosophies through greater flexibility and control in addition closedend funds dont have to manage fund liquidity to meet potentially large redemptions closedend funds are subject to various risks including managements ability to meet the closedend funds investment objective and to manage the closedend fund portfolio when the underlying securities are redeemed or sold during periods of market turmoil and as investors perceptions regarding closedend funds or their underlying investments change shares of closedend funds frequently trade at a discount from their net asset value in the secondary market this risk is separate and distinct from the risk that the net asset value of closedend fund shares may decrease the amount of such discount from net asset value is subject to change from time to time in response to various factors the closedend funds included in the portfolios may employ the use of leverage in their portfolios through the issuance of preferred stock or other methods while leverage often serves to increase the yield of a closedend fund this leverage also subjects the closedend fund to increased risks these risks may include the likelihood of increased volatility and the possibility that the closedend funds common share income will fall if the dividend rate on the preferred shares or the interest rate on any borrowings rises certain of the funds in the portfolios may be classified as nondiversified under the investment company act of  these funds have the ability to invest more than  of their assets in securities of a single issuer which could reduce diversification only the trustee may vote the shares of the closedend funds held in the portfolios the trustee will vote the shares in the same general proportion as shares held by other shareholders of each fund your portfolio is generally required however to reject any offer for securities or other property in exchange for portfolio securities as described under portfolio administrationportfolio administration public offering  general units are offered at the public offering price which includes the net assets value per unit plus organization costs plus the sales charge the net asset value per unit is the value of the securities cash and other assets in your portfolio reduced by the liabilities of the portfolio divided by the total units outstanding the maximum sales charge equals  of the public offering price per unit at the time of purchase you pay the initial sales charge at the time you buy units the initial sales charge is the difference between the total sales charge percentage maximum of  of the public offering price per unit and the sum of the remaining fixed dollar deferred sales charge and the total fixed dollar creation and development fee the initial sales charge will be approximately  of the public offering price per unit depending on the public offering price per unit the deferred sales charge is fixed at  per unit your portfolio pays the deferred sales charge in installments as described in the fee table if any deferred sales charge payment date is not a business day we will charge the payment on the next business day if you purchase units after the initial deferred sales charge payment you will only pay that portion of the payments not yet collected if you redeem or sell your units prior to collection of the total deferred sales charge you will pay any remaining deferred sales charge upon redemption or sale of your units the initial and deferred sales charges are referred to as the transactional sales charge the transactional sales charge does not include the creation and development fee which compensates the sponsor for creating and developing your portfolio and is described under expenses the creation and development fee is fixed at  per unit your portfolio pays the creation and development fee as the close of the initial offering period as described in the fee table if you redeem or sell your units prior to collection of the creation and development fee you will not pay the creation and development fee upon redemption or sale of your units because the deferred sales charge and creation and development fee are fixed dollar amounts per unit the actual charges will exceed the percentages shown in the fee table if the public offering price per unit falls below  and will be less than the percentages shown in the fee table if the public offering price per unit exceeds  in no event will the maximum total sales charge exceed  of the public offering price per unit since the deferred sales charge and creation and development fee are fixed dollar amounts per unit your portfolio must charge these amounts per unit regardless of any decrease in net asset value however if the public offering price per unit falls to the extent that the maximum sales charge percentage results in a dollar amount that is less than the combined fixed dollar amounts of the deferred sales charge and creation and development fee your initial sales charge will be a credit equal to the amount by which these fixed dollar charges exceed your sales charge at the time you buy units in such a situation the value of securities per unit would exceed the public offering price per unit by the amount of the initial sales charge credit and the value of those securities will fluctuate which could result in a benefit or detriment to unitholders that purchase units at that price the initial sales charge credit is paid by the sponsor and is not paid by your portfolio the fee table shows the sales charge calculation at a  public offering price per unit and the following examples illustrate the sales charge at prices below and above  if the public offering price per unit fell to  the maximum sales charge would be   of the public offering price per unit which consists of an initial sales charge of  a deferred sales charge of  and a creation and development fee of  if the public offering price per unit rose to  the maximum sales charge would be   of the public offering price per unit consisting of an initial sales charge of  a deferred sales charge of  and the creation and development fee of  beginning on april   the secondary market sales charge will be  and will not include deferred payments this sales charge will reduce by  on each subsequent april  to a minimum of  the actual sales charge that may be paid by an investor may differ slightly from the sales charges shown herein due to rounding that occurs in the calculation of the public offering price and in the number of units purchased the minimum purchase is  units  units for retirement accounts but may vary by selling firm certain brokerdealers or selling firms may charge an order handling fee for processing unit purchases reducing

you may not combine discounts since the deferred sales charge and creation and development fee are fixed dollar amounts per unit your portfolio must charge these amounts per unit regardless of any discounts however if you are eligible to receive a discount such that your total sales charge is less than the fixed dollar amounts of the deferred sales charge and creation and development fee you will receive a credit equal to the difference between your total sales charge and these fixed dollar charges at the time you buy units large quantity purchases you can reduce your sales charge by increasing the size of your investment if you purchase the amount of units shown in the table below during the initial offering period the sales charge will be as follows transaction amount sales

having defaulted on payment of any of its outstanding obligations or the price of a security has declined to such an extent or other credit factors exist so that in the opinion of the supervisor retention of the security would be detrimental to a portfolio if a public tender offer has been made for a security or a merger or acquisition has been announced affecting a security the trustee may

of the main us federal income tax consequences of owning units of the portfolio this section is current as of the date of this prospectus tax laws and interpretations change frequently and these summaries do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers for example these summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are a corporation a nonus person a brokerdealer or other investor with special circumstances in addition this section does not describe your state local or foreign tax consequences this federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice and opinion of counsel to the sponsor the internal revenue service could disagree with any conclusions set forth in this section in addition our counsel was not asked to review and has not reached a conclusion with respect to the federal income tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in the portfolio this may not be sufficient for you to use for the purpose of avoiding penalties under federal tax law as with any investment you should seek advice based on your individual circumstances from your own tax advisor assets of the portfolio the portfolio is expected to hold one or more of the following i shares of stock in corporations the stocks that are treated as equity for federal income tax purposes and ii shares the ric shares in funds qualifying as regulated investment companies rics that are treated as interests in regulated investment companies for federal income tax purposes it is possible that the portfolio will also hold other assets including assets that are treated differently for federal income tax purposes from those described above in which case you will have federal income tax consequences different from or in addition to those described in this section all of the assets held by the portfolio constitute the portfolio assets neither our counsel nor we have analyzed the proper federal income tax treatment of the portfolio assets and thus neither our counsel nor we have reached a conclusion regarding the federal income tax treatment of the portfolio assets portfolio status if the portfolio is at all times operated in accordance with the documents establishing the portfolio and certain requirements of federal income tax law are met the portfolio will not be taxed as a corporation for federal income tax purposes as a unit owner you will be treated as the owner of a pro rata portion of each of the portfolio assets and as such you will be considered to have received a pro rata share of income eg dividends and capital gains if any from each portfolio asset when such income would be considered to be received by you if you directly owned the portfolio assets this is true even if you elect to have your distributions reinvested into additional units in addition the income from portfolio assets that you must take into account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced by amounts used to pay sales charges or portfolio expenses your tax basis and income or loss upon disposition if your portfolio disposes of portfolio assets you will generally recognize gain or loss if you dispose of your units or redeem your units for cash you will also generally recognize gain or loss to determine the amount of this gain or loss you must subtract your tax basis in the related portfolio assets from your share of the total amount received in the transaction you can generally determine your initial tax basis in each portfolio asset by apportioning the cost of your units including sales charges among the portfolio assets ratably according to their values on the date you acquire your units in certain circumstances however you may have to adjust your tax basis after you acquire your units for example in the case of certain dividends that exceed a corporations accumulated earnings and profits as discussed below if you are an individual the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain is generally  generally  for certain taxpayers in the  and  tax brackets these capital gains rates are generally effective for taxable years beginning before january   for later periods if you are an individual the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain is generally   for certain taxpayers in the  and  tax brackets the  rate is reduced to  and the  rate is reduced to  for longterm capital gains from most property acquired after december   with a holding period of more than five years net capital gain equals net longterm capital gain minus net shortterm capital loss for the taxable year capital gain or loss is longterm if the holding period for the asset is more than one year and is shortterm if the holding period for the asset is one year or less you must exclude the date you purchase your units to determine your holding period the tax rates for capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as for ordinary income the internal revenue code however treats certain capital gains as ordinary income in special situations dividends from stocks certain dividends received with respect to the stocks may qualify to be taxed at the same rates that apply to net capital gain as discussed above provided certain holding period requirements are satisfied these special rules relating to the taxation of dividends at capital gains rates generally apply to taxable years beginning before january   dividends from ric shares some dividends on the ric shares may be designated as capital gain dividends generally taxable to you as longterm capital gains other dividends on the ric shares will generally be taxable to you as ordinary income certain ordinary income dividends from a ric may qualify to be taxed at the same rates that apply to net capital gain as discussed above provided certain holding period requirements are satisfied and provided the dividends are attributable to qualifying dividends received by the ric itself these special rules relating to the taxation of ordinary income dividends from regulated investment companies generally apply to taxable years beginning before january   regulated investment companies are required to provide notice to their shareholders of the amount of any distribution that may be taken into account as a dividend that is eligible for the capital gains tax rates if you hold a unit for six months or less or if your portfolio holds a ric share for six months or less any loss incurred by you related to the disposition of such ric share will be treated as a longterm capital loss to the extent of any longterm capital gain distributions received or deemed to have been received with respect to such ric share distributions of income or capital gains declared on the ric shares in october november or december will be deemed to have been paid to you on december  of the year they are declared even when paid by the ric during the following january dividends received deduction a corporation that owns units generally will not be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to many dividends received by the portfolio because the dividends received deduction is generally not available for dividends from most foreign corporations or from rics however certain dividends on the ric shares that are attributable to dividends received by the ric from certain domestic corporations may be designated by the ric as being eligible for the dividends received deduction inkind distributions under certain circumstances as described in this prospectus you may request an inkind distribution of portfolio assets when you redeem your units by electing to receive an inkind distribution you will receive portfolio assets plus possibly cash you will not recognize gain or loss if you only receive whole portfolio assets in exchange for the identical amount of your pro rata portion of the same portfolio assets held by your portfolio however if you also receive cash in exchange for a portfolio asset or a fractional portion of a portfolio asset you will generally recognize gain or loss based on the difference between the amount of cash you receive and your tax basis in such portfolio asset or fractional portion exchanges if you elect to have your proceeds from your portfolio rolled over into a future portfolio it is considered a sale for federal income tax purposes and any gain on the sale will be treated as a capital gain and any loss will be treated as a capital loss however any loss you incur in connection with the exchange of your units of your portfolio for units of a new portfolio will generally be disallowed with respect to this deemed sale and subsequent deemed repurchase to the extent the two portfolios have substantially identical portfolio assets under the wash sale provisions of the internal revenue code limitations on the deductibility of portfolio expenses generally for federal income tax purposes you must take into account your full pro rata share of your portfolios income even if some of that income is used to pay portfolio expenses you may deduct your pro rata share of each expense paid by your portfolio to the same extent as if you directly paid the expense you may be required to treat some or all of the expenses of your portfolio as miscellaneous itemized deductions individuals may only deduct certain miscellaneous itemized deductions to the extent they exceed  of adjusted gross income foreign taxes distributions by your portfolio that are treated as us source income eg dividends received on stocks of domestic corporations will generally be subject to us income taxation and withholding in the case of units held by nonresident alien individuals foreign corporations or other nonus persons subject to any applicable treaty if you are a foreign investor ie an investor other than a us citizen or resident or a us corporation partnership estate or portfolio you may not be subject to us federal income taxes including withholding taxes on some of the income from your portfolio or on any gain from the sale or redemption of your units provided that certain conditions are met you should consult your tax advisor with respect to the conditions you must meet in order to be exempt for us tax purposes you should also consult your tax advisor with respect to other us tax withholding and reporting requirements some distributions by your portfolio may be subject to foreign withholding taxes any income withheld will still be treated as income to you under the grantor portfolio rules you are considered to have paid directly your share of any foreign taxes that are paid therefore for us tax purposes you may be entitled to a foreign tax credit or deduction for those foreign taxes under certain circumstances a ric may elect to pass through to its shareholders certain foreign taxes paid by the ric if the ric makes this election with respect to ric shares you must include in your income for federal income tax

portfolio status your portfolio intends to qualify as a regulated investment company under the federal tax laws if your portfolio qualifies as a regulated investment company and distributes its income as required by the tax law the portfolio generally will not pay federal income taxes distributions portfolio distributions are generally taxable after the end of each year you will receive a tax statement that separates your portfolios distributions into two categories ordinary income distributions and capital gains dividends ordinary income distributions are generally taxed at your ordinary tax rate however as further discussed below certain ordinary income distributions received from your portfolio may be taxed at the capital gains tax rates generally you will treat all capital gains dividends as longterm capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your units to determine your actual tax liability for your capital gains dividends you must calculate your total net capital gain or loss for the tax year after considering all of your other taxable transactions as described below in addition your portfolio may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes and thus will generally not be taxable to you the tax status of your distributions from your portfolio is not affected by whether you reinvest your distributions in additional units or receive them in cash the income from your portfolio that you must take into account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced by amounts used to pay a deferred sales charge if any the tax laws may require you to treat distributions made to you in january as if you had received them on december  of the previous year dividends received deduction a corporation that owns units generally will not be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to many dividends received from your portfolio because the dividends received deduction is generally not available for distributions from regulated investment companies however certain ordinary income dividends on units that are attributable to qualifying dividends received by your portfolio from certain corporations may be designated by the portfolio as being eligible for the dividends received deduction sale or redemption of units if you sell or redeem your units you will generally recognize a taxable gain or loss to determine the amount of this gain or loss you must subtract your tax basis in your units from the amount you receive in the transaction your tax basis in your units is generally equal to the cost of your units generally including sales charges in some cases however you may have to adjust your tax basis after you purchase your units capital gains and losses and certain ordinary income dividends if you are an individual the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain is generally  generally  for certain taxpayers in the  and  tax brackets these new capital gains rates are generally effective for taxable years beginning before january   for later periods if you are an individual the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain is generally   for certain taxpayers in the

capital gain equals net longterm capital gain minus net shortterm capital loss for the taxable year capital gain or loss is longterm if the holding period for the asset is more than one year and is shortterm if the holding period for the asset is one year or less you must exclude the date you purchase your units to determine your holding period however if you receive a capital gain dividend from your portfolio and sell your units at a loss after holding it for six months or less the loss will be recharacterized as longterm capital loss to the extent of the capital gain dividend received the tax rates for capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as for ordinary income the internal revenue code treats certain capital gains as ordinary income in special situations ordinary income dividends received by an individual shareholder from a regulated investment company such as your portfolio are generally taxed at the same rates that apply to net capital gain as discussed above provided certain holding period requirements are satisfied and provided the dividends are attributable to qualifying dividends received by the portfolio itself these special rules relating to the taxation of ordinary income dividends from regulated investment companies generally apply to taxable years beginning before january   your portfolio will provide notice to its unitholders of the amount of any distribution which may be taken into account as a dividend which is eligible for these capital gains tax rates inkind distributions under certain circumstances as described in this prospectus you may receive an inkind distribution of portfolio securities when you redeem units this distribution is subject to taxation and you will recognize gain or loss generally based on the value at that time of the securities and the amount of cash received rollovers and exchanges if you elect to have your proceeds from your portfolio rolled over into a future trust it is considered a sale for federal income tax purposes and any gain on the sale will be treated as a capital gain and any loss will be treated as a capital loss however any loss realized on a sale or exchange will be disallowed to the extent that units disposed of are replaced including through reinvestment of dividends within a period of  days beginning  days before and ending  days after disposition of units or to the extent that the unitholder during such period acquires or enters into an option or contract to acquire substantially identical stock or securities in such a case the basis of the units acquired will be adjusted to reflect the disallowed loss deductibility of portfolio expenses generally expenses incurred by your portfolio will be deducted from the gross income received by your portfolio and only your share of the portfolios net income will be paid to you and reported as taxable income to you however if the units of your portfolio are held by fewer than  unitholders at any time during a taxable year your portfolio will generally not be able to deduct certain expenses from income thus resulting in your reported share of the portfolios taxable income being increased by your share of those expenses even though you do not receive a corresponding cash distribution in this case you may be able to take a deduction for these expenses however certain miscellaneous itemized deductions such as investment expenses may be deducted by individuals only to the extent that all of these deductions exceed  of the individuals adjusted gross income foreign tax credit if your portfolio invests in any foreign securities the tax statement that you receive may include an item showing foreign taxes your portfolio paid to other countries in this case

table of contents page risk factors  the portfolios  sponsor information  trustee information  taxation  portfolio termination  van kampen investments risk factors closedend funds closedend funds portfolios are managed and their shares are generally listed on a securities exchange the net asset value of closedend fund shares will fluctuate with changes in the value of the underlying securities that the closedend fund owns in addition for various reasons closedend fund shares frequently trade at a discount from their net asset value in the secondary market the amount of such discount from net asset value is subject to change from time to time in response to various factors closedend funds articles of incorporation may contain certain antitakeover provisions that may have the effect of inhibiting a funds possible conversion to openend status and limiting the ability of other persons to acquire control of a fund in certain circumstances these provisions might also inhibit the ability of stockholders including the portfolios to sell their shares at a premium over prevailing market prices this characteristic is a risk separate and distinct from the risk that a funds net asset value will decrease in particular this characteristic would increase the loss or reduce the return on the sale of those closedend fund shares that were purchased by the portfolios at a premium in the unlikely event that a closedend fund converts to openend status at a time when its shares are trading at a premium there would be an immediate loss in value to the portfolios since shares of openend funds trade at net asset value certain closedend funds may have in place or may put in place in the future plans pursuant to which the fund may repurchase its own shares in the marketplace typically these plans are put in place in an attempt by a funds board of directors to reduce a discount on its share price to the extent that such a plan is implemented and shares owned by the portfolios are repurchased by a fund the portfolios position in that fund will be reduced and the cash will be distributed the portfolios are prohibited from subscribing to a rights offering for shares of any of the closedend funds in which it invests in the event of a rights offering for additional shares of a fund unitholders should expect that a portfolio will at the completion of the offer own a smaller proportional interest in such fund that would otherwise be the case it is not possible to determine the extent of this dilution in share ownership without knowing what proportion of the shares in a rights offering will be subscribed this may be particularly serious when the subscription price per share for the offer is less than the funds net asset value per share assuming that all rights are exercised and there is no change in the net asset value per share the aggregate net asset value of each shareholders shares of common stock should decrease as a result of the offer if a funds subscription price per share is below that funds net asset value per share at the expiration of the offer shareholders would experience an immediate dilution of the aggregate net asset value of their shares of common stock as a result of the offer which could be substantial closedend funds may use leveraging in their portfolios leveraging can be expected to cause increased price volatility for those funds shares and as a result increased volatility for the price of the units of a portfolio there can be no assurance that a leveraging strategy will be successful during any period in which it is employed municipal bonds the closedend funds in the portfolio invest in certain types of bonds described below accordingly an investment in the portfolio should be made with an understanding of the characteristics of and risks associated with such bonds certain of the bonds in a closedend fund may be general obligations of a governmental entity that are backed by the taxing power of such entity other bonds are revenue bonds payable from the income of a specific project or authority and are not supported by the issuers power to levy taxes general obligation bonds are secured by the issuers pledge of its faith credit and taxing power for the payment of principal and interest revenue bonds on the other hand are payable only from the revenues derived from a particular facility or class of facilities or in some cases from the proceeds of a special excise tax or other specific revenue source there are of course variations in the security of the different bonds in a closedend fund both within a particular classification and between classifications depending on numerous factors certain of the bonds in a closedend fund may be obligations which derive their payments from mortgage loans certain of such housing bonds may be fha insured or may be single family mortgage revenue bonds issued for the purpose of acquiring from originating financial institutions notes secured by mortgages on residences located within the issuers boundaries and owned by persons of low or moderate income mortgage loans are generally partially or completely prepaid prior to their final maturities as a result of events such as sale of the mortgaged premises default condemnation or casualty loss because these bonds are subject to extraordinary mandatory redemption in whole or in part from such prepayments of mortgage loans a substantial portion of such bonds will probably be redeemed prior to their scheduled maturities or even prior to their ordinary call dates extraordinary mandatory redemption without premium could also result from the failure of the originating financial institutions to make mortgage loans in sufficient amounts within a specified time period additionally unusually high rates of default on the underlying mortgage loans may reduce revenues available for the payment of principal of or interest on such mortgage revenue bonds these bonds were issued under section a of the internal revenue code which section contains certain requirements relating to the use of the proceeds of such bonds in order for the interest on such bonds to retain its taxexempt status in each case the issuer of the bonds has covenanted to comply with applicable requirements and bond counsel to such issuer has issued an opinion that the interest on the bonds is exempt from federal income tax under existing laws and regulations certain issuers of housing bonds have considered various ways to redeem bonds they have issued prior to the stated first redemption dates for such bonds certain of the bonds in a closedend fund may be health care revenue bonds ratings of bonds issued for health care facilities are often based on feasibility studies that contain projections of occupancy levels revenues and expenses a facilitys gross receipts and net income available for debt service may be affected by future events and conditions including among other things demand for services and the ability of the facility to provide the services required physicians confidence in the facility management capabilities competition with other health care facilities efforts by insurers and governmental agencies to limit rates legislation establishing state ratesetting agencies expenses the cost and possible unavailability of malpractice insurance the funding of medicare medicaid and other similar third party pay or programs government regulation and the termination or restriction of governmental financial assistance including that associated with medicare medicaid and other similar third party pay or programs certain of the bonds in a closedend fund may be obligations of public utility issuers including those selling wholesale and retail electric power and gas general problems of such issuers would include the difficulty in financing large construction programs in an inflationary period the limitations on operations and increased costs and delays attributable to environmental considerations the difficulty of the capital market in absorbing utility debt the difficulty in obtaining fuel at reasonable prices and the effect of energy conservation in addition federal state and municipal governmental authorities may from time to time review existing and impose additional regulations governing the licensing construction and operation of nuclear power plants which may adversely affect the ability of the issuers of certain of the bonds in a closedend fund to make payments of principal andor interest on such bonds certain of the bonds in a closedend fund may be obligations of issuers whose revenues are derived from the sale of water andor sewerage services such bonds are generally payable from user fees the problems of such issuers include the ability to obtain timely and adequate rate increases population decline resulting in decreased user fees the difficulty of financing large construction programs the limitations on operations and increased costs and delays attributable to environmental considerations the increasing difficulty of obtaining or discovering new supplies of fresh water the effect of conservation programs and the impact of nogrowth zoning ordinances certain of the bonds in a closedend fund may be industrial revenue bonds irbs irbs have generally been issued under bond resolutions pursuant to which the revenues and receipts payable under the arrangements with the operator of a particular project have been assigned and pledged to purchasers in some cases a mortgage on the underlying project may have been granted as security for the irbs regardless of the structure payment of irbs is solely dependent upon the creditworthiness of the corporate operator of the project or corporate guarantor corporate operators or guarantors may be affected by many factors which may have an adverse impact on the credit quality of the particular company or industry these include cyclicality of revenues and earnings regulatory and environmental restrictions litigation resulting from accidents or environmentallycaused illnesses extensive competition and financial deterioration resulting from a corporate restructuring pursuant to a leveraged buyout takeover or otherwise such a restructuring may result in the operator of a project becoming highly leveraged which may impact on such operators creditworthiness which in turn would have an adverse impact on the rating andor market value of such bonds further the possibility of such a restructuring may have an adverse impact on the market for and consequently the value of such bonds even though no actual takeover or other action is ever contemplated or effected certain of the bonds in a closedend fund may be obligations that are secured by lease payments of a governmental entity hereinafter called lease obligations lease obligations are often in the form of certificates of participation although the lease obligations do not constitute general obligations of the municipality for which the municipalitys taxing power is pledged a lease obligation is ordinarily backed by the municipalitys covenant to appropriate for and make the payments due under the lease obligation however certain lease obligations contain nonappropriation clauses which provide that the municipality has no obligation to make lease payments in future years unless money is appropriated for such purpose on a yearly basis a governmental entity that enters into such a lease agreement cannot obligate future governments to appropriate for and make lease payments but covenants to take such action as is necessary to include any lease payments due in its budgets and to make the appropriations therefor a governmental entitys failure to appropriate for and to make payments under its lease obligation could result in insufficient funds available for payment of the obligations secured thereby although nonappropriation lease obligations are secured by the leased property disposition of the property in the event of foreclosure might prove difficult certain of the bonds in a closedend fund may be obligations of issuers which are or which govern the operation of schools colleges and universities and whose revenues are derived mainly from ad valorem taxes or for higher education systems from tuition dormitory revenues grants and endowments general problems relating to school bonds include litigation contesting the state constitutionality of financing public education in part from ad valorem taxes thereby creating a disparity in educational funds available to schools in wealthy areas and schools in poor areas litigation or legislation on this issue may affect the sources of funds available for the payment of school bonds general problems relating to college and university obligations include the prospect of a declining percentage of the population consisting of college age individuals possible inability to raise tuitions and fees sufficiently to cover increased operating costs the uncertainty of continued receipt of federal grants and state funding and government legislation or regulations which may adversely affect the revenues or costs of such issuers certain of the bonds in a closedend fund may be obligations which are payable from and secured by revenues derived from the ownership and operation of facilities such as airports bridges turnpikes port authorities convention centers and arenas the major portion of an airports gross operating income is generally derived from fees received from signatory airlines pursuant to use agreements which consist of annual payments for leases occupancy of certain terminal space and service fees airport operating income may therefore be affected by the ability of the airlines to meet their obligations under the use agreements from time to time the air transport industry has experienced significant variations in earnings and traffic due to increased competition excess capacity increased costs deregulation traffic constraints and other factors and several airlines have experienced severe financial difficulties similarly payment on bonds related to other facilities is dependent on revenues from the projects such as user fees from ports tolls on turnpikes and bridges and rents from buildings therefore payment may be adversely affected by reduction in revenues due to such factors as increased cost of maintenance decreased use of a facility lower cost of alternative modes of transportation scarcity of fuel and reduction or loss of rents certain of the bonds in a closedend fund may be obligations which are payable from and secured by revenues derived from the operation of resource recovery facilities resource recovery facilities are designed to process solid waste generate steam and convert steam to electricity resource recovery bonds may be subject to extraordinary optional redemption at par upon the occurrence of certain circumstances including but not limited to destruction or condemnation of a project contracts relating to a project becoming void unenforceable or impossible to perform changes in the economic availability of raw materials operating supplies or facilities necessary for the operation of a project or technological or other unavoidable changes adversely affecting the operation of a project and administrative or judicial actions which render contracts relating to the projects void unenforceable or impossible to perform or impose unreasonable burdens or excessive liabilities the sponsor cannot predict the causes or likelihood of the redemption of resource recovery bonds prior to the stated maturity of the bonds certain of the bonds in a closedend fund may be subject to redemption prior to their stated maturity date pursuant to sinking fund provisions call provisions or extraordinary optional or mandatory redemption provisions or otherwise a sinking fund is a reserve fund accumulated over a period of time for retirement of debt a callable debt obligation is one which is subject to redemption or refunding prior to maturity at the option of the issuer a refunding is a method by which a debt obligation is redeemed at or before maturity by the proceeds of a new debt obligation in general call provisions are more likely to be exercised when the offering side valuation is at a premium over par than when it is at a discount from par the exercise of redemption or call provisions will result in the distribution of principal and may result in a reduction in the amount of subsequent interest distributions extraordinary optional redemptions and mandatory redemptions result from the happening of certain events generally events that may permit the extraordinary optional redemption of bonds or may require the mandatory redemption of bonds include among others a final determination that the interest on the bonds is taxable the substantial damage or destruction by fire or other casualty of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used an exercise by a local state or federal governmental unit of its power of eminent domain to take all or substantially all of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used changes in the economic availability of raw materials operating supplies or facilities or technological or other changes which render the operation of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used uneconomic changes in law or an administrative or judicial decree which renders the performance of the agreement under which the proceeds of the bonds were made available to finance the project impossible or which creates unreasonable burdens or which imposes excessive liabilities such as taxes not imposed on the date the bonds are issued on the issuer of the bonds or the user of the proceeds of the bonds an administrative or judicial decree which requires the cessation of a substantial part of the operations of the project financed with the proceeds of the bonds an overestimate of the costs of the project to be financed with the proceeds of the bonds resulting in excess proceeds of the bonds which may be applied to redeem bonds or an underestimate of a source of funds securing the bonds resulting in excess funds which may be applied to redeem bonds the issuer of certain bonds in a closedend fund may have sold or reserved the right to sell upon the satisfaction of certain conditions to third parties all or any portion of its rights to call bonds in accordance with the stated redemption provisions of such bonds in such a case the issuer no longer has the right to call the bonds for redemption unless it reacquires the rights from such third party a third party pursuant to these rights may exercise the redemption provisions with respect to a bond at a time when the issuer of the bond might not have called a bond for redemption had it not sold such rights no one can predict all of the circumstances which may result in such redemption of an issue of bonds see also the discussion of single family mortgage and multifamily revenue bonds above for more information on the call provisions of such bonds senior loans the closedend funds in a portfolio may invest in senior loans issued by banks other financial institutions and other investors to corporations partnerships limited liability companies and other entities to finance leveraged buyouts recapitalizations mergers acquisitions stock repurchases debt refinancings and to a lesser extent for general operating and other purposes senior loans in which the closedend funds invest o generally are of below investment grade credit quality o may be unrated at the time of investment o generally are not registered with the sec or any state securities commission and o generally are not listed on any securities exchange an investment by closedend funds in senior loans involves risk that the borrowers under senior loans may default on their obligations to pay principal or interest when due although senior loans may be secured by specific collateral there can be no assurance that liquidation of collateral would satisfy the borrowers obligation in the event of nonpayment or that such collateral could be readily liquidated senior loans are typically structured as floating rate instruments in which the interest rate payable on the obligation fluctuates with interest rate changes as a result the yield on closedend funds investing in senior loans will generally decline in a falling interest rate environment and increase in a rising interest rate environment the amount of public information available on senior loans generally will be less extensive than that available for other types of assets no reliable active trading market currently exists for many senior loans although a secondary market for certain senior loans has developed over the past several years senior loans are thus relatively illiquid liquidity relates to the ability of a closedend fund to sell an investment in a timely manner at a price approximately equal to its value on the closedend funds books the illiquidity of senior loans may impair a closedend funds ability to realized the full value of its assets in the event of a voluntary or involuntary liquidation of such assets because of the lack of an active trading market illiquid securities are also difficult to value and prices provided by external pricing services may not reflect the true value of the securities however many senior loans are of a large principal amount and are held by a large number of financial institutions to the extent that a secondary market does exist for certain senior loans the market may be subject to irregular trading activity wide bidask spreads and extended trade settlement periods the market for senior loans could be disrupted in the event of an economic downturn or a substantial increase or decrease in interest rates this could result in increased volatility in the market and in a portfolios net asset value if legislation or state or federal regulators impose additional requirements or restrictions on the ability of financial institutions to make loans that are considered highly leveraged transactions the availability of senior loans for investment by the closedend funds may be adversely affected in addition such requirements or restrictions could reduce or eliminate sources of financing for certain borrowers this would increase the risk of default if legislation or federal or state regulators require financial institutions to dispose of senior loans that are considered highly leveraged transactions or subject such senior loans to increased regulatory scrutiny financial institutions may determine to sell such senior loans such sales could result in depressed prices if a closedend fund attempts to sell a senior loan at a time when a financial institution is engaging in such a sale the price a closedend fund could get for the senior loan may be adversely affected some senior loans are subject to the risk that a court pursuant to fraudulent conveyance or other similar laws could subordinate the senior loans to presently existing or future indebtedness of the borrower or take other action detrimental to lenders such court action could under certain circumstances include invalidation of senior loans any lender which could include a closedend fund is subject to the risk that a court could find the lender liable for damages in a claim by a borrower arising under the common laws of tort or contracts or antifraud provisions of certain securities laws for actions taken or omitted to be taken by the lenders under the relevant terms of a loan agreement or in connection with actions with respect to the collateral underlying the senior loan highyield securities an investment in units of the portfolios should be made with an understanding of the risks that an investment in highyield highrisk debt obligations or junk obligations may entail including increased credit risks and the risk that the value of the units will decline and may decline precipitously with increases in interest rates in recent years there have been wide fluctuations in interest rates and thus in the value of debt obligations generally certain of the securities included in the funds in the portfolios may be subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of loss of income and principal than are investments in loweryielding higherrated securities and their value may decline precipitously because of increases in interest rates not only because the increases in rates generally decrease values but also because increased rates may indicate a slowdown in the economy and a decrease in the value of assets generally that may adversely affect the credit of issuers of highyield highrisk securities resulting in a higher incidence of defaults among highyield highrisk securities a slowdown in the economy or a development adversely affecting an issuers creditworthiness may result in the issuer being unable to maintain earnings or sell assets at the rate and at the prices respectively that are required to produce sufficient cash flow to meet its interest and principal requirements for an issuer that has outstanding both senior commercial bank debt and subordinated highyield highrisk securities an increase in interest rates will increase that issuers interest expense insofar as the interest rate on the bank debt is fluctuating however many leveraged issuers enter into interest rate protection agreements to fix or cap the interest rate on a large portion of their bank debt this reduces exposure to increasing rates but reduces the benefit to the issuer of declining rates the sponsor cannot predict future economic policies or their consequences or therefore the course or extent of any similar market fluctuations in the future highyield or junk securities the generic names for securities rated below bbb by standard  poors or below baa by moodys are frequently issued by corporations in the growth stage of their development by established companies whose operations or industries are depressed or by highly leveraged companies purchased in leveraged buyout transactions the market for highyield securities is very specialized and investors in it have been predominantly financial institutions highyield securities are generally not listed on a national securities exchange trading of high yield securities therefore takes place primarily in overthecounter markets that consist of groups of dealer firms that are typically major securities firms because the highyield security market is a dealer market rather than an auction market no single obtainable price for a given security prevails at any given time prices are determined by negotiation between traders the existence of a liquid trading market for the securities may depend on whether dealers will make a market in the securities there can be no assurance that a market will be made for any of the securities that any market for the securities will be maintained or of the liquidity of the securities in any markets made not all dealers maintain markets in all highyield securities therefore since there are fewer traders in these securities than there are in investment grade securities the bidoffer spread is usually greater for highyield securities than it is for investment grade securities the price at which the securities may be sold and the value of a portfolio will be adversely affected if trading markets for the securities are limited or absent if the rate of redemptions is great the value of a portfolio may decline to a level that requires liquidation lowerrated securities tend to offer higher yields than higherrated securities with the same maturities because the creditworthiness of the issuers of lowerrated securities may not be as strong as that of other issuers moreover if a security is recharacterized as equity by the internal revenue service for federal income tax purposes the issuers interest deduction with respect to the security will be disallowed and this disallowance may adversely affect the issuers credit rating because investors generally perceive that there are greater risks associated with the lowerrated securities in the funds in the portfolios the yields and prices of these securities tend to fluctuate more than higher rated securities with changes in the perceived quality of the credit of their issuers in addition the market value of highyield highrisk securities may fluctuate more than the market value of higherrated securities since these securities tend to reflect shortterm credit development to a greater extent than higherrated securities lowerrated securities generally involve greater risks of loss of income and principal than higherrated securities issuers of lowerrated securities may possess fewer creditworthiness characteristics than issuers of higherrated securities and especially in the case of issuers whose obligations or credit standing have recently been downgraded may be subject to claims by debtholders owners of property leased to the issuer or others which if sustained would make it more difficult for the issuers to meet their payment obligations highyield highrisk securities are also affected by variables such as interest rates inflation rates and real growth in the economy therefore investors should consider carefully the relative risks associated with investment in securities that carry lower ratings the value of the shares of the closedend funds reflects the value of the portfolio securities including the value if any of securities in default should the issuer of any security default in the payment of principal or interest the closedend funds in the portfolios may incur additional expenses seeking payment on the defaulted security because amounts if any recovered by the funds in payment under the defaulted security may not be reflected in the value of the fund shares until actually received by the funds and depending upon when a unitholder purchases or sells his or her units it is possible that a unitholder would bear a portion of the cost of recovery without receiving any portion of the payment recovered highyield highrisk securities are generally subordinated obligations the payment of principal and premium if any interest and sinking fund requirements with respect to subordinated obligations of an issuer is subordinated in right of payment to the payment of senior obligations of the issuer senior obligations generally include most if not all significant debt obligations of an issuer whether existing at the time of issuance of subordinated debt or created thereafter upon any distribution of the assets of an issuer with subordinated obligations upon dissolution total or partial liquidation or reorganization of or similar proceeding relating to the issuer the holders of senior indebtedness will be entitled to receive payment in full before holders of subordinated indebtedness will be entitled to receive any payment moreover generally no payment with respect to subordinated indebtedness may be made while there exists a default with respect to any senior indebtedness thus in the event of insolvency holders of senior indebtedness of an issuer generally will recover more ratably than holders of subordinated indebtedness of that issuer obligations that are rated lower than bbb by standard  poors or baa by moodys respectively should be considered speculative as such ratings indicate a quality of less than investment grade investors should carefully review the objective of a portfolio and consider their ability to assume the risks involved before making an investment in the portfolio foreign issuers since certain of the underlying securities held by certain of the closedend funds units are issued by foreign companies an investment in the portfolios involves certain investment risks that are different in some respects from an investment in a portfolio which invests entirely in the securities of domestic issuers these investment risks include future political or governmental restrictions which might adversely affect the payment or receipt of payment of dividends on the relevant securities the possibility that the financial condition of the issuers of the securities may become impaired or that the general condition of the relevant stock market may worsen both of which would contribute directly to a decrease in the value of the securities and thus in the value of the units the limited liquidity and relatively small market capitalization of the relevant securities market expropriation or confiscatory taxation economic uncertainties and foreign currency devaluations and fluctuations in addition for foreign issuers that are not subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  there may be less publicly available information than is available from a domestic issuer in addition foreign issuers are not necessarily subject to uniform accounting auditing and financial reporting standards practices and requirements comparable to those applicable to domestic issuers the securities of many foreign issuers are less liquid and their prices more volatile than securities of comparable domestic issuers in addition fixed brokerage commissions and other transaction costs in foreign securities markets are generally higher than in the united states and there is generally less government supervision and regulation of exchanges brokers and issuers in foreign countries than there is in the united states securities issued by nonus issuers generally pay income in foreign currencies and principally trade in foreign currencies therefore there is a risk that the us dollar value of these securities will vary with fluctuations in the us dollar foreign exchange rates for the various securities there can be no assurance that exchange control regulations might not be adopted in the future which might adversely affect payment to the closedend funds or the portfolios the adoption of exchange control regulations and other legal restrictions could have an adverse impact on the marketability of international securities in a portfolio in addition restrictions on the settlement of transactions on either the purchase or sale side or both could cause delays or increase the costs associated with the purchase and sale of the foreign securities and correspondingly could affect the price of the units investors should be aware that it may not be possible to buy all securities at the same time because of the unavailability of any security and restrictions relating to the purchase of a security by reason of the federal securities laws or otherwise foreign securities generally have not been registered under the securities act of  and may not be exempt from the registration requirements of such act sales of nonexempt securities by a closedend fund in the united states securities markets are subject to severe restrictions and may not be practicable accordingly sales of these securities by a closedend fund will generally be effected only in foreign securities markets investors should realize that the securities in the closedend funds might be traded in foreign countries where the securities markets are not as developed or efficient and may not be as liquid as those in the united states the value of the securities will be adversely affected if trading markets for the securities are limited or absent discount securities certain of the securities held by the closedend funds in the portfolios may have been acquired at a market discount from par value at maturity the coupon interest rates on the discount securities at the time they were purchased and deposited in the funds were lower than the current market interest rates for newly issued securities of comparable rating and type if such interest rates for newly issued comparable securities increase the market discount of previously issued securities will become greater and if such interest rates for newly issued comparable securities decline the market discount of previously issued securities will be reduced other things being equal investors should also note that the value of securities purchased at a market discount will increase in value faster than securities purchased at a market premium if interest rates decrease conversely if interest rates increase the value of securities purchased at a market discount will decrease faster than securities purchased at a market premium in addition if interest rates rise the prepayment risk of higher yielding premium securities and the prepayment benefit for lower yielding discount securities will be reduced market discount attributable to interest changes does not indicate a lack of market confidence in the issue premium securities certain of the securities held by the closedend funds in the portfolios may have been acquired at a market premium from par value at maturity the coupon interest rates on the premium securities at the time they were purchased by the fund were higher than the current market interest rates for newly issued securities of comparable rating and type if such interest rates for newly issued and otherwise comparable securities decrease the market premium of previously issued securities will be increased and if such interest rates for newly issued comparable securities increase the market premium of previously issued securities will be reduced other things being equal the current returns of securities trading at a market premium are initially higher than the current returns of comparable securities of a similar type issued at currently prevailing interest rates because premium securities tend to decrease in market value as they approach maturity when the face amount becomes payable because part of the purchase price is thus returned not at maturity but through current income payments early redemption of a premium security at par or early prepayments of principal will result in a reduction in yield redemption pursuant to call provisions generally will and redemption pursuant to sinking fund provisions may occur at times when the redeemed securities have an offering side valuation which represents a premium over par or for original issue discount securities a premium over the accreted value liquidity whether or not the stocks in the portfolios are listed on a stock exchange the stocks may delist from the exchange or principally trade in an overthecounter market as a result the existence of a liquid trading market could depend on whether dealers will make a market in the stocks we cannot guarantee that dealers will maintain a market or that any market will be liquid the value of the stocks could fall if trading markets are limited or absent additional units the sponsor may create additional units of the portfolios by depositing into a portfolio additional stocks or cash with instructions to purchase additional stocks a deposit could result in a dilution of your investment and anticipated income because of fluctuations in the price of the stocks between the time of the deposit and the purchase of the stocks and because the portfolios will pay brokerage fees voting only the trustee may sell or vote the stocks in the portfolios while you may sell or redeem your units you may not sell or vote the stocks in your portfolio the trustee will vote the stocks in the same general proportion as shares held by other shareholders the portfolios investors should note that the selection criteria were applied to the securities for inclusion in the portfolios prior to the initial date of deposit should a security no longer meet the criteria used for selection for the portfolios such security will not as a result thereof be

disposition of portfolio units the discussion below supplements the prospectus discussion and is qualified in its entirety by the prospectus discussion prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors with regard to the federal tax consequences of the purchase ownership or disposition of portfolio units as well as the tax consequences arising under the laws of any state locality nonus country or other taxing jurisdiction the federal income tax summary below and in the prospectus is based in part on the advice of counsel to the portfolios the internal revenue service could disagree with any conclusions set forth in these discussions in addition our counsel was not asked to review and has not reached a conclusion with respect to the federal income tax treatment of the assets to be held by the portfolios this may not be sufficient for prospective investors to use for the purpose of avoiding penalties under federal tax law certain portfolios intend i to elect and ii to qualify annually as a regulated investment company under the code and to comply with applicable distribution requirements so that it will not pay federal income tax on income and capital gains distributed to its unitholders to qualify for the favorable us federal income tax treatment generally accorded to regulated investment companies a portfolio must among other things a derive in each taxable year at least  of its gross income from dividends interest payments with respect to securities loans and gains from the sale or other disposition of stock securities or foreign currencies or other income derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock securities or currencies and net income from certain publicly traded partnerships b diversify its holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year i at least  of the market value of the portfolios assets is represented by cash and cash items including receivables us government securities the securities of other regulated investment companies and other securities with such other securities of any one issuer generally limited for the purposes of this calculation to an amount not greater than  of the value of the portfolios total assets and not greater than  of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer and ii not more than  of the value of its total assets is invested in the securities other than us government securities or the securities of other regulated investment companies of any one issuer or two or more issuers which the portfolio controls and are engaged in the same similar or related trades or businesses or the securities of certain publicly traded partnerships and c distribute at least  of its investment company taxable income which includes among other items dividends interest and net shortterm capital gains in excess of net longterm capital losses but excludes net capital gain if any and at least  of its net taxexempt interest income each taxable year as a regulated investment company a portfolio generally will not be subject to us federal income tax on its investment company taxable income as that term is defined in the code but without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and net capital gain the excess of net longterm capital gain over net shortterm capital loss if any that it distributes to unitholders your portfolio intends to distribute to its unitholders at least annually substantially all of its investment company taxable income and net capital gain if a portfolio retains any net capital gain or investment company taxable income it will generally be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates on the amount retained in addition amounts not distributed on a timely basis in accordance with a calendar year distribution requirement are subject to a nondeductible  excise tax unless generally a portfolio distributes during each calendar year an amount equal to the sum of  at least  of its ordinary income not taking into account any capital gains or losses for the calendar year  at least  of its capital gains in excess of its capital losses adjusted for certain ordinary losses for the oneyear period ending october  of the calendar year and  any ordinary income and capital gains for previous years that were not distributed during those years to prevent application of the excise tax your portfolio intends to make its distributions in accordance with the calendar year distribution requirement further if your portfolio retains any net capital gain the portfolio may designate the retained amount as undistributed capital gains in a notice to unitholders who if subject to federal income tax on longterm capital gains i will be required to include in income for federal income tax purposes as longterm capital gain their share of such undistributed amount and ii will be entitled to credit their proportionate share of the tax paid by the portfolio against their federal income tax liabilities if any and to claim refunds to the extent the credit exceeds such liabilities a distribution will be treated as paid on december  of the current calendar year if it is declared by a portfolio in october november or december with a record date in such a month and paid by the portfolio during january of the following calendar year these distributions will be taxable to unitholders in the calendar year in which the distributions are declared rather than the calendar year in which the distributions are received if a portfolio failed to qualify as a regulated investment company or failed to satisfy the  distribution requirement in any taxable year the portfolio would be taxed as an ordinary corporation on its taxable income even if such income were distributed to its unitholders and all distributions out of earnings and profits would be taxed to unitholders as ordinary dividend income if a portfolio is treated as holding directly or indirectly  percent or more of the combined voting power of the stock of a foreign corporation and all us shareholders collectively own more than  percent of the vote or value of the stock of such corporation the foreign corporation may be treated as a controlled foreign corporation a cfc from a us tax perspective in such circumstances a portfolio will be required to include certain types of passive income and certain other types of income relating to insurance sales and services with related parties and oil related income in the portfolios taxable income whether or not such income is distributed if a portfolio holds an equity interest in any passive foreign investment companies pfics which are generally certain foreign corporations that receive at least  of their annual gross income from passive sources such as interest dividends certain rents and royalties or capital gains or that hold at least  of their assets in investments producing such passive income the portfolio could be subject to us federal income tax and additional interest charges on gains and certain distributions with respect to those equity interests even if all the income or gain is timely distributed to its unitholders a portfolio will not be able to pass through to its unitholders any credit or deduction for such taxes a portfolio may be able to make an election that could ameliorate these adverse tax consequences in this case a portfolio would recognize as ordinary income any increase in the value of such pfic shares and as ordinary loss any decrease in such value to the extent it did not exceed prior increases included in income under this election a portfolio might be required to recognize in a year income in excess of its distributions from pfics and its proceeds from dispositions of pfic stock during that year and such income would nevertheless be subject to the distribution requirement and would be taken into account for purposes of the  excise tax described above dividends paid by pfics will not be treated as qualified dividend income grantor trusts if any us investor is treated as owning directly or indirectly  percent or more of the combined voting power of the stock of a foreign corporation and all us shareholders of that corporation collectively own more than  percent of the vote or value of the stock of that corporation the foreign corporation may be treated as a controlled foreign corporation a cfc if you own  percent or more of a cfc through a portfolio and in combination with your other investments you will be required to include certain types of the cfcs income in your taxable income for federal income tax purposes whether or not such income is distributed to your portfolio or to you a foreign corporation will generally be treated as a passive foreign investment company pfic if  percent or more of its income is passive income or if  percent or more of its assets are held to produce passive income if your portfolio purchases shares in a pfic you may be subject to us federal income tax on a portion of certain distributions or on gains from the disposition of such shares at rates that were applicable in prior years and any gain may be recharacterized as ordinary income that is not eligible for the lower net capital gains tax rate additional charges in the nature of interest may also be imposed on you certain elections may be available with respect to pfics that would limit these consequences however these elections would require you to include certain income of the pfic in your taxable income even if not distributed to your portfolio or to you or require you to annually recognize as ordinary income any increase in the value of the shares of the pfic thus requiring you to recognize income for federal income tax purposes in excess of your actual distributions from pfics and proceeds from dispositions of pfic stock during a particular year dividends paid by pfics will not be eligible to be taxed at the net capital gains tax rate portfolio termination a portfolio may be liquidated at any time by consent of unitholders representing   of the units of the portfolio then outstanding or by the trustee when the value of the securities owned by the portfolio as shown by any evaluation is less than   if the value of the portfolio has exceeded  a portfolio will be liquidated by the trustee in the event that a sufficient number of units of the portfolio not yet sold are tendered for redemption by the sponsor so that the net worth of the portfolio would be reduced to less than  of the value of the securities at the time they were deposited in the portfolio if a portfolio is liquidated because of the redemption of unsold units by the sponsor the sponsor will refund to each purchaser of units the entire sales charge paid by such purchaser the trust agreement will terminate upon the sale or other disposition of the last security held thereunder but in no event will it continue beyond the mandatory termination date commencing
