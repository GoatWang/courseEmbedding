repair bill is a drop in the bucket compared to monthly payments on a new car said rich white executive director of the car care council the bottom line is that a properly maintained vehicle is safe more dependable more fuel efficient less polluting and more valuable the smartest way to get a solid return on investment is to keep your car through what we call the cinderella era its that period of time after the payoff when your car is still in great shape and needs only modest repairstirestire rotationin achieving proper alignment you may also benefit from tire rotation here the tires are moved to different locations of the car to achieve more even wear since our vehicles are very frontheavy due to the location of the engine our front tires have extra weight to contend with including the pressure of braking since these tires take on the brunt of the work in our daily driving rotation helps manage the tread wear without repeated replacement of the front tires vip can certainly complete this tire rotation for you and also give you the proper timeline to receive this maintenance on a regular basistire repairif something seems to be wrong with your tires your first instinct may be to replace them right away since frequent tire purchases can get expensive over time it is important to understand your options when it comes to tire repair and serviceâ  one common problem that people have with their tires is a puncture or tear after running over something sharp like a nail in the road if the puncture is located in the tire tread and fixable it is a good idea to see a professional while tire plug kits are available research has shown that many of these doityourself repairs are done incorrectly and do not solve the problem still leaving your tires and vehicle vulnerable to dangerwheel alignmentonce you have your wheels vip can mount and balance them for you our ase certified technicians are trained to properly fit the wheels to the vehicle using the right bolt pattern center bore offset width and the accurate load capacity according to the vehicle specifications we offer wheel installation and proper four wheel alignment along with any other service you need for your vehicle seven days a week even on sundaystire replacementunderstanding your tire tread is another critical component of tire maintenanceâ  when you are looking at a tire and see the thickly imprinted grooves this is the tread the tread is the only part of your vehicle that touches the road and is responsible for wicking away elements like water and snow to help maintain a solid traction to the road surface while you may not hear about tread that often it is incredibly important to both the safety and performance of your vehicle the law states that your tread must be at least nd of an inch or more are you in compliance with thisâ  to check your tire tread use the â€œpenny testâ€ place a penny into a tread groove if part of lincolnâ€™s head is covered by the tread you are driving with the proper amount of tread you can also use a tread depth gauge but make sure to use this instrument in several different spots outside edges and center of the tire since tires wear unevenly however sometimes the best way to get an accurate read on your tread health is to inspect the car for some visual signs all tires including passenger tires have tread wear indicators if you see these indicators often the letters â€œtwiâ€ and an arrow have become flush with the tire tread you are driving with an unsafe amount of tread and need a tire replacement if your tread is worn you run the risk of safety hazards like tire explosion if you are looking for a solution come to vip we can advise you if your tires can be fixed or if they need to be replacedtire servicetire

these components dont collide if collision occurs damage to the valves pistons cylinder head and cylinder walls can result this can be an expensive repairtiming belts usually are protected from foreign objects by a cover making visual inspection impossiblemany domestic vehicles built within the last several years and the majority of imports are equipped with a timing belt other engines rely

smell or sweet like maple syrup or is it like rotten eggs the answer to this question gives your technician a place to start looking for the problem if you answer sweet like maple syrup itâ€™s surely a coolant issue this is a problem that should be remedied as soon as possible while itâ€™s a likely a leak itâ€™s a less expensive fix if you let it go on too long youâ€™re most likely going to end up
