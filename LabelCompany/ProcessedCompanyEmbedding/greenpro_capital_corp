segment   venture capital investment   as a result of our acquisition of greenpro venture capital limited in september   we entered the venture capital business in hong kong with a focus on companies located in asia and southeast asia including hong kong malaysia china thailand and singapore our venture capital business segment will focus on establishing a business incubator for startup and high growth companies to support them during their critical growth periods and investing in select startup and high growth companies   we believe that a company’s life cycle can be divided as seed stage start up stage expansion stage mature stage and decline stage     ● seed stage financing is needed for research assets and the development of an initial business concept before the business has reached the startup phase the company usually has relatively low costs in developing the business idea the ownership model is considered and implemented         ● startup stage financing is needed for product development and initial marketing firms in this phase may be in the process of setting up a business or they might have been in the business for short time but not sold their products commercially in this phase cost are increasing affectedly because of eg product development market research and the need of recruiting personnel low levels of revenues are starting to generate           ● expansion stage financing is needed for the growth and expansion capital may be used to finance increased production capacity product or market development or hire additional personnel in the early expansion phase sales and production increase but there is not yet any profit in the later expansion stage the business typically needs extra capital in addition to organically generated profit for further development marketing or product development   we expect that most of a company’s funding needs will occur during the first three stages   we expect our business incubators to provide valuable support to young emerging growth and potential high growth companies at critical junctures of their development for example our incubators will offer office space at a below market rental rate we will also provide our expertise business contacts introductions and other resources to assist their development and growth depending on each individual circumstance we may also take an active advisory role of our portfolio companies including board representation strategic marketing corporate governance and capital structuring we believe that the future growth of those prospects startup companies will be our potential investment opportunities   in addition to our business incubator we have also invested cash and cash equivalents in companies that we believe have high growth potential in exchange for an equity position in such companies as of the date of this annual report we have made investments into following companies   name   shareholding     business rito group corp nevada

capital firm’s sell their part of the venture’s shares only    ● buyback or mbo either the entrepreneur or the management of the firm buys back the venture capital company’s shares of the firm    ●

that this seminar will synergistically support our venture capital business segment   we intend to provide these educational services through our subsidiary greenpro global advisory sdn bhd which was renamed greenpro capital village sdn bhd on september     on october   qsc asia sdn bhd an unaffiliated third party acquired  of greenpro capital village sdn bhd in consideration of  rm  from greenpro

secure sufficient financing a targeted campaign will be made to the following groups of clients law firms auditing firms consulting firms small to midsize enterprises in different industries including

lower cost and to provide security based on such financial information since the data is stored on the cloud system we anticipate a market with growing needs in south east asia we believe that today there is an increasing need for enterprises in different industries to maximize their performance with cost effective methods we believe our services will create numerous competitive advantages for our potential clients with support from greenpro we believe our future clients can focus on developing their businesses and expanding their own client portfolio   we believe the main drivers for the growth of our business are the products and services together with the resources such as office network professional staff members and operation tools to make the advisory and consulting business more competitive   customers   prior to the consummation of the previously described acquisitions we generated minimal revenue from three clients in hong kong in the ordinary course of business the revenue

competition   our industry is highly competitive we compete with local and international venture capital financial advisory and corporate business service companies such as cornerstone management group in hong kong cst tax advisor in singapore and maceda valencia  co in philippines that provide services comparable to our packaged solution we also compete with numerous local and international financial advisory and corporate business service companies that do not offer our broad range of services but focus on specialized areas such as tax planning crossborder solutions and the like some of our competitors may provide a broader selection of services including investment banking services which may position them better among customers who prefer to use a single company to meet all of their financial and business advisory needs in addition some of our competitors are substantially larger than we are may have substantially greater resources than we do or may offer a broader range of products and services than we do we believe that we compete on the basis of a number of factors including breadth of service and product offerings one stop convenience pricing marketing expertise service levels technological capabilities and integration brand and reputation   intellectual property   we intend to protect our investment in the research and development of our products and

accounting policies and estimates     the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires our management to make assumptions estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported including the notes thereto and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies if any we have identified certain accounting policies that are significant to the preparation of our financial statements these accounting policies are important for an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management’s subjective or complex judgment often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting the estimate may differ significantly from management’s current judgments we believe the following

current report on form k filed with the securities and exchange commission on january      item a controls and procedures   evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures     we conducted an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures the term “disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in rules ae and de under the securities and exchange act of  as amended “exchange act” means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports it files or submits under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission’s rules and forms disclosure controls and procedures also include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management including its principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure based on this evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded as of december   that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective the matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the public company accounting oversight board were  lack of a functioning audit committee due to a lack of a majority of independent members and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures  inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives  ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes and  lack of internal audit function due to the fact that the company lacks qualified resources to perform the internal audit functions properly and that the scope and effectiveness of the internal audit function are yet to be developed the aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by our chief financial officer in connection with the review of our financial statements as of december     management believes that the material weaknesses set forth in items  and  above did not have an effect on our financial results however management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and the lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods   during the quarterly report as of september   we did not maintain adequate controls to ensure that purchase accounting was correctly applied pursuant to us generally accepted accounting principles as defined in asc  and related interpretations specifically we did not sufficiently allocate the purchase consideration in connection with our acquisition of fa and yabez we considered the processes followed to initially account for the acquisition that included assistance from independent valuation consultants and the complexities involved in applying the unique circumstances associated with the transaction to the pertinent literature and determined that this significant deficiency did not constitute a material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting and that the company’s internal knowledge base and process regarding purchase accounting has now been remediated with heightened awareness and further expertise in this area            management’s report on internal control over financial reporting   our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules af and df under the exchange act our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the internal controls for the company are provided by

preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with the authorization of our management and    provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements   because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate   management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december   in making this assessment management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in internal controlintegrated framework management’s assessment included an evaluation of the design of our internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of these controls   based on this assessment management has concluded that as of december   our internal control over financial reporting was not effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles in an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls we have initiated or plan to initiate the following series of measures   we have increased our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function however we should continue to hire one or more personnel for the function we will create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives and we plan to appoint one or more outside directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed to an audit committee resulting in a fully functioning audit committee who will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures such as reviewing and approving estimates and assumptions made by management when funds are available to us we also plan to prepare written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting to establish a formal process to close our books monthly on an accrual basis and account for all transactions including equity and debt transactions   we anticipate that these initiatives will be at least partially if not fully implemented by the mid of fiscal

in filing the required form ’s in connection with the acquisition of our securities arising from our acquisitions of grbv ag and gpvc   item  executive compensation   compensation philosophy and objectives   our executive compensation philosophy is to create a longterm direct relationship between pay and our performance our executive compensation program is designed to provide a balanced total compensation package over the executive’s career with us the compensation program objectives are to attract motivate and retain the qualified executives that help ensure our future success to provide incentives for increasing our profits by awarding executives when corporate goals are achieved and to align the interests of executives and longterm stockholders the compensation package of our named executive officers consists of two main elements      base salary for our executives that is competitive relative to the market and that reflects individual performance retention and other relevant considerations and          discretionary bonus awards payable in cash or shares and tied to the satisfaction of corporate objectives   process for setting executive compensation   our board of directors is responsible for developing and overseeing the implementation of our philosophy with respect to the compensation of executives and for monitoring the implementation and results of the compensation philosophy to ensure compensation remains competitive creates proper incentives to enhance stockholder value and rewards superior performance the board of directors annually reviews and approves for each named executive officer and particularly with regard to the chief executive officer all components of the executive’s compensation the board of directors may award discretionary bonuses to each of the named executives and reviews and approves the process and factors including individual and corporate performance measures and actual performance versus such measures used by the chief executive officer to recommend such awards additionally the board of directors reviews and approves the base salary equityincentive awards if any and any other special or supplemental benefits of the named executive officers   the chief executive officer periodically provides the board of directors with an evaluation of each named executive officer’s performance based on the individual performance goals and objectives developed by the chief executive officer at the beginning of the year as well as other factors the board of directors provides an evaluation for the chief executive officer these evaluations serve as the bases for bonus recommendations and changes in the compensation arrangements of our named executives            our compensation peer group   we currently engage in informal market analysis in evaluating our executive compensation arrangements as the company and its businesses mature we may retain compensation consultants that will assist us in developing a formal benchmark and selecting a compensation peer group of companies similar to us in size or business for the purpose of comparing executive compensation levels   program components   our executive compensation program consists of the following elements   base salary   our base salary structure is designed to encourage internal growth attract and retain new talent and reward strong leadership that will sustain our growth and profitability the base salary for each named executive officer reflects our past and current operating profits the named executive officer’s individual contribution to our success throughout his career internal pay equity and informal market data regarding comparable positions within similarly situated companies in determining and setting base salary the compensation committee considers all of these factors though it does not assign specific weights to any factor the compensation committee generally reviews the base salary for each named executive officer on an annual basis for each of our named executive officers we review base salary data internally obtained by the company for comparable executive positions in similarly situated companies to ensure that the base salary rate for each executive is competitive relative to the market   discretionary bonus   the objectives of our bonus awards are to encourage and reward our employees including the named executive officers who contribute to and participate in our success by their ability industry leadership loyalty or exceptional service and to recruit additional executives who will contribute to that success   each of our named executive officers is eligible for consideration for a discretionary cash bonus or shares bonus the chief executive officer makes recommendations regarding bonus awards for the named executive officers and the board of directors provides the bonus recommendation for the chief executive officer however the board of directors has sole and final authority and discretion in designating to whom awards are made the size of the award if any and its terms and conditions the bonus recommendation for each of the named executive officers depends on a number of factors including i the performance of the company for the year ii the satisfaction of certain individual and corporate performance measures and iii other factors which the board of directors may deem relevant the company did not award any cash bonuses or shares bonus during fiscal year    stock holdings   the board of directors recognizes the importance of having a portion of the named executive officers’ compensation be paid in the form of equity to help align the executives’ interests with the interests of the company’s stockholders at this point however the board of directors has chosen to emphasize the cashbased portion of our compensation program over a stock program because it believes the discretionary nature of the cashbased compensation gives it the needed flexibility to factor in and reward the attainment of longerterm goals for the company and the executives as the board of directors deems appropriate   accordingly we encourage executive ownership of our common stock methods of supporting ownership include turning to executives to support the financing needs of the company we believe that this practice achieves the dual goals of meeting the company’s financing needs and aligning our executives’ interests with the interests of our stockholders   we have not timed nor do we plan to time our release of material nonpublic information for the purpose of affecting the value of executive compensation            summary compensation table   the following summary compensation table sets forth the aggregate compensation we paid or accrued
