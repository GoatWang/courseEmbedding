told mainebizi cant divulge their names but we are definitely looking at the maine market and really the entire northeast especially expanding from boston and above she addedinnovest ceo glenn schmidt said spinnaker trust will be innovests first client in maine though the companys application really isnt geographically orientedthe new platform is due to go live on july spinnaker trust opted for innovests flagship innotrust product after looking at a very broad spectrum of options including outsourcing according to ainsley coll spinnakers director of operationsa lot of firms our size are moving towards outsourcing in one shape or another she said but we feel that having our operations inhouse helps to enhance our client experiencebesides being more userfriendly and aesthetically appealing than the current portal the new cloudbased portal will allow spinnakers clients to aggregate their own data access multiple accounts through mobile applications and access tax forms and other documents which they are not able to currently she saidopen architecture coll cited innotrusts open architecture as a major plus allowing for a full integration with spinnakers existing system for customer relationship managementwe also wanted to partner with a firm that was willing to collaborate with us and was proactive about regulation changes and clients changes coll said also a company that was interested in creating that great experience for our clients its really a lot about innovation collaboration flexibilityinnovests schmidt explained that in the trust banking space its not just the type of technology but its the openness of our platform … that allows us to partner with people like spinnaker and give them full access to their own databefore the big day in a couple of weeks various tests and trainings are taking place as spinnaker gives clients a heads up on what to expect weve also taken the opportunity to take a step back and look at how we do things now and what
