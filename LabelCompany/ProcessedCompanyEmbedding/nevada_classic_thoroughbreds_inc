nevada classic thoroughbreds  home page homewho we arewhat we dolegends of the industryfeedback form related linksfaqs ownership of a thoroughbred racehorse can be one of the most wonderful and exciting things that can ever happen to  a person follow along with us  from the initial selection of the sire and dam to the unfolding of the foals potential as a racehorse through the training and then on to the ultimate enjoyment of having the racehorse join with you in the winners circle most people only watch and bet on a racehorse but an owner has the ongoing satisfaction of not only seeing his horse win but watching its offspring follow in its parents hoof prints we sincerely hope that you will take advantage of our web site links and read about our philosophy on this wonderful sport of thoroughbred racing if you would like to be part of us we will provide you with all the necessary information we look forward to your joining us in our efforts to become one of the premier racehorse farms in the united states     website last updated  contact us phone     copyright    all rights reserved   legends of the industry home who we arewhat we dolegends of the industryfeedback form related linksfaqs in our opinion the two most important racehorses in the racehorse industry have been northern dancer and mr prospector  northern dancer was not only a champion racehorse winning the kentucky derby and the preakness stakes but is most renowned for his tremendous impact on thoroughbreds of the modern era  at the breeders cup racing series in  the announcer stated that  out of the  champions racing in the breeders cups mile race were from the male lines of northern dancer  what an amazing contribution this single horse has made to the thoroughbred racehorse in modern times  we have developed northern dancer into the broodmare side of our breeding program the next legend of the industry is mr prospector whose son fusaichi pegasus won the kentucky derby  and when he enters stud for his first year his stud service will reportedly be over   again fusaichi pegasus is a son of mr prospector out of a northern dancer female line danzig our thoroughbreds offspring are designed to possess these power genetics  we intend to mate not just any mr prospector sire with any northern dancer broodmare  the sire and dam we choose must possess our fivepoint real conformation ranking with proven genetics as to their offspring probabilities the result of this will be to fix the mr prospector and northern dancer bloodlines  we intend to improve upon these bloodlines in the development of our own elite racehorse family   website last updated   contact us phone     copyright    all rights reserved   what we do home who we arewhat we dolegends of the industryfeedback form related linksfaqs our purpose is to produce horses that can race at the top level and reproduce themselves consistently here are some advantages of our farm    we start with the very best stock that others have attained we exceed what is considered the best in conformation  weve established an advanced fivepoint real conformation system that tells us the following the horse possessing extreme speed at a specific distance on a specific track surface the horse having a burst of speed from a specific distance to the finish line conformationallyspeaking the horse racing at a certain distance on a particular racing surface  the horse having cosmetically attractive appearance the horse having conformation that will not interfere with its racing career  our fivepoint real conformation system was designed using a scientific method of statistical analysis until a theoretic racehorse conformation model was developed this theoretic model was then tested against both the greatest racehorses known and the racehorses that are known failures at the track  the results of our finding are the farms trade secrets once our fivepoint real conformation system was established the next step was to establish a system of genetic probabilitiesspecifically what are the chances of a certain sire or a certain dam passing on their superior genetic racehorse abilities  we now know what can be expected of a foal bred from a particular sire and dam as well as the probabilities associated with these expectations an unexpected and surprising benefit to the farm is that we can now select genetic power sires without regard to stud fees  based on our fivepoint real conformation system we have found that many of the choice stallions are not necessarily the highest priced stud horses  for instance richly blended is one of our choices of stud horses in the united states  the few we ranked above him had stud fees ranging from over  to over  and many of those that we ranked below him had stud fees in the  to  range  yet richly blendeds stud fee is only   what an unexpected and surprising benefit  we can now genetically fix our fivepoint real conformation system to a particular group or family of racehorses in so doing our horses will be able to compete at the highest level on an ongoing basis rather than just onehorseinalifetime competing at the highest level we are a vertically structured companysince we dont need a number of horses and a number of breedings and a number of employees who can feed maintain and race our horses to compete on the top level we can accomplish the breeding racing and training of our horses with only a few people  also we can provide the companys other necessary services ourselves without hiring outside help  this cuts our costs thus potentially increasing profits for the farm the company considers its shareholders as owners  we know that these owners are interested in seeing the farm succeed and the nevada classic thoroughbreds race at the highest levels of competition   website last updated   contact us phone     copyright    all rights reserved   nevada classic thoroughbreds inc private company information  bloomberg july    pm et

note  development stage operations the company is in the development stages of operations according to the financial accounting standards board of the financial accounting foundation a development stage company is defined as a company that devotes most of its activities to establishing a new business activity in addition planned principle activities have not yet commenced note  financial statement of an inactive registrant under  cfr  the company does not need to provide an audited or reviewed quarterly report reg cfr a gross receipts from all sources for the fiscal year are not in excess of  b the registrant has not purchased or sold any of its own stock granted options therefore or levied assessments upon outstanding stock c expenditures for all purposes for the fiscal year

in the corporate minutes the salary paid to the chief executive officer is donated to the company by the chief executive officer until the company can pay its operation costs as determined by the companys officers and directors item  plan of operation the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements including the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report the company in its developmental stage is now revising its analysis of the prospective stallions for purchase the company has elected to purchase racing colts and develop them into breeding stallions as its primary function this function is the heart of the thoroughbred industry where the most expensive horses are bought and sold and thus the most important sector of the thoroughbred industry for profit to the company if the analysis of the prospective stallions is reasonably accurate then the company believes that it has the ability to purchase top breeding and racing stallion prospects at a fraction of the cost of producing and maintaining breeding stock to potentially accomplish the same purpose it appears obvious that as long as the company enjoys its pgmrn advantage that of identifying potential top breeding and racing stallions it can purchase these stallion prospects at a much lower price than it can produce them at this point in time therefore the company is going to specialize in selecting these prospects until such time as it is more economical to produce such stallions having the ability to purchase breeding and racing stallion prospects at a substantially lower price than it would cost to produce them is a substantial benefit to the company and eliminates the high risk of breeding and maintaining broodmares the companys future plan of operation is to dispose of its marketing of its horse products division of internet horse product marketing this disposal could come by advertising outright sale spinoff merger or any other means the company has in its arsenal to liquidate this asset to instead specialize in only the purchase and sale of breeding and racing stallion prospects as noted above in general any other assets not specifically used for this purpose will be eliminated furthermore these assets have been used and will more than likely page  be sold at a substantial loss to the company none of the officers or directors of the company will purchase such assets for their own interests rather these assets will strictly be advertised and sold to others outside the company at current market prices result of operation power genetics mathematical racing numberstm pgmrn the minimum objective of the racing and breeding of stallion prospects is to produce race horses that win gradedstakes races the maximum the company is hoping for is that the horses can compete and win in the classic races the companys nevada classic thoroughbreds inc employee discounts employee benefits employee perks employee
