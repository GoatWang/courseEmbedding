induced movement therapy cimt for children with unilateral cerebral palsy th of march  constraint induced movement therapy cimt is a treatment technique involving restraint of the less affected upper limb combined with task practice to promote upper limb function in the hemiplegic arm after stroke or brain injury this course focuses on the use of this technique with children who are neurologically

overlooked an innovative and evidencebased treatment for stroke is being underused says a physio who has developed a training course in the technique constraint induced movement therapy is recommended in the national clinical guidelines for stroke says annie mehargphysiotherapist who has  years’ nhs experience in neurological rehab units at hospitals such as homerton and the royal free in london but physios don’t feel confident about using this challenging treatment says annie meharg who developed the oneday course with colleague jill kings an occupational therapist aimed at highly motivated patients after hemiplegia cimt involves restraining the unaffected arm while giving intensive task practice to promote use of the affected arm ‘we’re giving people a task on the border between possible and impossible’ says annie meharg ‘that’s challenging for physios too but it has the potential to be of enormous benefit for some patients’ the association of chartered physiotherapists

developed a longawaited easy to use continuing professional development cpd tool that really does make it easier to create and maintain a health care professionals’ legally required cpd portfolio cpdonline cpdol can be easily accessed from the harrison training website and provides an interactive online portfolio system in which to organise and record cpd evidence the facility provides comprehensive and up to date descriptions of cpd terms and requirements easy to follow guidance as to how to write and maintain your portfolio and useful links to a wide range of cpd resources for me this beats any of the current cpd tools available to occupational therapists because it is electronic and this offers a number of attractive features my office space is small with very limited space for filing documents and files with cpdol i no longer need to transport and store paper documents and heavy lever arch files  i can upload certificates and written notes store them electronically and then dispose of the paper as necessary i have the option to request electronic versions of course notes and certificates for the future to upload direct into cpdol i can now dip into my cpd portfolio from a number of different interface terminals including my iphone which offers me the opportunity to update quickly after a cpd event from home office or train finally cpdol is visually attractive and fun to use and this is very motivating whereas in the past i have worried about being behind with organising my cpd documentation and slow to get on with it i now feel confident that i will be able to keep my portfolio interesting accurate and up to date h may may  clinical specialist ot older people i do not think i am alone when i say that i have attempted struggled and failed on numerous occasions to find a way of recording and maintaining my cpd activities however the cpd online tool has finally provided me with a method of achieving what i once thought was an onerous task what i like about the tool is that i can access it wherever i am at work or at home without having to carry around a huge paper file the sections provide a stepbystep approach to recording maintaining and evidencing cpd activities in a reflective and meaningful way the explanation drop boxes are really helpful as they walk you through what you need to be recording not only does the tool provide you with opportunity to record present cpd activities it provides advice on how to develop and plan for your future cpd so for me the tool feels like it is a living thinking and as it grows i know it will
