distribution rates may vary any distribution adjustment will not be reflected until after the declaration date for the next distribution see the funds a notices if any located under the news

the nav total return takes into account the funds total annual expenses and does not reflect sales load past performance is not indicative of future results  leverage is a technique where a closedend funds manager borrows assets at one rate and invests the proceeds from the borrowed assets at another rate seeking to increase yield and total return use of leverage can result in additional risk and cost and can magnify the effect of any losses  market value information used in calculating the percentages is based upon trade date plus one recording of transactions which can differ from regulatory financial reports forms ncsr and nq that are based on trade date recording of security transactions holdings are subject to change risk considerations the fund is subject to risks including the fact that it is a nondiversified closedend management investment company investment return and market value of an investment in the fund will fluctuate shares when sold may be worth more or less than their original cost because the fund is concentrated in securities issued by mlps mlprelated entities and other energy and utilities companies it will be more susceptible to adverse economic or regulatory occurrences affecting those industries including high interest costs high leverage costs the effects of economic slowdown surplus capacity increased competition uncertainties concerning the availability of fuel at reasonable prices the effects of energy conservation policies and other factors the funds use of derivatives may result in losses greater than if they had not been used may

it might otherwise sell the fund invests in securities of nonus issuers which are subject to higher volatility than securities of us issuers because the fund invests in nonus securities you may lose money if the local currency of a nonus market depreciates against the us dollar use of leverage can result in additional risk and cost and can magnify the effect of any losses the risks of investing
