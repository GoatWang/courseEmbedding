foolcouk foolcomau foolca foolsg foolde helping the world invest better since  hi fool premium advice help fool answers contact us login search search oil stocks is energy xxi ltd a value or value trap energy xxi ltd’s stock has been beaten down this year but here’s one number that could make the stock worth a look matthew dilallo tmfmd dec   at am it has been a truly awful year for investors in energy xxis nasdaqexxi stock which is down  over the past year exxi data by ycharts while those owning the stock are probably cursing the day they bought those without a position might be a bit tempted by the massive price cut as humans we tend to be drawn to things on sale with the hope that a real bargain might be had however the problem with perceived bargains is that theres usually a reason why an item has been steeply discounted such as a crack or other deformity so lets take a look to see if theres actually some value at energy xxi or if its just another trap for our investment dollars the value of oil in the groundone way to look at the underlying value of an energy company is to look at the oil and gas reserves it holds these reserves hold varying degrees of value based on the certainty of future production as well as commodity prices the more certain investors are that a companys reserves will be produced the higher the value we see this certainty scale in the following chart which shows that proved reserves are by far the most certain resource category   source eia the farther away we go from proved reserves also known as p the less certain we are that the reserves will be produced so these have less value to investors however in some cases investors can grow so bearish on a company that they ascribe absolutely no value to these reserves so its quite possible that a company is sitting on a lot more oil and gas in the ground than the value of a company would indicate a look at what energy xxi has in the groundwhen we look at energy xxi we see that investors are valuing the entire business as measured by enterprise value at about  billion however as of the end of the companys fiscal year in june it held proved reserves or p totaling  million barrels of oil equivalent or boe those reserves had pv value or a present value discounted by  of  billion at the then current oil price of  per barrel in addition to that the company held another  million boe of probable reserves p with a pv value of  billion and  million boe of possible reserves p with a pv value of  billion add it all up and the company was estimated to have been sitting on upward of  billion worth of oil and gas in the ground which is noted on the following chart source energy xxi ltd investor presentation what this slide is suggesting is that energy xxi is sitting on as much as three times more oil and gas in the ground than its current value would indicate thats of course if we ascribed full value for possible and probable reserves which are less certain than proved reserves further it also assumes a much higher oil price than what were seeing just a few months later still factor all of that into the equation and were still looking at a company sitting on substantially more oil and gas reserves than the current stock price would suggest which would seem to scream value  the weight pulling everything downthere is however one big blemish and thats the companys massive debt load the company is weighed down by  billion in debt this is a big burden as it leaves energy xxi with little wiggle room we saw this last quarter as the company generated  million in operating cash flow however its interest burden was  million in the quarter so  of its cash flow went just to pay the interest on its debt meanwhile the rest of its cash flow and then some was used to fund the companys capex plan last quarter alone the company spent  million in capex so that leaves the company to look to outside sources like issuing more debt or equity to fund capex the worry here is that as oil prices keep sliding it will make it much harder for energy xxi to maintain production while also keeping up with its interest payments so in the future it might have no choice but to sell its oil and gas assets at fire sale prices just to keep from going under if oil prices keep sliding  investor takeawaythere is a case to be made that energy xxi is a bargain as we can buy oil and gas in the ground for a discount to present value however the trap here is the companys debt as it sucks up way too much of the cash flow which could have been used to profitably develop its oil and gas assets this debt trap has turned too many value stocks into value traps so until the company improves that picture id stay away from this sale item  matt dilallo has no
