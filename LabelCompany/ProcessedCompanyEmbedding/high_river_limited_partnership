proxy battle has spilled into the judicial arena high river limited partnership high river a major shareholder in mylan laboratories inc mylan alleges that the current mylan corporate directors faced with an upcoming annual meeting at which high river and other dissatisfied shareholders would likely elect a new board amended nomination procedures in an attempt to thwart the election and entrench themselves in their positions the complaint in this case seeks a declaration that these amendments are null and void the latest salvo in the litigation is a motion to dismiss filed by mylan and the members of its board mylan board the motion asserts that the court lacks jurisdiction over the case and that the complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted after consideration of the motion and the arguments of counsel the court concludes that some of the claims must fall but others may stand for another day i statement of facts the proposed acquisition by mylan of another pharmaceuticals corporation king pharmaceuticals inc ignited the proxy contest underlying this case when announced in july  the proposal was criticized by a number of mylan shareholders including high river which stated that it would oppose the acquisition when the matter was submitted to shareholders soon thereafter the mylan board took a series of actions to restructure the acquisition deal and avoid the need for shareholder approval high river responded in august  by declaring that it would challenge the members of the mylan board in corporate elections scheduled  for july  doc  at  several months later and after a series of acrimonious public exchanges between the companies the mylan board enacted amendments to corporate bylaws related to the nomination of candidates for election as directors these amendments issued on february   require director nominations to be submitted by february   rather than march   and reschedule the annual meeting for october   rather than july   in effect the amended bylaws change the period for advance notice of nominations from four to eight months no reason was given for the change doc  at  high river immediately objected it characterized the amendments as an improper attempt to thwart the election of new directors and entrench the current members of the board in their positions on february   high river filed a complaint in this court seeking preliminary and permanent injunctive relief against enforcement of the amendments two days later the court denied a request for a temporary restraining order on the ground that high river had not demonstrated the potential for irreparable harm resulting from the amendments high river then withdrew its complaint and submitted a slate of candidates by the february  deadline doc  at  nearly a month later the complaint was refiled under the abovecaptioned docket the pleading is modified to reflect high rivers timely submission of a slate of candidates but otherwise repeats the allegations of the previous complaint it asserts that high river and other shareholders of mylan have been unjustly precluded from submitting additional candidates for election it requests as relief nullification of the recent amendments imposition of a renewed nominations period and an award of costs and damages in such amount as may be shown at trial to have been proximately caused by the defendant directors breach of fiduciary duty malfeasance and misfeasance doc  at   defendants filed the instant motion to dismiss in april  they argue that the complaint does not present a live case or controversy since high river has now submitted a slate of candidates in compliance with the amended deadline and that the complaint fails to state a valid cause of action briefing on the motion concluded on may   and the matter was taken under expedited consideration at the request of the parties docs   ii standard of review a motion to dismiss offers a preliminary opportunity for the court to review the  complaint and eliminate claims for which relief is patently unavailable whether because of jurisdictional limitations or obvious substantive deficiencies see empire kosher poultry inc v united food  commercial workers health  welfare fund of northeastern pa  f supp d   mdpa proceedings on the motion are presumptively limited to the face of the complaint with the nonmoving party receiving the benefit of all reasonable inferences from the allegations thereinid see also swierkiewicz v sorema na  us    s ct   l ed d   only when these allegations clearly fail to invoke the courts jurisdiction or to establish a potential right to relief should the complaint be dismissed see empire kosher  f supp d at  iii discussion corporate structure and administration in pennsylvania is governed by the business corporation law bcl  pa consstat §§  a series of statutory provisions establishing the rights of corporate entities and their responsibilities to shareholders and otherssee  summ pa jurd business relationships §  among the subjects addressed in the bcl is the process for nomination and election of the board of directors the body vested with general corporate authority see eg  pa consstat §§   see also  summ pa jurd business relationships §  shareholders are allowed to nominate candidates for election to the board but the corporation is obligated to accept only those nominations submitted in accordance with advance notice requirements of the corporate bylaws provided that those requirements are fair and reasonable in light of corporate needs see  pa consstat § e see also commonwealth ex rel laughlin v green  pa   ad    high river contends that the amended advance notice bylaws do not provide a fair and reasonable procedure for the nomination of candidates mylan counters that high river has alleged no cognizable injury since it has complied with the advance notice requirement and that the notice provisions are fair and reasonable as a matter of law these arguments will be addressed in turn a lack of jurisdiction the adjudicative authority of the federal courts is constitutionally limited to cases in which a party has suffered an injury in fact redressable by a favorable decision see lujan v defenders of wildlife  us    s ct   l ed d   citing sierra club v morton  us    s ct   l ed d   the alleged injury  must be actual or imminent and must be particularized affecting the plaintiff in a personal and individual way id at   n   s ct  absent allegations and at later stages of litigation proof of a cognizable injury in fact the court is without jurisdiction to entertain the matter id at   s ct  the complaint in this case clearly sets forth an injury in fact it alleges that high river has been deprived of its right recognized under the bcl to a reasonable opportunity to nominate the directors of a corporation in which it holds a substantial financial interest this deprivation may be redressed by a judicial declaration that the amended bylaws are invalid and an injunction requiring mylan to accept nominations submitted by high river outside of the advance notice period constitutional prerequisites to jurisdictional standing are satisfied see id see also  charles alan wright arthur r miller and edward h cooper federal practice and procedure §  d ed this injury is not cured by the fact that mylan may in its own discretion accept late nominations the interest asserted by high river is the ability to nominate candidates as a matter of right not merely as a matter of grace cf united states v generix drug corp  us   n   s ct   l ed d   adams v bowater inc  fd   st cir  levin v harleston  fd   d cir mylan offers no guarantee that it will accept late nominations to the contrary it asserts in this lawsuit a legal justification for rejecting these nominations judicial relief offers the only means by which high river can secure the right to propose new candidates for election this case presents a live controversy see county of los angeles v davis  us    s ct   l ed d    wright miller and cooper supra §§   nor is it relevant for purposes of the jurisdictional inquiry whether high river will if relief is granted actually propose a new slate of candidates a right is no less valuable merely because it goes unexercised see watt v energy action educ found  us    s ct   l ed d   citizens for better forestry v us dept of agric  fd   th cir cc distribs inc v united states  fd   dccir with the opportunity to submit new nominations high river will be in a strategically better position to review its current candidates particularly in light of any publicity that they have received since they were announced and to decide whether a change is in order the loss of this opportunity whether or not exercised constitutes an injury in fact for which judicial redress is potentially available see watt  us at   s ct   wright miller and cooper supra §§   however high river may not assert claims on behalf of other shareholders it is axiomatic that a party generally must assert its own legal rights and interests and cannot rest a claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties kowalski v tesmer  us   s ct    l ed d   the limitation on the rights of other shareholder to submit nominees does not restrict high rivers choice among potential candidates or otherwise constitute a harm to high river other shareholders may if they choose join in this case or commence an independent action to vindicate their rights there is no indication that high rivers interests are so inextricably bound to other shareholders as to allow it to assert a cause of action on their behalf see id  wright miller  and cooper supra §  the claims based on alleged harms to other shareholders will be dismissed b failure to state a claim that the court may entertain high rivers claims does not of course suggest that these claims have substantive merit nevertheless it is clear as a threshold matter that the complaint asserts a cognizable violation of pennsylvania law the bcl allows corporations to enforce advance notice provisions only if they are fair and reasonable in light of corporate needs see  pa consstat § e the amended bylaws issued by mylan require nominations to be proposed eight months in advance of the shareholder meeting more than double the advance notice directed by previous bylaws there is no indication that this extended period is necessary to allow the company to prepare proxy statements verify the qualifications of proposed nominees or take any other action related to the meeting agenda indeed according to the complaint the sole purpose of the bylaws is to advance the personal interests of the members of the mylan board these allegations considered in the light most favorable to high river demonstrate a potential violation of section  of the bcl see id §  cmt this violation if established may be remedied by injunctive and declaratory relief the bcl allows the court to review corporate actions and to invalidate or enjoin enforcement of bylaws that are patently unreasonable or conflict with specific statutory requirements see id §§   see also dugan v firemens pension fund of phila  pa   ad   pa laughlin  ad at  lutz v webster  pa   a     summ pa jurd business relationships §  these equitable remedies are potentially available to high river if it establishes that the amended bylaws do not provide a fair and reasonable procedure for the nomination of candidates the claims for declaratory and injunctive relief against mylan may proceed the claims for monetary relief however do not fare as well the bcl does not establish a right to compensatory damages or to attorneys fees in actions brought by individual shareholders for a violation of statutory provisions see eg  pa consstat §§   moreover it does not appear that high river has suffered any cognizable damages from the enactment of the bylaws the company has not been forced to take any action has not been denied any opportunity and has not incurred any apparent costs due to the amendment beyond those associated with commencement and prosecution of the instant lawsuit the complaint does not provide a basis for an award of compensatory damages even assuming arguendo their availability under the bcl nor may high river maintain its claims against the individual members of the mylan board for breach of fiduciary duty malfeasance and misfeasance notwithstanding the motivations of the individual board members the advance notice bylaws represent an action of the corporation not the directors see id §§   relief from enforcement of the bylaws if available must be sought from the corporation itself see eg davis v us gypsum co  fd    d cir cole v ford motor co  f supp   wdpa reifsnyder v pittsburgh outdoor adver co  pa   ad    n   none of the harms alleged in the complaint flow from the individual actions of the directors and the claims against them will be dismissed iv conclusion the sole claim that high river may assert based on the allegations of the complaint is a right to declaratory and injunctive relief against mylan with respect to the validity and prospective enforcement of the amended advance notice bylaws the remaining claims will be dismissed without prejudice an appropriate order will issue  order and now this th day of june  upon consideration of defendants motion to dismiss doc  and for the reasons set forth in the accompanying memorandum it is hereby ordered that  the motion to dismiss doc  is granted with

standard of review for a motion to dismiss the court will present the facts as alleged in the complaint see infra part ii the statements contained herein reflect neither the findings of the trier of fact nor the opinion of the court as to reasonableness of the parties allegations  high river also filed a separate complaint in this court challenging the acquisition agreement under state and federal securities laws see high river ltd v mylan labs inc  f supp d   mdpa rambo j these claims which are not directly relevant to the case sub judice were subsequently transferred to the southern district of new york on motion of the defendants id  see high river ltd v mylan labs inc no cv slip op at  mdpa feb   conner j  costs of the previous action were assessed against high river by separate order on this date see fed r civ p d if a plaintiff who has once dismissed an action in any court commences an action based upon or including the same claim against the same defendant the court may make such order for the payment of costs of the action previously dismissed as it may deem proper  the instant motion to dismiss does not challenge the factual veracity of the jurisdictional allegations of the complaint see carpet group intl v oriental rug imps assn  fd   d cir when a defendant attacks subject matter jurisdiction in fact as opposed to an attack on the allegations on the face of the complaint no presumptive truthfulness attaches to plaintiffs allegations and the existence of disputed material facts will not preclude the trial court from evaluating for itself the merits of jurisdictional claims quoting mortensen v first fed sav  loan assn  fd   d cir  neither party disputes that pennsylvania law applies in this diversity case see erie rr co v tompkins  us    s ct   l ed    apart from the issue of standing defendants do not challenge the exercise of subject matter jurisdiction over this case which involves diverse parties and an amount in controversy of more than  see  usc §   cf dardovitch v haltzman  fd   d cir noting that pennsylvania law does not permit an award of attorneys fees in the absence of express statutory allowance of the same the court expresses no view on whether high river would be entitled to an award of costs if it is successful in its claims see fed r civ p d  this case was brought as a direct action against the corporation see reifsnyder  pa   ad    n   and not as a derivative action in which the plaintiff is considered to represent the interests of the corporation and may potentially recover from corporate officials for financial losses to the company see  pa consstat §  see generally  summ pa jurd business relationships §§   cf  pa consstat §  stating that the duty imposed on directors to act in good faith runs
