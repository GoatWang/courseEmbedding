advertising  society reviewvolume  issue   asr in lieu of an abstract here is a brief excerpt of the content are product attribute beliefs the only mediator of advertising effects on brand attitude andrew a mitchell bioand jerry c olson bio mitchell andrew a and jerry c olson  are product attribute beliefs the only mediator of advertising effects on brand attitude journal of marketing research august – reprinted with the permission of the american marketing association fishbein’s attitude theory posits that beliefs are the only mediators of attitude formation and change the validity of this proposition for consumers’ beliefs about product attributes and brand attitudes was examined in the context of an advertising effects study to manipulate product attribute beliefs and to create settings in which other mediation processes might occur the authors exposed subjects to simple advertisements that contained either a verbal claim or visual information level of repetition also was varied as expected product attribute beliefs mediated attitude formation however another variable termed attitude toward the advertisement also mediated brand attitudes and purchase intentions the authors discuss alternative explanations for the results and offer suggestions for future research attitude defined here as an individual’s internal evaluation of an object such as a branded product has been an important concept in marketing research for the past  years there are at least two major reasons for this longterm interest first attitudes often are considered relatively stable and enduring predispositions to behave consequently they should be useful predictors of consumers’ behavior toward a product or service second social psychology has provided several theoretical models of the attitude construct eg fishbein  mcguire  rosenberg  triandis  wyer  these conceptual frameworks especially fishbein’s have stimulated much of the attitude research in marketing most of this work however has been descriptive and pragmatic in orientation theoretical issues have been relatively neglected to increase the usefulness of the attitude construct marketers must develop a clearer understanding of the causal determinants of attitude formation and change  olson and mitchell  also see lutz  lutz and bettman  these causal influences are of critical importance because they mediate the effects of marketing decision variables such as advertising or price on consumer attitudes thus a better understanding of the causal dynamics of attitude formation would not only aid marketing researchers in measuring the attitudinal impact of marketing variables but also help managers develop more effective marketing strategy attitude theory fishbein   fishbein and ajzen  presented perhaps the clearest theoretical exposition of the causal basis of attitudes according to fishbein and ajzen  p  “a person’s attitude is a function of his salient beliefs at a given point in time” beliefs are the subjective associations between any two discriminable concepts salient beliefs are those activated from memory and “considered” by the person in a given situation  fishbein and ajzen  olson kanwar and muderrisoglu  as these ideas are operationalized in the typical marketing research study the attitude concept of interest is a brand and the related concepts are product attributes that is marketing researchers have been mainly concerned with consumers’ beliefs about attributes of a brand fishbein’s nowfamiliar attitude model specifies the relationship between the set of salient beliefs about a concept often termed cognitive structure and an overall evaluation of or attitude toward the concept editorial note throughout the text the greek letter “sigma” will be replaced with “e” therefore the above equation would read as “eb ie i a o” in the text fishbein clearly intended the attitude model in equation to describe only the predicted relationship between measures of the theoretical constructs eg see fishbein and ajzen  p – that is the algebraic model provides a means of estimating the beliefattitude relationship that was formed as a result of causal mechanisms the model itself does not “state” the causal proposition nor does it specify the causal mechanisms fishbein also proposed that the attitudebelief relationship specified in equation holds for attitudes toward a specific behavior such as buying a product a act however the set of salient beliefs may not be the same as for a o  fishbein and ajzen  in turn attitude especially a act is if you would like

over a hundredyear period leading up to  by exploring the political and military context of the event the book demonstrates that the musin rebellion was not driven by systemic breakdown regionalism or ideology but was a failed attempt by political players to take control of the court central to the eruption of violence in  was the intervention of key rebel plotters several of whom were serving

imperialism susan brownell one of the more problematic sport spectacles in american history took place at the  world’s fair in st louis which included the third modern olympic games associated with the games was a curious event known as anthropology days organized by william j mcgee and james sullivan at that time the leading figures in american anthropology and sports respectively mcgee recruited natives who were participating in the fair’s ethnic displays to compete in sports events with the “scientific” goal of measuring the physical prowess of “savages” as compared with “civilized men” this interdisciplinary collection of essays assesses the ideas about race imperialism and western civilization manifested in the  world’s fair and olympic games and shows how they are still relevanta turning point in both the history of the olympics and the development of modern anthropology these games expressed the conflict between the old world emphasis on culture and new world emphasis on utilitarianism marked by franz boas’s paper at the scientific congress the events in st louis witnessed the beginning of the shift in anthropological research from nineteenthcentury evolutionary racial models to the cultural relativist paradigm that is now a cornerstone of modern american anthropology racist pseudoscience nonetheless reappears to this day in the realm of sports

books that contained homosexuality gay writers were eager to take advantage of this new freedom but the only houses poised to capitalize on the outpouring of manuscripts were “adult” paperback publishers who marketed their products with salacious covers gay critics unlike their lesbian counterparts have for the most part declined to take these works seriously even though they cover an enormous range of genres adventures blue collar and gray flannel novels comingout stories detective fiction gothic novels historical romances military stories political novels prison fiction romances satires sports stories and spy thrillers—with far more short story collections than is generally realized twelve scholars have now banded together to begin a recovery of this largely forgotten explosion of gay writing that occurred in the s descriptions of these pulps have often been inadequate and misinforming the result of misleading covers unrepresentative sampling of texts and a political blindness that refuses to grant worth to prestonewall writing this volume charts the broader implications of this state of affairs before examining some of the more significant pulp writers from the period it brings together a diverse range of scholars methodologies and reading strategies the evidence that these essays amass clearly demonstrates the significance of gay pulps for gay

advertising at war business consumers and government in the s inger l stole challenges the notion that advertising disappeared as a political issue in the united states in  with the passage of the

critics of advertising since the s to regulate advertising as extensively as its earliest opponents almost succeeded in doing met with fierce political opposition from organized consumer movements when it emerged modern advertising was viewed as propaganda that undermined the ability of consumers to live in a healthy civic environment xbin advertising on trial inger l stole examines how these consumer activists sought to limit the influence of corporate powers by rallying popular support to moderate and transform advertising she weaves their story together through the extensive use of primary sources including archival research done with consumer and trade group records as well as trade journals and a thorough engagement with the existing literature stoles account of this contentious struggle also demonstrates how public relations developed as a way to justify laissezfaire corporate advertising in light of a growing consumer rights movement and how the failure to rein in advertising was significant not just for that period but for ours as well xb     next results  of  sort by az recently added items per page      research areas social sciences business and society
