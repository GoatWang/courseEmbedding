trustee           by s michele hy voon   name  michele hy voon title    vice president       by s susan barstock   name  susan barstock title    vice president    exhibit a   consent   each of the undersigned parties hereby consents as of april   to the amendment of the indenture dated as of march   the “ indenture ” among slm student loan trust  as issuer the “ issuer ” deutsche bank trust company americas “ dbtca ” as successor eligible lender trustee the “ eligible lender trustee ” and deutsche bank national trust company “ dbntc ” as successor indenture trustee the “ indenture trustee ” as amended from time to time in substantially the form attached hereto as annex a the indenture is being amended to amend one of the definitions contained therein ratings considerations   each of the undersigned parties understands that no assurance can be provided regarding the impact that the adoption of the amendment will have on the ratings of the notes  as required by the indenture the issuer has provided prior written notice of the terms of the amendment to each rating agency currently rating the notes however no rating agency confirmation or affirmation of the ratings of the notes has been sought or given  as a result it is not certain what impact the adoption of the amendment will have on a rating agency’s decision to add the notes to or remove the notes from its negative watch list for possible downgrade or to downgrade the current ratings of the notes   further we have been advised that it is possible that a rating agency may view the adoption of this amendment as a restructuring of a distressed debt instrument  one potential result of this designation would be to cause a ratings downgrade of the notes to reflect the distressed debt element of their analysis followed by an upgrade of the rating of the notes to address the restructuring of the notes   us federal income tax considerations   each of the undersigned parties understands that the adoption of the amendment may have adverse us federal income tax consequences to the noteholders and the undersigned parties will rely on advice from their own tax advisors on this matter  the discussion below is general in nature and does not address all of the tax consequences of the adoption of the amendment that may be relevant to noteholders   although we believe that the adoption of the amendment will not adversely affect the tax characterization of the notes as indebtedness for us federal income tax purposes certain adverse tax consequences could apply to holders if the adoption of the amendment resulted in the notes being treated as equity for us federal income tax purposes  for a further discussion of  the adverse tax consequences to noteholders if the notes were treated as equity for us federal income tax purposes see “ us federal income tax consequences—tax consequences to holders of notes in general—treatment of the notes as indebtedness ” in the base prospectus dated february   the “ base prospectus ” the deferral of the stated maturity date pursuant to the amendment may be treated as a significant modification of the notes for us federal income tax purposes resulting in a deemed exchange  if the amendment results in a significant modification and a deemed exchange of “old notes” for “new notes” us noteholders will recognize gain or loss upon the deemed exchange unless the exchange qualifies as a taxfree recapitalization  although the matter is not    free from doubt we intend to treat the deemed exchange as such a recapitalization if the deemed exchange is a taxfree recapitalization a noteholder’s tax basis in the new notes received pursuant to a deemed exchange generally will equal the holder’s tax basis in the old notes if the amendment results in a significant modification the issue price of the new notes will depend on whether the new notes and the old notes are properly characterized as “traded on an established market” hereinafter “publiclytraded” within the meaning of treas reg § f  we expect the new notes should not be characterized as publicly traded we expect and the remainder of this discussion assumes that the stated interest on the new notes will meet the requirements for “adequate stated interest” under the treasury regulations accordingly if the new notes are not characterized as publicly traded the issue price of the new notes will be the “stated principal amount” of the new notes if the deemed exchange qualifies as a recapitalization and a noteholder’s initial tax basis in the new notes exceeds their stated principal amount the holder will be considered to have acquired the new notes with amortizable bond premium  in addition for any noteholder that acquired old notes with market discount any gain recognized on the deemed exchange will be treated as ordinary income to the extent of the market discount accrued during its period of ownership unless such holder previously elected to include market discount in income as it accrued for us federal income tax purposes  assuming the deemed exchange qualifies as a recapitalization in a deemed exchange of old notes with market discount for new notes the new notes will be treated as acquired with market discount if the issue price of the new notes exceeds the holder’s initial tax basis for such new notes by more than a de minimis amount and any accrued market discount with respect to the old notes generally should carry over to such new notes  for a further discussion of amortizable bond premium and market discount see “ us federal income tax consequences—tax consequences to holders of notes in general—market discount ” and “ us federal income tax consequences—tax consequences to holders of notes in general—amortizable bond premium ” in the base prospectus noteholders are urged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the us federal income tax consequences of the adoption of the amendment noteholders are hereby notified that executed and delivered consents are irrevocable prior to the expiration of the consent period including any onetime extension thereof made at the sole discretion of the adminis

loan trust  the rating outlook remains stable for the senior and subordinate notes a detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this press release key rating drivers high collateral quality the collateral consists of  of federal family education loan program ffelp loans the credit quality of the trust collateral is high in fitchs opinion based on the guarantees provided by the transactions eligible guarantors and reinsurance provided by the us department of education ed for at least  of principal and accrued interest fitch currently rates the us sovereign at aaa outlook stable sufficient credit enhancement ce while both the senior and subordinate notes will benefit from overcollateralization oc the excess of trusts asset balance over bond balance and excess spread the senior notes also benefit from subordination provided by the class b notes as of december  total parity is   ce and senior parity is   ce cash is being released from the trust given that the specified oc amount which is equal to the greater of   of the adjusted pool balance and  has been maintained adequate liquidity support liquidity support is provided by a debt service reserve fund sized at the greater of  of the pool balance and  acceptable servicing capabilities navient formerly sallie mae inc is responsible for daytoday servicing of the trust fitch believes navient is an acceptable servicer of ffelp student loans rating sensitivities since ffelp student loan abs rely on the us government to reimburse defaults aaasf ffelp abs ratings will likely move in tandem with the aaa us sovereign rating aside from the us sovereign rating defaults and basis risk account for the majority of the risk embedded in ffelp student loan transactions additional defaults and basis shock beyond fitchs published stresses could result in future downgrades likewise a buildup of ce driven by positive excess spread given favorable basis factor conditions could lead to future upgrades
