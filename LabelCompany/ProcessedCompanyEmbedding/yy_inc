research longshort equity contrarian research analyst portfolio strategysummarylive broadcast is a new but necessary highgrowth industry not only in china and across the world large players such as yy benefit the most from the explosive growthyy has a solid monetization model that incentivizes spending and maintains high consistent user trafficpreviously challenged segments such as game broadcast are turning aroundthere are more high margined business segments that are still underexploredcurrent valuation appears cheap when compared with historical valuation level and with other private companiesyy inc nasdaqyy is a social platform in china that features live broadcasting the overall company can be broken into the following subbusinesses yy live  online dating  game broadcasting  online games  online education  and others  having the most market share and the most comprehensive products on a single platform amongst players in the chinese live broadcast sector yy is a good play on the increasingly popular live broadcast we recommend long yy at   closing general market opportunity incredible industry growth chinese internet companies eg alibaba nysebaba tencent otcpktcehy otcpktctzd sina nasdaqsina saw tremendous growth in recent years thanks to the growing penetration of internet and the high population concentration in the country the new wave of growth for these companies lies in the gg coverage improvement resulting in renewed growth in the chinese technology sector live broadcasting is no exception per miit and credit suisse estimates total gg subscriber grew at  cagr between  and  and it is expected to reach  bn in  with a  penetration rate live broadcasting has recently been the focal point at many major global social media companies such as facebook nasdaqfb twitter nysetwtr and youtube in the four months between april and october  facebook saw the usage of live video increasing  times in china the market for live broadcasts is even stickier per a report by andreessen horowitz according to a survey of  livestreaming hosts conducted by todays internet celebrity and reported by credit suisse september  a little more than twothirds are under the age of  and about half are at least collegeeducated the popularity of live broadcasts among the young techsavvy population reinforces the exponential growth coming from technology furthermore on the broadcast host side the female to male ratio is  and the flip is true on the audience side therefore live broadcast is becoming a new platform for socializing and sometimes even dating purposes this form of entertainment is needed and is here to stay live broadcast is likely to continue to be successful and grow for a number of reasons first companies build in economic incentives for both audience and hosts to interact more and in turn boost the economics of the firm according to a cnbc news report last month a moderately popular parttime host with  followers can earn almost three times the average earning taken home by fresh university graduates this easy extra income is very meaningful to hosts who tend to be younger and have less earning power in their day jobs in an environment where standard of living and costs of goods are climbing on the audience side in addition to being able to socialize users have high engagement because they must spend money to attain and maintain statuses on the platform high statuses grant users special access which not only fulfills ones ego but also escalates the level of engagement second live broadcast is a very costbenefit efficient form of entertainment most of the contents are user generated so the bulk of the operating expenses is on technology which is decreasing last but not least live broadcast opens up a large array of opportunities for entertainment dating education moneymaking ads and ecommerce and so on therefore it is a market with great breadth and depth that is still at a nascent stage being the largest player yy will continue to be one of the largest beneficiaries of the industry growth why yy one of the risks often cited with live broadcast is its low entrant barrier this was somewhat true but as competition heats up and regulations tighten this risk is mitigated large players will reap the most benefit from the industry tailwind and the competitive moat they crafted from the large user base we particularly favor yy for a few reasons  the largest player in the sector  the only large independent player ie not owned by a conglomerate  comprehensive product offerings  first mover advantage and  favorable valuation yy live segment includes live streaming online dating online gaming ads membership despite not investing as heavily in marketing as its competitors yy stays consistently ahead in terms of traffic and user engagement its gap to inke is also narrowing the conversion from total traffic to paying users is trending up steadily even though there are some fluctuations in effective time spent in the mobile space yy has low new installation vs uninstallation spread out of the few most downloaded apps although it has been less aggressive in its marketing efforts yy believes more in the importance of content quality and variety yys first mover advantage provides solid foundation to support the companys growth yy has exclusive partnership with guilds which act as talent agencies influential hosts are more loyal to yy than expected as it is highly uncertain whether they could replicate their successes outside of the guild and yy smaller platforms may offer higher revenue sharing in the short run but they are not equivalent to recurring income yy has  guilds in total  of which are golden guilds the highest level in sinas june user survey on top live broadcasting hosts seven out of the top ten hosts were from yy with another from huya yys game broadcasting site top hosts generate superior contents that attract users yy retains users through carefully its crafted monetization model users are divided into tiers based on the monetary contribution they make to hosts in form of gifts yy typically pockets  of the value as revenue guilds  hosts  users on yy especially the high ranking ones are very sticky high paying members are given titles special administrative rights and ways to interact and maintain relationships with guildshosts the program spans to the decoration of virtual names the length of ids special seats in live programs and unique hallmark and visual effects when one enters show rooms top paying users also show up on the ranking board where everyone can see to maintain those privileges and to fulfill ones ego members must maintain high spending which reinforces the sustainability of yys revenue since content is the most crucial component of the success yy will transition to pugc professional and user generated content going forward where it will partner with more established studios and institutions yy will welcome brand owners media and institutions to broadcast to yys user base the company doesnt plan to increase its own content cost significantly it would be a winwin for both yy and brand owners as live broadcast is becoming an increasingly important channel and big players such as yy stand to benefit from the growth similarly being a big established player yy will win over smaller competitors from a regulation perspective the government has tightened regulation on live broadcast in september making new entrants more difficult new regulations require  platforms to have rmbmn of minimum registered capital and  platforms without a license to be either stateowned or statecontrolled multiple operating licenses are also needed besides standing to benefit from the industry growth and the scale it built as the first mover there are numerous opportunities for positive surprises going forward the first surprise lies in the mobile space revenue from mobile has always lagged that from pc mostly because users typically spend more time on pc however this gap is narrowing in q mobile contributed to  of yy lives revenues as compared with  in q the monetization gap is expected to narrow further as mobile penetration increases and some competition is weeded out the second potential surprise is on margin expansion including from lower expenses competitors have burnt a lot of cash promoting apps in august and september this trend has cooled down leading into q and we see yys dau stabilizing also yys management noted that operating cost on technology will trend down as the platform scales further the third area lies in the slightly easier comps yy wrote down an impairment of more than  million rmb in  mostly from the education business after the departure of a number of key personnel this eroded investors confidence at this point the lackadaisicalness of that segment is well pricedin any development is likely positive the overall firms performance will also now be compared to easier comps as a result of that impairment last but not least our analysis pointed to efficient management execution and sound capital structure yys roe has stabilized in the past several quarters driven by higher operating margin lower asset turnover and lower leverage ratio per du pont analysis debttoequity ratio is decreasing yet interest coverage has gone up from x in q to x in q fcf yield is estimated at  these positive stats indicate capacity to be on the offensive in face of competition and investment huya segment for game broadcast game broadcasting is still an underpenetrated market per cnnic data there were  million users as of june  only  of internet users the estimated potential market is  million online gamers enfodesk estimated that the game broadcasting market in  is  billion rmb  yoy and expect the market to grow to  billion rmb in  similar to case for the broader broadcasting sector scale and first mover advantage go a long way as the second biggest player in the industry by mau huya  million vs douyu  million and user time spent huya  vs douyu  we expect significant growth in the huya segment game broadcasting is a challenging business as the operating cost is very high the range of annual compensation for the top  hosts was  to  million rmb in jan  the same is  to  million rmb in may  therefore future growth will continue to favor the larger players who have more capital and resources to expand in fact we see promising trends of achieving greater operating leverage in this segment in recent earnings paying user is up  qoq or  yoy in q mobile contributed  of its revenues a big stepup from  in q we believe that huya will deliver a positive surprise going forward the gap with the biggest player douyu is already narrowing huya is also expanding its content to music and entertainment and it launched mobile game broadcasting to broaden its user base other notable segments what excites us about yy is that there are many products to monetize some of which are at nascent stage online dating for example is  of the overall business and its average revenue per paying user arpu is at  rmb more than double the  arpu of the entire platform however if one surfs the yy site one may note that the link to the dating site is rather discreet part of the reason is that the segment is still relatively new started november  and it only offers premium subscription nonetheless technode has applauded it as so far the most engaging and interactive among all their yys social offerings as of the end of  the other potential breakout opportunity is in ecommerce whose monetization hasnt been explored some sell products during their live show but yy has not monetized either gross merchandise value gmv sharing or advertising fees ecommercebased monetization has not been explored very much while some hosts are indeed selling products during their live show online broadcasting platforms have not monetized either gmv gross merchandise value sharing or charged any advertising fees attractive current valuation vs public comp and self yy has historically been trading below its other public peers but the discount becomes even wider more than sd below average lately compared to its own valuation in the past yy looks heavily discounted at the moment vs private companies inke is still in the early stage of monetization but it is already valued close to onethird of yys market cap douyu has fewer than  of yys users but its valued at about  of yy conclusion even though live broadcast has been a rather new form of entertainment its growth has been phenomenal with further acceleration expected with top three players taking  of traffic share and top five taking  large players will benefit the most from the continued industry growth as the largest player and earliest entrant yy has consistent traffic a solid monetization model and diverse products that craft a deep competitive moat with signs of improvement in various lines of business and current cheap valuation we believe that it is a name that will outperform disclosure i amwe are long yy i wrote this article myself and it expresses my own
