quarter  conference call joining me today is uli michel executive vice president and chief financial officer in the third quarter we reported record revenues of  million and grew  local currency growth was driven by our achievements in the international markets this  growth demonstrates the leadership of the sirona brands and the strength of our global sales and service infrastructure turning to the us cadcam growth was solid but was offset by lower imaging sales ahead of the us launch of the orthophos sl overall our revenues in the us were flat for the quarter we are pleased to see that the us dental equipment market remains healthy revenues in international markets increased  local currency growth was broadbased across all regions europe led our growth this quarter and germanys contribution was uberstruck we are very pleased with our ability to translate record interest at the ids into record revenues in q rest of the world posted robust growth led by japan despite the strength in many countries we continue to see pockets of weakness due to the economic situations in places such as russia and brazil china while still growing is also becoming incrementally more challenging turning to our business segments cadcam posted record results and delivered outstanding  growth in local currencies the introduction of our roi campaign at ids was very successful and will help drive growth in the coming quarters as a reminder our new software creates a unique roi proposition for cerec which enables a seamless restorative orthodontic and implantology workflow treatment center delivered an exceptional quarter with  growth in local currency we saw very strong growth across our comfort and standard lines our new economy platform the intego is being very well received by the market and in high demand instruments continued to grow faster than the market with  growth imaging was up  this quarter d adoption is driving growth and the market is excited about our new orthophos sl despite these positive developments slower demand for the xg product line impacted growth our record sales drove operating leverage and delivered record adjusted eps of  representing  growth on june  we had completed the acquisition of a small dental company were excited to have this company in our portfolio at this point i do not want to get into the details as we do not want to preempt the upcoming commercial launch we do understand your need to model the financial impact on the fourth quarter uli will be discussing this in his prepared remarks overall im very pleased with our performance this quarter and how well the sirona team delivered ill now turn the call to uli who will review our third quarter financials and our guidance ulrich michel  chief financial officer  executive vice president thanks jeff and good morning everyone in the third quarter our revenues increased by  million to  million up  reported in local currency we grew  million or  which was offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts of  million or  year to date about  of our revenue is us dollardenominated another  is eurodenominated and the remaining  is denominated in a mix of other currencies the most important ones being the japanese yen australian dollar brazilian real the russian ruble and the chinese yuan as you know many of these currencies have declined significantly to the us dollar over the past  months which reflect itself in a  unfavorable impact on q reported revenues as i go through the presentation today i will focus on our revenue performance in local currencies jeff already addressed revenue by geography so ill move right to a review of our business segments revenues in our cadcam segment increased  to a record  million and were up  in the local currencies growth was geographically broadbased but led by europe with particular strength in germany we had strong growth for both our chairside and labside products our cadcam segment margin was  up  basis points from last year the gross margin improvement was mainly driven by favorable foreign exchange impacts imaging segment revenue decreased  to  million but was up  on a local currency basis revenue growth was driven by strong demand for our d units in june we began delivering the new orthophos sl dd product line to our core european markets as planned however as a consequence revenue of our orthophos xg line declined which impacted revenue growth particularly in the us as we roll out the orthophos sl we expect revenue growth to accelerate beginning in q imaging segment gross profit margin was strong at  but down  basis points versus last year margins benefited from the weakening of the euro but were impacted by a less favorable product mix treatment center revenues were  million up  reported but up  on a local currency basis we had a very strong showing at the ids which drove exceptional sales growth in the comfort and standard segments in europe in the economy segment our new intego is very successful and in high demand treatment center gross profit margin was  a  basis points increase versus prior year the margin improvement was driven by favorable product and regional mix instrument revenues were  million down  reported but up  on a local currency basis instrument growth was driven by international markets particularly germany as a result of strong demand for our hygiene products and handpieces instrument segment gross profit margin was  down  basis points over last year segment gross profit margins decreased mainly due to unfavorable product and regional mix moving on to a review of the total companys third quarter pl us gaap gross profit margin was  compared to  in the prior year the increase in the gross profit margin was mainly due to the favorable foreign exchange effects as well as reduced amortization and depreciation expense resulting from the stepup to fair values of tangible and intangible assets sga expense was  million down  million versus last year the decrease in sga expense was primarily driven by the weakness of the euro and other major currencies we continue to invest in expansion of our sales and service infrastructure rd was  million down  million versus prior year the decrease was mostly driven by the weakness of the euro and the rampdown of expenses post ids net other income declined  million last year we benefited from a onetime gain associated with the sale of business assets net interest expense was  million up slightly from last year the income tax provision for the third quarter of fiscal  was  million representing an effective tax rate of  the  is in line with last years fullyear tax rate and our expectations for fiscal  as a result q us gaap net income was  million up  from prior year third quarter  dilutive gaap earnings per share was  compared to  in the prior year adjusted nongaap earnings per share was  up  from last year as a reminder adjusted nongaap eps excludes amortization and depreciation expense resulting from the stepup to fair values of intangible and tangible assets related to past business combinations gainloss on revaluation of foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities gainloss on derivative instruments any other cash or noncash items that management does not view as indicative of its ongoing operating performance and any related tax effects for a reconciliation of gaap eps to nongaap adjusted eps please see our earnings press release at june   the company had cash and cash equivalents of  million and total debt of  million resulting in net cash of  million this compares to net cash of  million at march   and  million a year ago free cash flow as defined by cash flow from operations less investing activities was a net cash inflow of  million in the quarter excluding  million used for the acquisition jeff mentioned free cash flow would have been an inflow of  million this compares to a net inflow of  million in last years third quarter which benefited from an  million inflow from the sale of a business as mentioned in other income excluding the acquisition this year and the divestiture last year our free cash flow improved  million or  now moving on to guidance we are reiterating our previously provided fiscal  guidance of  to  organic local currency revenue growth at current exchange rates the acquisition should add approximately  million to our q revenues or around  to our full year revenue guidance taking this into consideration our local currency growth range increases to  to  we are also reiterating adjusted nongaap eps to range between  and  the acquisition is not expected to have a material impact on q eps guidance is based on the following key inputs for the full year we now anticipate the segment gross profit margin to be around  basis points higher than last years level reported gross profit margin is expected to improve more than the segment gross profit due to the stepdown in amortization expense sga as a percentage of sales is still projected to be between  and  of sales for fiscal  rd expenses are still forecasted to be between  and  of sales the estimated effective tax rate for fiscal  is still around  our share count for the year is currently running a tad higher than we anticipated negatively impacting our fullyear eps by about  based on all of these factors we are reiterating our guidance range of  to  currently we see a slight bias to the lower half rather than the upper half of the range i will now turn the call back to jeff jeff jeffrey t slovin  president chief executive officer  director thank you uli as you just heard we expect the positive momentum in our business to continue into the fourth quarter our guidance implies another quarter of  growth or better in eps our success didnt happen overnight almost  years ago the first chairside cadcam system was developed with the vision of one day becoming the centerpiece of the dental office today we are seeing that vision becoming a reality this quarter cadcam posted record sales and robust growth around the world there was tremendous excitement at the international dental show for our products and software not only are we seeing more users adopting cerec but we are seeing utilization and cooperation with labs increasing significantly this quarter our sirona connect portal the digital highway that connects dentists with their labs saw usage rise  yearoveryear earlier this year we indicated that labs are encouraging dentists to send them digital files which require the use of an intraoral camera like our omnicam bluecam or apollo di labs are even providing financial incentives for dentists to go digital at the last few trade shows we have noticed an even stronger endorsement from labs they are actually accompanying dentists to our booth and encouraging them to buy our products we also continue to advance cerec to the forefront of dental education as weve told you in the past we are in over  of us dental schools and expect that number to grow we recently released prepcheck  software a new software aimed at assisting the training of students in a traditional setting students practice on models and have to wait for their professors to assess and comment on their work with prepcheck  after initial prep work students can take a digital impression with a sirona scanner get a quick assessment and get right back to work this software not only enhances the value of cerec to dental schools but makes cerec a central part of the students education when they enter the workforce they will have an added comfort level with cerec and its capabilities this should drive demand for our products we also believe that the roi proposition will accelerate adoption this new restorative orthodontic and implantology workflow makes cerec more profitable and transforms a dental practice with this tool general practitioners can now instantly offer a broader range of new procedures and products to their patients with this increased utility cerec has truly become the centerpiece of the dental office as uli mentioned in june we launched our orthophos sl our new dd digital platform we initially launched the product in germany and throughout europe feedback from the launch has been outstanding and we will roll out the product globally and expect it to drive imaging growth for years to come d adoption is growing rapidly and integration with cadcam is driving safer faster and better procedures one key design element that permeates our rd process is the importance of product integration sirona has long believed that the more integrated products are the easier it will be for the practitioner to reap the benefits of them treatment centers have always been the brandshaper of dental offices around the world and for years sirona has had the only treatment center with a digital workflow sironas dental chairs are not only highly functional and ergonomically designed but are by far the most technologicallyintegrated products on the market our exceptional  growth this quarter highlights the strength of our portfolio and the differentiation of our products at the international dental show we introduced the ability to integrate xray generators into our treatment centers since the launch weve seen strong demand for treatment centers with this added technology at ids we also introduced the concept of a fullyintegrated treatment center with our omnicam we will begin rolling out this product at the end of the fiscal year with one of the largest installed base of treatment centers around the globe sirona will leverage our growing installed base to usher in the new era of integrated digital dental offices our installed base of treatment centers instruments imaging and cadcam creates a strong competitive advantage for sirona we have invested resources in prioritizing customer service and satisfaction and have earned a loyal customer base for doing so this customer base is a powerful asset that will support our growth for years to come in september we will celebrate our cerec th anniversary which will be the largest and most comprehensive digital dentistry event in history it will be filled with exciting developments and new offerings i strongly encourage all of you to attend once again we will host an analyst lunch on thursday september  please get in touch with josh if youre interested in joining us the shift to digital dentistry is transformational to the dental practice it not only increases the efficiency of the office but also facilitates the offering of more services delivers better outcomes and improves profitability the strength of this years ids further validates that digital dentistry is gaining momentum and sirona is the best positioned to capitalize on this trend id like to thank our distribution partners led by patterson in the us and henry schein internationally and our outstanding employees whose efforts and ideas make sironas success possible uli and i will now address your questions operator please proceed questionandanswer session operator thank you our first question comes from tycho peterson with jpmorgan your line is open tycho w peterson  jpmorgan securities llc thanks jeff i want to ask about the cadcam strength obviously notable this quarter can you maybe talk a little bit about how much of this was just maybe pentup demand coming out of ids and what are your thoughts on underlying market growth today are you seeing more of an acceleration i guess jeffrey t slovin  president chief executive officer  director yes i think absolutely we have to look to the ids which we told you we thought was terrific for us more demos being done having the opportunity to present roi brought a lot of dentists in who were thinking we just did restorative certainly what were so pleased about is the ids really was about digital dentistry you heard a lot about cadcam and you heard about chairside which made dentists understand thats where dentistry is going and what we were able to do which really tells you a lot about our organization our brand and capabilities is turn that excitement into orders and not only by the way on the gp side but also labs got involved and consumables so i do believe that were seeing adoption increasing certainly  growth is really strong and the fact that we saw it broadbased gives me a lot of comfort i will tell you in germany it was extraordinary growth it also highlights the fact that more german dentists are taking a look at cadcam and turning that into a decision to purchase so we feel were well placed we also see that strength going into the fourth quarter as well tycho w peterson  jpmorgan securities llc and then i guess for uli if i think about the adjustment in gross margin can you maybe talk a little bit about the drivers there i guess the underlying question is there a price dynamic thats playing into that ulrich michel  chief financial officer  executive vice president the adjustment are you talking about guidance tycho w peterson  jpmorgan securities llc yes in guidance ulrich michel  chief financial officer  executive vice president okay look we like our margins in the third quarter overall i think we should say this were very proud of the cadcam margin the imaging margins were very strong in the context of the full year but we wanted to give you an indication of what we see jeff has already pointed to the fact that the emerging markets are a bit weaker than what we thought i think this is one point we stressed to you from the beginning of the year that this is the wild card in our budget and in our forecast and guidance and these markets have played out worse for us than what we thought you know that in these places we largely go direct which carries higher margins than our dealer business in europe for example where were doing a little better at the moment and which is compensating on the top line largely the shortfall we have out of these regions so that has an impact on our margins then you see for example the instruments business that weighs in we sold a fairly unfavorable mix this quarter so that weighs in on the fullyear margins and i think these are the major drivers tycho i hope this answers your question tycho w peterson  jpmorgan securities llc yeah thats helpful and then actually maybe jeff if i could just ask one more there were a number of kind of emerging opportunities you highlighted last quarter the adp supply agreement the ortho jv with align and the expanded patterson agreement are you able to give us any color on any of those three at this point or do we have to wait until next quarter jeffrey t slovin  president chief executive officer  director i would say that weve continued to move forward on all of those weve started a soft launch with the cerec meets invisalign this is a new way of scanning for ortho and so training is a component of it we are pleased with the collaboration i think you will see more of it later in the summer absolutely the interest from both gps and orthodontists is showing itself i would also say weve put a specific sales force in place to go directly to the ortho market as well and i think were steadily moving forward so very positive and tycho i think well even have more to say at cerec  and on our fourth quarter call tycho w peterson  jpmorgan securities llc okay thank you jeffrey t slovin  president chief executive officer  director sure operator our next question comes from john kreger with william blair your line is open john c kreger  william blair  co llc hi thanks very much jeff maybe just to followup on that can you just maybe give us a little bit more detail about when you expect to be shipping the orthophos sl in the us and the orthodontic version of omnicam in the us jeffrey t slovin  president chief executive officer  director i would say that this should be a latter part of the fourth quarter we will start to do that this year and the specific date around that i dont want to get into but i think you know there is an important upcoming date in september for us called cerec  but dont want to give you any specifics on that john john c kreger  william blair  co llc okay thanks and then given those interesting comments you made a few minutes ago with labs kind of encouraging more digital file submissions are you finally starting to see a little bit more interest in your di offerings or you still seeing sort of a disproportionate mix shift towards full cadcam on the chairside of your business jeffrey t slovin  president chief executive officer  director i would say the overwhelming interest is in chairside and ill talk a little bit about that for you in a moment but we are seeing this renaissance of a relationship with labs and the importance of capturing their customer to go directly to them and so that di aspect has played out but of course when you go chairside you also have the benefit of going to the lab on your more complicated cases john weve talked about competition in the past and made it clear about our  years in this business the clear market leader clinical studies working with all of the material companies but i think what we have to understand is there is the real difference between cerec chairside and others cerec really is about singlevisit dentistry that means having your patients sit down and being out within an hour an hour and a half maybe a little longer if its a more complicated case but when we talk about others were really talking about same day or next day dentistry which is not the same proposition for the dentist or the patient and then when youre talking about laboratory flows which is what a lot of the other competitors do theres no benefit at all for the patient and of course youre talking about multiple visits there is some potential savings but relatively light on that and so i think its important we get too caught up about just saying chairside but when you think about cerec you need to think about singlevisit dentistry and being done within an hour to an hour and a half john c kreger  william blair  co llc okay so thanks jeff so just to clarify it sounds like youre getting more labs driving interest in cadcam but it does not sound like youre starting to see more scanneronly sales within the cadcam segment is that the message jeffrey t slovin  president chief executive officer  director no were seeing more we are seeing scanner only but when you say look at all of them its disproportionately more chairside john c kreger  william blair  co llc okay jeffrey t slovin  president chief executive officer  director but we are pleased with that relationship with the lab and everybody feeling that there is a winwin proposition and in the past you would think that a lab would only want to talk about di and then the reality is theyre getting behind the fact and saying look chairside is fine too i just want when you want to go to a lab id like you to use the sirona highway to get it to me and i want to show that support john c kreger  william blair  co llc very good thank you ulrich michel  chief financial officer  executive vice president really the growth rates are high on the di only but the base is lower and the good thing on the di only is that the interest is much more for our omnicam which is more expensive and carries more margin than for our other offerings jeffrey t slovin  president chief executive officer  director its a fair point john c kreger  william blair  co llc interesting thank you jeffrey t slovin  president chief executive officer  director sure john operator our next question comes from robert jones with goldman sachs your line is open nathan a rich  goldman sachs  co hi this is nathan rich on for bob this morning just wanted to go back to guidance youve talked on the call pretty positively about the sales momentum that you saw in the third quarter continuing going forward but uli i think you said that your bias was towards the lower half of the eps range i was just wondering if you could kind of help square your comments there is it just a factor of margins maybe being a little bit softer than you had expected or any moving pieces related to the acquisition just any color you could share there ulrich michel  chief financial officer  executive vice president yes i can the acquisition to start with should not have a big impact on this we said this from the beginning its about  on the revenue which you can add to the range that we gave you in your models the relationship between cost of goods sold and revenue in the business that we acquired is very similar to our overall average its in the mid so i told you at the current exchange rate its about  million so the impact that you see even if its a tad below maybe our overall margin is not very big right so this is not the reason why we are pointing to the margins the biggest reason is as we have said the growth in the brics that is lower than we anticipated which we are compensating with growth in other parts of the world mostly dealer business with slightly lower margins and the other point i would say a luxury problem to have its the technicality of our share count when we started out the year we had assumed that we would slightly reduce our diluted shares outstanding through our buyback but with the high share price and the increase over the last quarters we are now slightly up in our share count and the impact is about is  compared to when we started out the year and we gave the guidance and since were already in august whatever we buy back for the remainder of the year will not have a material impact or an impact on this so these are the two main reasons share count and then the growth in the brics with high margins that is compensated with growth in the other parts of the world mostly through dealer business and slightly lower margins jeffrey t slovin  president chief executive officer  director i would just highlight again uli said slight bias which means there are opportunities as well on the upper end but there is a slight bias to the lower nathan a rich  goldman sachs  co understood makes sense and then just a quick followup on the us growth im wondering if you could give us the growth rate eximaging just so we could get a better sense of kind of underlying trend in the market jeffrey t slovin  president chief executive officer  director no were not going to go into segment details on that but we do want to give you the confidence that you know what were hearing from our team as well as the other dental companies is that the market is stable and improving we qualified the us market as healthy were seeing some momentum cadcam did well and i think you need to put this in perspective we havent launched yet our sl and so there is a lot of excitement waiting for that which means that the xg has some downward pressure on it as an older technology still a terrific product but overall we feel were wellpositioned in the us and patterson is a big part of that and they continue to talk about the acceleration and of the adoption of cadcam and i see that playing out and i think youre going to see that even stronger at cerec  nathan a rich  goldman sachs  co great thanks for the questions jeffrey t slovin  president chief executive officer  director yes operator our next question comes from steve beuchaw with morgan stanley your line is open steve c beuchaw  morgan stanley  co llc oh hi guys good morning and thanks for taking the question just a couple of fine points on my end one could you give us an update on the fda process behind the treatment center launch through patterson in the united states jeffrey t slovin  president chief executive officer  director yeah steve c beuchaw  morgan stanley  co llc and then ill go ahead if you dont mind well actually ill pause there thanks jeffrey t slovin  president chief executive officer  director okay so just to be clear right now our c is available in the us in july we received approval for the teneo and the intego which were very excited about as you know the teneo is our highend treatment center really a traffic brandshaper for the dental practice and our intego is also a great product but more aimed at the economy segment of it and so this is great news for us its a real testament to our team frankly to be able to get this registered as quickly as they were able to and im talking steve they didnt get it done weeks early but they got it done months earlier than we had expected so im proud of our teams ability to do that ulrich michel  chief financial officer  executive vice president i think we did it in about a third of the average time it takes for approval so thats i think a testament to both to the quality of and strength of our product and our team steve c beuchaw  morgan stanley  co llc im going to do my best not to translate those expectations over to other fda processes jeffrey t slovin  president chief executive officer  director yes steve c beuchaw  morgan stanley  co llc and then ill ask an openended question for you uli i think its always interesting to hear your latest thoughts on efforts around capital allocation it would be interesting to hear a little bit about your thinking around the acquisition that you guys mentioned today and then more broadly speaking how youre thinking on that front thanks so much jeffrey t slovin  president chief executive officer  director thanks ulrich michel  chief financial officer  executive vice president okay thanks capital allocation i think weve told you our priorities from the beginning first thing is reinvest in our business rd and were funding all the opportunities that we see which warrant so were not saving any money on our rd efforts we grow our infrastructure in the emerging markets and other parts of the world where we are not represented as we want to be and were looking for acquisitions actively which is what weve told you for a few quarters now this quarter we just happened to close one at the last day of the quarter we gave you a bit a sense of the financial impact well tell you more when we give  guidance and once these products have been officially launched with us so we do not want to preempt the commercial impact of this thats why were not saying much more but we think its a really good acquisition we like it dont expect too much in the first few quarters from this but i think once its integrated looking maybe three four quarters out it should start contributing to our income as well and to our cash flow for the moment its neutral steve c beuchaw  morgan stanley  co llc could we see this product at the show in las vegas in september ulrich michel  chief financial officer  executive vice president i dont think we want to comment on this at this point steve c beuchaw  morgan stanley  co llc okay thanks so much ulrich michel  chief financial officer  executive vice president okay operator our next question comes from erin wilson with boa you line is open erin e wilson  bank of america merrill lynch great thanks so much i believe last quarter you noted orders for orthophos sl or just imaging products in general were strong heading into the quarter how much was that contributing and was there some sort of timing issue there in the orders with the june launch i just want to understand the dynamics there jeffrey t slovin  president chief executive officer  director i think there was an issue which we tried to highlight on our last call that there was a lot of anticipation for the sl and certainly we were able to have some sales of the sl in germany and europe and we got outstanding feedback now thats what you always want but of course when you have an older generation and that feedback starts to get out there pretty quickly in markets that doesnt have it then you have a situation where a number of your distributors and doctors are waiting for the latest and greatest product offering which we think very highly of that i think the other thing is that as weve discussed theres a trend that has a lot of momentum which is d which is to a small degree in certain countries being offset by declines in d and that also goes into the mix now keep in mind that the us our largest market has not yet launched the sl but is pretty much aware of the fact that its coming but you should look for a pickup in imaging in q erin e wilson  bank of america merrill lynch okay great thanks and do you anticipate a benefit from section  clarity in the coming quarter i guess that was the headwind going into the end of the calendar year last year and could you speak to the dynamics there as well jeffrey t slovin  president chief executive officer  director erin its absolutely a fair question i think i can speak for myself and all of the other dental ceos we hope so we think its a nice proposition to the dentist typically the accountants are able to explain to them how they benefit so well from that and having clarity this early should have an impact so we are confident that knowing whats going to happen will play a better role for us in our communications erin e wilson  bank of america merrill lynch okay great thanks so much jeffrey t slovin  president chief executive officer  director thanks erin operator our next question comes from jason bednar with robert w baird your line is open jason m bednar  robert w baird  co inc broker thanks guys good morning so i just wanted to come back to some of your comments on the bric markets a little bit of a twofold question here so first on the top line this is presumably more of a market issue with some of the biggest incremental change in your commentary seemed to come from china and i think you said in past calls that brazil and russia had been softer throughout the year so i guess first is this all accurate or are you seeing some incremental softness in some of those markets and then on the spending side does the slowness in those markets make you any more hesitant to throw spending to further build out your sales and service presence in some of those markets jeffrey t slovin  president chief executive officer  director okay a lot in that question lets start and say that we mentioned when we started the year that there were some clear concerns that were visible in both russia and brazil on political and then economic macro levels i would tell you both of our organizations are well run and we feel well positioned in russia and brazil but the headwinds have been significant and while weve said that these are low singledigit revenues for us nevertheless they do add up and had an impact but i think that from a standpoint of investing in them right now would be a little bit too early to do it but we do believe both those markets will come back that were the best positioned to sell technology and we would continue to invest in them but they have had a toll on our earnings ulrich michel  chief financial officer  executive vice president china jeffrey t slovin  president chief executive officer  director china has been a little bit different china is a top worldwide dental market we sell the most equipment of anyone in china its been a terrific grower for us its continuing to grow but we see that there are more economic and political headwinds there we dont expect to grow as fast as we have in the past for now until this cleans up but i would say our management and our feet on the street are second to none and we see china to be a longterm growth driver so absolutely well continue to invest in that area but there are some challenges but i believe china will continue to be a great driver for sirona for years to come the sirona brand in all three of these countries is recognized well and that branding plays an important role during tough times and keep in mind also this that some of the areas have had to deal with financing challenges like brazil as that starts to ease up well be in better shape but i think i feel good about our product portfolio how were positioned and the people that we have there so well just have to wait this out a bit but the real end of the story is this weve got a global business and look what stepped up europe stepped up in a big way germany outstanding japan this is what youre able to do with sirona when there is areas in one pocket we have other areas that perform even better jason m bednar  robert w baird  co inc broker okay thanks and thats all helpful the other question i just wanted to come back to the acquisition you guys did and i dont know if youll answer this but hoping to get maybe some additional color on the deal even if you dont want to disclose the exact product or the company acquired but are you able to tell us whether this fits into one of your existing product segments or if its maybe a new category or is there anything you can provide i guess you told us from a profitability margin perspective that its mid on the gross margin side but anything on whether it fits in again an existing product category that you already have jeffrey t slovin  president chief executive officer  director no look we appreciate the question and we know youre very curious about it but its not like we want to give you well youre close here or there we really want to wait we think competitively it makes sense uli and i like the technology ulrich michel  chief financial officer  executive vice president and we would love to talk to you jeffrey t slovin  president chief executive officer  director in fact from our perspective wed love to start getting up on the table and telling you the impact of it down the road but when you want to have a commercial launch of it and its going to be relatively soon the best thing we can do is not launch it on a conference call and so were excited about it we think it will play into our strategy it will lead to growth down the road and its something that our investors and analysts will appreciate and thats as far as were willing to go on this call jason m bednar  robert w baird  co inc broker okay thank you guys operator your next question comes from brandon couillard with jefferies your line is open s brandon couillard  jefferies llc thanks good morning jeffrey t slovin  president chief executive officer  director good morning s brandon couillard  jefferies llc just back on that acquisition i think you said  million of revenue in the fourth quarter is that from the commercial launch that you mentioned or is that related to the base business of the assets and would it be fair to annualize that number and think about that as a fair revenue estimate for next year in terms of contribution jeffrey t slovin  president chief executive officer  director okay brandon look i think you can think about the  million as a part of the base business with regard to how to think about it for next year well give you guidance on that in our fourth quarter call when we give guidance s brandon couillard  jefferies llc okay fair enough ulrich michel  chief financial officer  executive vice president at the beginning we think its probably fair to think of this for the base business as an annualized number depending on exchange rates and so on but its probably fair right jeffrey t slovin  president chief executive officer  director and obviously brandon theyre trying to even lowball me by going – uli thank you for that one i want more of it other than an annualized number s brandon couillard  jefferies llc all right helpful one minor question for uli could you tell us the impact of currency on operating dollars in the period ulrich michel  chief financial officer  executive vice president i can try to give you a bit of a sense i think weve always said in the first half of the year it was a slight tailwind netnet for us its always been a hurt on the revenue line its been a hurt on the absolute gross profit dollars although its been a favorable impact on the margin percentage netnet it was a hurt on the gross profit dollars but because of our high share of sga and rd spend in other areas than dollars mostly the euro weve slightly overcompensated the dollar hurt on the gross profit line when you come down to operating or net income especially with the fairly high spend in euros around ids and the product development efforts leading into it and weve also i think on some of these said that on a full year basis we would expect this to mitigate and the impact to be minimal on a full year basis at the exchange rates of the various times when we did it so now in q as we anticipated it was a little bit of a headwind to us on the bottomline the loss we saw on gross profit dollars was largely but not fully compensated so its mildly unfavorable for the third quarter at the current exchange rates this is probably going to be a little bit bigger but were not talking huge dollars here were talking now looking forward maybe  a quarter or so unfavorable something like this all right s brandon couillard  jefferies llc super thank you ulrich michel  chief financial officer  executive vice president youre welcome jeffrey t slovin  president chief executive officer  director thank you operator our final question comes from jon block with stifel your line is open jon d block  stifel nicolaus  co inc great thanks guys and just a couple of quick ones for you the revs were obviously well ahead the opex leverage was a little light at least from what we were looking for and that sort of constrained the magnitude of the bottomline beat uli maybe this one is for you i know fx can move things around a bit but if i go back to  and  call it the prior two ids years i had the sga spend down about  to  from march to june this year it was up arguably  qonq so anything you can call out on the moving pieces or maybe where some incremental spend is being put in plus ulrich michel  chief financial officer  executive vice president you lost me a little bit on this one i have to say jon d block  stifel nicolaus  co inc i guess if you can comment on why didnt we see more opex leverage and why was sga up qonq in an ids year if you could go back to  and  that wasnt the case ulrich michel  chief financial officer  executive vice president a part of this is fx i would really have to look at this jon d block  stifel nicolaus  co inc but fx didnt move around a lot quartertoquarter i get yearoveryear but qonq it didnt move around a whole lot ulrich michel  chief financial officer  executive vice president i have to look at this really on exfx basis well get back to you with more detail if you want to offline but the basic question why didnt we see more leverage this is the brics that we have told you is part of the answer and you know we had some rampup expenses as we said for the orthophos sl still were investing for example in the treatment center launch in the us right that was a spend in the third quarter and things like this jeffrey t slovin  president chief executive officer  director yeah we had some programs also in germany i mean germany results were extraordinary uberstruck as we said jon but there was also some programs weve had in place as well which well take those every day but they were not annualized jon d block  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay got it and maybe just to shift gears and you led me into the next question with your commentary around germany jeff just at a high level can you speak to maybe some of the other – you detailed the bric markets but some of the other european markets schein and dentsply talked about greater consistency or a broadening out in europe at least on the consumables side jeffrey t slovin  president chief executive officer  director yes yeah jon d block  stifel nicolaus  co inc im wondering if youre seeing that also take place on the equipment side as well jeffrey t slovin  president chief executive officer  director we absolutely are this quarter for europe was really broadbased strength i think thats absolutely right and by the way across all of our segments so europe really came through and also in germany all of our segments were up as you saw treatment center big cadcam bigger this really i would say has a lot to do about how well we performed at the ids and it played out well in europe very few of the countries in europe were down in the quarter so i think as we think about it we were lockstep with consumables jon i think youll recall our second quarter we also highlighted europe the consumable companies werent as strong as we were and thankfully it wasnt a one quarter wonder for us and it played nicely after the ids hope that color helps you anything else operator thank you that concludes the qa session i will now turn the call back over to jeffrey slovin president and ceo of sirona for closing remarks please go ahead jeffrey t slovin  president chief executive officer  director thank you very much for joining us today i hope a number of

to welcome all of you to our first quarter and first ever conference call as dentsply sirona also joining us on the call today ulrich michel executive vice president and chief financial officer chris clark president and chief operating officer of our technologies business and derek leckow vice president of investor relations im delighted to report that our first quarter was a very successful one we seamlessly completed our merger and begin working on the great opportunities ahead of us rather than being distracted by the merger the team came together and was energized to perform in our first  days together dentsply sirona team has much to be proud of weve rebranded our company announced our leadership team and created an operating model to help optimize our growth as you can see on the earnings presentation we have organized our self into two segments dental and healthcare consumables and technologies our dental and healthcare consumables business is comprised of our endodontics preventive prosthetics restorative and instruments division along with wellspect our healthcare business our technologies business is comprised of our implant cadcam imaging treatment center and the orthodontic businesses we organized these segments to maximize efficiency and product development and crossselling opportunities in addition to developing new standalone products our segments will introduce integrated solutions to improve workflow in advanced patient care within technologies our loyal install base of cadcam and imaging has been expanding to incorporate more specialty procedures for decades we have a proven track record of using technology to allow the dentists to advance patient care both in terms of outcome and treatment times now we are moving towards integrated solutions using technology combined with clinical products to provide dentists with endtoend solutions and advance their own service capabilities this was first evident in restoratives but is now moving rapidly into implants orthodontics and endodontics these capabilities further facilitated with dentsply sironas worldclass clinical education platform creates a powerful basis for advanced learnings in clinical settings along the same lines specialists are demanding more hightech equipment like d imaging and digital impressions our relationships with these practitioners will help drive adoption of our technologies from a product development standpoint combining the experience and knowledge of our strategic business units will enable the development of integrated technologies furthermore by collaborating innovation should come faster and offer more to practitioners than ever before in consumables the majority of our revenues are operatoryrelated and often used in conjunction with one another we are focusing on offering practitioners endtoend solutions based on particular procedures all root canal procedures require multiple tools and are completed with restoration dentsply sirona is the only manufacturer with restodontics strategy offering all the necessary instruments equipment and consumables to diagnose and complete a root canal from start to finish as you can see the goal of organizing into these segments was to accelerate adoption of all of our products which will translate into topline growth by driving growth and increasing productivity of our sales and service infrastructure we will leverage our sales to deliver strong bottomline growth as well with so many opportunities ahead we have created an integration management office to work handinhand with senior management to oversee the seamless merging of both companies and cultures in order to capture our synergies we have formed multiple teams to actively manage our cost of revenue initiatives feedback from these teams have been overwhelmingly positive ideas are being shared across organizations and plans are being implemented to ensure these synergies come to fruition we are confident that we can deliver on our promise of  million in synergies by year three of our merger capital allocation will also be important part of our goforward strategy our company generates a significant amount of free cash flow and we have a large and flexible balance sheet as always our priority is to invest in growth drivers for our business we will also use our cash flow to make acquisitions repurchase our stock and support our dividend during the quarter we executed on the  million share repurchase consistent with the announcement we made at the time of the merger we continue to have  million shares authorized for repurchase we have flexibility to pursue multiple avenues of capital deployment all of which will drive value for our shareholders the opportunity ahead of us is more significant than anything either dentsply or sirona ever had on a standalone basis we have never been in a better position to grow and deliver shareholder value turning to the first quarter uli will explain some of the technicalities on the reported revenue growth i will focus my comments here on the underlying growth of our two combined businesses although the merger closed on february  i think it is more meaningful to discuss the performance of our business during the full quarter we achieved strong results with our combined businesses growing  constant currency excluding acquisitions divestitures and discontinued products internal sales growth was  geographically we have solid growth across all regions rest of world led our growth delivering  constant currency driven by internal sales growth of  there continue to be a number of challenging environments around the globe but we are much better positioned after the merger in these areas we expect our rest of world region to be the fastestgrowing region this year the us grew  constant currency driven by internal growth of  led by the technology segment europe grew  constant currency with internal sales growth of  driven by solid growth in both our technology and consumables segments on a segment basis our technology business led our growth with  constant currency growth internallygenerated sales grew  led by strong growth in our hightech products cadcam was particularly strong ahead of our new zirconia product launch in q dental and healthcare consumables generated internal sales growth of  growth was driven by operatoryfocused consumables first quarter adjusted eps was  representing  growth we achieved strong financial results while investing in rd and in our sales and service infrastructure we will continue to ramp these investments in q to better position our accelerating growth innovation and bestinclass customer service will be two key pillars of our new organization overall we reported a very solid first quarter ill now turn the call over to uli who will review our first quarter financials ulrich michel  chief financial officer  executive vp thanks jeff and good morning everyone this morning i will discuss our gaap results as well as our nongaap results including the sales performance of our combined businesses for the complete threemonth period of the first quarter  as if the businesses had been consolidated on january   i walk through the earnings performance i will also point out any impacts of merger accounting on earnings in the first quarter our reported revenues increased  million to  million up  reported the consolidation of one month of sirona contributed sales of  million which were reduced by  million to  million as a result of purchase accounting this reduction from our normal revenue recognition practices results from a onetime treatment of deferred income on service contracts where any deferred income at the time of the merger is removed from future revenues and income this onetime treatment reduced revenue by  million this quarter and will reduce future revenue by about  million in the aggregate over the next six quarters as of march  any new contracts are again being treated as they have been historically for nongaap reporting we will treat all the contracts existing at the time of the merger under the ongoing policy as if incurred in normal course of business for the full threemonth period ending march   adjusted sales of our combined businesses excluding precious metals grew  on a constant currency basis internal growth was  excluding  favorable impact from net acquisition and  basis points unfavorable impact from discontinued products foreign exchange movements were a headwind to revenue of  jeff already addressed revenue growth by geography and segment we have provided reconciliation tables for every segment and region that will help you understand how the gaap reported revenue and internal growth for the complete quarter come together us gaap gross profit was  million up  million from  million in  gross profit as a percentage of net sales excluding precious metal content decreased by  basis points to  from  in the prior year as you can see on the nongaap reconciliation tables the gross profit margin was negatively impacted by about  basis points due to the rolloff of mergerrelated fair value adjustments the company generated benefits from its global efficiency program which were largely offset by negative foreign currency impacts reported sga expenses which include rd was  million up  million versus last year sga expenses as a percentage of sales excluding precious metal increased  basis points compared to prior year mergerrelated expenses negatively impacted the rate by about  basis points partially offset by savings from the global efficiency program and the consolidation of sirona sga expenses were favorably impacted by foreign currency translation of approximately  basis points restructuring expenses were  million down  million from last year in total gaap operating income was  million representing  of sales excluding precious metals excluding the nongaap items set forth in our nongaap financial measures the adjusted operating margin was  which compares to  last year margins benefited from the positive impacts of the global efficiency program and the consolidation of sirona due to the strong performance in march the benefit from the consolidation is more pronounced had we consolidated sirona for the complete threemonth period our adjusted operating margin would have been approximately  basis points lower we believe this is more representative of the current performance level of our business net interest expense for the first quarter was  million  million lower than prior year largely driven by lower average debt levels other income in the first quarter was  million with the biggest impact coming from a small business divestiture which was removed from adjusted income for the three months ended march   income taxes were a net benefit of  million versus an expense of  million last year as part of the merger we will be able to generate an early synergy by recovering previously reserved tax assets of  million this is the single biggest driver of the favorable development and will be recovered in cash in future periods we have removed this benefit from our nongaap results as a result q us gaap net income attributable to dentsply sirona was  million up  from the prior year first quarter  diluted gaap eps was  compared to  in the prior year adjusted nongaap earnings per share was  up  from last year for a reconciliation of gaap eps to nongaap adjusted eps please see our earnings press release cash flow from operating activities during the three months period ended march   was  million compared to  million during the three months period ended march   the yearoveryear decrease was primarily related to a  million larger increase in accounts receivables due to stronger revenues in the month of march and payments of approximately  million of mergerrelated transaction fees and integration costs cash provided by investing activities was  million favorable which reflects the assumed cash in the merger with sirona of  million these funds were largely used to execute the  million share repurchase which in exchange is a major driver behind the  million cash used in financing activities the companys cash and cash equivalents increased by  million to  million during the three months ended march   now turning to guidance for fiscal  we expect adjusted nongaap eps in the range of  to  our guidance includes the following assumptions constant currency sales growth to range from  to  excluding precious metals this includes a  benefit from acquisitions divestitures and discontinued products and internal growth in the range of  to  at current exchange rates this translates to reported revenues excluding precious metals of  billion to  billion please keep in mind that growth comps get more difficult in q and q related to last years record international dental show and strong performance in our consumables business at the current exchange rates we would expect adjusted operating income margins in the range of  to  we anticipate our adjusted tax rate to be approximately  our eps range implies a fullyear share count of  million to  million fully diluted shares our share count will increase to  million as we move into q i will now turn the call back to jeff jeffrey t slovin  chief executive officer  director thanks uli we are in the very early days of our journey as dentsply sirona but we have a lot to be excited about the key driving force behind our merger was growth by accelerating the adoption of our products we can

evaluating ways to improve our processes and manufacture more efficiently we have begun cutting redundant corporate expenses and consolidating some of our countries all of these actions will generate

field of reps introducing customers to our expanded portfolio we have a large sales organization around the globe and theyve been meeting to find more ways to collaborate and accelerate growth while working with and respecting a wide range of distributor relationships that we have in place these are winwin scenarios for dentsply sirona and our distribution partners the more significant opportunities will require investment in both rd and infrastructure while these take time and will mean that some of our revenue synergies are backend loaded to our third year we are extremely confident that we can deliver them and they will be significant while these integrated solutions are in development our rd engine is continuing to introduce innovation to drive penetration of our products weve recently introduced a number of new meaningful products to the market our surefil sdr builds on our revolutionary marketleading bulk fill composite platform the product has enhanced radiopacity in interproximal layer in our healthcare business the new navina bowel management system provides a novel approach to irrigation in a rapidly expanding market early feedback has been overwhelmingly positive during the quarter we launched our cerec zirconia package which was well received by the market the zirconia package includes the new cerec speedfire our unique high speed sintering furnace and combination with the cerec chairside cadcam system it allows for a single visit dentistry of zirconia crowns and small bridges in the past using conventional furnaces zirconia

processing zirconia chairside zirconia is the most popular ceramic material for crowns in the us having this material available for cerec will substantially expand the addressable market for cerec in

together we will change dentistry for the better we will now address your questions operator please proceed questionandanswer session operator thank you and our first question will come from jeff johnson with robert baird jeff d johnson  robert w baird  co inc broker thank you can you hear me okay guys jeffrey t slovin  chief executive officer  director perfect ulrich michel  chief financial officer  executive vp good morning jeff jeff d johnson  robert w baird  co inc broker all right great congratulations guys on a good first quarter here jeff just wanted to start with you and then i have a followup for uli but i know youve only been in the seat now for a couple months here running the combined companies but as you put everything together any sense yet on kind of how youre thinking about the next several years from a top line perspective or maybe from an earnings growth perspective just how youre seeing the two companies come together jeffrey t slovin  chief executive officer  director new company same old questions right look first of all it is early days and i have to tell you im thrilled with what the teams been able to do together frankly one of the nice surprises is to see how talented we are across the globe in sales marketing rd and certainly our functional areas hr and finance its a big deal when two of the largest companies come together to make sure that you have the right cultural fit but one thing is for sure that we aligned on is really on our mission jeff which is to empower dental professionals to deliver better safer and faster dental care and this idea of endtoend solutions is where we feel the market is going so a key fundamental to the merger was growth so we expect to grow faster in the future and the reason for that is were better together to be able to accelerate the adoption of technologies and digital dentistry frankly when we look at what is possible on the synergy side as you look at our specialty areas as well as our technology theres a lot of things that we see early days that are just going to continue to play for us and of course singlevisit dentistry is just getting stronger its difficult to say if were at a tipping point yet but we feel better about that and our ability to work with cadcam and implant and ortho certainly gives us a strong feel for our ability to mobilize our synergy opportunities so theres a lot of genuine excitement here and i think its truly great for the dental industry and our distributor partners because were going to do a lot of great things together jeff d johnson  robert w baird  co inc broker all right great and uli maybe my followup question as i look at the eps guidance over the balance of this year it looks like its kind of lowsingle digits eps growth we dont have the pro forma net income pro forma operating income from last year but when i mash your two models together and look at kind of the net income operating income growth this year it looks like even on a pro forma combined basis this year over last year its going to be much higher than that lowsingle digit so what am i missing there between the operating income and net income good solid growth and the eps growth that looks like its going to come in lower than that over the balance of the year ulrich michel  chief financial officer  executive vp yes i think jeff the best way to think about it or to bridge it for you is if we start with dentsplys standalone eps last year of  right and we take the midpoint of our guidance this year  so this would be a  increase or a  which we will probably refer to as lowsingle digits right then i told you that we expect fx headwinds of about  which would add another  and as you know weve issued dentsply shares in exchange for sirona shares and with the multiple difference we issued depends on if you look at it trailing or forwardlooking but somewhere in the neighborhood of  million  million more shares for the same earnings than had we issued the shares at the same multiple so this gives you a diluted impact for the fullyear of somewhere in the neighborhood of  to  say  for arguments sake so thats another  and if you add this up you look at eps growth excluding fx and excluding the difference of the multiples on the issuance of about  and if you use this i think you can back into our earnings growth from there does that answer your question jeff d johnson  robert w baird  co inc broker yes ill go back and check my math but thats helpful thank you uli ulrich michel  chief financial officer  executive vp thanks youre welcome jeffrey t slovin  chief executive officer  director thanks jeff operator and our next question comes from robert willoughby with credit suisse please go ahead tyler harris  credit suisse securities usa llc broker hey guys its tyler harris in for bob today it looks like you guys had pretty impressive internal growth rates across the board in the quarter can you give us any additional color on specific countries markets growth rates especially in regards to europe and asia pacific jeffrey t slovin  chief executive officer  director sure so i think we were across the board strong no question about it rest of the world led the way for us and of course in the rest of the world lets start there a number of those areas are challenged japan of course is a very important market for us but it has its challenges but we continue to perform well youll start to hear a theme here tyler china also had some challenges but very pleased with what the team was able to accomplish there and even brazil which certainly has its challenges we were able to do particularly well in the consumables area which is pleasing for us we expect the rest of the world to be a growth driver for us for the rest of the year in europe we did well we havent seen anything really change over the last six months frankly russia still has some challenges but i was pleased with how the team was able to perform especially looking at our pipeline ahead we have a number of projects there southern europe seems to be picking up for us albeit its a low base germany performed but did not lead europe and then we saw strong growth in both technologies and consumables in europe but i would caution that our second quarter will be a difficult comp because of ids last year and keep in mind that ids was a record for us in the us again very strong growth led by technologies and also up operatory consumables we feel good about what were able to accomplish we also see that the us market is improving and the underlying demand for our products are strong tyler harris  credit suisse securities usa llc broker thank you operator and our next question comes from robert jones with goldman sachs robert patrick jones  goldman sachs  co thanks for the questions the original view was for the deal to be accretive in year one now jeff that youve had a little bit more time not a ton but a little bit more time to put the companies together and evaluate as well as evaluate the synergies a little bit more deeply can you maybe just give us a better sense of what youre seeing as far as the accretion or what your expectation is as far as the accretion will be in  specifically jeffrey t slovin  chief executive officer  director well specifically were not going to get into that but wed say were not backing off of our being accretive over the first  months absolutely we see such positive ability to grow together and of course weve had a little headwind that uli has talked about but by and large everything is on track or doing better again  days into this pleased about how the team has mobilized together weve certainly got some fx headwinds and as uli i think did a very nice job earlier talked about the share count headwind as well but from a standpoint of growth in this market  to  we think is leading the way and we feel good about our prospects for the rest of  and we started our year with a very solid quarter so i think were in a good place bob robert patrick jones  goldman sachs  co got it got it and then i guess just one specific one on the technology segment really nice growth there in the quarter was wondering if you could comment on the sales of cadcam specifically as your channel partner in north america had talked about carrying a higher level of inventory coming into this year im just trying to get a balance between what may be theyre holding versus what the endmarkets really doing any comments around that will be very helpful jeffrey t slovin  chief executive officer  director well certainly technology led the way at  for the quarter and certainly was leading the way in the us as well and that was led by cadcam and so the proposition has not changed with regard to us believing that along with patterson that cerec will become a standardofcare and were on the appropriate trajectory for that keep in mind also that we launched the new zirconia blocks but more critical to that was our speedfire so there was a lot of interests ahead of that and i think that its a situation where weve got a lot of opportunities for cerec in north america and well continue to uli do you want to comment ulrich michel  chief financial officer  executive vp no thank you you mentioned it with the launch of the speedfire i think people geared up to be ready to deliver right and we had a really good growth in cadcam i think there was nothing to be ashamed of right very solid growth robert patrick jones  goldman sachs  co no i agree thanks so much for the comments jeffrey t slovin  chief executive officer  director thanks youre welcome ulrich michel  chief financial officer  executive vp thanks operator our next question comes from john kreger with william blair roberto v fatta  william blair  co llc hi good morning guys this is robbie fatta in for john today thanks for taking the question as we think about the new segment structure is there any additional detail youll be giving going forward on some of the subsegments i know we just talked about cadcam a little bit but imaging or implants or any of the traditional subsegments that we used to get more detail on will we be getting any going forward jeffrey t slovin  chief executive officer  director well well certainly give you color for how they performed and certainly talk about new products the idea is we spent a lot of time thinking about how best to structure our organization how could it be most meaningful for our organization to grow to create value to be able to untap both cost and revenue synergies and so that structure also means that when you look at our overall business that there isnt any business that is really more than  so going down to our smallest which is instruments so were trying to get people focused on technology and consumable but certainly well deal with the strategic business units within it you had mentioned imaging imaging had a solid quarter and grew above the technology average it was across all regions so it was pretty strong growth roberto v fatta  william blair  co llc great and if we could just focus on implants for a second then can you give us a sense what the growth was for that in the quarter and then maybe our sense is that the potential synergies that you could generate is pretty big and the implant groups maybe the biggest out all of them is that a fair jeffrey t slovin  chief executive officer  director lets start with that because i think that is absolutely an onpoint comment we think implant is a strategic fulcrum for us we see how it relates to both our cadcam and imaging business we believe we are well positioned with our product offerings there we think this is a category that will continue to grow we have certainly a strong product offering there when you couple that with cerec atlantis simplant and isus its a robust offering rest of the world did better for us there we were pleased to see the volume come up pick up a bit for us there we saw some challenges in europe and certainly a market that were very excited about that we think we can do a lot more in is in the us chris you want to make a few more comments christopher t clark  president and chief operating officer technologies yes absolutely thanks jeff i think i agree with all of those comments i think this is one where both parties came with very significant and meaningful assets to come together if you think about again the implant is going digital obviously we have the cerec we have all the imaging coming from the sirona side weve got the atlantis simplant isus coming from the dentsply side and i would say im very pleased with how these teams have come together both from a standpoint of longer term or middle term if you will as well product synergies but in addition to that some nearerterm opportunities in terms of lead sharing kol sharing et cetera that again theres a lot of excitement a lot of movement and a lot of energy and again as jeff mentioned weve got expectations here that this really does accelerate implant growth rate and also frankly helps imaging and cadcam over time as well jeffrey t slovin  chief executive officer  director yes when you just think about the clinical education the engagement of our kols the possibility of what were able to do together with our technologies and in implant are pretty substantial roberto v fatta  william blair  co llc great thanks very much operator and our next question comes from matt miksic with ubs vik chopra  ubs securities llc hey good morning guys this is vik in for matt thanks for taking the questions i just had a couple over here so can you help us understand the puts and takes on gross margin i know you had mentioned fx in your global efficiency programs anything in particular on product mix for example and then how should we think about gross margin for  and anything in particular we should keep in mind over the next three quarters jeffrey t slovin  chief executive officer  director well let me start and then ill hand it over to uli on that but you need to understand that product mix and regional mix can have a significant impact in any quarter but now that we talk about our businesses no business being greater than  coming all the way down to  it should take some of that lumpiness out of it but nevertheless in the quarter it can have the impact of more than  basis points over  basis points depending on the mix so mix does play a role no question about it but the way to start to think about that is how we talk about how the consumables or the technology businesses grew in the quarter thats the first thing you need to think about but were trying to also get you focused on our operating income which we think is a better lever to understand our businesses but go ahead ulrich michel  chief financial officer  executive vp yes i think if you look at our margins in q we provided you with the rec tables i talked a little bit on the prepared remarks on the gaap versus nongaap items so i think what you see on the rec table is the margin a little bit over  reported for the first quarter after these adjustments i did mention that the fact that sirona has a very strong margin we only consolidated one month of sirona pronounced a little bit the benefit of the merger so that also helped the gross profit margins they were probably a tad higher in this recording than they would have been on the complete month i also said this on the remark to operating margins and the other thing to think about is the exchange rates were now at  the first quarter was a little bit lower so that will hurt our gross profit margins especially on the technology segment literally almost all of our manufacturing is euros swiss franc or swedish krona based right so for the full year i would expect them to be quite a bit lower than the  we saw in q again due to fx and due to the fact that we will not always only have the best month of the quarter in the numbers vik chopra  ubs securities llc okay thats very helpful thanks and just one more if i could can you give us a sense of some of the areas that youre monitoring that could potentially put you at either the bottom or the top end of your guidance beyond what youve seen in a very strong first quarter thank you jeffrey t slovin  chief executive officer  director well i think the way to think about it is the markets continue to hold up we continue to see that our early wins on our revenue synergies accelerate faster than we had expected we certainly have some tough comps ahead of us on q and q so how we are able to execute in those quarters will have a lot to do with the ability to go beyond but of course as we were just talking about the impact from sales and margin mix will play a big role in that vik chopra  ubs securities llc great thanks a lot operator and well move next to jon block with stifel jon block  stifel nicolaus  co inc great thanks guys and good morning maybe jeff just the first one for you the balance sheet is obviously very strong you completed the  million share repo i think youre still only in and around one times levered debttoebitda so just maybe at a high level if you can talk about the companys ability to do acquisitions even small ones over the next  months or so and im asking more from the capabilities around an integration standpoint obviously more so than financial jeffrey t slovin  chief executive officer  director right okay first of all let me tell you one of the truly gems of dentsply sirona is our business development team we have exceptionally capable people there that can process and digest a lot the fact that weve been working at the global efficiency and now have a formalized integration office to deal with this puts us in better stead we know which countries are the most stable and ones that it might be a little bit longer away to contemplate a ma position there but by and large i will tell you that our strategic plan is all about continuing to do acquisitions its day  and i can tell you we are right up to speed on what the possibilities are to go out there of course when you are in the midst of this type of transformational merger you do take into consideration your ability to integrate and how quickly wed be able to do it so thats all part and parcel for that but from the standpoint of myself the management team and the board we believe weve got a lot of room that can grow through acquisition jon block  stifel nicolaus  co inc perfect very helpful and just one more quick one for you uli i dont believe the  to  i dont think that assumes much more in the way of share repos done this year so can you just talk about that a little bit if you guys go ahead and do incremental share repurchases should we view that as marginal upsides to the  to  thanks guys ulrich michel  chief financial officer  executive vp yes i think we told you that our guidance is based on a share count range of  million to  million and as we leave q and if our share price doesnt change anymore because this has an impact of the diluted part of the options we would end up the year about in the middle of what we told you around  million shares we gave you the range because we still have an authorization left we have about  million left on our buyback authorization we do intend to execute on this timing depends on the availability of our cash flow and our other plans so it does include the possibility that we buy back a bit more in the course of the year jon block  stifel nicolaus  co inc thanks for your time jeffrey t slovin  chief executive officer  director thanks jon ulrich michel  chief financial officer  executive vp youre welcome yes operator our next question comes from steve beuchaw with morgan stanley steve c beuchaw  morgan stanley  co llc hi good morning nice to have the gang back together here first question is on synergies jeff you reiterated the  million by year three that you laid out with bret in the call last september itd be helpful just to hear at a high level how your thinking around the  million is evolving and then how you think about the pacing you mentioned in a prior comment that you see the sales piece of that as a little bit more backhalf loaded could you comment on the cost piece of that as well jeffrey t slovin  chief executive officer  director yes i would say that weve already started on some of the cost cost is easier to identify and you can go at it a little bit quicker certain corporate costs weve evaluated and come after insurance audit fees the other thing is when youre doing country consolidations there are overlaps with regard to software and duplication in functionality and functions and certainly also from a sourcing perspective we are at that there are some quick wins that weve been able to talk about but equally i think weve spent a lot of time with our team and in a moment im going to have chris talk to you a little about that because hes been leading the way with revenue synergies and were really pleased to see how well the teams have come together to collaborate again keep in mind its day  but the type of wins that were talking about that make sense for the dental practitioner for our distribution partners for dentsply sirona are really coming up from a perspective of the three years the  million again were not backing away from that were very confident about it but to give more color at this time about what well map in as far as year two and year three i dont think were – well i know were not going to talk about that today steve but we tried in my prepared remarks to really give you a lot of things that were working on that will have a big impact chris christopher t clark  president and chief operating officer technologies yes i guess steve id characterize it is follows as i mentioned on the implants discussion that theres a lot of energy here and thats true frankly for all of the different work streams that we have going and these are numerous you should think about the work streams really being both within the two segments and then across the two segments as well you should think about them being focused on product synergies again being probably more a little – think of that a little bit more innovationbased or rdbased there are some that are probably intermediate term some longerterm but again those are probably going to be on the tailend if you will or at least the back half of the threeyear period some may be a little bit before then and a lot of energy going there again when we get our scientists together when we get our marketers together and really think about the possibilities in terms of combined solutions on the other hand then in the nearer term on the commercial synergies think about again our sales and marketers getting together and talking about programmatically what can we do to drive more value with our customers together and again you can think about that in terms of promotions in terms of how we present ourselves to our customers in terms of as i mentioned earlier kols clinical education et cetera and so again theres a lot of energy many many work streams here but again were excited about how our people are engaging and i think that bodes well for the trajectory and where we head frankly not just this year but over the threeyear period and beyond jeffrey t slovin  chief executive officer  director again digital dentistry clinical education if you just steve think about how many trainings and educations we do where we never had any of our products also in the room when youre doing a training on ortho implant endo where that can play in and it works both ways and certainly nobodys done better than dentsply sirona in clinical education and that is valued highly by the dental professional steve c beuchaw  morgan stanley  co llc got it thanks for all that color just one followup actually to a comment that you made earlier jeff the language you used was something to the effect of our corporate strategy is all about ma i cant say its a terribly surprising comment but it would help given that comment and context to hear how you and the rest of the board think about your priorities and commitments around ma how do you think about the returns that you would require and what sort of strategic imperatives are you really trying to address there on the street thank you jeffrey t slovin  chief executive officer  director yeah i mean look this is certainly from a standpoint of the bigger picture what we look at we are first and foremost a innovator right and so technology matters so were out there were looking at businesses that maybe need a larger company infrastructure theyve got something that theyre either just finished with or they need more resources to finish that thats something thats very important something both companies have done extremely well and then we take a look at what can we add to our sbus what would be a additional addon that would help growth or the adoption of the technology or sell more of the consumables certainly and lets not forget the regional play which is why i said we have to look at each country within the stability level there certainly again we look for the acquisition to be accretive and if its not going to be accretive weve got to be able to explain to you very quickly why this will get there in a fast enough form that is necessary roic has always been something that is significant to us and hasnt changed i think we have a very robust process internally that we go through frankly i wanted to highlight it earlier because i think the teams truly extraordinary and that was something that i can tell you from a standpoint at sirona we were good dentsply is great and so coming together on that makes a big difference also weve been able to have discussions with our board about that we recognize that capital allocation is a critical component we think that were one of the few companies that can be a true consolidator in this industry and so theres a lot of room for that to take place over the years to come and as you know like anything you have to be ready to seize the opportunity when it becomes available and i think thats the point that we want to stress yes we have to integrate yes we understand that priority and our  know our first and foremost is to them and to our shareholders and stakeholders to make sure our nucleus is strong but after that we just see plenty of opportunities now were going to stay disciplined that doesnt change but thats part of our roadmap and i want to be crystal clear about that steve c beuchaw  morgan stanley  co llc thanks so much guys operator and our next question comes from tycho peterson with jpmorgan tycho w peterson  jpmorgan securities llc hey thanks i want to go back to one of the questions earlier on cadcam i understand you guys dont want to give numbers for the quarter but im wondering if you could just talk a little bit about underlying market growth for that market youve got a number of dynamics here with the zirconia workflow and obviously some of your competitors so can you maybe just talk about how you see the growth trajectory for cadcam for the next couple of years jeffrey t slovin  chief executive officer  director hi tycho nice to hear from you i mean look we did give color that cadcam led technology grew faster than the overall technology and thats because singlevisit dentistry is here to stay youre hearing it more and more in ortho its growing the fastest i would say around the globe but you wont hear from the dental community or distribution a disagreement about chair side becoming the standard of care weve heard more about digital impression only but thats typically in ortho and of course our zirconia its really a game changer when you think about this material and the strength of it and also the aesthetics and how it compares to others typically zirconia has been something that you would only do through the lab and of course our cercon ht is a product that were excited about that will deliver through the lab as well but from a chair side perspective you never considered it because it took two hours to sinter now with the speedfire its  minutes why is this so significant because zirconia is a terrific material for molars and certain bridges and actually very popular amongst dentists and so to be able to have this type of ceramic be available at chair side just truly opens up our addressable market and by addressable market were not talking about adding  or  more dentists who are interested were talking about tens of thousands of dentists that will now take a look at this opportunity where they wouldnt have before so we believe thats just another reason why cerec makes sense but the other thing frankly is the fact that now everybody is talking about not just restorative but were talking about what you can do with cerec on an implant and ortho side and i have to say that we were at the aao and in a second im going to ask chris to tell you about that flavor but you just see the appetite for digital impression and what the possibilities are for all types of applications and i think that was a bit of the story at the aao christopher t clark  president and chief operating officer technologies absolutely jeff i mean theres no doubt that a lot of energy regarding digital at the orthodontic show obviously were there and well positioned with the omnicam and again i think that as we look at the synergies of these companies coming together theres no doubt that similar to implants ortho is really one of the key fulcrums and one of the key opportunities so were excited about that i think that were well positioned for where this market is headed and again i think that really as we move forward i would expect that to be one of the key synergies jeffrey t slovin  chief executive officer  director i mean its a beautiful thing that the ortho to be the most open and also to have a clear aligner in our mtm for the anterior which is exciting for us tycho w peterson  jpmorgan securities llc great ill leave it at that thank you jeffrey t slovin  chief executive officer  director thank you christopher t clark  president and chief operating officer technologies thanks tycho operator and there are no further telephone questions at this time id like to turn the conference back over to management for any additional or closing remarks jeffrey t slovin  chief
