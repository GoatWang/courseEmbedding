strips gauze sponges hydrogels silicone gel sheeting wound care finding the right type of wound care treatment products is a crucial step on the road to recovery several factors will help you determine what kind of products you will need these factors include type of wound and severity amount of drainage location of the wound on the body what type of wound is it pressure ulcersbedsores some of the different kinds of wounds that our advanced wound care products treat include pressure ulcers or bedsores which are localized sores that occur as a result of pressure shear or friction usually in bony areas of the body for patients in hospice care or those who have limited mobility steps must be taken to prevent pressure ulcers particularly in bony areas or areas with limited padding such as the elbows ankles heels buttocks hips and ears areas of the body that are in constant contact with medical devices should also be examined regularly and treated to prevent injury cleansing and moisturizing the skin regularly will be a critical step in protecting against pressure ulcers body cleansers and moisturizers such as the moisturizing body cleanser and moisturizing body cream by thera will keep the wound clean and accelerate healing many of these products contain dimethicone a protector that will strengthen the skin and decrease the chance of bed sores appropriate surface support is another crucial part of preventing pressure ulcers supportive products such as the posey quilted long boots or heel protector soft boot take pressure off of the feet and ankles decubitus pads used on bedding and furniture wicks away moisture that might irritate the skin pillows and wedges like the spenco foot pillow and posey lateral wedges can also be used to provide additional support and reduce pressure on targeted areas stage  pressure ulcers can be treated by placing a tegaderm transparent film dressing or a hydrocolloid dressing with a film backing that will keep the area dry and decrease friction this will be particularly helpful if the ulcer is in an area that comes in contact with incontinence the transparent film will allow you to keep an eye on the area stage  pressure ulcers should be cleaned with a wound cleanser and covered with a hydrocolloid dressing or a hydrogel dressing such as the medihoney hcs hydrogel dressing appropriate secondary dressings may also be required for nonadhering primary dressings for wounds with moderate to have amounts of drainage calcium alginate dressings or hydrofiber dressings absorb wound fluid stage  and  pressure ulcers with minimal amounts of drainage should also be cleaned with a wound cleanser and covered with a hydrogel dressings hydrophilic wound dressings or a hydrocolloid wound dressing  heavy drainage should be covered with a calcium alginate such as the calcium alginate wound dressing by mckesson or a composite dressings by smith  nephew they should then be covered with a secondary bandage such as adhesive foam venous leg ulcers usually a result of venous congestion in the legs and feet these types of ulcers commonly occur in patients with edema they are often found on the lower sides of the legs venous leg ulcers can be prevented and treated with compression dressings that will relieve pressure around the wound products such as the unna boot provide compression that will help manage venous ulcers arterial ulcers these types of ulcers are caused by the blockage of blood flow due to conditions such as peripheral arterial disease they typically develop in areas that are exposed to pressure such as the legs or feet if the wound is dry or has light drainage medihoney gel can be used to dress the wound and can be covered with a hydrophilic wound dressing a secondary covering such as bordered gauze should be used to secure the dressings wounds with heavy drainage will require a calcium alginate or hydrofiber dressing neuropathicdiabetic ulcers neuropathic and diabetic ulcers are often the result of a lack of feeling usually in the feet the lack of sensation in the feet for many diabetic patients can lead to irritation in the bony areas of the foot where pressure is continually applied which can lead to the breakdown of tissue and cause an ulcer if these ulcers have minimal drainage they can be covered with medihoney gel hydrogel dressings or hydrophilic wound dressings for heavier drainage an absorptive calcium alginate or hydrofiber dressing will help the wound dry and heal skin tears skin tears often occur in people with fragile skin including the elderly or very ill patients they can be caused by shear friction or a blunt force that causes the skin layers to separate they must be properly treated to avoid the risk of becoming a complex wound if the skin tear is dry with little drainage a nonadhesive dressing such as a dermagel hydrogel sheet that will protect the delicate skin while providing moisture that will accelerate healing if the drainage is heavy calcium alginate or a hydrofiber will help absorb the moisture burns the degree of severity of the burn will determine the type of wound treatment necessary to treat the injury and prevent infection a first degree burn is limited to the epidermis and can cause some tenderness and pain a second degree burn reaches down into the papillary and could cause blisters and drainage a third degree burn destroys most of the skin tissue including the nerves it can cause a block in blood flow and requires medical attention first degree burns generally do not require a dressing but medihoney gel or medihoney paste can relieve pain and promote healing second degree burns can be treated with xeroform impregnated gauze to reduce the risk of infection and maintain a moist environment that accelerates healing third degree burns should always be treated by medical professional how should i treat a dry wound or a wound with light drainage for wounds with little to no drainage moisture is necessary to accelerate the healing process hydrogel dressings add moisture to the wound and soften the tissue to promote debridement or the removal of dead tissue film or foam hydrocolloid dressings also absorb small amounts of drainage these adhesive bandages are air and water tight to keep the wound dry and prevent infection they can be used as a primary or secondary dressing and are great for protecting areas that may be exposed to incontinence as they protect the wound and can easily be wiped off how should i dress a wound that has heavy drainage for wounds with moderate to heavy drainage absorbing the drainage without drying out the wound is important the first step is always to cleanse the wound using saline or a wound cleanser such as the dermal wound cleanser by mckesson calcium alginate dressings such as the calcium alginate dressing by mckesson can then be applied to wounds associated with diabetes venous wounds burns pressures ulcers cavity wounds etc they made with natural alginate fibers from seaweed when applied to area the calcium alginate becomes a moist gellike substance that helps heal the wound while absorbing excess fluid hydrofiber dressings are also designed to help manage wounds with moderate to high drainage able to absorb moisture equivalent to  times its weight these types of dressings provide a moist environment that promotes debridement and healing silicone adhesive dressings are soft and provide gentle breathable adhesion they are perfect for areas with sensitive or fragile skin they provide protection from moisture and bacteria medihoney products such as medihoney alginate or medihoney paste can also be used to help heal exuding wounds medihoney products have an osmotic effect that pulls fluid from deep within the wound which assists with autolytic debridement where is the wound located wounds that are located in areas that are frequently exposed to moisture such as the nose area or buttocks should be covered with a waterproof dressing that can be wiped off these dressing can serve as primary or secondary dressings depending on the severity of the wound opsite flexigrid transparent adhesive film dressings can be used to keep the area dry and allow the patient or caregiver to see how the wound is progressing they can be placed directly on the wound or over a primary dressing composite dressings such as the barrier island dressings by mckesson can be both a primary and a secondary dressing with nonadhesive gauze in the center of the bandage with an adhesive border the opposite side of the bandage is water resistant and will help you keep the wound clean tape clear tape» cloth tape» elastic tape» foam tape» more in tape » bandages ace bandages» compression dressings» conforming
