swenson  of eagle idaho mark a ellison  of boise idaho david d swenson  of boise idaho and jeremy s swenson  of meridian idaho were indicted today by a federal grand jury in boise for conspiracy to commit securities fraud wire fraud mail fraud and interstate transportation of stolen property stemming from their involvement in the dbsi group of companies dbsi us attorney for the district of idaho wendy j olson announced defendant douglas swenson is the founder and former president of dbsi mark ellison another founder of dbsi served as dbsi’s general counsel during the period charged in the indictment david d swenson and jeremy s swenson were assistant secretaries for dbsi founded in  and headquartered in meridian idaho dbsi was essentially a conglomerate of real estate and nonreal estate companies including dbsi housing and dbsi securities according to the indictment from january  through november  the defendants publicly represented that dbsi was a profitable company and had a net worth in excess of  million the indictment further alleges that the defendants knew and believed that contrary to the disclosures made to investors and their own dbsi employees involved with the marketing and selling of dbsi investments dbsi’s real estate and nonreal estate business activities were universally unprofitable dbsi’s muchtouted master lease investment product was losing approximately  million dollars a month and dbsi was relying on new investor funds including investor money that dbsi represented would only be used in particular circumstances to continue operations and pay returns to other dbsi investors the indictment alleges that the conspiracy continued until dbsi filed for bankruptcy in november  the eightythree count indictment also charges all of the defendants with thirtynine counts of securities fraud thirtyfour counts of wire fraud six counts of interstate transportation of stolen property taken by fraud and two counts of bank fraud former president douglas swenson is also charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering based on the conspiracy and fraud charges the indictment seeks forfeiture of properties and assets totaling  million according to the indictment dbsi purported to be an industry leader in locating acquiring developing managing and providing real estate investment opportunities throughout the united states the criminal allegations center around material omissions as well as false and fraudulent representations made to investors about investment products that involved tenantincommon  exchange interests tic investments and the related “master lease” investment product dbsi promoted the master lease whereby dbsi leased back commercial real estate that it first sold to tic investors as providing investors with a reliable fixed monthly return on their investment backed by the financial support and substantial net worth of dbsi also according to the indictment although the defendants knew of dbsi’s true and deteriorating financial position they withheld accurate financial information and took steps to conceal dbsi’s true financial condition from investors financial advisors broker dealers due diligence officers dbsi wholesalers and other dbsi employees the indictment alleges that in disclosures to investors the defendants falsely and fraudulently misrepresented dbsi housing’s net worth failed to disclose dbsi’s cash shortages and deteriorating finances misrepresented the likelihood of repayment on large investments in technology startup companies and failed to disclose dbsi’s dependence on new investor money to meet its existing obligations the indictment further alleges that as part of its master lease investment product dbsi collected funds called “accountable reserves” from investors the indictment alleges that although dbsi told investors that their accountable reserves would only be used for specific expenses associated with their tic properties and not comingled with other dbsi funds the defendants conspired to and did in fact commingle and divert at least  million in investor’s accountable reserves for purposes other than those disclosed to investors including payment of the promised fixed investment returns to existing investors operation expenses and investments in technology startup companies the defendants are also charged with defrauding investors of approximately  million dollars from a  notes offering based on disclosures that misrepresented assets on dbsi housing’s balance sheet these assets included account receivables from affiliated dbsi entities which were made up of more than  million in loans to technology startup companies the indictment alleges that the four defendants conspired to conceal the investments in and dbsi’s dependence on more than  million in loans to technology startup companies which were made through dbsi affiliated entities the indictment further alleges that defendants took steps to conceal these loans which were treated as fully collectible despite dbsi having received no prior material repayments and there being no likelihood of any future material repayments according to the indictment the fraud and conspiracy charges involved the nonpublic offerings for multiple commercial real estate investment projects in among others six different states virginia illinois georgia missouri north dakota and texas the bank fraud charges arise out of projects in georgia and illinois in which dbsi originally obtained financing from financial institutions in order to purchase commercial real estate which it then repackaged and resold to tic investors the indictment alleges that the defendants made false and fraudulent statements in order to secure those loans in a related case former dbsi chief operating officer gary bringhurst pleaded guilty in federal court in boise on monday april   to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud bringhurst  is originally from utah according to the plea agreement bringhurst conspired to mislead dbsi investors by among other things falsifying financial statements for dbsi housing the plea agreement further states that one of the properties about which dbsi made false and fraudulent representations was oakwood plaza llc in alton illinois “investment fraud undermines markets bilks investors of promised returns and creates unnecessary loss at a time when our economy is struggling to recover” said olson “those who seek to induce others to invest their hard earned money in complex financial deals have a solemn duty to act with honesty and integrity i commend the hard work and detailed investigation of the fbi and irs agents who have spent countless hours on this case” “defrauding investors is like a ‘house of cards’

 dbsi inc dbsi inc dbsi inc an idahobased commercial real estate investment company is facing questions from investors after becoming insolvent dbsi based much of its business on tenants in common tic investments in  the internal revenue service irs amended rules so that investors could avoid capital gains tax by investing proceeds from a property sale into tic investments tics allow individuals to become fractional owners of a single property unlike other legitimate tic investments dbsi appears to have been involved in circumspect activities between  and  investors poured approximately  billion into dbsis tic investments however regulatory questions have been raised concerning the nature of tic investments there has been debate as to whether tics should be classified as real estate investments or securities products dbsi sold both types of offerings concurrently thereby creating a legal quandary for many investors now that the company is in bankruptcy for those tics sold as securities products intermediary brokerdealer firms who ultimately sold the product were required to conduct due diligence prior to selling the investment and conduct ongoing monitoring thereafter at the very least brokerdealers must perform due diligence on financial statements perform background checks on key persons and assess the value of any underlying real estate there existed a myriad of issues that ultimately led dbsi to its current predicament systemic issues that seem to have existed for some time it appears that dbsi began encountering liquidity issues as early as  by  this shortage created an earnest need for new investor funds in order to maintain current operations part of maintaining operations included paying off older investors unlike other tic investment deals dbsi guaranteed a  dividend to investors in order to make these payments to investors amid chronic cash shortages dbsi appears to have created two schemes the two alleged scheme include hidden markups  dbsi would buy a commercial property at a given price and then sell it to new investors at a profit the amount of the markup was not disclosed in many cases a violation of securities law provided the properties were sold as a security one disturbing characteristic of this practice was the amount of time between dbsi buying an investment property and selling it to investors sometimes it was as short as one day accountable reserves  beginning in  every new dbsi project had an accountable reserves fund that set aside money for tenant improvements and repairs in actuality only  of the money in those funds went towards tenant improvements and repairs the other  of the over  million available in accountable reserves went towards other dbsi funds even with the abovementioned schemes dbsi was not able to maintain a financially viable enterprise by  the company was losing  million a month on its properties that number increased to  million by  despite years of losing money investors were only issued warnings on their investments six weeks prior to the company filing bankruptcy in the aftermath of dbsis bankruptcy filing state investigators began looking into the actions of the company the bankruptcy court in delaware appointed an examiner joshua hochberg to conduct a detailed analysis of the company aimed at determining its actions prior to becoming insolvent he is charged with tracking more than  billion in dbsi transactions in an attempt to discover the location dbsi resources to date it has been discovered that company insiders bilked more than  million since  over  million going to ceo douglas swenson according to hochberg swenson is the only member of dbsis management who is refusing to answer questions following a threat to compel him to submit to questioning swenson presented a letter stating that he would exercise his fifth amendment right against selfincrimination if forced to answer questions about dbsi top of page the importance of selection of

boise idaho david d swenson  of boise idaho and jeremy s swenson  of meridian idaho were indicted today by a federal grand jury in boise for conspiracy to commit securities fraud wire fraud mail fraud and interstate transportation of stolen property stemming from their involvement in the dbsi group of companies dbsi us attorney for the district of idaho wendy j olson announced defendant douglas swenson is the founder and former president of dbsi mark ellison another founder of dbsi served as dbsi’s general counsel during the period charged in the indictment david d swenson and jeremy s swenson were assistant secretaries for dbsi founded in  and headquartered in meridian idaho dbsi was essentially a conglomerate of real estate and nonreal estate companies including dbsi housing and dbsi securities according to the indictment from january  through november  the defendants publicly represented that dbsi was a profitable company and had a net worth in excess of  million the indictment further alleges that the defendants knew and believed that contrary to the disclosures made to investors and their own dbsi employees involved with the marketing and selling of dbsi investments dbsi’s real estate and nonreal estate business activities were universally unprofitable dbsi’s muchtouted master lease investment product was losing approximately  million dollars a month and dbsi was relying on new investor funds including investor money that dbsi represented would only be used in particular circumstances to continue operations and pay returns to other dbsi investors the indictment alleges that the conspiracy continued until dbsi filed for bankruptcy in november  the count indictment also charges all of the defendants with  counts of securities fraud  counts of wire fraud six counts of interstate transportation of stolen property taken by fraud and two counts of bank fraud former president douglas swenson is also charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering based on the conspiracy and fraud charges the indictment seeks forfeiture of properties and assets totaling  million according to the indictment dbsi purported to be an industry leader in locating acquiring developing managing and providing real estate investment opportunities throughout the united states the criminal allegations center around material omissions as well as false and fraudulent representations made to investors about investment products that involved tenantincommon  exchange interests tic investments and the related master lease investment product dbsi promoted the master lease whereby dbsi leased back commercial real estate that it first sold to tic investors as providing investors with a reliable fixed monthly return on their investment backed by the financial support and substantial net worth of dbsi also according to the indictment although the defendants knew of dbsi’s true and deteriorating financial position they withheld accurate financial information and took steps to conceal dbsi’s true financial condition from investors financial advisors broker dealers due diligence officers dbsi wholesalers and other dbsi employees the indictment alleges that in disclosures to investors the defendants falsely and fraudulently misrepresented dbsi housing’s net worth failed to disclose dbsi’s cash shortages and deteriorating finances misrepresented the likelihood of repayment on large investments in technology startup companies and failed to disclose dbsi’s dependence on new investor money to meet its existing obligations the indictment further alleges that as part of its master lease investment product dbsi collected funds called “accountable reserves” from investors the indictment alleges that although dbsi told investors that their accountable reserves would only be used for specific expenses associated with their tic properties and not co mingled with other dbsi funds the defendants conspired to and did in fact commingle and divert at least  million in investor’s accountable reserves for purposes other than those disclosed to investors including payment of the promised fixed investment returns to existing investors operation expenses and investments in technology start up companies the defendants are also charged with defrauding investors of approximately  million dollars from a  notes offering based on disclosures that misrepresented assets on dbsi housing’s balance sheet these assets included account receivables from affiliated dbsi entities which were made up of more than  million in loans to technology startup companies the indictment alleges that the four defendants conspired to conceal the investments in and dbsi’s dependence on more than  million in loans to technology startup companies which were made through dbsiaffiliated entities the indictment further alleges that defendants took steps to conceal these loans which were treated as fully collectible despite dbsi having received no prior material repayments and there being no likelihood of any future material repayments according to the indictment the fraud and conspiracy charges involved the nonpublic offerings for multiple commercial real estate investment projects in among others six different states virginia illinois georgia missouri north dakota and texas the bank fraud charges arise from projects in georgia and illinois in which dbsi originally obtained financing from financial institutions in order to purchase commercial real estate which it then repackaged and resold to tic investors the indictment alleges that the defendants made false and fraudulent statements in order to secure those loans in a related case former dbsi chief operating officer gary bringhurst pleaded guilty in federal court in boise on monday april   to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud bringhurst  is originally from utah according to the plea agreement bringhurst conspired to mislead dbsi investors by among other things falsifying financial statements for dbsi housing the plea agreement further states that one of the properties about which dbsi made false and fraudulent representations was oakwood plaza llc in alton illinois “investment fraud undermines markets bilks investors of promised returns and creates unnecessary loss at a time when our economy is struggling to recover” said olson “those who seek to induce others to invest their hard earned money in complex financial deals have a solemn duty to act with honesty and integrity i commend the hard work and detailed investigation of the fbi and irs agents who have spent countless hours on this case” “defrauding investors is like a ‘house of cards’ the underlying structure can fall apart at any time
