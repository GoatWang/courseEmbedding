or medication that can be delivered intravenously by iv can be delivered via io at approximately the same or faster rate as an accepted standard of care and treatment modality io infusion is endorsed by the american heart association advanced trauma life support and advanced cardiac life support courses as well as the european resuscitation council io is also taught as part of military medicine training and tactical combat casualty care guidelines fasttactical can be placed and vascular access achieved in  seconds essentially equivalent to a central venous line with medications reaching the heart within  seconds the sternum is the easiest and most reliable io site to locate and place the humeral site is difficult to locate and it’s hard to keep devices in place during transport the tibia site gives poor flow rates as compared to humeral and sternal io sites clinical data indicates the sternal route for io as compared to humeral or tibial improves patient outcomes see gopyngcomsternalio for details fasttactical is the most reliable and easy to use io device featuring an allinone design with no drilling batteries multiple parts or needles to choose pyng medical is the pioneer in sternal io technology fasttactical is based on the trusted  proven design of pyng’s fast sternal io system which has been used by the us military for more than  years “when time and venous access are imperative fast can pull any provider out of a jam – any level of provider can place it effectively” lt lanney c jones chief flight paramedic ms medflight ie richmond va   pioneering sternal io technology since  pyng medical is the pioneer in sternal intraosseous infusion technology in  pyng received clearance for fast the first fdacleared io system designed specifically for use in the sternum during adult emergency intervention in  fast was cleared for use in adolescents  years of age and over fast has been trusted and used by military and combat personnel for more than  years in fact more military and combat personnel use fast sternal io than any other sternal or tibial io device in  pyng launched fastresponder which includes all the trusted and proven features of fast but modified to specifically meet the needs of civilian emergency medical services and hospital critical care personnel fastcombat was launched soon after a device similar in all ways to fastresponder but in combat colors in  pyng introduced fasttactical for both civilian and military use fasttactical is built on the design of fastresponder  fastcombat but includes unique rigid tube packaging making it ideal to fit in medical bags while protecting the device and keeping it sterile   who is fasttactical sternal io for fasttactical is designed for use by both the military and in civilian prehospital and hospital settings whenever fast vascular access is required or when traditional intravenous access fails the success rates for io infusion are as high as or higher than for traditional iv infusion additionally io infusion is an accepted standard of care and treatment modality it is endorsed by the american heart association advanced trauma life support advanced cardiac life support courses as well as the european resuscitation council io infusion is also taught as part of military medicine training and tactical combat casualty care guidelines for ems when it comes to establishing critical vascular access in the field seconds count that’s why emergency medical services and first responders count on fasttactical sternal io with no batteries required fasttactical is the most reliable io option available in the field and with a low profile design tubing remains in place when transporting patients in difficult conditions including loading patients into ambulances or aircraft for the military pyng medical’s fast device has been trusted by the military for years now the military can access the next generation device featuring an allinone design and hard rigid tube packaging to take up as little space as possible – while protecting the io device from damage in extreme conditions for hospitals small and portable with no batteries required fasttactical is a smart addition to every crash cart and critical care unit when intravenous access fails emergency nurses and doctors can quickly gain vascular access using a reliable sternal io that relies on operator force only and features automatic depth control no drilling or spring loading   toggles why sternal io sternal io for vascular access traditionally intravenous iv access has been used for rapid fluid and medication administration during resuscitation iv access times and the ability to start an iv vary greatly among users and the situational environment starting an iv on a patient with hypovolemic shock or cardiac arrest presents a real challenge alternatives to iv access such as central venous catheterization or a venous cutdown are very time consuming and challenging in the best of situations most prehospital medical personnel are not equipped or trained to perform these procedures intraosseous io infusion systems enable the user to rapidly safely and effectively administer emergency fluids and medications into the vascular system through the bone marrow the primary indication for use for io infusion is the need for rapid or emergent vascular access when conventionalintravenous access has failed many organizations define this as two failed iv attempts io infusion is an accepted standard of care and treatment modality it is endorsed by the american heart association advanced trauma life support advanced cardiac life support courses as well as the european resuscitation council io infusion is also taught as part of military medicine training and tactical combat casualty care guidelines success rates for io infusion are as high as or higher than iv think of the bone marrow as the “noncollapsible vein” any fluids or medications that can be administered via iv can also be administered via io infusion flow rates and volume that can be delivered by io infusion are comparable to iv and the time for fluids or medications to reach the vasculature concentrations in the blood and effects on target organs are similar between io infusion and iv pyng medical’s fasttactical™ sternal io device is safe to use in patients  years of age and older procedures to administer io infusion are relatively simple and can be taught quickly to all medical providers in military prehospital or hospital environments fasttactical can be used safely and effectively during cpr so that cpr guidelines can be followed and also can be used when a cervical spine collar is in place  reasons to choose fasttactical sternal io compact rigid tube protective packaging that easily fits in medical bags clinical evidence supports the sternal io route faster fluid delivery via the sternum sternal io is less painful than tibial or humeral io the sternum is an easy and consistent site to locate sternal io can be used with standard ems procedures like cpr the sternal io route and the fast devices have saved lives for more than  years download the new ebook by dr alan moloff to learn more about the  reasons the sternal route for io is the best choice for your ems or hospital critical care team download the ebook now fasttactical sternal io device benefits rigid hard tube packaging the small profile packaging means fasttactical fits easily into your medical bag while the rigid packaging protects the device from damage and keeps it sterile allinone device with no batteries required fasttactical is an allinone device which means you don’t have to choose needles worry about batteries or mess around with different parts this sternal io device is ready to go when you are easy sternal site location unlike the long bones the flat bone in the sternummanubrium is easy to locate and access even for first time users no drilling no pins simply reliable and easy to use fasttactical allinone io is engineered for automatic depth control this means you don’t need to guess which needle to use or worry about how much pressure to apply with your drill easy to learn even for new medical professionals fasttactical was designed as an allinone io in order to be as easy to learn and failsafe as possible after insertion you simply remove the device and your builtin iv connector is ready for you to connect your iv tube and rapidly deliver fluids and medication into the vascular system less pain on insertion and fluid delivery your patients will not only experience much less pain on insertion to the sternal site vs the long bones but will feel less pain with fluid delivery from the sternal site in many cases lidocaine is not required low profile tubing fasttactical features low profile tubing which lies nearly flat against the patient this eliminates many of the bumping hazards that could dislodge the iv especially during transport clear plastic protector dome for added security protect your iv even further with a plastic dome which fits securely over the insertion site indications for use the main indication for use is the need for rapid or emergent vascular access when conventional  intravenous access has failed most organizations define this as two failed iv attempts  the rate of iv failure varies significantly based on the skill level of the provider the location in the prehospital or hospital environment associated injuries and the blood pressure of the patient studies have shown a  to  iv infusion success rate another study focused just on emergency iv access demonstrated a  failure rate the average time it takes to initiate an iv infusion also varies significantly from  minutes to  minutes  central venous catheterization cvc is a commonly taught physician level skill that is often used if iv access cannot be obtained this is a challenging procedure under the best of conditions io infusion can be used in an emergent situation as a “bridge” to a cvc allowing rapid vascular access until a cvc can be performed under better conditions first attempt for a cvc is  with a mean time of  minutes in one study cvc’s also have higher rates of infection noted at  per  catheter days as compared to io infusion  a venous cutdown is another alternate procedure if iv access cannot be obtained this is taught in atls and some military medical training the mean infusion time for the cutdown group was    minutes  intraosseous capabilities fasttactical can be inserted and used during cpr and does not interfere with other resuscitation requirements this device can also be used with a cervical spine collar in place for immobilization  the device can be inserted through deep skin burns  the success rates for io infusion are as high as or higher than for traditional iv infusion mcnabb states “the success rate of vascular access for sternal io users with training but no previous clinical experience with the io system was  for those with at least one previous io device use …” median access time for all users was  seconds while mean access time was  seconds  another study notes first time io access and infusion success from  –  “typically” in  minute or less and the majority of io insertions completed within  minutes in all studies  the flow rate or infusion rate of an io infusion are comparable to the traditional iv infusion  flow rates will vary based on a number of factors the two most important variables are the blood pressure of the patient and the type of infusion system used up to  mlminute was achieved using the tradition gravity feed drip system and greater than mlminute using a syringe bolus technique  any fluids or medications that can be administered by the iv route can be administered io  commonly used medications and fluids used in resuscitation that have been used with io infusion include but are not limited to lidocaine epinephrine dopamine vasopressin blood plasma hypertonic saline  normal saline lactated ringer’s morphine valium succinylcholine heparin antitoxins and methylpredisolone  the pharmacokinetics of io infusion are similar to iv regarding time to enter the vasculature concentrations in the blood and effects on target organs  with regard to clinically effective doses to target organs io infusion is equivalent to or quicker than iv note that in cases of severe shock changes in peripheral venous flow rates make venous access very difficult and may potentially delay the time for medications to reach the target organs by iv  the paper by halvorsen states “…a number of studies have indicated essentially identical plasma concentrations or onset of physiologic effects of drugs and fluids when io infusions were compared to both central or peripheral intravenous infusions…” the sternal io procedure is relatively simple and can be utilized by multiple levels and types of medical providers in the prehospital and hospital environments it has been used by emt basics to emt paramedics military medics nurses physician’s assistants and physicians in the prehospital environment it provides a safe and quick alternative to the traditional iv  a  “overall correct use” rate was documented after only a  hour lecture followed by  hour handon practice in a study using emtbasic students as the sample group  sternal io and cpr fasttactical is compatible with all current recommendations and procedures for conducting cpr chest compressions  fasttactical is placed in the manubrium of the sternum the manubrium is located at the cephalad top portion of the sternum the hand placement for cpr chest compressions is located just cephalad of the xiphoid process bottom portion of the sternum the position and placement of fast devices and the hands for chest compressions are separated by the entire body of the sternum deployment of fasttactical sternal io can be accomplished while chest compressions are temporarily halted which takes only a few seconds chest compressions if done correctly will not affect the placement of the fast infusion tube with proper deployment of fasttactical chest compressions can continue while fluids are administered bibliography larocco bg wang he intraosseous infusion prehospital emergency care aprjun   frascone r et al obtaining vascular access is there a place for the sternal io air
