accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis the company has a working capital deficit has incurred reoccurring net losses and has not yet established revenue producing activities which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern based on the above considerations there is a substantial doubt about the ability of the company to continue as a going concern the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the companys ability to further implement its business plan and generate future profits or attain working capital through debt or equity financing  management hopes that with precious metals making a turn around they will obtain distribution networks for the machines  management hopes to find avenues to license their terminal technologies and sell terminals which will bring sufficient revenues and investment into the company to sustain its growth and operations  furthermore management

basis of presentation our financial statements are stated in united states dollars and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap cash and cash equivalents the company considers all highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents  use of estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires us to make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the period presented we make our estimate of the ultimate outcome for these items based on historical trends and other information available when the financial statements are prepared changes in estimates are recognized in accordance with the accounting rules for the estimate which is typically in the period when new information becomes available we believe that our significant estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable based upon information available at the time they were made actual results could differ from these estimates making it possible that a change in these estimates could occur in the near term principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of pmx communities inc and its whollyowned subsidiaries pmx gold llc and pmx gold bullion sales inc all intercompany transactions have been eliminated financial instruments and fair value the companys balance sheet includes certain financial instruments including accounts payable accrued expenses and notes payable the carrying amounts of current assets and current liabilities approximate their fair value because of the relatively short period of time between the origination of these instruments and their expected realization asc  fair value measurements and disclosures defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date asc  also establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between  market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources observable inputs and  an entitys own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances unobservable inputs the fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level  the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below level  unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical unrestricted assets or liabilities level  inputs other than quoted prices included within level  that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability eg interest rates and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means level  inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable  fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of december   the respective carrying value of certain onbalancesheet financial instruments approximated their fair values due to the shortterm nature of these instruments equipment equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation depreciation is provided using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of five years for equipment five years for molds and seven years for furniture and fixtures impairment of longlived assets the company evaluates the recoverability of longlived assets and the related estimated remaining useful lives when events or circumstances lead management to believe that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amounts in such circumstances those assets are written down to estimated fair value the company recognizes an impairment loss when the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset the amount of impairment is measured as the difference between the assets estimated fair value and its book value common stock common stock options and warrants the company uses the fair value recognition provision of asc  compensationstock compensation which requires the company to expense the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of such instruments the company uses the blackscholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of any equity instruments on the grant date the company also uses the provisions of asc  equity based payments to nonemployees to account for stockbased compensation awards issued to nonemployees for services such awards for services are recorded at either the fair value of the services rendered or the instruments issued in exchange for such services whichever is more readily determinable using the measurement date guidelines enumerated in asc  income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed under asc  income taxes the company uses the liability method of accounting for income taxes the liability method measures deferred income taxes by applying enacted statutory rates in effect at the balance sheet date to the differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts on the financial statements the resulting deferred tax assets or liabilities are adjusted to reflect changes in tax laws as they occur a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized the company recognizes the financial statement benefit of an uncertain tax position only after considering the probability that a tax authority would sustain the position in an examination for tax positions meeting a morelikelythannot threshold the amount recognized in the financial statements is the benefit expected to be realized upon settlement with the tax authority for tax positions not meeting the threshold no financial statement benefit is recognized as of december   and  the company had no uncertain tax

and procedures evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined under rule ae and rule de promulgated under the securities exchange act of  as amended as of december    we do not have sufficient segregation of duties within accounting functions which is a basic internal control  due to our size and nature segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible  however to the extent possible the initiation of transactions the custody of assets and the recording of transactions should be performed by separate individuals  based on this evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded such controls and procedures to be not effective as of december   to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the commissions rules and forms and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the act is accumulated and communicated to the issuers management including its principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure managements annual report on internal control over financial reporting our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting  our internal control over financial reporting is the process designed by and under the supervision of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer or the persons performing similar functions to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external reporting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  these officers have evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in internal control over financial reporting  guidance for smaller public companies  our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december   and concluded that it was not effective because of the material weakness described below in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   material weaknesses became evident to management regarding our inability to generate all the necessary disclosure for inclusion in our filings with the securities and exchange commission due to the lack of resources which resulted in lack of multiple levels of supervision and review and a lack of segregation of duties a material weakness is a significant deficiency in one or more of the internal control components that alone or in the aggregate precludes our internal controls from reducing to an appropriately low level the risk that material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis the company hired an outsource certified public accountant to work with our cfo and management on an as needed basis to eliminate the material weaknesses  we will continue to aggressively recruit experienced professionals to ensure that we include all necessary disclosures in our filings with the securities and exchange commission although we believe that this corrective step will enable management to conclude that the internal controls over our financial reporting are effective when the staff is trained we cannot assure you these steps will be sufficient we may be required to expend additional resources to identify assess and correct any additional weaknesses in internal control  this annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting  managements report was not subject to attestation by the companys registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the securities and exchange commission that permit the company to provide only managements report in this annual report evaluation of changes in internal control over financial reporting our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have evaluated changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended december    based on that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer or those persons performing similar functions did not identify any change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting important considerations the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting is subject to various inherent limitations including cost limitations judgments used in decision making assumptions about the likelihood of future events the soundness of our systems the possibility of human error and the risk of fraud moreover projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and the risk that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate over time because of these limitations there can be no assurance that any system of disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting will be successful in preventing all errors or fraud or in making all material information known in a timely manner to the appropriate levels of management item b  other
