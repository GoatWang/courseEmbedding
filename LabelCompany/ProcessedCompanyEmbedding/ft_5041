articleyear authors biggins de lr hanebury and ka fagerstonesuggested citation biggins de lr hanebury and ka fagerstone  digging behaviors of radiotagged blackfooted ferrets near meeteetse wyoming  western north american naturalist    intensive radiotracking during august–december enabled us to collect detailed information on digging behaviors of a small sample of blackfooted ferrets mustela nigripes occupying colonies of whitetailed prairie dogs cynomys leucurus a sample of  prairie dogs also radiotagged progressively ceased aboveground activity during late summer and fall presumably as they descended into burrows to hibernate most of the time ferrets spent digging was in november–december when  of the radiotagged prairie dogs were inactive suggesting that digging was primarily to excavate hibernating prey although  of the burrow openings were estimated to be in large mounds which are common on colonies of whitetailed prairie dogs all of a sample of  deposits of soil diggings made by ferrets were excavated at small mounds or nonmounded openings the average duration of  nocturnal sessions of digging by ferrets was  minutes a digging session consisted of multiple bouts of soil movement typically lasting about  min and sessions were separated by pauses above or belowground lasting several minutes bouts of moving soil from a burrow involved roundtrips of – s to remove an average of  cm of soil per trip these digging bouts are energetically costly for ferrets one female moved  kg of soil an estimated  m during bouts having a cumulative duration of  minutes removing a soil plug estimated to be  cm long increasing evidence suggests that some behaviors of ferrets and prairie dogs are coevolutionary responses between this highly specialized predator and its prairie dog prey related projects no science projects found        dean bigginsdean bigginswyomingmustela nigripescynomys leucurusblmfwsburrowing patternssoilblackfooted ferretfort contact dean
