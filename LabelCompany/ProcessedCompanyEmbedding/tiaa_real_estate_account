security tiaa real estate account marks  years shareemailprint account offers benefits of direct real estate investments to retirement saversnew york ny – december   – the tiaa real estate account  has marked its th anniversary demonstrating tiaacref’s longstanding history in offering distinctive products to retirement savers  launched in  the account is the industry’s largest investment vehicle dedicated to providing individual investors direct access to commercial real estate enabling portfolio diversification beyond equities and fixed incomethe tiaa real estate account is a variable annuity with over 2 billion in assets under management and consists primarily of investments in office industrial retail and multifamily properties throughout the united states the account is accessible to millions of individual investors through their employer’s tiaacrefadministered retirement platforms the account is distinct in that it offers direct investment exposure to a diversified portfolio of commercial real estate and an investor’s accumulation units in the account are not priced by the securities markets whereas shares in real estate investment trusts reits are typically traded on stock exchanges and subject to securities market pricing fluctuations“before we launched the account two decades ago this was an asset class that was inaccessible to most investors due to high capital requirements and a lack of liquidity” said gerry casimir managing director and portfolio manager for the tiaa real estate account “however direct real estate has low correlations to public markets and lower volatility than reits which can provide diversification for individual portfolios”tiaacref is the third largest manager of worldwide real estate assets with more than 0 years of experience in direct real estate investing  tiaacref believes that its real estate account offers investors a consistent deliberate investment approach with a focus on high quality investment opportunities and the ability to identify good relative value over the longterm  the properties held in the account are diversified by sector and geography in addition the account offers investors a potential hedge against inflation and the opportunity for favorable longterm returns through rental income and appreciation of commercial real estate“the ability to offer our plan participants this distinctive investment option typically an asset class only available to institutional investors speaks to our commitment to provide plan sponsors with solutions that drive better outcomes for their participants” said teresa hassara president of institutional retirement at tiaacref “this investment option comes with strong expertise supporting 40k 40b and other retirement plan markets and has played an important role in building retirement plan participants’ financial wellbeing”visit our web site for more informationtiaa real estate account main pagetiaa real estate account prospectustiaa
