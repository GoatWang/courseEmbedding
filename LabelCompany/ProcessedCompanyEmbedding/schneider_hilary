of todays call or to learn more about lifelock and with that let me turn the call over to hilary hilary a schneider  president and chief executive officerelect good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today this quarter marks the th consecutive quarter of lifelocks sequential growth in both revenue and cumulative ending members the combination of new member acquisition increased adoption of our premium products and strength in our enterprise business resulted in revenue of  million above the high end of our guidance with over  gross new member additions we now have  million members and an annual retention rate of  which is one of the strongest among consumer subscription businesses while we are pleased with the revenue and profitability results in the quarter the recovery of the comarketing channel has been slower than expected in the wake of ftc matters and due to our strategic shift to focus our sales efforts on larger opportunities these larger comarketing relationships have the potential to materially accelerate our growth in this channel however they do tend to have longer sales cycles as a result the ftc matters and the shift in our sales focus we now anticipate the comarketing channel will not contribute materially to our growth until  this panel tends to deliver a higher proportion of prepaid annual members and a high take rate of premium products consequently the weakness in this channel is a headwind to our  growth as well as impacting our cash flow performance while the comarketing channel weakness makes achieving some of our  objectives more challenging we remain optimistic about the longterm prospects for our business we continue to be the largest pure play identity theft protection provider in our market and the key differentiators that have enabled our consistent track record of growth and profitability continue to set us apart first lifelock has unique visibility to highrisk new account opening data with the ability to rapidly alert enterprises and our members of suspicious or fraudulent activity id analytics has built a contributory data model with over  enterprises contributing data across multiple industries we then apply our patented methodology to this data to identify consumer behavior that is outside of normal pattern ida customers includes four out of the top five wireless carriers credit card issuers and retail card issuers and our database can score virtually  of the us adult population one industry where ida has recently grown its transaction visibility is in the alternative finance or payday loan space so far this year we have seen a five times increase in transaction visibility from this industry which is often not visible to credit monitoring services because of this increased visibility lifelock has been able to prevent an average of five subsequent fraudulent applications for each member who notified us with a not me response to alerts from these enterprises these fraudulent transactions were prevented because of the power of our ida network this protection is only available to lifelock customers second lifelock continues to have four times the brand awareness versus the next time closest identity theft protection competitor similar to iconic brands like google which is now a verb and netflix which is synonymous with video streaming lifelock is synonymous with identify theft protection third high customer satisfaction is a critical aspect of our business because unlike other businesses with multiyear contracts and restrictive terms our members can cancel at any time our high retention reflects a strong level of customer satisfaction with lifelock services it is also reflected in the positive feedback our members give our member service agents so far this year over  of members surveyed have rated our member service agents with an  or  out of a  to  scale fourth we have consistently been a leading innovator in our industry today we announced new enhanced protection called stolen funds replacement this enhanced benefit offers our members three levels of dollarfordollar reimbursement up to a  million at the top tier for our ultimate plus product in addition to our existing service guarantee from our research we know that consumers are looking for the highest levels of protection for their financial assets and we believe this enhanced protection feature will be well received we understand the growing needs in the world of digitized personal information and as the pioneer in identity protection we will continue leading the industry with new innovation to protect consumers these key differentiators position us for continued leadership in a large market identity theft is an enormous problem in  alone there was  million records exposed due to data breaches meanwhile the average number of digital devices per person in the us has grown to  up from  in  and the portion of adults who access social networking sites from their smartphone each week has grown to  up from  in  our identities are increasingly digitized and porous as we use apps congratulate friends on their birthdays announce the birth of children and update our profiles with new jobs this proliferation makes it easier for bad actors to amass personally identifiable information or pii and to hone their vectors of attack shifting now to an update on our security legal and regulatory affairs continually enhancing our information security remains a top priority at lifelock and im happy that our progress in these key areas is getting noticed during the quarter we were named one of the top  companies of approximately  other sites that the online trust alliance assessed as part of their  honor roll making us the highestscoring identity theft protection company other top  sites were pinterest the white house and instagram as it relates to the ftc and consumer class action matters the settlement approval process is progressing as planned with the objection period over and the settlement pending final court approval we continue to expect payments to the class members beginning in late q or q of this year as we outlined previously during the quarter we also settled the lead plaintiff shareholder derivative lawsuit received preliminary approval from the court and are awaiting the final ruling we are pleased with our progress in these areas and look forward to putting this behind us moving now to the progress we are making with our product and technology investments as we mentioned last quarter we have built a new data platform that will integrate all member alerting and analytics in a unified scalable and extensible architecture this is an important strategic shift in the way we engage with our members during the second quarter we migrated credit alerting and we expect all consumer alerting to be fully transitioned in the coming months with our new data platform we are improving the quality of our alerts and we have accelerated our ability to ingest large data sets facilitating the expansion of our data partnerships and ultimately the most valuable aspect of the new data platform is the flexibility and scalability it provides as we expand the rates of services we make available to our members an important advantage in the marketplace with our new data platform we have the ability to not only provide consumers with near realtime alerts from id analytics but to add a layer of analytics across all our alerting with the potential to make these alerts even more customized and valuable to our members id analytics continues to innovate and we are pleased with the uptake in one of our newest products id connect id connect creates a frictionless new account enrollment experience whether in person online or via a call center driving higher conversion rates while mitigating fraud risk one of the largest wireless carriers has now rolled out id connect to  stores we believe this product is broadly applicable across a variety of industries and are pleased to have also launched the product with a specialty finance provider during the quarter feedback about the product has been very positive and some customers have shared the early impact for example one customer has seen meaningful reduction in new account opening times while another has improved new account conversion by nearly  since they implemented the project finally fundamental to our long term success and ultimately my primary responsibility is getting the right leadership in place and operating effectively in this regard i believe we have made significant progress across the company at all levels and i feel confident about the team we now have in place to help us achieve continued growth first we are pleased with the progress we have seen at id analytics and as a result i am happy to announce that scott carter the ceo of ida has been promoted to evp of enterprise and ceo of ida and will join my management team this promotion recognizes the tremendous contribution that scott brings to lifelock and to ida as well as the strategic importance of the ida business our cmo ty shay has built out his team increased the analytical rigor in member acquisition and is working to improve our unit economics i hope you have all had a chance to see our new advertising campaign which highlights with some humor the differences between credit monitoring and broad based identity theft protection services the campaign has been performing well and it has proven our ability to build on our already strong brand as our brand awareness levels continue to improve marketing effectiveness is a continuous focus area that we regularly review and adapt to changes in consumer behavior and the performance of our marketing channels mike dean who leads our partner efforts further strengthened the partner team with the addition of terry green  as general manager of our employee benefits team to help us build this exciting part of our business terry  brings significant experience in the benefits space including serving as the evp of employee benefits with hubs international one of the top ten benefit brokers and previously svp and employee benefits executive with bank of america a recent survey by willis towers watson estimates that by  up to  of employers surveyed will offer identity theft protection services itps is projected the fastestgrowing voluntary benefit and as the brand leader were very optimistic about the large growth opportunity we see in the employee benefit channel over the next several years as a reminder the eb channel is seasonal with the significant majority of enrollments taking place during the fourth quarter open enrollment periods finn faldi has joined us as svp to lead our comarketing partner channel finn brings meaningful partnership and operations experience from companies including yahoo oracle and appthis with the talent of this team we are refocusing on the largest opportunities and are pleased with the quantity and quality of dialogues we are having as we build our pipeline as we noted above we are seeing that our strategic shift to focus on the largest of opportunities is extending the length of the sales cycle while this is having some impact to member growth in the short term we are confident that this approach will yield strong results in  and beyond sharon segev who joined as general counsel earlier this year has also been an excellent addition to the team her deep understanding and expertise in all aspects of her work has been invaluable particularly as we work to turn the page on the ftc and related litigation and continually focus on raising the compliance bar finally bringing more than  years of senior leadership in

benefits space and expect to see our directtoconsumer business continue to grow we have the right people in place to execute on the next phase of growth and maturity for this company before i turn the call over to chris i want to extend a heartfelt thank you to him for all of his outstanding work and numerous contributions as cfo of lifelock in helping lead the company through an exceptional period of growth and profitability now let me turn the call over to chris to walk you through the financials christopher g power  chief financial officer thanks hilary it has been a pleasure being a part of the lifelock team for the last five and a half years i am very proud that during my time weve been able to extend lifelocks brand leadership grow its unique data assets and pull together a team of worldclass talent the company is in excellent financial shape with a bright future and a clear path to continue to scale moving forward im confident that doug is the right choice to help the company further capitalize on our large market opportunity turning to the quarter total revenue was  million above the high end of our guidance of  million to  million and up  compared to the second quarter of  our consumer business grew  yearoveryear to  million we added  gross new members in the quarter compared to  gross new members in the second quarter of last year gnms in our directtoconsumer channel grew yearoveryear and helped drive a premium take rate that was well over  and up slightly sequentially our partner gross new members continued to be impacted by the lower contribution from the comarketing channel as hilary discussed we also had a large employer paid employee benefit win during q of  which impacted our yearoveryear comparison in addition we continue to see more employers electing to introduce this benefit in q to align with their annual benefit election cycle we now expect roughly twothirds of our full year employee benefit enrollments to come through the employer open enrollment periods in q we remain confident in our eb customer pipeline and note that the number of companies who have already committed to offer lifelock as an employee benefit puts us well on track to deliver our full year forecast we ended the quarter with approximately  million members up  from q of last year the monthly average revenue per member for the period was  up  compared to the second quarter of last year and up  from the prior quarter slowing member growth in particular the comarketing channel impacted the monthly revenue per member our annual retention rate of  dipped slightly on a sequential basis and was down  percentage points from  in q of  last quarter we discussed the four factors driving the yearoveryear decline and each of these factors continued to impact our q annual retention rate these included the annual renewal timing associated with the record number of members signed up in the wake of the anthem breach in the first half of  in addition there were a large number of first half cancellations in the oil and gas vertical in our eb channel as a reminder we report an annual retention rate and as a result these two factors will continue to impact our annual retention rate for a few more quarters the third factor was the increase in cancellations in the second half of  related to the negative press associated with the ftc matters an item that continues to impact the annual retention rate in  and finally we continue to see the ongoing shift of our base to premium products and monthly billing payment plans both of these cohorts tend to have slightly higher cancellation rates than that experienced in our standard product and annual payment plans and we expect this trend to continue in addition we saw higher cancellations in the quarter due to the expiration of a large number of breach channel contracts and a higher number of cancellations within our affiliate channel as hilary mentioned our expectations remain that redress checks will be sent to members for the ftc and related class action suit settlements in late q or early q which we believe will have an impact on our retention rate revenue from the enterprise segment was  million up  yearoveryear as id analytics continues to make progress expanding the breadth and depth of its network helping to drive growth of the enterprise transactions by  to over  million in the quarter we are very pleased with the traction we are gaining at ida for example one of the nations leading automotive lenders contracted to use credit optics which will provide  visibility to all auto loan applications for this customer in addition a leading retail card issuer implemented id score on  of their new applications now before i move further down the income statement i want to preface my comments by stating that unless otherwise indicated they will be focused on nongaap results which for the quarter exclude a total of  million of sharebased compensation expense  million of the amortization of acquired intangible assets and  million in litigation expense associated with the ftc and derivative settlement adjusted gross margins were  in the quarter compared with  in q of last year as expected gross margins declined during the second quarter due to approximately  million in costs associated with the migration of credit services for all premium members we continue to expect an offsetting reduction in expenses spread throughout the rest of the year leaving the full year  cost in this area roughly equivalent to our previous profile normalized gross margins adjusting for these credit migration cost would have been  or a roughly  improvement from last year this is a continuation of the multiyear trend of consistent gross margin improvements and we expect our new data platform will improve gross margins by  over the long term adjusted sales and marketing expenses were  million in the period compared to  million in the second quarter of  our cost of acquisition in the quarter increased to  up from  in q of last year and  in the prior quarter as reflected in our prior guidance coa levels were elevated in the first half of the year as the partner channel contribution remained under pressure as a result the higher coa directtoconsumer channel contributed a larger share of the gross new member additions in addition building on our first quarter efforts we increased investments in brand advertising during the quarter and saw continued gains in our industryleading brand awareness levels both yearoveryear and since last quarter we also had a large employee benefit win in q of  with a very low coa which also impacted our yearoveryear comparison our expectation remains that our coa will decline later in the year as we see a benefit from the increased brand investments in the first half of the year and as fourth quarter member growth in the lower coa employee benefit channel reduces our average coa with our industryleading retention rate and the continued market acceptance of our premium products the lifetime value of our members remains healthy and validates the investment at these coa levels adjusted technology and development expenses were  million in the quarter up from  million in the yearago period due to ongoing investments in talent product enhancements security and infrastructure as we have discussed you should expect us to continue on this path of investment adjusted ga expenses were  million in the quarter compared to  million in the yearago period legal expenses were down significantly but were partially offset by increases in compliance and risk initiatives as a reminder we began adjusting ftcrelated expenses when we entered the litigation phase in q of  adjusted ebitda was  million in q compared to  million in the second quarter of  the quarters yearoveryear performance was negatively impacted by the previously discussed timing of an additional  million in expenses related to the migration of premium members credit data we expect this will be offset by lower expenses in this area in the second half of the year the combination of stronger revenue and the delay in timing of some marketing expenses contributed to our overperformance relative to our guidance of  million to  million overall adjusted net income was  million in the quarter compared to adjusted net income of  million in q of last year adjusted net income per share in the second quarter was  based on  million shares beating our guidance of  to  and down compared to  based on  million shares in the yearago period cash flow from operations for the quarter was  million down from  million in the second quarter of last year total capital expenditures were  million up from  million last year a majority of the increase was related to the development of our enhanced data platform adding back expenses related to the ftc litigation of  million free cash flow was  million compared to  million in the yearago period the decrease was due to  million in data services associated with the transition to our new data platform the shift to a higher proportion of media that requires advance payment along with the timing of other net working capital items we ended the second quarter with  million in cash and marketable securities compared to  million at the end of the prior quarter the decline was predominantly the result of the roughly  million paid under the recently completed share buyback program which resulted in  million shares returned to the company we have now fulfilled the  million stock repurchase program well in advance of our yearend planning returning a total of  million shares our board regularly evaluates our capital structure and we will continue to look at buybacks as an option going forward now turning to our guidance for the third quarter we are initiating guidance as follows total revenue is expected to be in the range of  million to  million adjusted net income per share is expected to be in the range of  to  based on approximately  million fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding adjusted ebitda is expected to be in the range of  million to  million for the full year  we are updating guidance as follows we are reiterating total revenue guidance which is expected to be in the range of  million to  million overall we continue to expect our directtoconsumer channels to perform well and anticipate strong fourth quarter member additions in the employee benefits channel while we are pleased with the addition of talent to the comarketing team and are making progress building pipelines we dont believe it will meaningfully contribute to growth in  as discussed we also expect some headwinds to the retention rate in late q or early q when checks are sent to consumers as part of our ftc and related class action settlement adjusted ebitda is expected to be in the range of  million to  million unchanged from our prior guidance we continue to expect the seasonality to be more pronounced in  based on the timing of sales and marketing investments which are more heavily weighted towards the front half of the year and the transition to our new platform adjusted net income per diluted share is expected to be in the range of  to  based on approximately  million fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding an increase from the previous range of  to  this guidance assumes a  cash tax rate our pershare profitability is benefiting from the accelerated buyback activities which have taken share count down free cash flow is expected to be in the range of  million to  million down from our prior guidance of  million to  million this is driven by the weakness in our comarketing channel which typically has a high proportion of prepaid annual members in summary the weakness in the comarketing channel as well as the shift in our member base due to our ongoing success in the employee benefit channel where our subscription fees are deducted directly from paychecks will alter the cash flow profile of the business the underlying profitability however remains strong and we expect to see healthy growth and scale across our business we remain confident that our brand unique technology and strong team will continue to drive penetration of our large and growing market we are focused on executing against our goals of driving new member growth and delivering bestinclass products to our members and with that wed like to open the call for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you at this time well be conducting a questionandanswer session our first question comes from david hynes from canaccord david e hynes  canaccord genuity inc hey thanks guys so maybe we can start with the comarketing channel hilary i guess can you give us any color on the conversations that youre having with these prospective new larger partners what are the gating factors to getting these deals done are there any recurring issues any additional color that can help us think about kind of what pushes these across the finish line hilary a schneider  president and chief executive officerelect yeah sure dj the way to think about the comarketing channel is that that channel definitely was impacted by the ftc matters and weve had a slower than expected recovery one of the things that contributes to that is that we are really strategically realigning to target larger opportunities and when we talk about larger opportunities were really talking about the potential to be integrated into the product offering flow of these larger companies id say were pleased with the scale and scope of the conversations weve had to date and that were very confident about the ability to materially scale this channel and its really a question in our minds as we work with these potential partners around how do we get the right offer in the right place at the right time david e hynes  canaccord genuity inc yeah got it and then on the ida side good to see that business executing well its obviously an important piece of the puzzle if my math is right it looks like the revenue per transaction dips a bit in the enterprise business and i guess could you talk about is there strategic rationale there right talk about pricing do you sacrifice pricing in the near term to grow the data network how do you think about that now and then kind of longer term pricing leverage in that business hilary a schneider  president and chief executive officerelect yeah absolutely so as you recognize ida is the special sauce of our business this unique data visibility not only helps us in scoring accurately for enterprises authentication of identity but it also enhances the lifelock offering we know for example that when a lifelock member receives an ida alert which is a me or not me then it increases the net promoter score in a dramatic way david e hynes  canaccord genuity inc yeah hilary a schneider  president and chief executive officerelect it is a  network effect of this business which is the more data we see the more effective our scoring is on the enterprise side and the more benefit we deliver to lifelock and we are prioritizing visibility to that data over pricing in the near term over the mid to long term i think theres opportunity to rethink that prioritization david e hynes  canaccord genuity inc yeah okay thats fair and then lastly maybe on the activist front  obviously you have a d filer that says theyve initiated a dialogue with the board maybe you could give us some color on kind of where their interests lie kind of tone of conversations anything you could offer to help us think about whats happening on that front hilary a schneider  president and chief executive officerelect yep as you would expect were always in dialogue with our shareholders and we dont comment on individual conversations with any shareholders i would emphasize that the board is focused on enhancing shareholder value david e hynes  canaccord genuity inc got it okay ill pass the line thanks guys christopher g power  chief financial officer thanks dj operator thank you our next question comes from scott zeller from needham  company scott zeller  needham  co llc hi good afternoon a question on the comarketing channel im trying to understand whether or not the challenge there is because you have partners that may have backed away and are not coming back to you or if its because there are new partners you have in the pipeline that have not converted hilary a schneider  president and chief executive officerelect sure so let me just reiterate that we have not lost any material partners through the process this is really around our pipeline and it is around targeting these larger opportunities in this quarter im sure you noticed in our statements that weve also strengthened our team in addition to mike dean who joined us earlier this year weve added finn faldi who will be focused on the comarketing channel and has significant experience in that space as well as terry  whos going to be joining us in the employee benefits space and so when we think about it we actually like the tenor of the conversations were having and the progress but it will take us longer to realize the upside so were really looking at contribution in  scott zeller  needham  co llc okay thats helpful and can you characterize the types of arrangements these would be you mentioned employee benefits but will we also think of large financial institutions here you mentioned getting your offering integrated into someone elses product array so maybe just high level flavor of the types of partners hilary a schneider  president and chief executive officerelect yes you should be thinking about the largest companies in the united states scott zeller  needham  co llc okay okay and you mentioned before i think i heard on the prepared remarks there are three levels of reimbursement of funds could you just clarify that is it only the ultimate plus paying customers hilary a schneider  president and chief executive officerelect yes there are three levels and the levels are   and  million and just to provide some added color the offering of this lost funds reimbursement really is an extension of the differentiation of lifelock and it was launched in response to some indepth consumer research weve conducted over the last year which really indicates that consumers are willing and care about protection of their financial assets and theyre looking for peace of mind and to give you some perspective we used the same analytical rigor in developing the tiering of this new lost funds reimbursement that we used when we implemented ultimate plus and advantage and were pleased with the early results that were seeing and well continue to iterate as we test and develop scott zeller  needham  co llc okay thanks very much christopher g power  chief financial officer thanks scott operator thank you our next question comes from scot shiao of bank of america scott shih yau shiao  bank of america merrill lynch hi so given whats happened in the comarketing channel would we expect coa to trend downwards for the rest of the year can we still expect that to still end higher in the year relative to last year christopher g power  chief financial officer so we wont guide to those specifics because a lot of that is going to be influenced by the mix within the channels overall but certainly with the q emphasis of the employee benefit channel and some additional shift were seeing in the business to some of those signups really coming in the fourth quarter rather than through the year i think youre going to see a significant improvement in the fourth quarter from a coa perspective so i think its really kind of more q focused as we roll through the year and its going to be driven by that success we have in the eb channel scott shih yau shiao  bank of america merrill lynch okay got it and with the – in respect to the arpu trends would we expect the arpu trends to continue to increase through the back half of the year as well and whats the proportion of the gnms on the higher arpu products is that still greater than  christopher g power  chief financial officer yeah so in terms of the gross new members that we added in the quarter we were well over  we were actually up just slightly from q which was one of our best quarters ever so very pleased with the new member mix of those premium offerings in terms of some of the things that are going to influence the arpu over time obviously its going to be dependent on channel mix but certainly as our premium products continue to penetrate the base that gives us a level of tailwind from an arpu perspective and on top of that weve also historically been able to innovate and create new products and new offerings and new features that allow us to introduce new products at higher price points now having said that there will be a bit of a headwind as well the eb channel we love the cost of acquisition elements of that business but if you recall it does tend to skew a little bit to the standard product so it tends to put a little bit of pressure on arpu in addition to that you know with that premium channel you might get a slightly higher level of churn so i think in terms of some of the factors to think about as we move forward i think those are things to consider scott shih yau shiao  bank of america merrill lynch okay thats helpful and lastly was there any effect recently with the headlines with the data breaches i think there were a number of older data sets that were released was there any increase in the number of customers that were being seen or was it nothing like the anthem hilary a schneider  president and chief executive officerelect i think the best way to think about that is the ongoing impact to the growth in the business christopher g power  chief financial officer and really its about the awareness for consumers so its just another example for consumers of enterprises not being able to contain consumers data so really over time it just continues to increase the awareness of consumers which ultimately kind of helps us over the long haul scott shih yau shiao  bank of america merrill lynch okay got it thank you christopher g power  chief financial officer thanks scott operator thank you our next question comes from dan bergstrom from rbc capital markets daniel bergstrom  rbc capital markets llc yeah thanks for taking the question maybe just a bit more on the employee benefits channel its seasonal enrollment in the fourth quarter sounds like a little bit more seasonal than previously could you talk to the sales cycle here what goes on the other three quarters are you educating potential customers working to be part of the enrollment process or are you really placing more resources into the broker networks that advise on the benefits packages hilary a schneider  president and chief executive officerelect sure dan appreciate the question so just to provide some context this is really only the third year for this channel and were very pleased with the results were seeing we do work through a broker network and the broker network has been influencing the employers who are projected to be adding identity theft protection at an increasingly rapid rate as they really look to differentiate themselves with their employees but i think there has been a shift in more companies moving their open enrollments to q than weve seen in the past and id also say that we feel really confident that were on track to meet expectations and if you were going to take an example of the success we see in the employee benefits channel its really a perfect cross section for us of being top of mind for the consumer while theyre signing up for other kind of protection and therefore can think about gosh ive thought about lifelock in the past really thought i wanted to get it this is an easy way for me to do it and the enrollment process for them is very easy because all the information is provided from the employer so they dont have to go through that process the other thing id call out we really like about this channel is that it does not have any of the billing issues associated with the rest of the channel christopher g power  chief financial officer i think the other thing id add there as well dan is companies really now are going through the decision process about what benefits theyre going to be offering when we get to the fourth quarter so from our perspective weve got really good visibility to both deals that have closed in terms of employers committing to offer our product although we havent yet signed up our gross new member but also we have a good sense of the number of companies that are considering the offer as we get to the fourth quarter and i think the last thing id add there too is whats interesting as well is as were learning and as were growing in this business and its performing very well as you get often times to year two or year three after youve offered this employee benefit you still pick up some members who perhaps maybe didnt sign up in year one and so that also we have a level of visibility to as well daniel bergstrom  rbc capital markets llc thanks and then hilary you talked about consumer awareness there youve done some elevated brand spending over the first half of the year i think that tends to have a longer tail versus more responseoriented advertising how do you judge that can you tell if theres an uptick in second half new members related to that brand advertising or how should we think about measuring its success should people be watching the coa thanks hilary a schneider  president and chief executive officerelect yeah so clearly from a brand perspective were very pleased with our new campaign and i hope youve all had a chance to look at some of the new tv spots the way i would think about that is that we of course measure coa in period but as we run more tv we clearly are driving awareness and were seeing that in the increases we see in our alreadyhigh brand awareness that kind of brand awareness really helps us when we think across raising the water for all ships so for example on employee benefits that higher brand awareness will translate to higher pull through for the employers to offer lifelock to their employees now remember the other benefit of the television advertising is television has added benefits across all channels daniel bergstrom  rbc capital markets llc thank you christopher g power  chief financial officer thanks dan operator our next question comes from joe maxa from dougherty joe maxa  dougherty  co llc thank you most of my questions have been answered i wanted to just maybe touch on the gross new members i mean obviously a lot of moving parts and i may have missed it but it sounded like a little bit of concern in q versus q obviously q is strong with employee benefits but handicapped in q should we be thinking of a number similar to what you added last year christopher g power  chief financial officer so joe as youre aware we dont really guide to specific metrics i think if you look at our business i think the directtoconsumer business was up in q and were getting some good performance there as well as weve discussed the employee benefit channel does tend to be kind of heavily weighted to the fourth quarter and we have talked about some of the challenges in the comarketing channel certainly through the rest of  so again were pleased with the results well continue to invest but i would expect the bigger impact to come with the eb channel in the fourth quarter joe maxa  dougherty  co llc right thank you christopher g power  chief financial officer thanks joe operator thank you at this time we have no further questions i will turn the call back over to hilary schneider for closing comments hilary a schneider  president and chief executive officerelect sure thank you for joining the call today i want to encourage you to take the time to visit
