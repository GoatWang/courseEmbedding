individuals in the fields of medicine drug development molecular biology and genetics have joined calico • hal v barron md • david botstein phd • robert cohen md • cynthia kenyon phd” barron will be

says “we don’t have everything worked out but basically the field of aging research is amazing there are so many cool results in the literature in terms of how you can perturb this or that signaling pathway and how to keep an animal ‘young’ longer or extend its lifespan it’s a very very exciting time for a company like calico to come along i think calico can really do exciting things” the

their shares languish in the single digits of course i will relish being the reagent provider that provides calico with their picks and shovels to use a san franciscogold miner analogy best of luck – you’ll need it petar posavec there’s a lot of research and experimentation that’s already been done on the subject matter it was already stated that by injecting stem cells into the abdominal section could triple ‘the average lifespan’ stemcells are  option nanorobots invented over  years ago could be another one but not in a manner that makes the body dependent on the technology but rather that the technology prompts the body’s own processes to work more efficiently and differently as well as extent the lifespan indefinitely to that end… how do we know that physical death as it occurs in humans is natural it could just as easily be a byproduct of a psychosomatic response from our observation of the environment which early humans projected onto themselves and the premise could have stuck with society as we know it virtually everything we understand about our customs and behavior is essentially influenced by the environment by living in an environment which basically conforms to the notion that ‘death is inevitable’ you essentially create a psychosomatic response on a subconscious level which manifests inon your body and this in turn produces an epigenetic effect there’s more than enough evidence to suggest that placebo effect is extremely effective to that end… it might be possible to accomplish this without technological intervention on a personal level it would require distancing oneself from most commonly held perceptions and opening the mind to new ones not an easy task given that we live in society which does the very opposite but its possible and requires a lot of effort – and i would surmise it would also require adjustment in ones lifestyle which includes diet etc apart from that telomere research is another option – but i doubt telomeres alone are responsible for the effect of physical ageing as we understand the process there could be other cofactors involved but telomeres are a good place to start – and their association with cancer growing
