customer support delivery of documents common questions about forming a c corporationif you have more questions please give us a call at   we love to helpwhat are the primary advantages of a c corporationthe c corporation structure is very similar to the c corporation with a few notable differences the most important of these differences is that c corporations are eligible for special pass through taxation status with the irs this allows c corporation owners to avoid double taxation on their business income are there any restrictions on who can file to form a c corporationoutside of some statespecific regulations that require individuals to be  to own a business there are no restrictions on who can form a corporation however if a corporation decides to elect for c corporation status there are several restrictions placed on who can become part of the organizations ownership they are as follows• all c corporation shareholders must be legal citizens of the united states • c corporations are only able to distribute one uniform class of stock • c corporation are limited to  different shareholders • subsidiary organizations may not have an ownership interest in a c corporation all shareholders must be individuals what are the tax implications of a c corporationone of the most common reasons that business owners elect to form a c corporation is that the structure is eligible for passthrough taxation under this special tax status the corporation is never taxed on its income instead each individual owner is taxed on the companys profits and losses as they are distributed and reflected on their personal income tax returns are there a required number of individuals needed to form a c corporationmost states only require one director in order to start a c corporation however some states impose a minimum number of directors based on the number of shareholders the company has this required number is typically never lower than three and there is no
