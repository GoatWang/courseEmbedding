performance depends in part on how its assets are allocated among the underlying funds or asset classes the adviser’s evaluations and assumptions regarding the asset classes or the underlying funds in which the fund invests may be incorrect causing the fund to be invested or not invested in one or more asset classes or underlying funds at an inopportune time which could negatively affect the fund’s performance banking and financial services industry focus risk from time to time an underlying fund may invest more than  of its assets in unsecured bank instruments including but not limited to certificates of deposit and time deposits or securities that may have guarantees or credit and liquidity enhancements provided by banks insurance companies or other financial institutions to the extent an underlying fund focuses its investments in these instruments or securities the underlying fund’s performance will depend on the overall condition of those industries and the individual banks and financial institutions in which an underlying fund invests directly or indirectly the supply of shortterm financing changes in government regulation changes in interest rates and economic downturns in the united states and abroad changing fixed income market conditions risk the current low interest rate environment was created in part by the federal reserve board frb and certain foreign central banks keeping the federal funds and equivalent foreign rates at or near zero increases in the federal funds and equivalent foreign rates may expose fixed income markets to heightened volatility and reduced liquidity for certain fixed income investments particularly those with longer maturities in addition decreases in fixed income dealer marketmaking capacity may also potentially lead to heightened volatility and reduced liquidity in the fixed income markets as a result the value of an underlying fund’s investments and share price may decline changes in central bank policies could also result in higher than normal shareholder redemptions which could potentially increase portfolio turnover and an underlying fund’s transaction costs commodities tax risk the tax treatment of commoditylinked derivative instruments may be adversely affected by changes in legislation regulations or other legally binding authority if as a result of any such adverse action the income of an underlying fund from certain commoditylinked derivatives was treated as nonqualifying income an underlying fund might fail to qualify as a regulated investment company and be subject to federal income tax at the fund level should the internal revenue service issue guidance or congress enact legislation that adversely affects the tax treatment of an underlying fund’s use of commoditylinked notes or a whollyowned subsidiary which guidance might be applied to the underlying fund retroactively it could among other consequences limit the underlying fund’s ability to pursue its investment strategy commoditylinked notes risk in addition to risks associated with the underlying commodities investments in commoditylinked notes may be subject to additional risks such as nonpayment of interest and loss of principal counterparty risk lack of a secondary market and risk of greater volatility than traditional equity and debt securities the value of the commoditylinked notes an underlying fund buys may fluctuate significantly because the values of the underlying investments to which they are linked are themselves volatile additionally certain commoditylinked notes employ “economic” leverage by requiring payment by the issuer of an amount that is a multiple of the price increase or decrease of the underlying commodity commodity index or other economic variable such economic leverage will increase the volatility of the value of these commoditylinked notes and an underlying fund to the extent it invests in such notes commodity risk an underlying fund may have investment exposure to the commodities markets andor a particular sector of the commodities markets which may subject an underlying fund to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities such as stocks and bonds volatility in the commodities markets may be caused by changes in overall market movements domestic and foreign political and economic events and policies war acts of terrorism changes in domestic or foreign interest rates andor investor expectations concerning interest rates domestic and foreign inflation rates investment and trading activities of mutual funds hedge funds and commodities funds and factors such as drought floods weather livestock disease embargoes tariffs and other regulatory developments or supply and demand disruptions because an underlying fund’s performance may be linked to the performance of volatile commodities investors should be willing to assume the risks of potentially significant fluctuations in the value of an underlying fund’s shares correlation risk because an underlying fund’s investment strategy seeks to balance risk across three asset classes and within each asset class across different countries and investments to the extent either the asset classes or the selected countries and investments become correlated in a way not anticipated an underlying fund’s adviser an underlying fund’s risk allocation process may result in magnified risks and loss instead of balancing reducing the risk of loss debt securities risk the prices of debt securities held by an underlying fund will be affected by changes in interest rates the creditworthiness of the issuer and other factors an increase in prevailing interest rates typically causes the value of existing debt securities to fall and often has a greater impact on longerduration debt securities and higher quality debt securities falling interest rates will cause an underlying fund to reinvest the proceeds of debt securities that have been repaid by the issuer at lower interest rates falling interest rates may also reduce an underlying fund’s distributable income because interest payments on floating rate debt instruments held by an underlying fund will decline an underlying fund could lose money on investments in debt securities if the issuer or borrower fails to meet its obligations to make interest payments andor to repay principal in a timely manner changes in an issuer’s financial strength the market’s perception of such strength or in the credit rating of the issuer or the security may affect the value of debt securities the adviser’s credit analysis may fail to anticipate such changes which could result in buying a debt security at an inopportune time or failing to sell a debt security in advance of a price decline or other credit event derivatives risk the value of a derivative instrument depends largely on and is derived from the value of an underlying security currency commodity interest rate index or other asset each referred to as an underlying asset in addition to risks relating to the underlying assets the use of derivatives may include other possibly greater risks including counterparty leverage and liquidity risks counterparty risk is the risk that the counterparty to the derivative contract will default on its obligation to pay the underlying fund the amount owed or otherwise perform under the derivative contract derivatives create leverage risk because they do not require payment up front equal to the economic exposure created by owning the derivative as a result an adverse change in the value of the underlying asset could result in the underlying fund sustaining a loss that is substantially greater than the amount invested in the derivative which may make the underlying fund’s returns more volatile and increase the risk of loss derivative instruments may also be less liquid than more traditional investments and the underlying fund may be unable to sell or close out its derivative positions at a desirable time or price this risk may be more acute under adverse market conditions during which the underlying fund may be most in need of liquidating its derivative positions derivatives may also be harder to value less tax efficient and subject to changing government regulation that could impact the underlying fund’s ability to use certain derivatives or their cost also derivatives used for hedging or to gain or limit exposure to a particular market segment may not provide the expected benefits particularly during adverse market conditions these risks are greater for certain underlying funds than most other mutual funds because certain underlying funds will implement their investment strategy primarily through derivative instruments rather than direct investments in stocksbonds emerging markets securities risk emerging markets also referred to as developing markets are generally subject to greater market volatility political social and economic instability uncertain trading markets and more governmental limitations on foreign investment than more developed markets in addition companies operating in emerging markets may be subject to lower trading volume and greater price fluctuations than companies in more developed markets securities law and the enforcement of systems of taxation in many emerging market countries may change quickly and unpredictably in addition investments in emerging markets securities may also be subject to additional transaction costs delays in settlement procedures and lack of timely information exchangetraded funds risk in addition to the risks associated with the underlying assets held by the exchangetraded fund investments in exchangetraded funds are subject to the following additional risks  an exchangetraded fund’s shares may trade above or below its net asset value  an active trading market for the exchangetraded fund’s shares may not develop or be maintained  trading an exchangetraded fund’s shares may be halted by the listing exchange  a passivelymanaged exchangetraded fund may not track the performance of the reference asset and  a passively managed exchangetraded fund may hold troubled securities investment in exchangetraded funds may involve duplication of management fees and certain other expenses as the fund or an underlying fund indirectly bears its proportionate share of any expenses paid by the exchangetraded funds in which it invests further certain exchangetraded funds in which the fund or an underlying fund may invest are leveraged which may result in economic leverage permitting the fund or an underlying fund to gain exposure that is greater than would be the case in an unlevered instrument and potentially resulting in greater volatility exchangetraded notes risk exchangetraded notes are subject to credit risk counterparty risk and the risk that the value of the exchangetraded note may drop due to a downgrade in the issuer’s credit rating the value of an exchangetraded note may also be influenced by time to maturity level of supply and demand for the exchangetraded note volatility and lack of liquidity in the underlying market changes in the applicable interest rates and economic legal political or geographic events that affect the referenced underlying market or assets an underlying fund will bear its proportionate share of any fees and expenses borne by an exchangetraded note in which it invests for certain exchangetraded notes there may be restrictions on an underlying fund’s right to redeem its investment in an exchangetraded note which is meant to be held until maturity foreign government debt risk investments in foreign government debt securities sometimes referred to as sovereign debt securities involve certain risks in addition to those relating to foreign securities or debt securities generally the issuer of the debt or the governmental authorities that control the repayment of the debt may be unable or unwilling to repay principal or interest when due in accordance with the terms of such debt and an underlying fund may have limited recourse in the event of a default against the defaulting governmentwithout the approval of debt holders some governmental debtors have in the past been able to reschedule or restructure their debt payments or declare moratoria on payments foreign securities and credit exposure risk us dollardenominated securities carrying foreign credit exposure may be affected by unfavorable political economic or governmental developments that could affect payments of principal and interest furthermore an underlying fund’s foreign investments may be adversely affected by political and social instability changes in economic or taxation policies difficulty in enforcing obligations decreased liquidity or increased volatility foreign investments also involve the risk of the possible seizure nationalization or expropriation of the issuer or foreign deposits in which an underlying fund could lose its entire investments in a certain market and the possible adoption of foreign governmental restrictions such as exchange controls foreign securities risk an underlying fund’s foreign investments may be adversely affected by political and social instability changes in economic or taxation policies difficulty in enforcing obligations decreased liquidity or increased volatility foreign investments also involve the risk of the possible seizure nationalization or expropriation of the issuer or foreign deposits in which an underlying fund could lose its entire investments in a certain market and the possible adoption of foreign governmental restrictions such as exchange controls unless an underlying fund has hedged its foreign securities risk foreign securities risk also involves the risk of negative foreign currency rate fluctuations which may cause the value of securities denominated in such foreign currency or other instruments through which an underlying fund has exposure to foreign currencies to decline in value currency exchange rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time currency hedging strategies if used are not always successful fund of funds risk the fund’s performance depends on that of the underlying funds in which it invests accordingly the risks associated with an investment in the fund include the risks associated with investments in the underlying funds the fund will indirectly pay a proportional share of the fees and expenses of the underlying funds in which it invests there are risks that the fund will vary from its target weightings if any in the underlying funds that the underlying funds will not achieve their investment objectives that the underlying funds’ performance may be lower than their represented asset classes and that the fund may withdraw its investments in an underlying fund at a disadvantageous time liquidity risk an underlying fund may be unable to sell illiquid investments at the time or price it desires and as a result could lose its entire investment in such investments liquid securities can become illiquid during periods of market stress if a significant amount of the an underlying fund’s securities become illiquid an underlying fund may not be able to timely pay redemption proceeds and may need to sell securities at significantly reduced prices management risk an underlying fund is actively managed and depends heavily on an underlying fund’s adviser’s judgment about markets interest rates or the attractiveness relative values liquidity or potential appreciation of particular investments made for an underlying fund’s portfolio an underlying fund could experience losses if these judgments prove to be incorrect additionally legislative regulatory or tax developments may adversely affect management of an underlying fund and therefore the ability of the underlying fund to achieve its investment objective market risk the market values of an underlying fund’s investments and therefore the value of an underlying fund’s shares will go up and down sometimes rapidly or unpredictably market risk may affect a single issuer industry or section of the economy or it may affect the market as a whole individual stock prices tend to go up and down more dramatically than those of certain other types of investments such as bonds during a general downturn in the financial markets multiple asset classes may decline in value when markets perform well there can be no assurance that specific investments held by an underlying fund will rise in value money market fund risk although an underlying money market fund seeks to preserve the value of the fund’s investment at  per share the fund may lose money by investing in an underlying money market fund the share price of money market funds can fall below the  share price you should not rely on or expect an underlying money market fund’s adviser or its affiliates to enter into support agreements or take other actions to maintain an underlying money market fund’s  share price the credit quality of an underlying money market fund’s holdings can change rapidly in certain markets and the default of a single holding could have an adverse impact on an underlying money market fund’s share price an underlying money market fund’s share price can also be negatively affected during periods of high redemption pressures andor illiquid markets furthermore amendments to money market fund regulations could impact an underlying money market fund’s operations and possibly negatively impact its return municipal securities risk the risk of a municipal obligation generally depends on the financial and credit status of the issuer constitutional amendments legislative enactments executive orders administrative regulations voter initiatives and the issuer’s regional economic conditions may affect the municipal security’s value interest payments repayment of principal and an underlying fund’s ability to sell the security failure of a municipal security issuer to comply with applicable tax requirements may make income paid thereon taxable resulting in a decline in the security’s value in addition there could be changes in applicable tax laws or tax treatments that reduce or eliminate the current federal income tax exemption on municipal securities or otherwise adversely affect the current federal or state tax status of municipal securities nondiversification risk the fund is nondiversified and can invest a greater portion of its assets in the obligations or securities of a small number of issuers or any single issuer than a diversified fund can a change in the value of one or a few issuers’ securities will therefore affect the value of the fund more than if it was a diversified fund repurchase agreement risk an underlying fund is subject to the risk that the counterparty may default on its obligation to repurchase the underlying instruments collateralizing the repurchase agreement which may cause an underlying fund to lose money these risks are magnified to the extent that a repurchase agreement is secured by securities other than cash or us government securities an underlying fund considers repurchase agreements with the federal reserve bank of new york to be us government securities for purposes of the underlying fund’s investment policies short position risk because an underlying fund’s potential loss on a short position arises from increases in the value of the asset sold short the underlying fund will incur a loss on a short position which is theoretically unlimited if the price of the asset sold short increases from the short sale price the counterparty to a short position or other market factors may prevent an underlying fund from closing out a short position at a desirable time or price and may reduce or eliminate any gain or result in a loss in a rising market an underlying fund’s short positions will cause the underlying fund to underperform the overall market and its peers that do not engage in shorting if an underlying fund holds both long and short positions and both positions decline simultaneously the short positions will not provide any buffer hedge from declines in value of the underlying fund’s long positions certain types of short positions involve leverage which may exaggerate any losses potentially more than the actual cost of the investment and will increase the volatility of an underlying fund’s returns subsidiary risk by investing in the subsidiary an underlying fund is indirectly exposed to risks associated with the subsidiary’s investments the subsidiary is not registered under the investment company act of  as amended  act and except as otherwise noted in this prospectus is not subject to the investor protections of the  act changes in the laws of the united states andor the cayman islands under which an underlying fund and the subsidiary respectively are organized could result in the inability of an underlying fund andor the subsidiary to operate as described in this prospectus and the sai and could negatively affect an underlying fund and its shareholders us government obligations risk obligations of us government agencies and authorities receive varying levels of support and may not be backed by the full faith and credit of the us government which could affect an underlying fund’s ability to recover should they default no assurance can be given that the us government will provide financial support to its agencies and authorities if it is not obligated by law to do so variablerate demand notes risk the absence of an active secondary market for certain variable and floating rate notes could make it difficult to dispose of these instruments which could result in a loss volatility risk although an underlying fund’s investment strategy targets a specific volatility level certain of an underlying fund’s investments may appreciate or decrease significantly in value over short periods of time this may cause an underlying fund’s net asset value per share to experience significant increases or declines in value over short periods of time yield risk an underlying fund’s yield will vary as the shortterm securities in its portfolio mature or are sold and the proceeds are reinvested in other securities when interest rates are very low an underlying fund’s expenses could absorb all or a portion of an underlying fund’s income and yield additionally inflation may outpace and diminish investment returns over time as of  ianax nav change
