in its arrowpoint marks through valid federal registrations and continuous use in interstate commerce dating back to march  and that its registrations for insurancerelated services protects it from the defendants infringement because investment management is a fundamental aspect of insurance di  at  as such it alleges the defendants unauthorized use of the aam logo and arrowpoint element in connection with the same type of services has caused actual confusion and irreparable harm for which there is no adequate remedy at law di  at  therefore the plaintiff argues it is entitled to a preliminary injunction based on  its trademark infringement claims under the section  of the lanham act  delaware common law and the dtpa and  unfair  section  of the lanham act provides any person who shall without consent of the registrant   use in commerce any reproduction counterfeit copy or colorable imitation of a registered mark in connection with the sale offering for sale distribution

usc §a  competition and false advertising claims under section a of the lanham act and the dtpa di  di  in response the defendants argue that the plaintiffs trademark registrations for insurancerelated services do not give it the right to block the defendants from using their marks for the distinctly different business of investment management services di  at  in addition the defendants contend that the plaintiff does not provide investment management services to any bona fide third parties and only manages investments of insurance premiums and other funds for itself and affiliated insurers d at  a likelihood of success on the merits  trademark infringement and unfair competition under the lanham act the law of trademark protects trademark owners in the exclusive use of their marks when use by another would be likely to cause confusion freedom card inc v jp morgan chase  co  fd   d cir  quoting fisons horticulture inc v vigoro indus inc  fd   d cir  a plaintiff

lanham act it only briefed and referenced statutory language related to unfair competition under section a of the lanham act unfair competition is codified by  usc § ala while false advertising is

 quoting mushroom makers inc v r g barry corp  f d   d cir  even if a mark is registered the presumptive right to use it extends only so far as the goods or services noted in the registration

inc v commerce ins agency inc  fjd   d cir  quoting ford motor co v summit motor prods  fd   d cir  a mark is inherently distinctive if it may be fairly characterized as arbitrary fanciful or suggestive d at  n here the defendants argue that the plaintiff cannot establish the first two elements for trademark infringement under the lanham act because insurance and investment management services are two distinctly different businesses di  at  the court disagrees the plaintiffs arrowpoint marks were federally registered on august   di  ex a both certificates of registration expressly state that the marks are for writing property casualty  a trademark becomes incontestable after the owner files affidavits stating that the mark has been registered that it has been in continuous use for five consecutive years and that there is no pending proceeding and there has been no adverse decision concerning the registrants ownership or right to registration fisons  fd at  n  usc §§   incontestability is not at issue in this case the arrowpoint marks were first used in commerce in march  and the present litigation was initiated less than three years later in february   msurance underwriting in the fields of property and casualty insurance insurance claims processing insurance claims servicing namely claims administration and premium rate computing actuarial services and insurance consulting services d i  ex a as such the plaintiffs certificates of registration specify purely insurancerelated services and are devoid of any indication that the arrowpoint marks are used for investment management services thus the plaintiffs arrowpoint marks do not carry a presumption of validity in the area of investment management services nonetheless the plaintiff argues and the defendants do not dispute that the arrowpoint marks are inherently distinctive see di  at  arrowpoint marks are arbitrary di  at  arrowpoint is suggestive therefore the court finds that the plaintiff owns valid marks which are legally protectable against the defendants alleged infringement if a likelihood of confusion exists between the parties marks see interpace cord v lapp inc  f d   d cir

name scott on household cleaners did not infringe the use of that mark on paper products  likelihood of confusion to prove likelihood of confusion plaintiffs must show that consumers viewing the mark would probably assume the product or service it represents is associated with the source of a different product or service identified by a similar mark checkpoint sys v check point software tech  fd   d cir  quoting scott paper  fd at  the third circuit has adopted a tenfactor test known as the lapp test to determine likelihood of confusion in the market for both competing and noncompeting goods victorias secret   fd at  the factors are   the degree of similarity between the owners mark and the alleged infringing mark  the strength of the owners mark  the price of the goods and other factors indicative of the care and attention expected of consumers when making a purchase  the length of time the defendant has used the mark without evidence of actual confusion arising  the intent of the defendant in adopting the mark  the evidence of actual confusion  whether the goods competing or not competing are marketed through the same channels of trade and advertised through the same media  the extent to which the targets of the parties sales efforts are the same  the relationship of the goods in the minds of consumers whether because of the nearidentity of the products the similarity of function or other factors   other facts suggesting that the consuming public might expect the prior owner to manufacture both products or expect the prior owner to manufacture a product in the defendants market or expect that the prior owner is likely to expand into the defendants market d no single factor is determinative in the likelihood of confusion analysis and each factor must be weighed and balanced against one another checkpoint  fd at  further the lapp test is a qualitative inquiry    and the different factors may properly be accorded different weights depending on the particular factual setting victorias secret  fd at  here the plaintiff argues that the defendants use of the arrowpoint element in their names has caused repeated instances of actual confusion among even the most sophisticated financial institutions and is likely to cause additional confusion among customers di  at  in essence the plaintiff contends that brokerage personnel who handle fixedincome securities transactions have been misled into mistaking one entity for the other or into believing that the entities are in some way affiliated or related d at  the defendants vehemently dispute that any confusion exists and contend that the high level of consumer sophistication in  this case obviates any link between the alleged supplier confusion and any potential or actual effect on a consumers purchasing decision  di  at  the parties focus their likelihood of confusion arguments on the respective arrowpoint word marks and do not put forth any significant arguments regarding the logos nevertheless the court will address logos in addition to the word marks additionally because the evidence of actual confusion is integral to many of the parties arguments the court will address the lapp factors in a modified sequence  a degree of similarity between the marks marks are confusingly similar if ordinary consumers would likely conclude that the services share a common source affiliation connection or sponsorship fisons  fd at  the proper legal test for mark similarity is whether the marks create the same overall impression when viewed separately fisons  fd at  overall impression is created by the sight sound and meaning of the mark sabinsa corp v creative compounds llc  fd   d cir  when comparing the marks each should be viewed in their entirety giving greater force and effect to the dominant feature country floors inc v p ship composed ofgepner and ford  fd   d cir  as a starting point the parties logos arrowpolnt capltat and are not confusingly similar because they do not create the same overall impression fisons   the defendants argue that the primary focus of the lanham act is consumer confusion and trademark laws protect only against confused purchasing decisions not against confusion generally di  at  the court disagrees under established third circuit law the act covers the use of trademarks which are likely to cause confusion mistake or deception of any kind not merely of purchasers nor simply as to source of origin kos pharm  fd at  accordingly the court must analyze all incidents of confusion related to the parties marks  the parties agree lapp factor i   facts suggesting the public might expect the plaintiff to expand and offer services in the defendants market is neutral because it does not apply in this case  fd at  indeed the similarity is negligible both logos contain a chevron reminiscent of an arrowhead and a horizontal line however the ac logo chevron is small in relation to the overall size of the mark and its use in place of the letter a as part of the logos dominant feature  the phrase arrowpoint capital in contrast the aam logo uses a large chevron surrounded by parallel lines to create its dominant feature which is prominently placed in the center of the mark further the fullcolor versions of the logos are even more distinct the ac logo is dominated by blue lettering and has a thin red accent line on the other hand the aam logo contains four distinct colors and its use of color draws the viewers eye to the center of the mark in sum the parties logos are unlikely to be confused because they do not create the same overall impression when viewed separately fisons  fd at  however the word marks are much more similar arrowpoint is the dominant feature and it appears as the first word in all of the marks  the defendants additional terms asset management partners fundamental opportunity fund and structured opportunity fund do change the overall visual impact and sound of the marks but convey a meaning somewhat similar to capital see checkpoint  fd at  finding check point software very similar to checkpoint systems because software and systems are generic or descriptive terms  that would not lead the average consumer to disassociate the products  but courts in this circuit have found that very similar marks are able to coexist in the financial services market where consumers take greater care than many others when the parties use their  see arrowpoint capital as compared to arrowpoint asset management arrowpoint partners arrowpoint fundamental opportunity fund and arrowpoint structured opportunity fund  see also j thomas mccarthy  mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition §  th ed  the trademark board has said that the general rule is that a subsequent user may not avoid likely confusion by appropriating anothers entire mark and adding descriptive or nondistinctive matter to it an exception to that rule exists when the marks in their entireties convey quite different meanings  i full names in official communications see first keystone fed sav bank v first keystone mortg inc  f supp   ed pa  sav bank life ins co of mass v sbli usa mut life ins co ca no   us dist lexis  at  ed pa nov    accordingly the court finds that the word marks are similar but the dominant arrowpoint feature is tempered when the marks are viewed in their entirety therefore with respect to the word marks this factor slightly favors the plaintiff b strength of the owners mark to determine the strength of the mark courts look to  the inherent features of the mark contributing to its distinctiveness or conceptual strength and  the factual evidence of the marks commercial strength or of marketplace recognition of the mark sabinsa  fd at  citing victorias secret   fd at   for conceptual strength the court agrees with the defendants that the arrowpoint marks are suggestive indicating direction and precision  di  at  however the marks conceptual strength is undermined by the lack of evidence demonstrating commercial strength the plaintiffs solitary support for commercial strength is that it has spent approximately  promoting its marks di  at  the court is unable to gauge whether that sum spent on promotional efforts is sufficient to establish marketplace recognition for investment management services by way of comparison the defendants claim to have spent almost double  see also omicron capital llc v omicron capital llc  f supp d  sdny  finding identical word marks for financial services unlikely to cause confusion because they are not broadly marketed to the public and prospective purchasers are unlikely to perceive the marks before becoming familiar with the parties businesses  see sabinsa  fd at  citation and internal quotation marks omitted arbitrary or fanciful marks like kodak use terms that neither describe nor suggest anything about the product suggestive marks like coppertone require consumer imagination thought or perception to determine what the product is  that amount   for the same purpose  di  at  accordingly the court is not convinced that the arrowpoint marks have obtained any significant commercial strength which weakens the overall strength of the mark therefore the court finds that the factor is neutral c evidence of actual confusion evidence of actual confusion is    highly probative of a likelihood of confusion sabinsa  fd at  however a court may discount evidence of actual confusion that is isolated and idiosyncratic victorias secret  fd at  further confusion is not actionable where it is not shown    to have resulted from confusion between the two companies as opposed to mere carelessness or accident first keystone  f supp at  here the plaintiff produced no evidence of actual customer confusion instead it argues that broker dealers at global financial institutions including bank of america barclays citigroup rbs and morgan stanley all have been misled into mistaking one entity for the other or into believing that the entities are in some way affiliated orr elated di  at  specifically the plaintiff provides three categories of alleged actual confusion  thirdparty inquiries about the relationship between the parties   misdirected trades  and  incidents of  the court notes that the defendants purported marketing expenditures may be highly inflated and include the defendants founders travel expenses for any purpose see di  at  n  for example in april  a royal bank of scotland rbs salesperson contacted the plaintiff regarding a large security purchase that the defendants had made using a different broker and asked why the plaintiff had not engaged rbs for the transaction in may  an attorney for barclays capital negotiating a security agreement for the plaintiff asked whether it was a different entity from the arrowpoint that is being represented by a different law firm and in april  in connection with a securities agreement citigroup sent a request for general information regarding the plaintiff and asked it to do the same exercise for two of the defendants entities  arrowpoint fundamental opportunity fund and arrowpoint structured opportunity fund di  at   on three occasions between april and july  jpmorgan chase  co jpmorgan misallocated the defendants trades to the plaintiffs brokerage account di  at  however the plaintiff rejected each trade before settlement in addition the plaintiffs representative testified that misallocated trades are not uncommon in the financial services industry di  at  n  mistaken identity which inhibited the plaintiffs ability to complete trades  di  at  the court views many of the alleged inquiries about the affiliation between the parties with great skepticism given the interested sources and the inability to crossexamine the supposedly confused individuals victorias secret  fd at  in addition the court has not been presented sufficient evidence to determine whether the misdirected trades were the result of actual confusion between the parties as opposed to mere carelessness mistake or clerical error on a brokers part see first keystone  f supp at  indeed it appears as if jpmorgan was the only financial institution that misdirected trades there is also no evidence to establish that three misdirected trades are significant especially since the record is devoid of the number of trades that were executed without incident see note  supra victorias secret  fd at  finding a court may discount evidence of actual confusion that is isolated and idiosyncratic the remaining allegations do present some evidence of actual confusion between the parties by brokerdealers but again the record does not convince the court that the few remaining alleged incidents translate to a more general likelihood of confusion as a matter of law especially since the record is devoid of any inference of customer confusion therefore the court finds that this factor slightly favors the plaintiff d customer care and sophistication  the plaintiff alleges that in summer  citigroup delayed its application to acquire certain securities in part due to confusion between its account and another applicant aam which inhibited the review and submission of both applications and in august  the plaintiff attempted to participate in a corporate bond offering through rbs but was informed that it would not receive an allocation because it was mistaken for a hedge fund operating out of colorado   at  in response the defendants argue that the alleged confusion at citigroup did not prejudice the plaintiffs application because it applied under the arrowood name and the plaintiffs applications were deferred because citi gave preference to large orders and the plaintiff was one of the smallest participants   and  similarly the defendants argue that the plaintiff was able to resolve whatever error occurred in the  rbs bond offering and it did get an allocation d at  n  when consumers exercise heightened care in evaluating the relevant products before making purchasing decisions courts have found there is not a strong likelihood of confusion where the relevant products are expensive or the buyer class consists of sophisticated or professional purchasers courts have generally not found lanham act violations checkpoint  fd at  here the plaintiff concedes that customers of the parties investment services are likely to be careful and sophisticated di  at  the defendants echo that premise and argue that customers of both parties invest large sums usually at least  million and investments in the defendants hedge funds are locked up for  months with penalties for early withdrawal di  at  further the defendants potential customers are high net worth individuals institutional investors or endowment funds that often perform due diligence on the defendants before investing id and the plaintiffs potential customers are insurance companies and pension funds di  at  as such the court finds that the buyer class consists of sophisticated or professional purchasers that exercise heightened care in evaluating the relevant products before making purchasing decisions checkpoint  fd at  moreover both parties acknowledge that they make individual facetoface presentations to potential investors see id at  dl  at  which militates against a likelihood of confusion accordingly this factor strongly favors the defendants due to the amount of money involved and the high level of customer sophistication e length of time the defendant has used the mark without evidence of actual confusion arising the defendants contend that they began using their mark in december  and the plaintiffs first alleged instance of actual confusion did not occur until more than a year later  l april  di  at  in contrast the plaintiff asserts that the april  confusion occurred less than one month after the defendants began investing in earnest under its arrowpoint opportunity fund mark di  at  the court is unable to thoroughly assess this factor given the nature of the alleged actual confusion and the lack of evidence regarding the amount and type of trades the parties executed during the same timeframe therefore this factor is neutral f the defendants intent in adopting the mark evidence of intentional willful and admitted adoption of a mark closely similar to the existing marks weighs strongly in favor of finding the likelihood of confusion checkpoint  fd at  citation and internal quotation marks omitted here the defendants assert that aam selected its marks because arrowpoints had personal significance to aam s founder and to suggest a connection between digging for arrowpoints and the thorough manner in which aam conducts the fundamental research on which it bases its investment management services di  at  in addition they argue that aam adopted its mark in good faith based on a clearance procedures that included counsels review of a full us availability trademark search report which indicated that the plaintiff was engaged in property and casualty insurance not investment management or related services d as such there is no evidence or even inference that the defendants chose its name with the plaintiffs name or product in mind checkpoint  fd at  therefore this factor favors the defendants g channels of trade and advertising media the greater the similarity in advertising and marketing campmgns the greater the likelihood of confusion checkpoint  fd at  citation omitted here both parties promote their services through industry meetings events and direct presentations to prospective  clients see di  at  di  at  however the defendants target events of interest to hedge fund investors family foundations and endowments di  at  the plaintiff concedes that it does not attend such events because it is not a hedge fund  di  at  attendance at different sets of industry events cuts against a likelihood of confusion checkpoint  fd at  see further the defendants rely on wordofmouth referrals id at  which intuitively eliminate the possibility of confusion finally it cannot be over stressed that both parties use direct client presentations incorporating their respective logos which are visually distinct thus this factor strongly favors the defendants h similarity of target customers  the relationship of the goods in the minds of customers the parties generally seek distinct groups of customers that are sophisticated and unlikely to view the parties services as related or similar the plaintiff targets customers experiencing some sort of financial distress while the defendants pursue high net worth individuals and institutional investors not distressed companies di  at  the defendants do concede that insurance companies and pension funds are potential clients for both parties  but they argue that those clients would retain the parties for different purposes  the plaintiffs expertise is in fixedincome investments while the defendants claim to offer expertise across the capital spectrum d in response the plaintiff argues that any distinctions between the parties services and clients are irrelevant given the overlap between their investment activity at  the plaintiff does argue that the parties have attended the same industry events which have resulted in actual confusion di  at  the alleged actual confusion involved one of the plaintiffs employees who was wearing an arrowpoint capital name badge being asked whether he was associated with arrowpoint in denver by a person manning a trade booth the court finds that such an encounter at a trade show does not affect its analysis of this factor  the plaintiff alleges that the defendants have promoted their investment management services to at least eight insurance companies four public pension plans and three corporate pension plans di  at   various brokerage firms which has led to actual confusion di  at  the court disagrees the distinctions between the parties services and clients are the relevant inquiries under these two factors when the parties target their sales efforts to the same group of consumers there is a greater likelihood of confusion between the two marks sabinsa  fd at  citation omitted however if the products fall under the same general product category but operate in distinct niches they will probably not be closely related d at  citation and internal quotation marks omitted the court finds that while some potential customers may overlap there is little likelihood of customer confusion because the parties offer distinctly different investment management strategies to generally different classes of investors further any purported actual confusion by the broker dealers is not due to the clients targeted or the investment management services offered and should not be considered under these factors rather any brokerdealer confusion is attributable to the similarity of the marks and the fungible nature of commonly traded securities stated differently a particular fixedincome security is an identical good in the mind of a broker dealer regardless of what entity is purchasing it for a particular client based on an individualized investment strategy as such any weight attributable to brokerdealer confusion is properly assessed by the actual confusion lapp factor therefore the court finds that these factors favor the defendants  lanham act claims summary the above analysis demonstrates that the balance of lapp factors tips in favor of the defendants importantly the parties promote their specialized investment services using direct presentations to generally distinct groups of prospective customers which include sophisticated or professional purchasers that invest large sums of money while similarities exist between the parties word marks the respective logos are distinct and the overall strength of plaintiffs marks  is weakened by a lack of commercial strength further the limited incidents of brokerdealer confusion are not dispositive of a likelihood of confusion in the marketplace and do not outweigh the factors in the defendants favor accordingly the plaintiff has not shown a likelihood of confusion in the marketplace therefore the plaintiff has not proven a likelihood of success on the merits for its lanham act claims b likelihood of success on the merits  common law infringement and dtpa claims because the plaintiff failed to carry its burden for proving a likelihood of confusion the court does not need to address the plaintiffs state law trademark claims at length the plaintiff concedes in its opening brief that trademark infringement under the common law and dtpa are subject to the lanham act standard for trademark infringement di  at  in addition the plaintiff relies upon its trademark infringement likelihood of confusion arguments to establish unfair competition and false advertising under the dtp a therefore the court finds that the plaintiff has not proven a likelihood of success on the merits for its state law trademark claims v conclusion for the reasons stated above the court will deny the
