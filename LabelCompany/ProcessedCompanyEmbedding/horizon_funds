bull market in bonds the search for yield remains in full force yield compression and the resulting bond price appreciation have also added to the incomesolution challenge by reducing the number of attractive capital appreciation opportunities available in fixed income products that have a tactical component—which can be utilized effectively to allocate across the different segments of the fixedincome universe to those the fund manager perceives as having the most attractive relative valuations—have strong appeal particularly for investors seeking both greater yield and total return unconstrained and alternativeincome funds have been launched to help meet this demand and their number should continue to grow read morespoiled for choice less is much more for example a recently launched unconstrained bond fund with this go anywhere philosophy is the neuberger berman unconstrained bond fund the driving rationale behind these alternative credit products is that in order to achieve an attractive total return in a lowyieldlimitedcapitalappreciation environment a fixed income–oriented investor needs a fund manager who can rapidly take advantage of new opportunities without the constraints typically imposed on a traditional bond fund this unconstrained strategy has proved popular recently since lipper began tracking the net flows of the alternativecreditfocused peer

strong growth segments most of which were unavailable to fund investors until recently investors find these products particularly appealing for their portfoliodiversification benefits and their perceived ability to provide positive absolute returns in different market environments the number of these products will continue to increase as financial advisors find they have broad appeal in periods of heightened volatility some investors are also concerned about the future direction of equities and the prospects for fixed income after the bond market disappointed in  these uncertainties

see new funds added include hedge fundlike strategies such as marketneutral marketneutral funds often attempt to limit or neutralize the impact that market return has on the portfolio by being both long and short this has appeal for investors who are looking for both diversification and reduced volatility two funds following this approach are pimco worldwide fundamental advantage strategy fund which has gathered significant assets over the past two years and vanguard market neutral fund smartbeta approaches should also see new fund launches as this approach gains greater traction

weightings in larger names enhanced indexing is a popular smartbeta strategy that continues to attract a lot of net inflows enhanced indexing strategies typically attempt to reduce overall volatility

investing the horizons exchange traded products consist of the horizons index etfs index etfs x daily bull and x daily bear etfs x daily etfs inverse etfs inverse etfs vix etfs defined below and active etfs the x daily etfs and certain other horizons exchange traded products use leveraged investment techniques that can magnify gains and losses and may result in greater volatility of returns these horizons exchange traded products are subject to leverage risk and may be subject to aggressive investment risk and price volatility risk which where applicable are described in their respective prospectuses each x daily etf seeks a return before fees and expenses that is either  or  of the performance of a specified underlying index commodity or benchmark the target for a single day each index etf or inverse etf seeks a return that is  or  respectively of the performance of a target due to the compounding of daily returns a x daily etfs or inverse etfs returns over periods other than one day will likely differ in amount and possibly direction from the performance of their respective targets for the same period the horizons exchange traded products whose target is the sp  vix shortterm futures index™ the vix etfs one of which is a x daily etf and one of which is an index etf as described in their prospectus are speculative investment tools that are not conventional investments the vix etfs target is highly volatile as a result the vix etfs are not generally viewed as standalone longterm investments historically the vix etfs target has tended to revert to a
