tuesday afternoon barr is an attorney and business partner of jared abbruzzese bruno is accused of receiving payment from abbruzzese’s companies for doing no work while steering grant money toward abbruzzese’s business interests those grants came up in barr’s testimony today prosecutor elizabeth coombe presented a press release from evident technologies one of abbruzzese’s companies for which barr is still a trustee evident received a grant from the state senate in  for  and announced at a press conference the total grant would be  million advertisement barr said he was “not privy to what goes on at the senate” but knew bruno was a supporter of evident and he arraigned for the grant money “i assume he had a big influence” he said judge gary sharpe said he considered barr an “adverse and hostile witness” and advised barr to not “editorialize” or add extra information to his answers while under examination by coombe barr mistakenly labeled the grant “bruno member item” in company documents when local media reached out to evident to ask about the grant barr told employees “ignore it it can’t be good” in an email he testified he was concerned it would be a distraction for the small company barr also discussed the terms of bruno’s work agreement he said during  when bruno was getting paid by abbruzzese’s companies communications technology advisors and capital and technology advisors the companies were paying about eight to  independent contractors for consulting services that created their own work schedule and often worked from home or on the phone they were paid from  to  monthly bruno earned  monthly barr said bruno was different though as he was senate majority leader and rather than a handshake deal the company created a work agreement letter barr said some of the language in the letter was crafted by an ethics officer who included a paragraph concerning the public officers law barr’s testimony lasted most of the day next jerry bilinski a local veterinarian who bought two mares and two foals with bruno and abbruzzese in  took the stand bilinski said he’d been friends with bruno since the s he said he paid half of the  to buy the horses with bruno and abbruzzese later bought onesixth of each their shares for  abbruzzese bought a filly born in  named christy’s night out from bruno for  in  an amount bilinski said he learned from the us attorney’s office and was surprised to hear bilinski had sold his interest in the filly for  and said abbruzzese was not interested in trying to make money from the filly which differed from his plans prosecutors contend abbruzzese bought the “worthless” horse from bruno in exchange for state grant money awarded to his business interests bilinski said “worthless” was “not a word i would use or agree with” he said he saw photographs of the horse before seeing it in person and the tongue was protruding and feet “a little broken up” but it didn’t have any “important health issues” he said for the horse to be insured it had to be examined by a veterinarian the horse was insured for  significantly less than the other foals in the partnership which were insured for  and  bilinski also said he knew the horse was a favorite of abbruzzese’s wife and was named after her best friend bilinski’s testimony concluded at the end of day and the trial will resume at  am today abbruzzese has yet to
