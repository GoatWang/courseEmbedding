advantage of market opportunities under both normal operating conditions and under unpredictable circumstances of industry or market stress cash is used to fund loans purchase investments fund the maturity of liabilities and at times to fund deposit outflows and operating activities the corporations principal sources of funds are deposits amortization and prepayments of loans maturities sales and principal receipts from securities borrowings and operations management considers the asset position of the corporation to be sufficiently liquid to meet normal operating needs and conditions the

broker to obtain deposits from outside its normal service area as an additional source of funding the corporation however does not rely upon these deposits as a primary source of funding although management monitors interest rates on an ongoing basis a quarterly rate sensitivity report is used to determine the effect of interest rate changes on the financial statements in the opinion of

offbalance sheet risk these financial instruments generally include commitments to originate mortgage commercial and consumer loans and involve to varying degrees elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets the maximum exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the borrower is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments since commitments to extend credit have a fixed expiration date or other termination clause some commitments will expire without being drawn upon and the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements the same credit policies are used in making commitments as are used for onbalance sheet instruments and collateral is required in instances where deemed necessary undisbursed balances of loans closed include funds not disbursed but committed for construction projects unused lines of credit include funds not disbursed but committed for home equity commercial and consumer lines of credit financial standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party the credit risk

compensate for such changes the spread on interest rates or the difference between the average earning assets and the average interestbearing liabilities is monitored quarterly offbalance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business to meet the financial needs of our customers we are a party to financial instruments with offbalance sheet risk these financial instruments generally include commitments to originate mortgage commercial and consumer loans and involve to varying degrees elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets the maximum exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the borrower is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments since commitments to extend credit have a fixed expiration date or other termination clause some commitments will expire without being drawn upon and the total commitment amounts does not necessarily represent future cash requirements the same credit policies are used in making commitments as are used for onbalance sheet instruments and collateral is required in instances where deemed necessary undisbursed balances of loans closed include funds not disbursed but committed for construction projects unused lines of credit include funds not disbursed but committed for home equity commercial and consumer lines of credit financial standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same
