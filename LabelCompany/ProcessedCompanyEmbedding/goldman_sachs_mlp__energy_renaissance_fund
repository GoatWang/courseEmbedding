investment in the fund is not appropriate for all investors and the fund is not intended to be a complete investment program investors should carefully review and consider the fund’s investment objective risks charges and expenses before investing fund risk considerations the goldman sachs mlp and energy renaissance fund invests primarily in master limited partnership “mlp” and other energy investments the fund’s equity investments are subject to market risk which means that the value of the securities in which it invests may go up or down in response to numerous factors including the prospects of individual companies particular sectors andor general economic conditions investments in mlps are subject to certain additional risks including risks related to limited control and limited rights to vote potential conflicts of interest cash flow risks dilution risks limited liquidity risks related to the general partner’s right to force sales at undesirable times or prices interest rate sensitivity and for mlps with smaller capitalizations lower trading volume and abrupt or erratic price movements mlps are also subject to risks relating to their complex tax structure including the risk that an mlp could lose its tax status as a partnership resulting in a reduction in the value of the fund’s investment in the mlp and lower income to the fund mlps are also subject to the risk that to the extent that a distribution received from an mlp is treated as a return of capital the fund’s adjusted tax basis in the mlp interests may be reduced which may increase the fund’s tax liability upon the sale of the mlp interests or upon subsequent distributions in respect of such interests the fund’s strategy results in its being taxed as a regular corporation or “c” corporation which involves complicated accounting tax and valuation issues many mlps in which the fund invests operate facilities within the energy sector and are also subject to risks affecting that sector because the fund concentrates its investments in the energy sector the fund is subject to greater risk of loss as a result of adverse economic business or other developments affecting industries within that sector than if its investments were more diversified across different industries the fund may invest in private investment in public equities “pipes” which may be deemed illiquid the securities of mid and smallcapitalization companies involve greater risks than those associated with larger more established companies and may be subject to more abrupt or erratic price movements the fund may invest in mlps with smaller capitalizations which may have limited financial resources and less liquidity the fund may invest in private companies or companies prior to their initial public offering which are not subject to securities and exchange commission “sec” reporting and are more vulnerable to market conditions the fund is nondiversified and may invest a larger percentage of its assets in fewer issuers than diversified funds accordingly the fund may be more susceptible to adverse developments affecting any single issuer held in its portfolio and to greater losses resulting from these developments the fund is newly organized and has no operating history shares of closedend investment companies frequently trade at a discount from their net asset value “nav” and the fund cannot predict whether its shares will trade at below or above nav or the initial public offering price the fund is subject to leverage risk which involves risks and special considerations including the likelihood of greater volatility of nav market price and dividend rate of the shares than a comparable portfolio without leverage the risk that fluctuations in interest rates on borrowings and shortterm debt or in the interest or dividend rates on any leverage that the fund must pay will reduce returns the effect of leverage in a declining market which is likely to cause a greater decline in the nav of the shares than if the fund were not leveraged which may result in a greater decline in the market price of the shares the fund’s investments in derivative instruments can be illiquid may disproportionately increase losses and may have a potentially large impact on fund performance investments in derivative instruments may be harder to value subject to greater volatility and more likely subject to changes in tax treatment than other investments an investment in the fund is not appropriate for all investors and is not intended to be a complete
