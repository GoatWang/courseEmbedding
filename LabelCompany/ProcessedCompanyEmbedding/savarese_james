networks including the tollison economists network —   in  jim savarese established his economic consulting firm with the same name with headquarters in washington dc a few years later he was claiming to have associates at major universities in more than  states who could become available to the tobacco industry to make statements in support of smoking   he also had strong labor union connections some key documents • note that savarese was used by the tobacco institute in stockholm     see also john savarese  e born –  he was an assistant economics professor at virginia commonwealth university in richmond    james savarese was initially employed by the american federation of state county and municipal employees afscme which was one of the largest organizations in the aflcio  jan  tobacco

submit an article now and again — with the understanding that the work is not done on ti time  jan  dianne savarese is listed as an attendee at the feb  tis college of tobacco knowledge she may have

associates inc  feb see  sep  tobacco institute draft communications plan reference to economic impact of expanding smoking prohibitions in montgomery county by james savarese and associates inc a survey of opinions toward a proposed smoking ordinance in montgomery county prepared by hamilton and staff forjames savarese and associates  feb the company james savarese  associates inc has prepared a report on the economic impact of smoking prohibiiton in mongomery county for the tobacco institute it is  pages long and contains all the fingertothebreeze assumptions that economists love to present as facts of course it emphasises the additional costs of bans and ignores any potential benefit health fires cleaning bills pollution costs the cost of producing and displaying no smoking signs appears to be a primary consideration  to the point of an obsession  while the hourly cost of wages by those in need of a smoking break is estimated at  million in this one county alone  savarese manages to come up with some impressive tables which are almost totally irrelevant using theodore sterlings calculations  dec  mike kerrigan at the tobacco institute see difficulties ahead for the tobacco industry with the new york legislature in  he wants to recruit two lobbyists james saverese and joe kilgallon for the bootlegging project spreading claims that increases in cigarette excises will result in smuggling and loss of state income     he is going to invite them to lunch tomorrow with jack kelly ti and lawyer john rupp of covington  burling i believe the tobacco institute should take the necessary steps to deeply involve jim and joe to assist us in our new york legislative efforts in  i think you will agree that they both can materially improve our chances of success  feb report on new york state finances  the cigarette tax by james savarese  associates february   feb  a press release put out in march for the council of labor union women cluw on abortion by ogilvy

apr  trish militas associate at ogilvy  mather pr marcia silverman writes to peter sparber at the tobacco institute in an effort to create organized labor opposition to certain workplace smoking restrictions ogilvy  mather has targeted several unions for initial contacts and discussions on the issue     these unions have been selected on the basis of the industries they have organized the size and potential growth of their membership their clout within the labor movement and their political strength brief descriptions of eight of these unions follow among the list was the american federation of state county and municipal employees afscme which was one of the largest organizations in the aflcio it was also the union which employed james m savarese who was to join both ompr on the ti account and also run the tobacco institutes labor and economists projects     there is no mention of savarese in this memo however  july  ogilvy  mathers bill to the tobacco institute for july  contains a  charge for james savarese  hrs at  ph the others are only listed by their om titles so savarese was obviously an outside contractor to om  sep  tobacco institute draft communications plan  feb  draft outline of the book to be derived from smoking and society conference june  new york and edited by robert d tollison it will have chapters written by various experts and the international tobacco lobby group infotab is to distribute the book the incidence of taxes on smoking savareseshughart smoking is a heavily taxed activity in general the burden of the tax is shared by consumers in the form of higher prices producers of tobacco products in the form of reduced profits and tobacco farmers in the form of lower rents     this section contains an evaluation of tax equity including a consideration of how the burden is distributed among these three groups the analysis utilizes us data as well as data from several other countries around the world     the paper presents evidence that taxes on smoking are regressive ie that excise taxes on cigarettes fall more heavily on lowincome consumers both tollison and shughart are corenmembers of the cashforcomments economists network tollison becomes the main organiser along with savarese  apr  the tobacco institutes cigarette exercise tax plan draft shows that they are disillusioned with president reagan because after the deregulatory fiascos of his first term he was now leaning more towards the use of excise taxes to offset some of the income tax reductions given to the wealthy — resulting in a fastgrowing deficit which had now reached  billion outlook for  once the elections are over it is almost certain that the new congress will consider a significant tax increase since an enormous amount of revenue is needed to balance the federal budget it will be very difficult to keep federal cigarette excises out of a final tax package earmarking of cigarette excises for medicare was being suggested the various state excises were also under consideration     they also suggest the hiring in each state economic consultants one public finance economist for  days   including meetings with coalition members andor the governors staff research and preparation and testimony total one economist for a union workshop on the tax issue including  or  training sessions over the course of a convention total  six economists   and one senior economist   for a tax symposium including publishing of the proceedings at  the senior economist would play an oversightorganizational role and would be responsible for editing the proceedings such a symposium would be staged for regional or national impact total  one economist provided to a public employee union to do original research on the need for adequate services to be funded by broadbased taxes this would include the final report and testimony total  it also had draft copy and designs for a couple of different booklets aimed at different states and others aimed at laborunion and racial groups and it identifies the congress committeemen and state assembleymen who should be targetted as most likely to be influenced adding an appendix which lists economists who could be enlisted to help potential economic consultants     following is a list of economists in key states who might assist us as consultants we have begun contacting them to ensure their willingness and expertise we are asking each about past experience work with similar issues previous work with the industry published articles or research and speaking availability     as discussed in the body of this program our intent is to have a group of individuals who we can call upon regularly to testify conduct special research projects and discuss their research andor views on

barazel university of washington washington dc robert d tollison george mason university wisconsin burton weisbrod university of wisconsin     tollison is the most influential and prestigious on this list he would be hired to consult on federal tax situations and to oversee efforts of the others throughout the country see last page yoram barazel is the only name on this list who appears to have resisted the institutes overtures  oct james m savarese public finance economist and labor relations specialist president james savarese  associates is the author of free to smoke  oct william shughart and james savarese have jointly presented a revised draft not for quotation without permission document on the incidence of taxes on tobacco — which has found its way into brown  williamson files     after  pages it concludes rather tamely that given that smokers as a group appear to have lower permanent incomes than the population as a whole any per unit or excise tax on them will generally be regressive  jan at roughly this time the cashforcomments economists network was being set up by robert tollison using his center for the study of public choice with james savarese  associates he was already functioning independently of ogilvy  mather the split agreement appears to have been that om would continue to handle ordinance hearings and speaking engagements while tollison and savarese would control the network of economists  oct  in the  page final opinion in the case usa and others vs philip morris et al during  the tobacco institute paid  for one half the

engagements at seminars for some of the industrys cashforcomments economists under the auspices of the southwestern social science association and the eastern economic association jim savarese of om writes to trish milita copied to the tobacco institute re economic forums attached are the panel sessions that were accepted by both the southwestern social science associations and the eastern economic association in march  these are very strong academic panels and add a great deal of depth to our list of consultants for future use i know all of these individuals personally except for henry butler who is a friend of bob tollisons at texas am they all understand their mission and will be submitting papers for us to review well in advance of the meetings the southwestern social science association seminar run by om in houston mar  was on taxation and social process it had robert ekelund in the chair and papers by henry n butler joseph m jadlow and richard e wagner keith watson was a discussant the eastern economic association seminar run by om in pittsburgh mar  was on perspecives on tax reform it had robert tollison in the chair and papers by william shughart gary anderson and a joint paper by john bowmanmichael pratt the discussant was george hoffer note all of the speakers here were employed by the tobacco industry through the savaresetollison economists network to promote the industrys social cost and taxation agenda  mar  bill kloepfer the vice president in charge of public relations at the tobacco institute send a memo to president sam chilcote on consultant economists tax issue advice he says as you suggested i met march  in a hotel room with five economists to discuss approaches by the industry to tax issues pete sparber participated attending were james savarese ogilvy  mather dennis logue dartmouth dolores martin university of nebraska dwight lee university of georgia henry butler university of chicago the advice we received was to consider carefully any earmarking proposals perhaps accepting those which present a coalition probability and protesting those which do not     the effect of price including excises on cigarette demand apparently is usually measured on an immediate basis most economists evidently find the demand for cigarettes to be relatively inelastic     while the socalled social costs issue affects public policy in many ways it was recognized as one of the incentives for increased cigarette taxes the group recognized the  office of technologic assessment memorandum as a landmark and its members indicated they would welcome an opportunity to study it as a basis for proposing research projects which could mitigate its unwarrented effects     they understand that the institute does not have an economic research budget per se but that we would welcome any suggestions which we might consider on their merits     the discussion lasted for about five hours it was quite worthwhile we should take appropriate steps internally now to consider the major points which emerged  june e a tobacco institute list of schedule of payments  excise tax oped project aprilmay  this lists those academic economists who have already planted their article on a local newspaper and the amount they are to be paid     they appear to have been paid  for each article and  if they had also made contact with their local congressman however a number of the cashforcomments network members still have not completed their commission     the george mason uni production staff of bob tollison bill shughart and gary anderson were paid for rewrites editing and research  articles and carol robert for the production of final product  a total of    expenses or  per article to make them into saleable propaganda for their local newspapers see     a month or so later the gmu production staff were also being paid  for rewrites editing and research on  additional articles while savarese seems to have been charging    in expenses for recruiting replacement economists in california montana new york ohio and tennessee  june  peter sparber at the tobacco institute memoes fred panzer his boss enclosing a number of congressional statementsdays after they were givenenclosed are statements prepared for various congressional hearings on the tax issue that specifically comment on earmarking to some degree     these statements are by henry butler of texas am william shughart and dwight lee of george mason submitted to ways  means june   bob tollison of george mason for the chafee subcommittee on september   randy rucker of north carolina state on the rose bill on july   and cm lindsay of clemson for hearings on the stark bill which never were held     ive asked jim savarese who provided these papers to begin working on copy that could serve as the text for multipurpose antiearmarking publications  dec  james savarese sends fred panzer at the tobacco institute a summary of the activities of his network of economists this is effectively a record of the first year of operations of the main cashforcomments economists network dear fred     i have attached a list of all the economists we have used along with the projects they have worked on in behalf of the tobacco institute there are now  names on the list some states have  or  not counting himself and bob tollison the details given for each consist of state regional division of the ti name address and telephone number added to this is a list of the projects they have completed in later lists also the names of congressmen they have contacted     virtually all of these cashforcomment academics have been generating oped articles for newspapers or have in some unspecified way opposed the packwood excise tax plan — or perhaps helped fake up one of the chase econometrics studies a few participants have attended congressional or government inquiries treasury i or local ordinance hearings as independent witnesses while secretly acting for the tobacco industry two of the  members ann harperfender and gary anderson were acting termporarily as advisors to ronald reagans advisory council on intergovernmental relations— which sought to bring pressure on the fda epa and osha and stop them being proactive with smoking bans     other participants have been promoting the industry line at various academic conferences and fora mainly as keynote speakers at economic society meetings  and a few of the coreteam were involved in brianstorming sessions with members of the tobacco industry looking for new angles for their pr and for possible research project which might generate some economic propaganda for the industry     many of them have joined in with the industrys orchestrated letterwriting campaigns opposing workplace smoking bans gsa  general government services administration ways  means  congressional committee on finances alec  american legislative exchange council a formalised way for big business to directly influence congressional and state politicians chase econometrics  a company that did economic impact studies for the tobacco industry in various locations to prove that smoking bans would destroy

tobacco institute this is the  list with the same comments and notes about lunch etc     panzar is now running an oped writing project which requires academic law professors to give it some credibility savareses attached bill shows that these academic lawyers price their writing at  per editorial less savareses cut  feb  jim savarese bob tollison and henry butler write to participants in advertising oped projectthe academic economists on the tollisonsavarese list we are finally ready to get this first oped project off the ground i am asking you to review the attached materials and write an editorial for a major newspaper in your state this article should support the basic right to advertise legal products and oppose attempts to restrict advertising either by outright bans or by punitive use of the tax code     obviously the point of this exercise is to support tobaccos right to advertise on basic constitutional grounds arguments which touch on issues such as censorship

period the auditor found that it was a oneemployee operation  savarese billed at a rate of  per hour or approximately  a year he only keeps rough accounts and has no contract with the tobacco institute he marks up the conveyed cost of all subcontracters by varying amounts up to  often the name of the subcontractor is not disclosed or their existence establishable  because of concerns that

suitable for public consumption lees paper the economics and politics of tax earmarking and wagners paper fiscal norms fiscal practice and tax earmarking     paul w wilson thomas e brocherding and

morris was totally loaded with tobaccofriendly scientists iaq i also like this one gray robertson is certainly key and larry holcomb could be good theodor sterling is quite possible although busy and located in canada he will probably not be in montreal for the meeting noted above     another possibility is an american with labour connections  jim savarese whom we used last year in stockholm frank

the rest dwight lee fred mcchesney and robert tollison each presented their papers dealing with aspects of the sessions theme and kevin grier and bruce yandle offered some interesting observations in discussing the papers     indeed one of bruce yandles comments was to the effect that the three papers together provided a quite coherent alternative body of analysis to the conventional literature on user fees all speakers and preselected discussants were members of the cashforcomments network  jan e tobacco institute draft plan for  with emphasis on taxes these are the economistrelated paragraphs objective to discourage reliance on consumer excise taxes on cigarettes to meet social and economic objectives by demonstrating that excise taxes are regressive and inconsistent with fair taxation goals and tactics commission two oped articles in  from consulting economists as articles are published provide to other institute decisions for promotion and submission to appropriate policy makers conduct at least  presentations by consulting economists on the excise tax issue before national regional and state tax policy conferences continue to utilize consulting economists for testimony and briefings expand appearances to include presentations to business clubs and the business press conduct media refresher courses for public speaking appearance and delivery of testimony utilize the consulting economists for an oped program that addresses the national earmarking issue and state specific earmarking issues as articles are published provide to other institute divisions and promote to appropriate public policymakers use field staff network to support distribution efforts  may  james savarese  associates is working with powell adams  rinehard writing to carol hrycaj at the tobacco institute about the  social cost plan savarese had now rejoined ogilvy  mather as a partner working with par     this new company is a washington dc subsidiary of ogilvy  mather this was a period when the publicrelations advertising agencies campaign management polling companies and mediamarketing firms were beginning to consolide into three very large global conglomerates om became part of the wpp group along with hill  knowlton bustonmarsteller j walter thompson and many other highly recognisable names in states where it is likely that the social cost argument will be used in the tax and budget debate we recommend the institute proactively commission and release statespecific studies combatting the social cost argument these studies can be used in legislative briefings conducted by the economists for example we recommend that a media tour program utilizing the social cost economists be implemented in geographic regions which produce the targeted commodity attempts also should be made to place stories and interviews with the economists in the targeted industries trade publications we recommend the institute commission research on what products and activities are considered to be overregulated and identify an appropriate spokesperson or organization to carry the government interventionoverregulation messages     this program could include a media tour program utilizing the spokesperson in targeted states program messages would center around the theme that the government increasingly is intervening in everyday life and personal lifestyle choices     because strategy iii reaches out to the general population we recommend that the economists media tours and targeted media activities also fall under this strategy commision economic consultants familiar with the social costą issue to review and maintain literature to conduct research to prepare articles legislative testimony letters to editors and oped pieces when possible utilize existing tax issue economists network conduct periodic meetings in central location continue to encourage social cost economists to submit abstracts of studies and make presentations at economic conferences including american economic association southern economic association western economic association and atlantic economic association coordinate with state activities economic consultant social cost briefings of economic and policy staffs of organizations such as american legislative exchange council national conference of state legislators council of state governments and national governors association encourage these groups to address the issue as a serious public policy concern seek publication and speakingseminar opportunities encourage economic consultants to conduct issue briefings with relevant staff of business organizations such as the business roundtable and local chambers of commerce  june  powell adams  rinehard is reporting to the tobacco institute quite independently of james savarese their april activity report says grassroots activities — agency drafted oped to be signed by aam american agriculture movement representative regarding excise tax increases in minnesota and forwarded to client for review and comment public affairs activities — agency continued to review clippings for     lettertotheeditor campaign that incorporates science advisory board messages — agency submitted drafts of letterstothe editor responding to newspaper columns on environmental tobacco smoke and submitted to client for review — agency drafted oped regarding its the law program and forwarded to client for review and comment ompar appear to have also taken over the media tours from fleishmanhillard  june  powell adams  rinehard with jim savarese and leslie dawson have a conference with brennan dawson martin gleason and carol hrycaj at the tobacco institute the comments and decisions made were the social cost activity has become more intense in past two year — it hasnt improved hrycaj stated that the institute currently battles the false social cost claims by promoting a series of white papers and books written by savarese  associates economists these materials are promoted through media tours and presentations featuring ti spokespeople and consulting economists hrycaj pointed out that the institute has sponsored eight pieces of social cost research since  all eight were submitted to reknowned scholarly journals and four have been published hrycaj added that the heart of the current program is the consulting economists who produce the studies get them published and promote them in academic circles savarese noted that the institute has sponsored five books on the social cost issue but no new social cost research has been commissioned in three years he noted that the research is essential to establish credibility for the social cost programs savarese said that the media tours and presentations have been successful and that the earlier research has been exploited hrycaj suggested that we concentrate on promoting each individual piece of research to hit individual target audiences starting with select papers moeller hrycaj and rinker suggested exploring the possibility of having the consulting economists conduct briefings before business groups and targeted legislators savarese recommended that the consulting economists be asked to identify speaking opportunities for themselves he also recommended pursuing a program with consulting economists based on the critique of hhs social cost model      dawson agreed with this strategy she recommended that consulting economists meet with influential national media outlets to explain weaknesses and flaws of hhs model savarese will prepare a proposal to attack government overregulation dawson recommended preparing and attempting to place an oped piece on government overregulation in major papers hrycaj recommended allowing dwight lee to identify opportunities to give social cost presentations before appropriate local level business organizations savarese and par will prepare a short proposal based on threetiered program consulting economist produces a white paper questioning hhs methodology major paper oped on white paper and consulting economists oped program based on white paper  july  about this time powell was dropped from the name of the company powell adams  rinehart and ogilvy was added it now became ogilvy adams ś rinehart with the same account  number its budget with the tobacco institute was  per year for the excise tax issue in           note that this was for just this one issue each budgeted separately note also that james savarese  associates also had a budget of  reserved for  down from  in  so they hadnt actually merged  apr  the newly merged ogilvy adams  rinehart organisation is bidding for the work of the coalition of companies fighting excise taxes which runs under the name coalition against regressive taxation and has million dollar budgets it spends most of the time promoting the value of tollison and jim miller and the economists network     it promotes savarese as director of the economist network jim works as a consultant with ogilvy adams  rinehart to represent corporations trade associations labor unions and state governments on economic and labor relations issues his corporate clients include the american iron and steel institute philip morris and the american bakers association     among his labor union clients are the international association of machinists the american federation of teachers and the united steel workers of america jim also directs the economist network — a nationwide network of university professors who write opeds and testify on economic issues it fails to mention his later claim to have been an economics professor at a university it gives the tobacco institute account as an example of their work and notes the overall strategy that oar implements is to involve various coalition partners and independent economists in persuading decisionmakers that excise taxes are an unreasonable burden on low and moderate income taxpayers and have a negative impact on the economy activities include arranging for prominent economists to testify at congressional and regional     treasury department hearings and state legislative sessions and write letters     to print outlets in key congressional districts arranging for prominent economists in targeted states and congressional     districts to submit opinion pieces opposing excise taxes in local papers conducted media tours with prominent economists resulting in favorable local     media coverage  oct   also  for excise issue p   may  bob robert tollison and jim savarese are jointly
