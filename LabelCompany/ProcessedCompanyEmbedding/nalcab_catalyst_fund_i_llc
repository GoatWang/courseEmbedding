determining influence on ones economic opportunity health and education the foreclosure crisis and ensuing recession badly damaged the promise of economic mobility for people of color and younger families the people who represent the future of our nations economy the pew research centers social and demographic trends project reported that median household wealth among hispanics fell from  in  to  in  a  drop driven by foreclosure and plummeting home values research from the federal reserve of st louis documents that younger families headed by someone younger than  lost significantly larger portions of their wealth in the recession than older families primarily due to mortgage debt and declining housing values the devastating impact of the recession on the balance sheets of workingclass families is now calcifying into a structural economic problem the pew research center reported in december  that even as the economic recovery has begun to mend asset prices not all households have benefited alike and wealth inequality has widened along racial and ethnic lines it is imperative for the health of the american economy to reverse these trends in communities of color and particularly among latinos our nations fastest growing demographic segment affordable housing that connects families to economic opportunity healthy environments and educational advancement is critical for addressing this challenge the reality of decreased public investment in affordable housing coupled with appreciating real estate values is making it increasingly difficult to develop affordable housing with less public investment private investments will play a greater role in financing affordable housing there is a pressing need to develop mechanisms that better connect private
