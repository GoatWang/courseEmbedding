the back of the eye fovista® antipdgf therapy fovista® is designed to target platelet derived growth factor pdgf in combination with antivegf drugs to disrupt the formation of abnormal new blood vessels in wet amd in clinical trials the combination of fovista® mg and an antivegf therapy demonstrated statistically significant superiority compared to antivegf monotherapy in terms of improvements in visual acuity providing a  comparative benefit from baseline fovista® binds to and inhibits pdgf expression causing the loss or stripping of pericytes leaving the endothelial cells unprotected and highly vulnerable to the effects of antivegf therapy clinical data have shown that administration of fovista® mg in combination with antivegf drugs is likely to inhibit new blood vessel growth in patients with wet amd more effectively than antivegf monotherapy and may also enhance neovascular regression fovista® clinical development   fovista® fact sheet zimura® – anticomplement zimura® targets complement factor c a central component of the complement cascade that is believed to be involved in the development of amd in a phase a clinical trial of zimura® wet amd patients who had not previously been treated with antivegf therapy and who received six injections of zimura® in combination with antivegf treatment showed improvements in vision of a magnitude warranting further evaluation in subsequent studies based on results of this trial data from a thirdparty clinical trial and multiple published studies suggesting that the complement pathway plays a significant role in dry amd we plan to initiate a phase  clinical trial investigating zimura® for treatment of geographic atrophy a severe form of dry amd affecting approximately  million patients worldwide zimura® clinical development aptamer technology both fovista® and zimura® are aptamers single strands of nucleic acid that bind with high specificity and affinity to targets such as pdgf similar to a monoclonal antibody aptamers are synthetically derived making their production predictable and reproducible they are also chemically stable and do not generate an immune response that
