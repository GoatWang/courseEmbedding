destefano of counsel for defendantsappellantsrespondents lipsitz green scime cambria llp buffalo john a collins of counsel for plaintiffrespondentappellant appeal and cross appeal from an order of the supreme court oswego county james w mccarthy j entered april   the order inter alia denied the motion of plaintiff for partial summary judgment pursuant to labor law §   it is hereby ordered that the order so appealed from is modified on the law by vacating the fifth ordering paragraph reinstating the sixth and seventh affirmative defenses denying plaintiffs motion for leave to amend the bill of particulars to include the violation of  nycrr  as a basis for the labor law §   claim and granting that part of defendants cross motion for summary judgment dismissing the labor law §   claim and as modified the order is affirmed without costs memorandum plaintiff commenced this labor law and commonlaw negligence action seeking damages for injuries he sustained when he fell from an elevated work site while working at premises owned by defendants defendants contracted with plaintiffs employer to replace a diffuser in defendants power plant at the time of the accident plaintiff was attempting to attach a clamp to the diffuser plaintiff was provided with a mechanical lift and a safety harness but he did not believe that he could reach the appropriate location with a mechanical lift plaintiff removed his harness and climbed out of the lift whereupon he fell approximately  to  feet to the ground there typically were drop lines above the work area to which plaintiff could attach his safety harness but in the area in which plaintiff was working the drop line had been removed plaintiff moved for partial summary judgment on liability under labor law §   and for leave to amend his bill of particulars to assert a violation of  nycrr  as a basis for his labor law §   claim defendants crossmoved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint defendants appeal and plaintiff crossappeals from an order denying plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment granting plaintiffs motion for leave to amend the bill of particulars granting that part of defendants cross motion with respect to the labor law §  claim and sua sponte dismissing defendants affirmative defenses that plaintiff was a recalcitrant worker and that his conduct was the sole proximate cause of his injuries we conclude that supreme court properly denied the motion and that part of the cross motion with respect to the labor law §   claim contrary to the parties contentions there are triable issues of fact whether plaintiff was provided with appropriate safety devices as contemplated by section   sistrunk v county of onondaga  add    see generally ortiz v varsity holdings llc  nyd    cherry v time warner inc  add    specifically the record contains conflicting evidence whether plaintiff could safely perform his work with the assistance of the mechanical lift and safety harness and whether a drop line should have been available for plaintiffs use we further conclude that summary judgment to either plaintiff or defendants on the issues of whether plaintiff was a recalcitrant worker or whether his conduct was the sole proximate cause of the accident is inappropriate because there is conflicting evidence in the record concerning the availability of appropriate safety equipment see generally miro v plaza constr corp  nyd    thome v benchmark main tr assoc llc  add    berrios v  ave of the ams llc  add    the nondelegable duty imposed upon the owner and general contractor under labor law §   is not met merely by providing safety instructions or by making other safety devices available but instead is met by furnishing placing and operating such devices so as to give a worker proper protection long v cellino  barnes pc  add    internal quotation marks omitted see auriemma v biltmore theatre llc  add    although plaintiff concedes that he was instructed to use a harness we conclude that defendants did not establish a recalcitrant worker defense merely by showing that plaintiff was instructed to avoid an unsafe practice akins v central ny regional mkt auth  add    see luna v zoological socy of buffalo inc  add    because plaintiff is not entitled to summary judgment on those issues we agree with defendants that the court erred in sua sponte dismissing their affirmative defenses asserting that plaintiff was a recalcitrant worker and that his conduct was the sole proximate cause of the accident we therefore modify the order accordingly contrary to the further contentions of defendants and plaintiff we conclude there is a triable issue of fact whether the work in which plaintiff was engaged when he was injured ie replacement of the diffuser came within the protection of labor law §   see generally kostyo v schmitt  behling llc  add    pakenham v westmere realty llc  add    we agree with defendants however that the court erred in granting plaintiffs motion for leave to amend the bill of particulars to include the violation of  nycrr  as a basis for the labor law §   claim inasmuch as that regulation is inapplicable to the facts of this case see generally dacunti v new york city school constr auth  add    because there is otherwise no basis for the alleged violation of section   we conclude that the court erred in denying that part of defendants cross motion with respect to that claim we therefore further modify the order accordingly section  which sets forth standards for safety belts harnesses tail lines and lifelines does not specify when such safety devices are required partridge v waterloo cent school dist  add    emphasis added see generally kwang ho kim v d  w shin realty corp  add    dacunti  add at  avendano v sazerac inc  add    finally we conclude that the court properly granted that part of defendants cross motion for summary judgment dismissing the labor law §  claim although plaintiff contends that his injury was caused by a defective condition of the premises plaintiffs account of the accident establishes that there was no dangerous condition on the premises which caused the accident but rather it was caused by the manner in which the work was undertaken lombardi v stout  nyd    see ortega v puccia  add    all concur except whalen j who dissents in part and votes to modify in accordance with the following memorandum whalen j dissenting in part i respectfully dissent in part because i cannot agree with the majoritys conclusion regarding plaintiffs labor law §   claim i otherwise agree with the remainder of the majoritys decision defendants contend and the majority agrees that supreme court erred in granting plaintiffs motion for leave to amend the bill of particulars to include the violation of  nycrr  as a basis for the labor law §   claim i disagree although the note of issue and certificate of readiness were filed prior to that motion plaintiffs reliance upon  nycrr  raises no new factual allegations or theories of liability and results in no discernible prejudice to defendants landon v austin  add    see ortega v everest realty llc  add    ellis v jmg inc  add    it is clear that  nycrr  is both applicable to the facts of this case and sufficiently specific to support the section   claim farmer v central hudson gas  elec corp  add    amended on rearg  add   lv denied  nyd   the majority concludes that section  is inapplicable to the facts of this case noting that it sets forth standards for safety belts harnesses tail lines and lifelines but  does not specify when such safety devices are required  that conclusion ignores that the record here establishes that there was a  tieoff rule when a worker was working six feet or more above the ground thus the when is established as anytime a worker was working six feet or more above the ground as plaintiff was here the majority also ignores evidence in the record that there were safety devices in the location of plaintiffs fall at some point during the job while plaintiff is not thereby entitled to summary judgment on the section   claim i conclude that the court properly
