pain serves a purpose and is considered protective and productive it alerts people suffering from a problem and reminds them to take it easy until it is healed chronic pain on the other hand no longer serves a productive or protective purpose and in fact may actually prevent the sufferer from functioning and healing as well as they could  chronic pain is a disease of its own in which pain grows in duration beyond  months andor in intensity disproportionately to or sometimes without a clear underlying cause when this happens the brain has learned to accept expect and generate the pain experience an example of this is phantom pain in which a person may feel explicit pain in a part of the body that is no longer there and should not be feeling anything let alone pain this same phenomenon happens in almost all types of chronic pain and is the reason that efforts to mask or dull the painful sensation are often unsuccessful trying to mask pain with a drug an injection physically manipulation or even surgical intervention often does not produce lasting relief while there may be some physical or mechanical factors which have or are contributing to pain to get durable lasting relief the brain must be restored back to a more normal healthy perception of pain   the radiant approach to treating chronic pain  radiant pain relief centres offer a unique and progressive treatment for chronic pain which helps retrain the brain and restore it back to a more normal healthy perception of pain  we have treated hundreds of patients with nearly every type of chronic pain imaginable on average our patients experience an  reduction in pain and more than  of our patients conclude therapy with a pain score of zero or near zero by combining a highly refined care model with a novel fdacleared device

our patients have been dealing with chronic pain for many months years or decades they have tried a variety of solutions but have not found satisfactory pain relief for many this has caused a sense of discouragement which can be as frustrating and difficult as the pain itself at radiant pain relief centres individuals find a team of caring compassionate staff that understands the difficulties of living in chronic pain through a highly refined patientcentered care model that combines skillful patient communication and application of sophisticated fdacleared scrambler therapy® patients can experience profound pain relief with lasting results radiant pain relief centres’ treatment does not use drugs needles or surgery but rather administers mild electrical impulses which replicate normal healthy nerve communications these impulses communicate with and retrain how the brain perceives the chronic pain messages the result is total or near total pain relief which becomes lasting through the principles of neuroplasticity in most cases significant pain relief is experienced in the first treatment session over a series of consecutive daily treatments for about  weeks patients experience total or near total pain relief with results lasting for  days on average periodic booster treatments are administered when necessary to maintain optimal ongoing relief contact us today to learn more

bioengineering research center in rome italy it was cleared by the fda in  under the term “scrambler therapy” and uses a new theory of pain management that addresses the way the brain receives and interprets chronic pain information rather that trying to suppress or dull the pain message by using artificial intelligence that mimics the body’s natural healthy pain signaling the technology replaces the chronic pain message with a no pain message to the brain through neuroplasticity the body learns and adopts this painfree messaging the result is significant or total pain relief for

 portland or i experienced the onset of muscle and nerve pain in my neck and back made worse by long hours working as a general dentist eventually my condition became so severe that i could no longer practice clinical dentistry it became extremely discouraging to spend a great deal of money and valuable time on treatments and doctor visits hoping to find something to alleviate the pain as a last resort several expensive surgical options were recommended with less than ideal success rates fortunately before i committed to surgery my family physician recommended a treatment offered at radiant pain relief centres i was cautiously optimistic after years of failed treatment but i was offered a free initial treatment to see if the type of pain i experienced could be treated with the radiant pain relief centres’ technology i loved the opportunity to try the treatment before investing additional time and money the process was actually relaxing and best of all i experienced  true pain relief before the end of my first free treatment my experience with the radiant’s treatment using scrambler therapy was unique in that i finally experienced successful sustained pain relief allowing me to return to my daytoday responsibilities this was a game changer for me i was able to avoid risky and expensive surgery narcotic painkillers and weeks of recovery from a costly surgical procedure without knowing the outcome it was an easy decision after experiencing a successful free treatment and one of the best decisions i’ve ever made my sincere praise for the lifechanging treatment option is given with complete confidence my only regret is that i didn’t have the opportunity to receive treatment five years ago but then i may not have appreciated how incredible a simple noninvasive treatment option could provide such profound success it was definitely an experience unlike any other the feeling of true  pain relief after years of chronic debilitating pain is unlike anything i’ve experienced and given me my life back a sincere thank you to the wonderful team at radiant pain relief centres   i was able to walk without hunching over and without … jami bishop  portland or i am a  year old mother and grandmother and i have worked for over  years with severe back pain due to a fall through a trap cellar door when i was a child in  the pain was overwhelming and i saw many doctors for help i tried physical therapy chiropractors injections prolotherapy a variety of pain medicines and pain patches i finally had my sacroilliac joint and ls both fused in  after the surgery the pain increased even worse and it became terribly painful to sit walking felt like there was a sledge hammer that was tapping my back with every step there was a knifelike pain in my spine that never ceased i could only make the pain bearable by lying down pain in my back and sacroilliac joint made it impossible to sit so i was essentially bedridden again i tried physical therapy pilates injections nerve ablation rhyzotomy acupuncture tens unit and i had a trial for the spinal cord stimulator the spinal cord stimulator did not mask my pain and the thought of another invasive procedure that could cause more nerve damage made that option too disagreeable i was so desperate i kept searching for something that could help with the pain i saw several different pain doctors and i heard more than once that i needed to accept the pain and that i would be disabled and dependent on opiates for the rest of my life i found out a little later that i had a fractured vertebrae and spondylolisthesis i had another fusion surgery to have that corrected and the pain after that was about the same although even worse when sitting finally i heard about radiant pain relief centre’s exclusive therapy and researched everything that i could online i couldn’t wait to try the therapy and in july i went to west linn or i had  treatments and the pain relief lasted i was able to walk without hunching over and without limping my pain level was almost zero when walking but sitting was still extremely painful this pain relief lasted  weeks but still i was able to walk and exercise for the first time in years to try everything with zero results and to finally try something that actually does reduce my pain has finally given me hope the facts that it is noninvasive and does not have any side effects is just amazing to me because all the medications i take and have tried have terrible terrible side effects i truly believe that with more treatments there will come a time i will be able to get off of opiate medication and get back to living my life   made my life more enjoyable dennis weehunt  aurora or i wanted to send you this testimonial on how good i am doing after having five treatments at your clinic i am  years old and have worked as a millwright for most of my life as a result of working with impact tools large wrenches and other tools my thumb joints on both hands have caused me to be in a great deal of pain pain was so bad that it would wake me up at night picking up my grandchildren or twisting off a bottle cap would send me to a pain level of  i had been told by doctors that i needed surgery on both of my thumbs the pain wasn’t so much in the joints as it was the surrounding area my first exposure to the radiant pain relief centres was not as a patient i had taken my uncle there for treatment for longterm shingles pain my uncle had been suffering with pain at a level between  and  for  years after a few treatments his pain level had dropped to a  level i had been asking a lot of questions about the treatment and one day the tech asked if i would like to be hooked up to the machine so i could better understand what my uncle was feeling at that time i had not told the tech how bad my thumbs were my left thumb was giving me the most pain so asked if she would hook it up to my left hand as she started the treatment on my uncle i was feeling what he felt as the machine ramped up i noticed my thumb pain was going away i started opening and closing my hand and then making a tight fist – my pain was gone at the end of my uncle’s treatment i told the tech how bad my hands were and what i felt during my uncle’s treatment she scheduled an appointment the next day for me it’s been   months now of being pain free on my right thumb at  months i had to have a booster treatment on the left thumb depending on what i am doing the left thumb gets sore at a  level but after a day’s rest it’s fine during the period of treatment on my thumbs i had a home accident where i lost  inch of a finger on my left hand i was having a lot of ghost pain swelling and stiffness while having treatment on my thumb my finger pain was gone i could almost close that finger into a fist the bandage needed to be changed every day so i would wait until my appointment to change the dressing i was able to accomplish this totally pain free when i went back to the hand doctor she was amazed at my flexibility healing and level of pain i want to thank you all at radiant pain relief centres for making my life more enjoyable and if you are wondering about my uncle’s
