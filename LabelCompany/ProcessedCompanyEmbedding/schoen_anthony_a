that it was safe and effective  by unanimous panel opinion issued feb   the court of appeals overruled the trial court’s certification of the class  the court of appeals held that individual proof would be necessary to show that merck had made fraudulent or negligent misrepresentations toward each class member through the marketing and sale of vioxx and that each putative class member’s

guterman karen davis citation k davis c schoen s guterman t shih s c schoenbaum and i weinbaum slowing the growth of us health care expenditures what are the options the commonwealth fund january  add to my library print × executive summaryus health care expenditures have risen rapidly in the last six years imposing increasing stress on families businesses and public budgets health spending is rising faster than the economy as a whole and faster than workers earnings in recent years insurance administrative overhead has been rising faster than other components of health spending while pharmaceutical spending has increased more rapidly than spending on other health care servicesthe us spends  percent of gross domestic product gdp on health care compared with  to  percent in most major industrialized nations the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms projects that growth in health spending will continue to outpace gdp over the next  years wide variations in cost and quality across the us underlie these national trends indicating opportunities to increase efficiencythis report reviews trends in us health care expenditures in the last  years examines variations in costs and considers explanations for high costs and fast growth in spending it then examines strategies that could achieve savings and slow spending growth and discusses their potential for improving overall health system performance from a public perspective the most desirable strategies to address high and rising health care costs would involve  eliminating duplicative or unnecessary care and reducing administrative overhead  preventing illnesses or complications and detecting conditions at an early stage  avoiding unneeded hospitalizations and  enhancing productivity and efficiency in the provision of care although there may come a time when the nation is compelled to make a tradeoff between spending on health care and other high priorities there is currently ample evidence that we can achieve savings and efficient payment insurance and care delivery systems and still improve health outcomes quality of care and access to carehealth care costs vary substantially across the united states for example the dartmouth atlas of health care shows that medicare outlays per beneficiary adjusted for area wage costs ranged from  in hawaii to  in new jersey in  yet studies find no systematic relationship between spending more and achieving longer lives or higher quality of care for medicare beneficiaries evidence of extensive variations in costs and quality and studies documenting provision of duplicative inappropriate and unnecessary care have led the institute of medicine iom and other experts to conclude that the us health care system could improve quality access and cost performance the iom defines efficiency as achieving the highest level of quality for a given level of resources whether comparing us performance to international benchmarks of high value or to benchmarks set within the us it is clear there are opportunities to improve the yield we reap given the resources we invest in health careonetime savings are likely to derive from approaches that address factors that contribute to current high levels of us expenditures inefficiency and waste these factors includeoveruse inappropriate or ineffective use of carepayment incentives that reward the delivery of more services without consideration to clinical value or costeffectivenessmarket power of insurers providers and the health industry including pharmaceutical companies device manufacturers and other suppliers to set prices above competitive market levelsa low ratio of primary to specialty care physicians and servicesaccess barriers to preventive and primary care that contribute to avoidable hospital admissions emergency department use and complications of chronic and acute diseasea lack of wellcoordinated care that leads to unsafe duplicative or conflicting careinadequate information systems and information exchange andhigh administrative costs including the high proportion of insurance premiums used to cover overhead costs the complexity of insurance benefit design and duplicative and uncoordinated requirements and administrative costs for providersthe principal factors that contribute to longterm trends in rising expenditures that might be amenable to policy change are somewhat different they includeintroduction of new technologiesinnovations without comparative information on clinical outcomes or costeffectiveness to guide decisions on adoption and usewages and prices of other hospitalpurchased goods and servicesgrowing market power and consolidation of insurers providers and the health industry including pharmaceutical companies device manufacturers and other suppliers contributing to less choice and higher prices andthe increasing prevalence of chronic diseasesboth strategies that achieve onetime savings as well as those that address cost trends could yield substantial cumulative gains over time a policy option that has the effect of achieving a onetime reduction in the level of health care spending by  percent in  would achieve cumulative savings over the eightyear period from  to  of  trillion a policy option that has the effect of lowering the average rate of increase in health care outlays by one percentage point a year would yield cumulative savings of  trillion over the same period in combination onetime changes in spending levels plus even small changes in projected rates of increase interact to produce even more substantial longterm yields figure es to achieve longterm gains in efficiency new policies will need to counteract factors contributing to high levels of spending poor quality and inefficient care as well as factors contributing to upward pressures on expenditures over time potential strategies to move the us to a higher value more efficient health care system cluster into six main areasincreasing the effectiveness of markets by improving access to information on the quality and costs of care promoting greater competition and developing better information on the costeffectiveness of health care technology and proceduresreducing high insurance administrative overhead and achieving more competitive pricesproviding payment incentives to promote efficient and effective carechanging the health care system to promote patientcentered primary careinvesting in infrastructure such as health information technology and information exchange systems andinvesting strategically to improve access affordability and equityeffective policy options should focus on changing total national expenditures rather than simply shifting costs from one payer source to another some policies may have a greater effect on federal budget outlays while others may affect outlays by state government employers or households achieving improved value for the national investment in health care requires policies that achieve net gains for the whole country at the national level the policies shouldbe amenable to federal policy actionimprove health outcomes quality access efficiency or equityhave a high likelihood of significant reduction in expenditure levels andor trends compared with current projections or achieve a net improvement in valuebe evidencebased and feasible to implement andbe reasonable first steps toward longerterm reformsat the federal level there are a range of legislative proposals that seek to improve efficiency and contain health expenditures legislative proposals which have been introduced in congress address four major areas simplifying standardizing and introducing negotiated pricing into medicare part d enhancing the utilization of health information technology and building a national interoperable technology system integrating valuebased purchasing into medicare payments and improving public access to information on the quality and price of medical servicesthere is a compelling need for a coherent public and private sector strategy with all parties working in concert toward agreedupon health system aims such a strategy should place high priority on policies and practices that have the potential to move our nation toward benchmark levels of performance on access quality and efficiency so that the us health system could achieve commensurate value for the significant resources it commands get updates that matter sign up to receive ealerts and newsletters on the health policy topics you care about most
