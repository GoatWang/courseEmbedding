international tobacco company philip morris international inc said tuesday it has filed an application with the us food and drug administration to market a new type of cigarette as potentially less harmful than conventional cigarettesif the product gets clearance henrico countybased altria group inc — parent of top us tobacco company philip morris usa — would have exclusive rights to sell it in the united states under a licensing agreement between the companiesinstead of burning tobacco the alternative smoking device — called iqos — electronically heats tobacco to produce a vaporphilip morris international claims the vapor has less than  percent of the harmful chemicals found in cigarette smoke but the fda will have to verify that claim as part of the agency’s review of the application which could take more than a yeartobacco companies cannot make healthrelated claims about their products in the us without fda authorizationunder a  federal law that gave the fda authority to regulate tobacco products companies can apply to the agency to market novel products as “modified risk” if they might be less hazardous to health the fda has not yet authorized any products as modified riskphilip morris international which has its operational headquarters in lausanne switzerland could sell the iqos product in the united states through altria without making health claims but it would still need to apply to the fda to do so and undergo a separate approval process from the modifiedrisk applicationphilip morris international was spun off as a separate company from altria group in  with altria retaining rights to the us market and philip morris international taking control of business in international marketssome analysts have speculated that the two companies might reunite given consolidation in the global tobacco industrygetting a green light to sell the iqos product in the united states could be a catalyst for the companies to merge tobacco industry analyst bonnie herzog of wells fargo securities wrote in a note to investors on tuesday“given the companies’ history together and close working relationship now on iqos we continue to believe a reunification of philip morris international and altria makes sense” herzog saidshe estimated that  to  percent of the us combustible cigarette market could be converted to iqos by  philip morris international said it expects the fda will take at least  days to complete an administrative review of the application then the agency could take a year to make a final decision on whether to authorize the product as modified riskphilip morris international already sells the iqos product without reduced harm claims in japan italy and switzerland and in some cities in the united kingdom germany denmark portugal

philip morris international product is flying off the shelves the tobacco giants strategy in emphasizing its reducedrisk portfolio is paying off dan caplinger tmfgalagan feb   at am philip morris international nysepm made its reputation by selling cigarettes but the company has recently done an aboutface with respect to its longterm strategy unlike its competitors philip morris has unequivocally embraced the idea that it will eventually stop selling traditional cigarettes instead moving to reducedrisk products that it argues have more favorable health effects and will more easily pass regulatory muster in its fullyear  financial report philip morris showed just how successful reducedrisk products have been with early results from its heatnotburn tobacco system looking extremely encouraging demand for iqos devices and the specially formulated heatsticks tobacco that the devices use has been extremely strong lets look more closely at how iqos helped philip morris over the past year and what lies ahead for the heatedtobacco product going forward image source philip morris international why philip morris international is so enthusiastic about iqos philip morris internationals attitude toward reducedrisk products stems largely from the potential it has already seen in the alternativeproducts market for  fullyear total revenue at philip morris climbed  on a currencyneutral basis and ceo andre calantzopoulos pointed to the strong performance of reducedrisk products notably heatsticks and iqos devices for the gains in particular philip morris brought in  million in net revenue from reducedrisk products although the profit margin on that revenue was fairly low calantzopoulos explained that the primary reason was that philip morris priced the iqos device itself at an introductory discount in order to encourage smokers to switch to the heatedtobacco system like a razorandblade model philip morris anticipates that margin will be more favorable with heatsticks and the company can also work on maximizing profit on the iqos systems once theyve gotten to be more readily available through national rollouts consumers have snapped up iqos aggressively and that has actually proven to be a bit of a problem for philip morris the company said that its heatsticks production volume reached  billion units reflecting its full manufacturing capacity for  the ceo noted that volume would have been much higher absent this capacity restriction which obliged us to limit iqos device sales in japan since june market share in japan hit  in late december with offtake share rising to an even higher  level image source philip morris international as the chart above shows japan has been the biggest success story for philip morris and iqos but its far from the only one in every market with a launch prior to the middle of  offtake volume rose at a compounded weekly rate of  which is similar to what japan showed early on indeed results in portugal italy and romania have been particularly encouraging and russia has also shown substantial promise as well how philip morris intends to grow iqos philip morris international is going to move full steam ahead with iqos as the premier product in its reducedrisk portfolio the company has already launched iqos in key cities within  different markets including  in the european union six in the eastern europemiddle eastafrica segment and japan new zealand and canada philip morris will expand its testing to go national in several of those markets and it also intends to add another  to  new countries to the mix in  moreover philip morris is moving aggressively to meet anticipated higher demand in  the company had a capacity to produce roughly  billion heatsticks by the end of  philip morris expects that number to have climbed to  billion with  billion units available for commercial sale during the year as calantzopoulos explained we look forward to unleashing the true potential of iqos once the pressure on heatsticks capacity eases a big change for philip morris after decades of success with traditional marlboro cigarettes philip morris is making a huge shift that shows how committed the company is to embracing the potential of reducedrisk products a lot will depend on whether iqos can continue to do as well as it has in early tests and get more smokers to switch from other manufacturers cigarette brands to the heatedtobacco product in the long run dan caplinger has no position in any stocks mentioned the motley fool has no position in any of the stocks mentioned
