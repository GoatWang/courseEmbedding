yearsprosthe industry is stableand the pay and benefits are adequate many benefits have been reduced since the merger with nstar such as pay for storm duty vacation buy and discounted employee stock purchase the people who work here are intelligent hardworking and want to do the right things for the customers and the company but due to the problems i described below its becoming nearly impossible to do thatconssince the merger with nstar the company is run more like a dictatorship than a democracy this has disenfranchised nearly everyone in the workforce in all positions all of the lineworkers electricians financial analysts engineers and low level managers can see how their knowledge and decision making skills are no longer valued by the ivory tower executives basic tasks like approving low  expenditures or filling a position for someone who has left the company are now delayed weeks and sometimes months simply because they require multiple signoffs and justifications from higher ups who just leave the request sitting in their inboxthe company has put a huge focus on safety and customer satisfaction which are both good things but safety is being compromised more than ever before because people are no longer comfortable questioning the decisions being made by upper management and according to recent jd power rankings customer satisfaction is also in the tank mostly because of high rates and questionable reliability during recent large scale storms i can assure you that most employees are not singing the praises of this company to their family and friends now eitheralso it doesnt leave a great impression on employees to see their benefits reduced while an article is published about the eversource ceo having one of the top  highest pensions in the countryadvice to managementreliquish control back to local management empower them to make decisions and you will empower the entire workforce in turn this could really be a good place to work for again communicate
