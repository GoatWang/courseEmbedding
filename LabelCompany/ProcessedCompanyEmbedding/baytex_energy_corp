page    at baytex we produce our heavy oil from vertical slant and horizontal wells using progressive cavity pumps capable of handling large volumes of heavy oil combined with gas water and sand initial production from these wells usually averages between  and  bbld of crude with gravities ranging from  to  degrees api once produced the oil is trucked or pipelined for delivery to a sales pipeline or rail loading facility pipeline sales prior to entering a sales pipeline the heavy crude oil is usually blended with lighthydrocarbon diluents such as condensate at this point the blended crude oil is sold by baytex to various purchasers and is delivered to markets in both canada and the united states via pipeline after reaching a refinery the blended crude oil is refined into petroleum products such as fuel oil lubricants and asphalt by the crude purchasers crude by rail baytex actively employs risk mitigation strategies to maximize the profitability of its heavy oil production beginning in  our historic practice of hedging through fixed forward pricing contracts and longterm physical supply contracts was augmented through a significant increase in rail transportation which allows us to deliver our heavy oil to higher netback markets and mitigate our exposure to pipeline access disruptions one particular advantage of transporting heavy crude oil via rail is that we are able to ship raw undiluted barrels which eliminates the need to purchase diluent the raw heavy barrels are sold by baytex at the rail loading facility to various purchasers and then delivered to markets in the united states after reaching a refinery the raw heavy barrels are refined into petroleum products such as fuel oil lubricants and asphalt by the crude purchasers

analysis for  reveals that with a slightly improved and stabilized oil price and given baytex’s exceptional leverage to the price of oil an  rally is reasonable from a valuation and historical price behavior standpoint in fact it isn’t unprecedented — between january th  and june th  baytex rallied nearly  compared to a  rally in wti conversely the stock is down nearly  yeartodate compared to  for wti over the past  months baytex is the th worst performer out of  canadian energy names the source of baytex’s leverage to oil prices the image above plots weekly baytex prices in canadian dollars against wti while the trendline only reveals a roughly  cent change in baytex’s price for every dollar in wti change baytex demonstrates massive variation in price for a given oil price depending generally on the direction oil is trending at the time the prices in the  per share range when wti was around  followed the oil rally in early  the most recent pricing is evident in the red dot at the bottom significantly below the trendline this is due to the general although choppy downtrend crude has been in since the start of  at oil prices of  per barrel baytex prices have ranged between  and nearly  per share a return of a general uptrend in oil would likely result in very positive baytex performance thanks to its strong leverage to oil prices baytex possesses product leverage due to its roughly  heavy oil production financial leverage near sector high debttocash flow levels and relative undervaluation these three factors mean when oil is doing poorly baytex leads the pack but the reverse will be true during rallies starting with financial leverage baytex current has a net debt of about  billion and on a debttocash flow basis using  oil prices of  per barrel baytex has a debttocash flow of  this compares to  for its peer group of junior and intermediate producers and only bellatrix bxe and pengrowth pgh come in with worse debt metrics the debt is largely due to a poorly timed acquisition of aurora oil and gas in  right before the oil price collapse baytex currently has annual interest payments equal to about  of cash flow and this large fairly fixed expense results in strong cash flow leverage to rising and falling oil prices this chart by td securities illustrates baytex’s cashflow sensitivity in a scenario of oil falling by  per barrel similar upside sensitivity exists this leverage is also due to the fact baytex produces about  heavy oil which gives it product leverage due to the heavy oil differential to wti this means assuming a relatively constant differential heavy oil weighted producers will see a greater percentage revenue growth for a set increase in wti than light oil weighted producers examining two  scenario’s for baytex  the effect on price in this example i am assuming wti averages  for  not an unreasonable forecast given outside opec the only material source of production growth globally is us shale which breaks even at around  i am assuming a usdcad exchange rate of  a western canadian selectwti differential of us per barrel and production of  boepd the production mix is equivalent to current levels and i assume minimal hedging lossesgains product realized price cdn total annual production in relevant units revenue cdn heavy oil    natural gas    ngl’s    light oil    total  billion sources adam mancini baytex energy corp financial disclosures if this price outlook comes to fruition baytex is undervalued now on an enterprise valuedebtadjusted cash flow basis evdacf this would put baytex at about x this compares to the company’s year average of x debtadjusted cash flow baytex’s peer group currently trades at x but would trade much higher in a  per barrel average year at  baytex would generate around  billion in revenue as demonstrated in the above table assuming  cash expenses including interest and inline with previous years baytex would see about  million in cash flow or  per share if baytex spends  million on capex the high end of this year’s capital budget baytex would see free cash flow of  million a move up to x  evdacf which would still leave baytex at a discount to its peer group since the peer group average would also rise would work out to a share price of cad this equates to a  return from july th prices of cad what about the downside if we assume oil averages  in  an exceptionally unlikely and worstcase circumstance barring a recession — us shale needs higher prices to satisfy demand growth baytex can expect cash flow of  million if the company wound down capex to  million which is their sustaining capex level this would leave an  million shortfall which would fall on baytex’s roughly cad million of available credit room  million of cash flow would give baytex a  evdacf of x if we assume baytex were to trade at x this would result is a share price of cad this may be too pessimistic however — in  baytex bottomed at  when oil was  per barrel baytex is without a doubt highly risky i am long and since this is a fundamentals trade i have no stop in place and am controlling risk by allocating only  of my portfolio for investors who believe  will see oil prices average at or above current levels the riskreward for baytex is worth the trade disclosure i amwe are long bte i wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions

fool answers contact us login search search can baytex energy corp weather another market downturn the canadian oil company isnt in the position where it can handle another plunge in oil prices matthew dilallo tmfmd jun   at pm after two challenging years baytex energy nysebte was decidedly more optimistic heading into  thats evident from its decision to boost capital spending nearly  this year which would enable the company to restart its drilling activities in its home country of canada and finally reverse its steady production decline that said the key to baytex energys optimism was a belief that oil would average more than  per barrel providing it with enough cash flow to finance its capex program so that it didnt drill itself any deeper into debt unfortunately rising oil output from baytex energy and its peers has put downward pressure on crude prices which recently tumbled below  per barrel its a concerning price point for baytex because the company isnt built to handle another market downturn because of that the company might need to pull back the reins on spending so its stock doesnt sink any further due to the weight of its debt image source getty images walking a tightrope when baytex energy released its  budget the company anticipated that it could generate enough cash flow at  oil to finance between  million canadian dollars and ca million  million million in capital spending which was enough capital to boost output  by years end the company has since ratcheted up that growth rate to  after reporting robust drilling results in the first quarter however the drillers betterthanexpected production rates on new wells are both a blessing and a curse because its contributing to the glut of oil on the market these days which has been putting pressure on oil prices that pricing pressure is a problem because at  oil baytex energy would consume nearly ca million  million more cash that it generates meaning it might need to borrow money so it can bridge the gap while the company does have more than ca million  million available under its credit facility it would be unwise for baytex to tack any more debt on its balance sheet thats because the oil company already has nearly ca billion  billion in debt outstanding which is way too much considering its just a ca billion  billion company in fact at its current run rate baytexs debttofunds from operations was nearly  times last quarter for perspective rival crescent point energy nysecpg only has ca billion  billion in debt and its an ca billion  billion company which is why it has a much more conservative  times leverage ratio because of that lower leverage crescent point energy has the resources to grow production at a faster pace this year the company currently expects to increase output  by years end which is a healthy growth rate for a company thats producing twice as much oil and gas as baytex energy furthermore the company can finance that growth and pay its dividend while living within cash flow at  oil add to the fact that crescent point has a cashrich balance sheet and it has plenty of cushion should oil run below that level image source getty images what this might mean for baytex energy baytex energy on the other hand doesnt have any breathing room because of that it might not have any choice but to cut back on capital spending thats a tactic it employed last year when oil prices sold off cutting its budget  below initial expectations in march and by another  in july in addition to that the company started shutting down older wells with weak economics to preserve cash flow while oil prices havent fallen low enough this year to require the shutin of wells it has dropped to the point where baytex needs to think about revising its capex budget with it potentially needing to narrow its range down closer to the ca million  million mark however cutting spending still wont address baytex energys troubled balance sheet while the company doesnt have any nearterm bond maturities its credit facility will mature in two years thats a concern because the company has already utilized a third of its capacity and is at risk of racking up more debt given its projected outspending at current oil prices its a situation that could cause the company problems down the road as this maturity date draws near which is why the driller should consider tackling the issue before it gets out of hand thats exactly what happened to fellow canadian producer pengrowth energy nysepgh which previously eschewed asset sales choosing to address its balance sheet woes by slashing spending and using that cash flow to pay down upcoming debt maturities however with the clock ticking away toward a doomsday deadline pengrowth energy started unloading assets in recent months to stay afloat those transactions have enabled pengrowth to reduce debt  since the end of last year buying it more time to replace existing debt with less restrictive borrowings so that it can start developing the second phase of its promising lindbergh project that said the company might have gotten more cash for its assets if it werent pressured by the clock to get deals done which is a lesson baytex energy needs to take to heart investor takeaway as things stand right now baytex energy cant handle another market downturn because the company has too much debt on its balance sheet to operate comfortably at current oil prices let alone even lower prices because of that baytex will likely need to slash spending given that prices have fallen below its breakeven meanwhile it should give serious thought to addressing its debt situation now by selling assets so that it doesnt face a potentially disastrous situation of having to unload assets into a collapsing oil market under a

peace river farming families have complained about tar and solventlike odours and emissions associated with heavycrude operations across the region after baytex energy began production the alberta energy regulator and energy minister ken hughes have publicly expressed concern about baytexs conduct and have emphasized that the impacts being caused by baytex are out of the ordinary minister ken hughes told cbc news the mar nd decision to put a moratorium on further drilling by baytex in the reno field was unprecedented what i could detect was that there was something in the air that was different than the rest of alberta hughes said this kind of development was experiencing different emissions and different air quality problems  the families who had all originally welcomed the energy projects onto their land report more than two years of health effects including severe headaches and dizziness sinus and other medical problems according to their lawyer keith wilson regulations have not been developed for the chops method of oil sands production being used by baytex that is why baytex is not technically violating any laws by open venting its bitumen processing tanks because emissions from these tanks are known to cause health effects and affect air quality other companies like penn west petroleum use fully closed vapour recovery systems baytex has chosen not to expend the money installing these systems on the  superheated oil sands processing tanks in the area despite reporting a record  rate of return on investment a return rate that baytex claims is one of the highest for any oil project in north america the alberta government has expressed serious concerns about what baytex is doing and has taken the unprecedented step of not only not allowing baytex any new well licences in the area and but has also convened a public inquiry yet baytex continues to produce in open vented tanks and several families remain out of their homes there are broader concerns about what baytexs actions may do to harm the reputation of albertas oil sands production at a time when the canadian government is trying to reassure its trading partners that oil sands are produced
