new products per year to expand our product line our next product launch is scheduled for early  international expansion the next phase of our growth includes expanding first into canada and then into europe kickstarting our move into the international cycling market requires an injection of capital customer acquisition a typical customers acquisition cost is about  of our revenue the goal is to increase volume with our suppliers and thereby lower production costs to help reduce this percentage recurring revenue we want to explore a bikeasaservice subscriptionbased model where customers can pay a monthly fee for access to an evelo bike repairs and theft protection lets change how we move around dear reader evelo is growing fast with over m in projected revenue this year and thousands of satisfied customers all over the united states weve grown more than  this year alone we have a strong dedicated team in place and an amazing community of customers and ambassadors all around the country were proud that we reached this point on a fairly bootstrapped budget my brother and cofounder and i started evelo  years ago with just our personal savings its grown into a multimillion dollar profitable company by focusing on the customer developing beautiful comfortable electric bikes and creating an innovative distribution model our customers can customize their perfect bike in minutes and have it delivered  assembled directly to their door however this is only the beginning our goal for evelo has always been to make biking more accessible to everyone by removing the common barriers that keep people from cycling whether those barriers are hills fitness levels age or even the simple inconvenience of arriving to a destination sweaty evelo bikes makes anything possible moreover we want to change the way that the traditional bicycle industry does business by removing layers of distributors sales reps and brickandmortar dealers our idea has always been to provide our customers with more value for every dollar they spend on the bike there is even more work to be done we truly believe that electric bikes are the future of personal transportation and want to make them mainstream in north america we are looking to release several new models next year begin international expansion starting with canada and introduce new ways to make owning an ebike even more affordable to accomplish these goals faster and make evelo a household brand we are collaborating with a small group of investors that believe in the potential of electric bikes and want to be a part of this growing movement now were opening up investment in evelo to all of those who share these goals in the past only wealthy investors and venture capitalists had the opportunity to buy stock in private companies like google and facebook before they went public that just changed the recent passage of the jobs act allows anyone to invest in private companies as such we invite you to take a look at our fundraising campaign sincerely boris mordkovich ceo show more meet the founders boris mordkovich ceo previously cofounded and sold two other companies upon starting evelo he biked  miles

after  years at harmonix music systems pj king cofounder at firefly space systems sean hanagan im a corporate immigration lawyer interested in start up crowdfunding opportunities michael napolitano more investors more investors details expand all can you take us back to the beginning how did you get started the idea actually resulted from a problem i saw in my own family my brother and his wife ride bikes together but it was difficult for her to keep up on the hills and to travel as far and as fast as my brother my brother built an electricassisted bike for her which solved the problem and their rides together became more frequent and enjoyable for them both talking about this one day we realized that a lot of other people would benefit from the same technology so we researched the issue and started the company with about  of our own money prior to founding evelo my brother and i started grew and eventually sold two other companies during the last decade from our initial investment we’ve grown evelo organically relying only on our own revenue and profits for the first  years the result is sales of about  million with  million in sales in just the last quarter alone who is your competition we have two different types of competitors  traditional bike companies eg trek specialized schwinn the one thing that makes traditional bike companies so strong is the same thing that makes their electric bike offerings and distribution so weak  their dealers are true cycling enthusiasts who frequently started their bike shop because of that passion the vast majority of traditional bike shops today however tend to think of electric bikes as a form of cheatingthis trickles down the entire supply chain a bike company may have only  or  electric bike models resulting in limited choice bike shop owners and staff are not thrilled about selling electricpowered products customers typically start their ebike research online rather than by going to a local storegiven all of this if you visit any traditional bike store and ask them about their electric bike distribution they will either have no interest or they will say that they tried but couldn’t really find a way to sell a meaningful number of ebikeseven with traditional bike companies not finding a viable market for electric bikes we still take steps to differentiate ourselves  laser focus on electric bikes and directtoconsumer distribution we only sell electric bikes making us the natural choice for customers looking for one based on our findings many people begin their research on electric bikes online rather than by going to a traditional store this allows us to capture their attention and trust first in terms of distribution traditional bike brands are inflexible given that they have to rely on an existing network of dealers as a result any bike sold directly at a brickandmortar dealer carries a markup of up to  over a directtoconsumer brand like ours this allows us to offer a lower price to the customer while maintaining a higher profit margin  electric bike companies eg pedego stromer faraday with competing electric bike companies we focus on the ways we can win over a customer  technology  although there is no such thing as a perfect bike for everyone certain technological features do make a bike more appealing to a wider population  automatic transmission  many of our customers are new to cycling so we focus on making our products incredibly easy to use with no learning curve for example many customers tell us that they dislike the traditional gearing mechanisms used on bikes consequently we have done away with traditional gearing by using the nuvinci harmony cvt instead this is basically an automatic transmission like we find in cars but designed for a bike changing the gears for the rider automatically httpwwwevelocomevelodifferencenuvinciharmonyautomatictransmission  middrive motor design  we also chose a different motor design than most other ebike companies they use traditional hub motors because they are cheaper and easier to source instead we offer a middrive option this offers a lot of advantages better climbing of the hills better range ability to use a smaller battery and still get great range and being able to take advantage of all of the gears on a bike httpwwwevelocomevelodifferenceadvantagesmiddrivemotorvshubmotor the use of a middrive motor combined with the nuvinci harmony is a major draw for many of our customers  omni wheel  in addition to a line of complete electric bikes we recently launched the new omni wheel httpomnievelocom by replacing the front wheel with the omni anyone can convert a traditional bike into an electric one in just  minutes no technical skills are required and it comes at a fraction of the price of a complete bike with the addition of the omni wheel we can meet the needs of virtually any customer at any price point  distribution  technology is only  of the equation even if we had the best bike tech out there if we cant sell it at the right price point to the right customer we would still be out of luck  directtoconsumer distribution model – selling directly to customers in an online marketplace lets us consistently price our products at  less than brands at brickandmortar stores while also offering a better overall product more power more range this allows us to scale faster and more efficiently such that with modest increases in team size we grow significantly due to the structure of our work  ambassador program – we counteract one big advantage that dealers at bike stores have with this program it connects existing evelo owners with potential customers for test rides our ambassadors existing owners make money every time they complete the test ride process as well as every time a test ride turns into a sale we are the only company in the industry where our customers can actually earn an income off their bike purchase  to the tune of  to  per year on average  subscription model – we are currently exploring a subscriptionbased offering that would also enable our customers to get a perfect electric bike for themselves for as low as  per month about the price of a monthly transit pass without sacrificing the quality or specs of the product how do you acquire customers we’ve worked hard to develop a core strength in digital marketing our team of  people is split fairly evenly between those from the traditional bike industry and those from the ecommerce space most of our marketing is oriented around search search engine optimization email marketing content marketing and social media we provide as much information on and through our website as we possibly can to both prospects and existing customers our ambassador program is the only major offline component of our customer acquisition approach the end result of all this is a typical acquisition cost of  or  on an average purchase of  could you tell us about your production process we currently work with two factories – one in china and the other in taiwan  each focused on different product lines we’ve built excellent relationships with them and team members periodically visit to provide inperson contact the completed bikes are shipped to our warehouseoffice in seattle by container ship orders are customized and shipped directly from our seattle warehouse and office via either ups or fedex to customers our partners are a key piece in our continuing growth in a capitalintensive business such as evelo’s with a goal of achieving economies of scale to slingshot even greater opportunities we need additional capital over the past couple of years we have finetuned our advertising efforts our logistics purchasing etc  learning what works what doesnt and how to keep costs down fast growth at this point depends on focusing on customer acquisition to increase our volume with our suppliers which will actually drive down production costs its winwin situation  more customers mean we can produce our product for less and we can sell it for less which in turn will attract more customers once we go from  million to about  million in sales we’ll start seeing significant drops in our production costs for those that are completely unfamiliar with your space can you talk about what the market looks like and where you see it going in the next  years one of the things we joke about internally is that an electric bike is the bestselling electric vehicle in the world that nobody in the us knows about although the global electric bike market involves  billion a year with  million electric bikes sold last year and a growth rate of  yearoveryear the market in the us lags behind the rest of the world some companies that started out  years before we did now reach sales of  to  million per year some impressive growth in the us market during the past year or so however makes this the perfect time for us to expand in the us interest in electric bikes is fuelled by three major trends the first is the search for alternative means of transport in growing urban centers where car ownership is expensive parking space limited and rushhour traffic leads to gridlock second electric transport in general is becoming mainstream for environmental and other reasons tesla’s entry into the electric vehicle field succeeded in bringing together technology that is acceptably priced of proven quality and visually attractive – paving the way for increased general interest in alternative transport as a whole the third trend is a growing emphasis on staying health fit and active with a large number of baby boomers now hitting retirement age staying active and fit may involve agerelated challenges that electric bikes help overcome over the next five years even as electric and hybrid cars become more the norm some people will still choose an electric bike for most travel especially as urban areas continue to develop more of a biking culture with increased use of dedicated bike lanes and trails zipping past rushhour traffic will still be appealing whether the cars in traffic are gas powered or electric and of course an electric bike still will help older riders keep fit and active something that is beyond the capabilities of an electric car lifestyle choices offered by electric bikes such as leisurely rides on trails and paths a secondary transportation device for rv owners and quickandeasy errandrunning will greatly expand in essence the presence of electric and hybrid cars in the market will be a catalyst for growing interest in other environmentfriendly options like electric bikes we see nothing but growth here in the us as well as some interesting opportunities in other areas of the world what’s next for your business and why are you raising money now up until now weve been bootstrapping with a goal of getting the fundamentals right we have succeeded in developing a directtoconsumer model in an industry that traditionally does not take that approach we have worked on bringing down our acquisition costs our rd costs and finetuned the ecommerce side of things although there is always more to learn were on the right track the next step is ramping up growth first by bringing new products to the market to that end we are involved in the internal development of a new product that will be for sale early in  we also plan to introduce new and recurring revenue streams starting with the bikeasaservice approach that i mentioned earlier options like theft protection or annual maintenance plans are a real opportunity to turn a  onetime bike purchase into a monthly subscription to additional service offerings at the same time we intend to venture outside of the us market beginning with expansion into canada next year with a similar market and geography expansion into canada carries limited risk and lets us finetune our distribution techniques by applying these same techniques to the much larger european market we will find a profitable niche there that features competitive pricing at  euros less than european pricing what’s been your largest challenge so far ironically enough our biggest challenge came from our major strength  offering a directtoconsumer model most of the packaging used in the bike industry isn’t designed to effectively protect the product when individual boxes are shipped to customers via costeffective shippers like fedex or ups at first we experienced significant damage on up to  of shipped bikes resulting from transit through various hubs or centers on its way to its destination as well as sometimes lessthanstellar treatment during the final trip to the customer’s door obviously this is a poor customer experience and is very costly to deal with even in cases where our damage claims were accepted by the shipper we needed another solution so we experimented with designing packaging that would survive and protect the bike no matter what ups or fedex could throw at it with that challenge solved shipping damage affects less than half a percent of orders fewer than  in  bikes this is an unusual fundraising strategy why have you given your customers the chance to invest online via wefunder we did a small friends and familyseed round last year and also emailed our customer base about our vision for the company we were blown away by the degree of interest – in fact two customers wound up investing around  but last year we had to turn away many potential investors because they were not accredited investors with the growth in our customer base and contacts this year we hope to gain real traction now that the barrier of accreditation has been removed having more of our customers have the opportunity to invest in evelo and expand our relationship with them is an important part of our vision of the company visàvis our customers can you tell us about the team why are you the ones to make this happen my brother and i have been involved in startups for the last  years or so prior to launching evelo i was employee number  in one of the first persontoperson car sharing dotcoms which was sort of a hybrid of airbnb and zipcar my main focus there was marketing and customer acquisition that company went on to raise over  million from dc including google ventures and then expanded nationwide it was an invaluable learning experience on how to scale a company within a new industry about half of our team has extensive experience with traditional bike companies including a former executive from a large bike brand and another who has worked with one of the largest electrical bike retail operations in north america our sales and service teams are comprised of individuals who have previous experience selling and servicing bikes and all have the knowledge and interest in the industry that is vital to our ongoing success but one thing that makes our team really special is that its the perfect hybrid of those with experience in the traditional bicycle industry and those with ecommerce skills and experience our marketing and logistics teams have much experience in online ecommerce in general covering everything from search engine optimization and online advertising through online marketing and social media as well as the logistics needed to make this kind of business a success this combination of skills in those involved at evelo creates a powerful synergy that has – and will continue  to fuel our growth in the coming years ask a question  startups have raised  on wefunder wefunder supports
