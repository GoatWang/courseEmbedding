power in  we have seen early signs of an economic recovery to build on this momentum we need to look hard at what the country requires and how we can contribute given that japan is the worlds largest creditor nation and has the worlds fastest aging population one area that requires attention is the creation of a new social framework at the same time we need to revise the structure of our financial system for japan to grow sustainably into the future the capital markets will have to play a more prominent role indeed japans approximately ¥ trillion in personal financial assets holds the key to the countrys future growth nomura aims to support this growth by facilitating the flow of funds throughout the economy connecting markets east  west asia is expected to account for half of the worlds gdp by  and will no doubt remain the growth engine of the global economy over the coming years however for the region to realize its full potential asian countries must finance the largescale infrastructure projects required to underpin economic growth japan can play a leading role here growing together with the rest of asia by putting its financial assets to work across the region with

strategy to become asias global investment banking hear how nomura impressed them their experiences as interns and graduates and the evolution of their roles and responsibilities since joining charmaine chong investment banking charmaine chong  investment banking singapore graduated in liberal arts with a focus in economics vassar college usa  for most liberal arts students investment banking may not seem like a natural career choice i was initially skeptical as well although an analyst position provides the fastpaced working environment with high expectations i was looking for i was concerned that my limited finance knowledge compared to students with a businessrelated degree would hold me back however as i went through the recruiting process i realized that investment banks are looking for more than just the right answers to technical questions – they also value the diversity in thought and depth of communication and interpersonal skills that liberal arts graduates can bring to the table while the first few weeks as an intern or analyst can be daunting especially for those without a finance background nomura has structured a training program that accelerates the learning curve with a comprehensive curriculum and warm and consistent mentoring to support one’s learning the only other necessity is a passion to improve and to deliver highquality work there were two things i was greatly appreciative of within days of joining nomura the strong team spirit and the willingness of my colleagues to consider all opinions and ideas even as an intern i was integrated immediately into and considered part of the team my responsibilities and contributions grew along with my capabilities regardless of my title having served in both capital markets and corporate finance sides of investment banking i’m grateful for the indepth exposure to a wide variety of financial products and companies across asia in my current role as an analyst in the corporate finance team i’m constantly juggling different deals with different clients deliverables and deadlines – what excites me especially is when the work my team produces benefits our clients’ growth strategies nomura continues to expand rapidly building on our significant momentum we continue to generate new business opportunities this is the place for graduates looking for a stimulating and intellectually challenging environment and who want to be an integral part of an exciting future × christopher read corporate infrastructure christopher read  finance bsc in banking finance  management loughborough university the opportunity to be given real work and responsibility from day one impressed me and was a key reason i applied to nomura as an intern in the fixed income product control team i was responsible for producing daily profit and loss statements which included reconciling various data feeds comparing desk estimates and communicating any discrepancies to the traders this gave me great exposure across the desk and with the traders as i became more confident and efficient i was given additional products and traders to cover nomura excels at providing real opportunities to interns and graduates in the current economic climate there are many challenges but also opportunities to get more involved i have increasingly been given more responsibility while some of my friends are still doing similar roles to when they started the graduate training included technical and soft skills sessions the soft skills delivering powerful presentations training was particularly valuable  our pitches were recorded and then replayed which was really helpful and informative my responsibilities have steadily grown since joining the rotational graduate program i have been heavily involved in several insightful pieces of analysis for senior management in cost management  analytics i developed an internal cost allocation process improved the content and insight of internal management information mi and worked on delivering several cost saving initiatives in the regulatory reporting team i have taken ownership of several key processes and reports and recently played a key project role in the delivery and reporting of the new crdiv liquidity coverage ratio lcr to the uk regulator pra my top tip for future interns is flexibility and networking you have to be flexible in your approach to work be ready to take on new projects and tasks that may be outside your remit be proactive and don’t be afraid to challenge the status quo × clarence nahan investment banking clarence nahan  investment banking london masters in management escp europe route to nomura i joined the full time program after being an intern for  months at lehman brothers since joining i have increasingly been exposed to the firm’s deal flow and i have worked on landmark transactions like the moncler €m ipo i have really been able to make an impact and take ownership of key work streams moreover since my arrival the team has expanded with the arrival of new analysts and interns allowing me to mentor them and share all the training that i had received as a junior banker over the past years i have also been more involved in nomura’s citizenship initiatives  volunteering at our partner secondary school as a visiting french teacher the equity capital markets team focuses on nomuras largest corporate clients as a team we provide advisory and execution capabilities on cashequityrelated products including ipos rights issues abbs strategic or financial stake divestment and a range of other strategic dialogues like stake building dividend policy and capital structure nomura gives you the chance to be part of a new story in investment banking we want candidates with the energy and the maturity to step up quickly you need to be bright full of energy and have a longterm view im very excited about my future here at nomura we are not bogged down with major reputational issues  instead were concentrating on building our franchise our move to our current landmark office in the city of london was a symbol of this commitment to europe i interview many of our graduates we look for people with strong analytical and interpersonal skills plus a keen interest in markets × elisabeth kilbane global markets elisabeth kilbane global markets new york majored in economics at the massachusetts institute of technology mit route to nomura the summer before my senior year of college i interned with nomura and at the end of the summer i received and accepted an offer of fulltime employment to prepare for my interview i read up on current events and the markets and i considered in advance the personal experiences that had led me to applying i also researched nomura itself so that i understood the firm’s role in the global finance landscape my advice is to stay calm during the interview you may be asked some technical questions that are difficult to prepare for ahead of time give the questions your best shot but dont let them overwhelm you or cloud the rest of your interview during my internship i was given the opportunity to work on projects with very senior people i was trusted to take responsibility for projects and expected to contribute in a meaningful way right from the start because of this there were high expectations for development throughout the program and i felt as though my mentors were pushing me towards goals in my product knowledge this challenging yet supportive environment proved to be an excellent learning experience and i learned more in my summer with nomura than i had in any previous internship having never worked in financial markets before i was very unsure of what to expect going into my summer internship i walked into training knowing only the basics of finance and i expected the experience to be overwhelming and highly competitive however i found my peers and mentors to be extremely helpful throughout my summer at nomura i believe the key to a successful internship is to express a genuine interest in the products interns should work to understand to the best of their ability the products of the desks they rotate through you can demonstrate your knowledge by showing real curiosity and asking intelligent questions while meeting a lot of people is of course important the value of this is increased tremendously by having high quality conversations and leaving a positive impression on those you meet × george robinson investment banking george robinson investment banking new york economics degree brigham young university nomura has several major strengths the first is its asian connection research analysts agree that a lot of investment will be coming out of asia in the next several years especially japan and given the difference in culture it is extremely helpful that nomura has the connections and the knowledge to know how to deal with asian buyers nomura is also a place where i will be given the opportunity to make real contributions and where i would have the best opportunity to learn and develop myself i prepared for interviews by studying the finance and accounting topics i knew were important in interviews and practiced how to answer interview questions well i also networked with professionals from nomura and learned about the firm and got tips from them about how to interview well at nomura in addition to these things i would also advise students who are about to apply for internships to regularly read the news specifically the wall street journal and be able to talk about important and trending topics a typical day for me as an intern in the industrials group would start just before am and if there wasn’t a deck that needed to be printed or some work finalized i would catch up on the news around  i would meet with members of the deal team and we would go over what we had done so far and what else was needed from that point until around pm i would work on some aspect of the deal or pitch this work varied greatly on one particular pitch i spent a great deal of time helping create the strategic positioning pages for a company the strategic buyer list with associated rationale and i helped build the model after lunch we would circle up again and discuss what changes we would want to make and how to better present what we had throughout the afternoon there could be various meetings that i would attend these could consist of sitting in on client or industry specialist calls or meeting with mentors or senior bankers at around pm most people would order dinner and eat together after dinner we would circle up again and figure out what our next steps were and from that point until sometime between pm and am we would work there are a lot of ebbs and flows in the work and this was a typical day when we were particularly busy preparing for an important pitch the people at nomura are some of the most downtoearth and nicest people i’ve had the fortune of working with given these things i’m very happy that i chose nomura and i couldn’t imagine now having made any other choice × ifiok ekwere investment banking ifiok ekwere  investment banking london joint honors bachelors degree in biology and management imperial college london what impressed me about nomura was the structure of the internship program from a nonfinance background i was keen to complete an internship in a bank where i would have the opportunity to learn as much as i could about the industry and to understand where my skill set would be best suited before the internship i thought i would be most suited to an equities role however rotating between equities and fixed income helped me realize my skill set and interests were much better suited to a role in fixed income as an intern my typical day started at around am i was responsible for summarizing key points in our trading meeting and updating the team i attended deskspecific meetings to organise the day’s tasks before the markets opened for trading after trading i would review the days trades with the settlement teams to ensure they had been booked correctly on the fx sales desk i also built an excel model that was used as a platform to structure sales strategies as an associate my typical day starts around am with a morning meeting call i then put together a summary of the news highlights from bloomberg relating to the companies that we manage in our loan portfolio during earnings season i will put together earnings summaries and circulate these to the relevant teams and people within the bank if there is a live deal being assessed by the desk there will often be a series of meetings with colleagues across the investment banking finance and risk management divisions to discuss and analyse the merits of the deal before it is sent to the necessary approval committees a highlight for me was the management buyout of iceland foods – it was the first deal i was responsible for from start to finish and it was a thrill to see it announced in the news upon completion as a graduate i have been involved in a number of wellknown emea  americas transactions i find the investment banking industry fascinating and am looking forward to gaining more experience and progressing at an even faster pace with my career over the next few years × jaap tanke global markets jaap tanke  global markets london masters in finance university of amsterdam route to nomura after i graduated i immediately joined the global markets summer internship program and at the end of the program i received an offer to join full time what initially impressed me about nomura was the open culture and how approachable the people were during my internship i rotated between the managed accounts desk in equities and the corporate equity derivatives team in the first rotation i assisted the team with small tasks as they were in the middle of launching a new fund in my second rotation i learned how to price different option structures with inhouse software researched specific stocks and contributed towards different slides of pitch book presentations the intern training was very helpful the bloomberg and thomson reuters training ensured i was up to speed to complete tasks while on the desk there were a lot of networking opportunities and we also contributed towards raising money for the charity rainbow trust by organizing different activities for employees to sponsor the interns the cross divisional activities ensured we met with fellow interns across the firm as a graduate i had immediate exposure to clients after completing my fca qualification the immediate exposure allowed me to build key relationships which have resulted in doing day to day business with some top accounts now my focus at the moment is to become a specialist in one specific product in order to eventually become the goto person for my clients in this product my top advice for an intern is to explore the firm sit with different desks and divisions as this will give you a very good overview of the different positions available at a global investment bank in addition try to add value on top of your main day to day tasks this will demonstrate that you are eager and a hard worker × joyce su global markets joyce su  global markets hong kong graduated with an ma in mathematics of finance columbia university  i returned to asia after working and studying in the us for a number of years what motivated me to join nomura when i moved back is its reputation  its the best bank in asia with a growing global reach the people here also influenced my decision from my first interview they gave me their time and expertise so that i could find the best role to match my skill set they wanted me to maximize my career potential as well as match me to an area that would benefit them  it was a twoway decision what sets nomura above other investment banks is the culture the rapidly expanding global operations are making us a leader in the industry and this momentum gives the bank an entrepreneurial feel its a place where smart people work together and encourage each other to develop their own creative ideas i am part of the prime services team financing and structuring hedge funds for our sales people and traders from day one i participated in so many aspects of the business and my manager was keen to get my input and opinion on our projects in fact he still is ive learnt never to be afraid of bringing ideas to the table because the managers here always give you the chance to excel if your ideas are good they will use them im looking forward to forging a successful career at nomura its a place where you can learn and absorb knowledge quickly and use it to move up to higher levels of responsibility if you have the right attitude and a passion for investment banking this is the place to be × sameer rahman global markets sameer rahman  global markets singapore graduated in mathematics university of new south wales mba in international business university of technology sydney i never doubted that i wanted to work in investment banking simply because the nature of the industry is such that it challenges you to push yourself to do the best you can joining this industry i knew i would be working with or competing against some of the brightest people around which motivates me to go the extra mile i was attracted to nomura because of its strong business culture positive team environment and most importantly the excellent opportunities afforded to young graduates such as myself we are growing at an incredible pace and it’s truly an exciting place to be if one looks at the footprint we already have in this industry and what we are striving to achieve from the beginning the  week graduate training program in london helped us strengthen our knowledge across different asset classes as well as forge meaningful relationships with our peers from the different offices across the world it gave us the base to settle in immediately once we joined our desk   i was trusted to cover clients and asked to come up with trade ideas very early on my manager was very encouraging and it gave me the confidence to learn and grow very quickly looking back on the past year and putting everything in perspective joining nomura was one of the best decisions i made  × sapna aeri corporate infrastructure sapna aeri  technology london bachelors computer science degree city university london route to nomura i took a third year industrial placement with lehman brothers which later resulted in a role at nomura i was impressed by nomura as it appeared to be constantly growing and adapting this meant i would be involved in new projects and new and evolving technology to cope with the greater global demand this was and still is an exciting prospect as an intern i gained vast exposure to the variety of roles i could pursue i attended networking events panel discussions and lunch  learn sessions the thought of working in an investment bank was initially quite intimidating however i was surprised at how freely i was able to interact with colleagues of varying seniority allowing me to build a strong network and experience a range of outlooks and perspectives the graduate training was really useful with a background in it i had limited understanding of banking so it was useful to gain a more detailed understanding we have had further product specific training and personal development sessions since then which is great for understanding how you are being perceived by others and how to present yourself in different situations every day you learn something new i could be holding discussions with the desk brokers or development team or discussing new ideas projects and enhancements to our current systems my responsibilities span from kicking off and looking after projects for the desk managing system upgrades and testing as well as ensuring trade flows are being handled correctly i am learning about option trading directly from the desk and the management of the trades through testing on our fx options platform as banking evolves and changes i have the opportunity to learn about the new technology on offer scope out new requirements and see the projects through from start to end since joining as a graduate i have progressed to the position of senior business analyst within fx options technology i have led the delivery of global high profile projects for both regulatory and business

university after studying economics at university i developed a passion for finance investment banking seemed like the perfect place for me to explore the industry further for me nomura was the best choice its famous in japan not only for being at the forefront of banking but also for its hardwork ethic and dynamic culture in my time here i have seen the fusing of traditional and new with nomuras acquisition of lehman brothers this has formed a culture that encourages new thinking based on strong foundations and that makes it a really interesting place to work as an execution trader i receive and execute orders from our london office for japanese stocks i can win money very quickly and lose it too which makes my job really exciting each time i succeed it makes me want more that is what drives me to come to work every day being in constant contact with my colleagues in london also makes me feel part of an international business not a japanese bank im not sure how many other places could offer that what makes nomura an exciting place to be right now is the change we are going through if you have ambition and drive you can use those talents to get involved in this change process grow the company and really boost your career × vincent li global markets vincent li  global markets hong kong global business in finance the hong kong university of science and technology  whats

starting point of my career i wanted a place that offered me the opportunity to grow and learn quickly nomura is a company that is rapidly expanding its footprint across the financial world and it matched well with my career objectives when i first started at nomura i had the chance to spend six months in london on the convertibles desk in sales trading and research which was a great experience when i came back to hong kong i moved over to the equity derivatives desk working with a team from the rest of the world my role is about generating crossregional trade ideas for our clients being able to produce profitable and unique ideas that no other investment bank offers in the market is a very satisfying feeling this is also the driving force behind waking up every morning

publish my ideas and let me deal with clients they were very trusting in my abilities which i really appreciated and this experience helped me to learn a lot quickly nomura is a great place for new

morning meeting from am to share information and have discussions on the stock price from the previous day we start calling clients from am with the information from the morning meeting it is always

structure and plan your preparation preparing for and being interviewed is similar to sitting an exam you won’t have time to cover everything instead you will need to identify the key points and focus on the relevant material firstly you should congratulate yourself in being selected for interview stage and have confidence in your ability then ask yourself the following questions what will the interviewers want to know an interview is not an opportunity to divulge everything you know instead you need to focus on what is relevant to the company and the position you’re applying for to identify what is most relevant you will need to fully understand the role it’s requirements and the key skills and competencies required how are you going to sell yourself what is your unique selling point ie what sets you apart from the competition how do you want the interviewers to remember you after the interview – what key points do you want them to recall how will you be assessed you can’t start your preparation until you know what you are preparing for read the interview format thoroughly to identify how you will be assessed ie interviews case study exercises and tests if you’re unsure – ask what are the core competencies required for the role your interview performance and ultimately if you are successful or not will be dependent on how you perform against core competencies identify what are the key competencies required for the role and for the company what examples do you have to demonstrate each competency have you considered examples outside academia ie sports music drama volunteering charity mentoring societies or other extracurricular activities what achievements are you most proud of and why – which competency do they demonstrate interview questions interviewers will use a variety of questions to assess your ability against each competency ensure you are familiar with each type of question and how to structure your answers accordingly types of interview questions may include competency based questions these require you to provide a real life example to explain how you behaved in a certain situation past behaviour is used as an indicator to assess potential future performance delivering a structured answer is crucial  research the star method to guide you top tip ensure your examples are varied and recent the more recent the past behaviour the greater the indication of future ability technical questions practice there are many online resources or books available with practice questions questions may include basic accounting valuation brain teasers and mental arithmetic top tip brain teasers – the key is not the answer it is the how you derive at the answer the interviewer is assessing your ability to formulate a logical and methodical response cv cover letter and application questions ensure you have thoroughly reread each document and identify any obvious questions top tip practice articulating your experience in a concise and structured manner out loud it doesn’t always sound the same as when you practice in your head industry related questions interviewers will assess your interest understanding and industry knowledge top tip form an opinion – digest the information you read and form your own judgment use facts and statistics to back up your conclusions research there are a number of readily available resources to help you prepare make sure you fully utilise all resources available to you these may include online resources company website press releases annual reports research publications social media and online forums school career services and recruitment events networks – academic staff alumni peers family and friends – even if they do not have a financial services background they can help

learning experience make sure you get something out of it close the interview – thank your interviewer for their time if you’ve enjoyed the experience and you look forward to hearing about the next steps – tell us after your interview be responsive following the interview go back to your recruiter and continue to build a relationship if you are offered a position it is unprofessional to renege
