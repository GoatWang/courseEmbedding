hi    for a picturesque north shore setting you simply cannot ask for more than dillingham ranch the grounds  the home are absolutely stunning  can be used in a variety of different ways we looked at many many locations before finally deciding to bit the bullet  pay the very large price tag for this location they did work with us on the price for some trade but in general for most brides this is a high end location  the price tag matches it pros absolutely stunning from the gorgeous grove of palm trees on the drive up to the ranch to the classic breathtaking ranch home with big white pillars on the wraparound porch to the hardwood floors beautiful furniture fireplace the row of royal palms in the back banyan trees a pond peacocks roaming the grass beautifully appointed rooms including a bridal suite  all with incredible outdoor showers beautiful lighting fixtures a worldclass kitchen outdoor furniture  stateoftheart sound system fairly professional management who communicated very well  handled our contracts deposits  all other issues well consfor the incredibly expensive price i was surprised about a few things  there are no tables or chairs to use  you have to bring all of that in even your own toilet paper for a venue that specializes in weddings i think they could easily purchase tables and chairs to keep on property that would absolutely save the bride  groom from having to have all that delivered we used royal party supply who did a good job  but had to pay a delivery fee of course  the water in the worldclass kitchen is not potable you have to bring in all your own water we had an amazing caterer lan thai of happys green hawaii who did that for us at no charge  but having a gourmet kitchen doesnt do you much good if you cant drink the water since most

get to use the rooms at the ranch for you or your guests to stay in unless you pay  per room this seems silly to me because those rooms just sit there empty until the wedding day  and after the

this they do not want dancing in there particularly if anyone is wearing high heels we were incredibly adamant with our guests that they not wear high heels since the ceremony was all out on the grass anyway and we just didnt want any issues with the floors  our deposit however when we asked about rearranging the furniture a little bit to create a different flow for our event we were told that we couldnt move it and they would have to do it so it doesnt ruin the floors understandable  but then the management told us they would charge us  to move the furniture ugh it was moments like this that felt a little bit moneygrubbing to us but of course this is a business  they dont take credit cards this one was a shocker to not be able to put that large of an amount on our credit card and get the

also received a notice that the ranch was up for sale  that it was possible it would be sold before our event  although the ranch manager was very nice when i called her about this  explained it in a way that calmed my nerves thankfully so  its a lot of things to consider however  i will say this on our wedding day things went very smoothly the managers were very helpful we even invited them down to have a drink  some food the place looked absolutely pristine our guests were blown away by the grounds  the photos are absolutely gorgeous we particularly loved taking photos with the horses being allowed to have our dog there on leash for the ceremony  having access to the bedrooms so that we could have a grooms suite  a bridal suite  our guests had places to change  shower in all honesty  the outdoor showers in every bedroom alone were almost worth the entire price our guests used them after the luncheon to change  get ready for the bollywood reception that evening  every single person including our photographer  dj etc who used the showers just came out glowing and made sure to tell us how much they enjoyed the showers  i kid you not as a bride  showering in the outdoor shower and getting my makeup  hair done in the beautiful bridal suite   seeing my friends  family in that stunning location  was incredibly dreamy worth it for us yes it was we worked with malia to secure the

far awayjust about the end of the road so make sure that you have a transport plan for your people who indulge in libations  if not for the price and the stress i would give this place a  star rating

  farrington hwywaialua hi    for a picturesque north shore setting you simply cannot ask for more than dillingham ranch the grounds  the home are absolutely stunning  can be used in a variety of different ways we looked at many many locations before finally deciding to bit the bullet  pay the very large price tag for this location they did work with us on the price for some trade but in general for most brides this is a high end location  the price tag matches it pros absolutely stunning from the gorgeous grove of palm trees on the drive up to the ranch to the classic breathtaking ranch home with big white pillars on the wraparound porch to the hardwood floors beautiful furniture fireplace the row of royal palms in the back banyan trees a pond peacocks roaming the grass beautifully appointed rooms including a bridal suite  all with incredible outdoor showers beautiful lighting fixtures a worldclass kitchen outdoor furniture  stateoftheart sound system fairly professional management who communicated very well  handled our contracts deposits  all other issues well consfor the incredibly expensive price i was surprised about a few things  there are no tables or chairs to use  you have to bring all of that in even your own toilet paper for a venue that specializes in weddings i think they could easily purchase tables and chairs to keep on property that would absolutely save the bride  groom from having to have all that delivered we used royal party supply who did a good job  but had to pay a delivery fee of course  the water in the worldclass kitchen is not potable you have to bring in all your own water we had an amazing caterer lan thai of happys green hawaii who did that for us at no charge  but having a gourmet kitchen doesnt do you much good if you cant drink the water since most caterers arrive prepared to cook on their own equipment  dont need the massive kitchen really  even though you have the place for the full day  setup the day before  take down the day after you do not get to use the rooms at the ranch for you or your guests to stay in unless you pay  per room this seems silly to me because those rooms just sit there empty until the wedding day  and after the wedding they clean them all anyway so i agree with the previous reviewer that that should be included in the cost  the floors inside the great room are beautiful new hardwood floors  but because of this they do not want dancing in there particularly if anyone is wearing high heels we were incredibly adamant with our guests that they not wear high heels since the ceremony was all out on the grass anyway and we just didnt want any issues with the floors  our deposit however when we asked about rearranging the furniture a little bit to create a different flow for our event we were told that we couldnt move it and they would have to do it so it doesnt ruin the floors understandable  but then the management told us they would charge us  to move the furniture ugh it was moments like this that felt a little bit moneygrubbing to us but of course this is a business  they dont take credit cards this one was a shocker to not be able to put that large of an amount on our credit card and get the miles  points was absolutely frustrating to both of us i dont know why they cant do it  but we had to pay the entire thing with checks it was very irritating in agreement with the previous poster we also received a notice that the ranch was up for sale  that it was possible it would be sold before our event  although the ranch manager was very nice when i called her about this  explained it in a way that calmed my nerves thankfully so  its a lot of things to consider however  i will say this on our wedding day things went very smoothly the managers were very helpful we even invited them down to have a drink  some food the place looked absolutely pristine our guests were blown away by the grounds  the photos are absolutely gorgeous we particularly loved taking photos with the horses being allowed to have our dog there on leash for the ceremony  having access to the bedrooms so that we could have a grooms suite  a bridal suite  our guests had places to change  shower in all honesty  the outdoor showers in every bedroom alone were almost worth the entire price our guests used them after the luncheon to change  get ready for the bollywood reception that evening  every single person including our photographer  dj etc who used the showers just came out glowing and made sure to tell us how much they enjoyed the showers  i kid you not as a bride  showering in the outdoor shower and getting my makeup  hair done in the beautiful bridal suite   seeing my friends  family in that stunning location  was incredibly dreamy worth it for us yes it was we worked with malia to secure the estate for our wedding it was really expensive but you get the day before and the day after for setup and cleanup which helped it is newly remodeledand beautiful there is a stateoftheart kitchen that was brand spanking new we did our ceremony in the front lawn the aisle was the cemented pathway down the center the cocktail hour was held int he same area with the grand rooom open then the reception was on the back side of the house up until the row of palm trees leading to the mountains it was quite and free of light polution luckily we had a clear night which played a huge part our guests were stunned with the stars that led them home the water is not city water so they say it is not potable there are rooms that you can rent which i think is unreasonable and should be included in the huge price tag on the location each room has its own outdoor shower and bathroom as with most wedding venues there is stressother than the money strain eating our budgeta few weeks before the wedding we got a notice in the mail that dillingham ranch is up for sale and that if it sells before our wedding they will recommend that the new owners let us use the location but cannot guarantee it insert mini bridal freakout here things worked out but i would caution anyone interested in this location to make sure that ownership is stable or ahve a really good plan b also keep in mind that it is far far awayjust about the end of the road so make sure that you have a transport plan for your people who indulge in libations  if not for the price and the stress i would give this place a  star rating for its beauty and ease of planning i have to say that the ranch was a good choice to have the warrior dash  it was open spaced and had lots of parking only thing was we were on the field and there are loads of crap all over the place the event was fun and im hoping they return next year the ranch had plenty of space for us to run and park too the redfrogevents people knew what they were doing and everything was organized really well i cant wait to do the run again next year dillingham ranch aina llc claimed this business has been

  farrington hwywaialua hi    for a picturesque north shore setting you simply cannot ask for more than dillingham ranch the grounds  the home are absolutely stunning  can be used in a variety of different ways we looked at many many locations before finally deciding to bit the bullet  pay the very large price tag for this location they did work with us on the price for some trade but in general for most brides this is a high end location  the price tag matches it pros absolutely stunning from the gorgeous grove of palm trees on the drive up to the ranch to the classic breathtaking ranch home with big white pillars on the wraparound porch to the hardwood floors beautiful furniture fireplace the row of royal palms in the back banyan trees a pond peacocks roaming the grass beautifully appointed rooms including a bridal suite  all with incredible outdoor showers beautiful lighting fixtures a worldclass kitchen outdoor furniture  stateoftheart sound system fairly professional management who communicated very well  handled our contracts deposits  all other issues well consfor the incredibly expensive price i was surprised about a few things  there are no tables or chairs to use  you have to bring all of that in even your own toilet paper for a venue that specializes in weddings i think they could easily purchase tables and chairs to keep on property that would absolutely save the bride  groom from having to have all that delivered we used royal party supply who did a good job  but had to pay a delivery fee of course  the water in the worldclass kitchen is not potable you have to bring in all your own water we had an amazing caterer lan thai of happys green hawaii who did that for us at no charge  but having a gourmet kitchen doesnt do you much good if you cant drink the water since most caterers arrive prepared to cook on their own equipment  dont need the massive kitchen really  even though you have the place for the full day  setup the day before  take down the day after you do not get to use the rooms at the ranch for you or your guests to stay in unless you pay  per room this seems silly to me because those rooms just sit there empty until the wedding day  and after the wedding they clean them all anyway so i agree with the previous reviewer that that should be included in the cost  the floors inside the great room are beautiful new hardwood floors  but because of this they do not want dancing in there particularly if anyone is wearing high heels we were incredibly adamant with our guests that they not wear high heels since the ceremony was all out on the grass anyway and we just didnt want any issues with the floors  our deposit however when we asked about rearranging the furniture a little bit to create a different flow for our event we were told that we couldnt move it and they would have to do it so it doesnt ruin the floors understandable  but then the management told us they would charge us  to move the furniture ugh it was moments like this that felt a little bit moneygrubbing to us but of course this is a business  they dont take credit cards this one was a shocker to not be able to put that large of an amount on our credit card and get the miles  points was absolutely frustrating to both of us i dont know why they cant do it  but we had to pay the entire thing with checks it was very irritating in agreement with the previous poster we also received a notice that the ranch was up for sale  that it was possible it would be sold before our event  although the ranch manager was very nice when i called her about this  explained it in a way that calmed my nerves thankfully so  its a lot of things to consider however  i will say this on our wedding day things went very smoothly the managers were very helpful we even invited them down to have a drink  some food the place looked absolutely pristine our guests were blown away by the grounds  the photos are absolutely gorgeous we particularly loved taking photos with the horses being allowed to have our dog there on leash for the ceremony  having access to the bedrooms so that we could have a grooms suite  a bridal suite  our guests had places to change  shower in all honesty  the outdoor showers in every bedroom alone were almost worth the entire price our guests used them after the luncheon to change  get ready for the bollywood reception that evening  every single person including our photographer  dj etc who used the showers just came out glowing and made sure to tell us how much they enjoyed the showers  i kid you not as a bride  showering in the outdoor shower and getting my makeup  hair done in the beautiful bridal suite   seeing my friends  family in that stunning location  was incredibly dreamy worth it for us yes it was we worked with malia to secure the estate for our wedding it was really expensive but you get the day before and the day after for setup and cleanup which helped it is newly remodeledand beautiful there is a stateoftheart kitchen that was brand spanking new we did our ceremony in the front lawn the aisle was the cemented pathway down the center the cocktail hour was held int he same area with the grand rooom open then the reception was on the back side of the house up until the row of palm trees leading to the mountains it was quite and free of light polution luckily we had a clear night which played a huge part our guests were stunned with the stars that led them home the water is not city water so they say it is not potable there are rooms that you can rent which i think is unreasonable and should be included in the huge price tag on the location each room has its own outdoor shower and bathroom as with most wedding venues there is stressother than the money strain eating our budgeta few weeks before the wedding we got a notice in the mail that dillingham ranch is up for sale and that if it sells before our wedding they will recommend that the new owners let us use the location but cannot guarantee it insert mini bridal freakout here things worked out but i would caution anyone interested in this location to make sure that ownership is stable or ahve a really good plan b also keep in mind that it is far far awayjust about the end of the road so make sure that you have a transport plan for your people who indulge in libations  if not for the price and the stress i would give this place a  star rating for its beauty and ease of planning i have to say that the ranch was a good choice to have the warrior dash  it was open spaced and had lots of parking only thing was we were on the field and there are loads of crap all over the place the event was fun and im hoping they return next year the ranch had plenty of space for us to run and park too the redfrogevents people knew what they were doing and everything was organized really well i cant wait to do the run again next year dillingham ranch aina llc claimed this business has been

simply cannot ask for more than dillingham ranch  the grounds  the home are absolutely stunning  can be used in a variety of different ways  we looked at many many locations before finally deciding to bit the bullet  pay the very large price tag for this location   they did work with us on the price for some trade but in general for most brides this is a high end location  the price tag matches it prosabsolutely stunning  from the gorgeous grove of palm trees on the drive up to the ranch to the classic breathtaking ranch home with big white pillars on the wraparound porch to the hardwood floors beautiful furniture fireplace the row of royal palms in the back banyan trees a pond peacocks roaming the grass beautifully appointed rooms including a bridal suite   all with incredible outdoor showers beautiful lighting fixtures a worldclass kitchen outdoor furniture  stateoftheart sound systemfairly professional management who communicated very well  handled our contracts deposits  all other issues well consfor the incredibly expensive price i was surprised about a few things there are no tables or chairs to use  you have to bring all of that in even your own toilet paper   for a venue that specializes in weddings i think they could easily purchase tables and chairs to keep on property that would absolutely save the bride  groom from having to have all that delivered  we used royal party supply who did a good job  but had to pay a delivery fee of course the water in the worldclass kitchen is not potable   you have to bring in all your own water  we had an amazing caterer lan thai of happys green hawaii who did that for us at no charge  but having a gourmet kitchen doesnt do you much good if you cant drink the water since most caterers arrive prepared to cook on their own equipment  dont need the massive kitchen really even though you have the place for the full day  setup the day before  take down the day after you do not get to use the rooms at the ranch for you or your guests to stay in unless you pay  per room   this seems silly to me because those rooms just sit there empty until the wedding day  and after the wedding they clean them all anyway so i agree with the previous reviewer that that should be included in the cost    the floors inside the great room are beautiful new hardwood floors  but because of this they do not want dancing in there particularly if anyone is wearing high heels  we were incredibly adamant with our guests that they not wear high heels since the ceremony was all out on the grass anyway and we just didnt want any issues with the floors  our deposit     however when we asked about rearranging the furniture a little bit to create a different flow for our event we were told that we couldnt move it and they would have to do it so it doesnt ruin the floors  understandable  but then the management told us they would charge us  to move the furniture   ugh it was moments like this that felt a little bit moneygrubbing to us but of course this is a business  they dont take credit cards this one was a shocker   to not be able to put that large of an amount on our credit card and get the miles  points was absolutely frustrating to both of us  i dont know why they cant do it  but we had to pay the entire thing with checks   it was very irritating  in agreement with the previous poster we also received a notice that the ranch was up for sale  that it was possible it would be sold before our event  although the ranch manager was very nice when i called her about this  explained it in a way that calmed my nerves thankfully  so  its a lot of things to consider however  i will say this  on our wedding day things went very smoothly  the managers were very helpful we even invited them down to have a drink  some food the place looked absolutely pristine  our guests were blown away by the grounds  the photos are absolutely gorgeous   we particularly loved taking photos with the horses being allowed to have our dog there on leash for the ceremony  having access to the bedrooms so that we could have a grooms suite  a bridal suite  our guests had places to change  shower  in all honesty  the outdoor showers in every bedroom alone were almost worth the entire price our guests used them after the luncheon to change  get ready for the bollywood reception that evening  every single person including our photographer  dj etc who used the showers just came out glowing and made sure to tell us how much they enjoyed the showers  i kid you not    as a bride  showering in the

potable there are rooms that you can rent which i think is unreasonable and should be included in the huge price tag on the location each room has its own outdoor shower and bathroom as with most wedding venues there is stressother than the money strain eating our budgeta few weeks before the wedding we got a notice in the mail that dillingham ranch is up for sale and that if it sells before our wedding they will recommend that the new owners let us use the location but cannot guarantee it insert mini bridal freakout here things worked out but i would caution anyone interested in this location to make sure that ownership is stable or ahve a really good plan b also keep in mind that it is far far awayjust about the end of the road so make sure that you have a transport plan for your people who indulge in libations  if not for the price and the stress i would give this place a  star rating for its beauty and ease of planning for a picturesque north shore setting you simply cannot ask for more than dillingham ranch the grounds  the home are absolutely stunning  can be used in a variety of different ways we looked at many many locations before finally deciding to bit the bullet  pay the very large price tag for this location they did work with us on the price for some trade but in general for most brides this is a high end location  the price tag matches it pros absolutely stunning from the gorgeous grove of palm trees on the drive up to the ranch to the classic breathtaking ranch home with big white pillars on the wraparound porch to the hardwood floors beautiful furniture fireplace the row of royal palms in the back banyan trees a pond peacocks roaming the grass beautifully appointed rooms including a bridal suite  all with incredible outdoor showers beautiful lighting fixtures a worldclass kitchen outdoor furniture  stateoftheart sound system fairly professional management who communicated very well  handled our contracts deposits  all other issues well consfor the incredibly expensive price i was surprised about a few things  there are no tables or chairs to use  you have to bring all of that in even your own toilet paper for a venue that specializes in weddings i think they could easily purchase tables and chairs to keep on property that would absolutely save the bride  groom from having to have all that delivered we used royal party supply who did a good job  but had to pay a delivery fee of course  the water in the worldclass kitchen is not potable you have to bring in all your own water we had an amazing caterer lan thai of happys green hawaii who did that for us at no charge  but having a gourmet kitchen doesnt do you much good if you cant drink the water since most caterers arrive prepared to cook on their own equipment  dont need the massive kitchen really  even though you have the place for the full day  setup the day before  take down the day after you do not get to use the rooms at the ranch for you or your guests to stay in unless you pay  per room this seems silly to me because those rooms just sit there empty until the wedding day  and after the wedding they clean them all anyway so i agree with the previous reviewer that that should be included in the cost  the floors inside the great room are beautiful new hardwood floors  but because of this they do not want dancing in there particularly if anyone is wearing high heels we were incredibly adamant with our guests that they not wear high heels since the ceremony was all out on the grass anyway and we just didnt want any issues with the floors  our deposit however when we asked about rearranging the furniture a little bit to create a different flow for our event we were told that we couldnt move it and they would have to do it so it doesnt ruin the floors understandable  but then the management told us they would charge us  to move the furniture ugh it was moments like this that felt a little bit moneygrubbing to us but of course this is a business  they dont take credit cards this one was a shocker to not be able to put that large of an amount on our credit card and get the miles  points was absolutely frustrating to both of us i dont know why they cant do it  but we had to pay the entire thing with checks it was very irritating in agreement with the previous poster we also received a notice that the ranch was up for sale  that it was possible it would be sold before our event  although the ranch manager was very nice when i called her about this  explained it in a way that calmed my nerves thankfully so  its a lot of things to consider however  i will say this on our wedding day things went very smoothly the managers were very helpful we even invited them down to have a drink  some food the place looked absolutely pristine our guests were blown away by the grounds  the photos are absolutely gorgeous we particularly loved taking photos with the horses being allowed to have our dog there on leash for the ceremony  having access to the bedrooms so that we could have a grooms suite  a bridal suite  our guests had places to change  shower in all honesty  the outdoor showers in every bedroom alone were almost worth the entire price our guests used them after the luncheon to change  get ready for the bollywood reception that evening  every single person including our photographer  dj etc who used the showers just came out glowing and made sure to tell us how much they enjoyed the showers  i kid you not as a bride  showering in the outdoor shower and getting my makeup  hair done in the beautiful bridal suite   seeing my friends  family in that stunning location  was incredibly dreamy worth it for us yes it was we worked with malia to secure the estate for our wedding it was really expensive

than dillingham ranch the grounds  the home are absolutely stunning  can be used in a variety of different ways we looked at many many locations before finally deciding to bit the bullet  pay the very large price tag for this location they did work with us on the price for some trade but in general for most brides this is a high end location  the price tag matches it pros absolutely stunning from the gorgeous grove of palm trees on the drive up to the ranch to the classic breathtaking ranch home with big white pillars on the wraparound porch to the hardwood floors beautiful furniture fireplace the row of royal palms in the back banyan trees a pond peacocks roaming the grass beautifully appointed rooms including a bridal suite  all with incredible outdoor showers beautiful lighting fixtures a worldclass kitchen outdoor furniture  stateoftheart sound system fairly professional management who communicated very well  handled our contracts deposits  all other issues well consfor the incredibly expensive price i was surprised about a few things  there are no tables or chairs to use  you have to bring all of that in even your own toilet paper for a venue that specializes in weddings i think they could easily purchase tables and chairs to keep on property that would absolutely save the bride  groom from having to have all that delivered we used royal party supply who did a good job  but had to pay a delivery fee of course  the water in the worldclass kitchen is not potable you have to bring in all your own water we had an amazing caterer lan thai of happys green hawaii who did that for us at no charge  but having a gourmet kitchen doesnt do you much good if you cant drink the water since most caterers arrive prepared to cook on their own equipment  dont need the massive kitchen really  even though you have the place for the full day  setup the day before  take down the day after you do not get to use the rooms at the ranch for you or your guests to stay in unless you pay  per room this seems silly to me because those rooms just sit there empty until the wedding day  and after the wedding they clean them all anyway so i agree with the previous reviewer that that should be included in the cost  the floors inside the great room are beautiful new hardwood floors  but because of this they do not want dancing in there particularly if anyone is wearing high heels we were incredibly adamant with our guests that they not wear high heels since the ceremony was all out on the grass anyway and we just didnt want any issues with the floors  our deposit however when we asked about rearranging the furniture a little bit to create a different flow for our event we were told that we couldnt move it and they would have to do it so it doesnt ruin the floors understandable  but then the management told us they would charge us  to move the furniture ugh it was moments like this that felt a little bit moneygrubbing to us but of course this is a business  they dont take credit cards this one was a shocker to not be able to put that large of an amount on our credit card and get the miles  points was absolutely frustrating to both of us i dont know why they cant do it  but we had to pay the entire thing with checks it was very irritating in agreement with the previous poster we also received a notice that the ranch was up for sale  that it was possible it would be sold before our event  although the ranch manager was very nice when i called her about this  explained it in a way that calmed my nerves thankfully so  its a lot of things to consider however  i will say this on our wedding day things went very smoothly the managers were very helpful we even invited them down to have a drink  some food the place looked absolutely pristine our guests were blown away by the grounds  the photos are absolutely gorgeous we particularly loved taking photos with the horses being allowed to have our dog there on leash for the ceremony  having access to the bedrooms so that we could have a grooms suite  a bridal suite  our guests had places to change  shower in all honesty  the outdoor showers in every bedroom alone were almost worth the entire price our guests used them after the luncheon to change  get ready for the bollywood reception that evening  every single person including our photographer  dj etc who used the showers just came out glowing and made sure to tell us how much they enjoyed the showers  i kid you not as a bride  showering in the outdoor shower and getting my makeup  hair done in the beautiful bridal suite   seeing my friends  family in that stunning location  was incredibly dreamy worth it for us yes it was we worked with malia to secure the estate for our wedding it was really expensive but you get the day before and the day after for setup and cleanup which helped it is newly remodeledand beautiful there is a stateoftheart kitchen that was brand spanking new we did our ceremony in the front lawn

delivery fee of course the water in the worldclass kitchen is not potable   you have to bring in all your own water  we had an amazing caterer lan thai of happys green hawaii who did that for us at no charge  but having a gourmet kitchen doesnt do you much good if you cant drink the water since most caterers arrive prepared to cook on their own equipment  dont need the massive kitchen really even though you have the place for the full day  setup the day before  take down the day after you do not get to use the rooms at the ranch for you or your guests to stay in unless you pay  per room   this seems silly to me because those rooms just sit there empty until the wedding day  and after the wedding they clean them all anyway so i agree with the previous reviewer that that should be included in the cost    the floors inside the great room are beautiful new hardwood floors  but because of this they do not want dancing in there particularly if anyone is wearing high heels  we were incredibly adamant with our guests that they not wear high heels since the ceremony was all out on the grass anyway and we just didnt want any issues with the floors  our deposit     however when we asked about rearranging the furniture a little bit to create a different flow for our event we were told that we couldnt move it and they would have to do it so it doesnt ruin the floors  understandable  but then the management told us they would charge us  to move the furniture   ugh it was moments like this that felt a little bit moneygrubbing to us but of course this is a business  they dont take credit cards this one was a shocker   to not be able to put that large of an amount on our credit card and get the miles  points was absolutely frustrating to both of us  i dont know why they cant do it  but we had to pay the entire thing with checks   it was very irritating  in agreement with the previous poster we also received a notice that the ranch was up for sale  that it was possible it would be sold before our event  although the ranch manager was very nice when i called her about this  explained it in a way that calmed my nerves thankfully  so  its a lot of things to consider however  i will say this  on our wedding day things went very smoothly  the managers were very helpful we even invited them down to have a drink  some food the place looked absolutely pristine  our guests were blown away by the grounds  the photos are absolutely gorgeous   we particularly loved taking photos with the horses being allowed to have our dog there on leash for the ceremony  having access to the bedrooms so that we could have a grooms suite  a bridal suite  our guests had places to change  shower  in all honesty  the outdoor showers in every bedroom alone were almost worth the entire price our guests used them after the luncheon to change  get ready for the bollywood reception that evening  every single person including our photographer  dj etc who used the showers just came out glowing and made sure to tell us how much they enjoyed the showers  i kid you not    as a bride  showering in the outdoor shower and getting my makeup  hair done in the beautiful bridal suite   seeing my friends  family in that stunning location  was incredibly dreamy  worth it for us yes  it was grove of palms  dillingham ranch grove of palms  dillingham ranch bridal shots  dillingham ranch bridal

before and the day after for setup and cleanup which helped it is newly remodeledand beautiful  there is a stateoftheart kitchen that was brand spanking new we did our ceremony in the front lawn the aisle was the cemented pathway down the center the cocktail hour was held int he same area with the grand rooom open then the reception was on the back side of the house up until the row of palm trees leading to the mountains it was quite and free of light polution luckily we had a clear night which played a huge part our guests were stunned with the stars that led them homethe water is not city water so they say it is not potablethere are rooms that you can rent which i think is unreasonable and should be included in the huge price tag on the location each room has its own outdoor shower and bathroom as with most wedding venues there is stressother than the money strain eating our budgeta few weeks before the wedding we got a notice in the mail that dillingham ranch is up for sale and that if it sells before our wedding they will recommend that the new owners let us use the location but cannot guarantee it insert mini bridal freakout herethings worked out but i would caution anyone interested in this location to make sure that ownership is stable or ahve a really good plan b also keep in mind that it is far far awayjust about the end of the road so make sure that you have a transport plan for your people who indulge in libations if not for the price and the stress i would give this place a  star rating for its beauty and ease of planning was this review … useful  funny

the ranch was a good choice to have the warrior dash   it was open spaced and had lots of parking  only thing was we were on the field and there are loads of crap all over the place  the event was fun and im hoping they return next year  the ranch had plenty of space for us to run and park too  the redfrogevents people knew what they were doing and everything was organized really well i cant wait
