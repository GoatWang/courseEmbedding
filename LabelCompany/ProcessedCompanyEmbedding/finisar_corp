the companys optical subsystems consist of transmitters receivers transceivers transponders and active optical cables which provide the fundamental opticalelectrical or optoelectronic interface for interconnecting the electronic equipment used in these networks including the switches routers and servers used in wireline networks as well as the antennas and base stations used in wireless networks these products rely on the use of semiconductor lasers and photodetectors in conjunction with integrated circuits and optoelectronic packaging to provide a means for transmitting and receiving digital signals over fiber optic cable at speeds ranging from less than one gigabit per second gbps to more than  gbps over distances of less than  meters to more than  kilometers using a range of network protocols and physical configurationsfinisar supplies optical transceivers and transponders that allow pointtopoint communications on a fiber using a single specified wavelength or bundled with multiplexing technologies can be used to supply multiterabit per second tbps bandwidths using approximately  or more wavelengths on the same fiber the company also provides products known as wavelength selective switches wss wss are switches that are used to dynamically switch network traffic from one optical fiber to multiple other fibers without first converting the optical signal to an electronic signal wss products are sometimes combined with other components and sold as linecards that plug into a system chassis referred to as a reconfigurable optical adddrop multiplexer roadm the companys line of optical components consists of packaged lasers and photodetectors for data communication and telecommunication applications its manufacturing operations are vertically integrated and it utilizes internal sources for many of the key components used in making its products including lasers photodetectors and integrated circuits ics it sells its products primarily to original equipment manufacturers oems of storage systems networking equipment and telecommunication equipment and to their contract manufacturersthe companys optical subsystems and components are integrated into its customers systems and used for fiber opticsbased data communication and telecommunication networks finisars family of optical subsystem products are based on the ethernet fiber channel optical transport network otn and synchronous optical networkingsynchronous digital hierarchy sonetsdh its optical subsystem products perform various functions with data integrity and support a range of protocols transmission speeds fiber types wavelengths transmission distances physical configurations and software enhancements its optical subsystem products include a microprocessor with embedded software that provides customers realtime monitoring of transmitted and received optical power temperature drive current and other link parameters for each port in their systemsfor data communication applications that rely on the fiber channel standard the company provides a range of optical subsystems for transmission applications at  to  gbps for data communication applications that rely on the ethernet standard it provides a range of optical subsystems for transmitting signals at  to  gbps using the small formfactor pluggable sfp sfp  gigabit small form factor pluggable xfp x quad small formfactor pluggable qsfp qsfp c formfactor pluggable cfp cfp cfp and other form factors for otn and sonetsdhbased telecommunication applications it supplies optical subsystems that are capable of transmitting at       and  gbps it also offers a line of optical subsystems for telecommunication applications using wavelength division multiplexing wdm technologies its products include coarse wavelength division multiplexing cwdm transceivers in the sfp form factor and dense wavelength division multiplexing dwdm transceivers in the sfp sfp xfp and cfp form factors these products include both fixed wavelength transceivers and tunable transceivers that are capable of dynamically tuning across a range of wavelengths in the c and lbandsthe company has access to technology for the manufacture of a number of active and passive optical components including vertical cavity surface emitting lasers vcsels fabryperot fp lasers distributed feedback dfb lasers tunable lasers positive intrinsic negative pin detectors integrated waveguide detectors mach zehnder modulators fused fiber couplers isolators filters polarization beam combiners interleavers and amplifiers these optical components are used internally in the manufacture of its optical subsystems the company sells some of these components in the merchant market to other subsystems manufacturers it also offers products used in building fibertothehomecurb networks and for parallel optics applications such as backplanes for switches and routersfinisar offers wss and roadm linecard products for wavelength management in dwdm telecommunication networks these capabilities are made possible in part through the use of its liquid crystal on silicon lcos technology similar to that used in miniature projectors this technology provides a wss capable of operating on both  and  gigahertz ghz international telecommunications union itu grids based on its flexgrid technology in addition this lcosbased architecture offers the capability for inservice upgrades of functionality and integration of additional system functionality including route and select drop and continue channel monitoring and channel contouring features its wss and roadm linecard product offering ranges from x x and x products up to higher output fiber port counts in its x and xx productsthe company competes with foxconn jds uniphase oclaro

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed

csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not
