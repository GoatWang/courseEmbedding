produced water volume throughput in the first quarter of  averaged  thousand barrels per day mbbld a decrease of  compared to  mbbld in the prioryear period and a decrease of  compared to  mbbld in the fourth quarter of   smlps natural gas volume throughput metrics exclude its proportionate share of volume throughput from its  ownership interest in ohio gathering steve newby president and chief executive officer commented smlps first quarter  financial and operating results correspond with our expectations and full year  financial guidance  over the last several months drilling activity has increased significantly across our systems  we expect volume growth from this drilling activity to positively impact our operating and financial results in the second half of the year we took advantage of a favorable capital markets environment in the first quarter of  by accessing the bond market for  million of senior notes at a  coupon  this opportunistic financing enabled us to repay all of the outstanding debt under our  senior notes extend our debt maturity profile and term out  million of revolver borrowings  we continue to have a positive outlook on our business and we believe well see growth accelerate as we move throughout the year  our customers are increasing their drilling and completion activity behind our systems and many have taken steps to strengthen their balance sheets and enhance their capital position to execute their growth plans  in addition we are encouraged by the level of commercial activity we are seeing and we are evaluating a number of opportunities around our existing system footprints and in new basins  financial guidance smlp is reaffirming its  financial guidance with adjusted ebitda expected to range from  million to  million and an annualized fourth quarter  adjusted ebitda run rate between  million and  million  smlp expects to incur  million to  million of capex in  including maintenance capex of  million to  million  smlps  capex guidance reflects the inclusion of our contributions to equity method investees  smlp expects full year distribution coverage will range from x to x  first quarter  segment results the following

throughput for ohio gathering  gross basis represents  of volume throughput for ohio gathering based on a onemonth lag utica shale the utica shale reportable segment includes our  ownership interest in ohio gathering a natural gas gathering system in service and under development spanning the condensate liquidsrich and dry gas windows of the utica shale in harrison guernsey noble belmont and monroe counties in southeastern ohio  segment adjusted ebitda for the utica shale includes our proportional share of adjusted ebitda from ohio gathering based on a onemonth lag  the utica shale reportable segment also includes summit utica the natural gas gathering system we operate which is currently in service and under development in belmont and monroe counties in southeastern ohio  summit utica gathers and delivers dry natural gas to interconnections with a thirdparty intrastate pipeline which provides access to the clarington hub  segment adjusted ebitda for the first quarter of  totaled  million up  from  million for the prioryear period primarily due to significantly higher volume throughput across summit utica partially offset by lower volume throughput on ohio gathering and lower stabilization revenue at ohio condensate  volume throughput on the ohio gathering system which is based on a onemonth lag averaged  mmcfd gross in the first quarter of  compared to  mmcfd gross in the prioryear period and  mmcfd gross in the fourth quarter of   volume throughput on ohio gathering in the first quarter of  was impacted by natural declines from existing wells on the system  ohio gathering commissioned the larew compressor station in march  which is expected to facilitate incremental dry gas production beginning in the second quarter of  and generates an incremental compression fee on all dry gas volumes  currently our customers are running five drilling rigs across the ohio gathering footprint and we expect to see the volume benefit from this activity beginning in the second half of   volume throughput on the summit utica system averaged  mmcfd in the first quarter of  compared to  mmcfd in the prioryear period and  mmcfd in the fourth quarter of   volume throughput for the first quarter of  increased relative to the prioryear period due to our continued buildout of the summit utica gathering system and our connection of  new wells throughout  and another four new wells during the first quarter of   we expect volumes on summit utica will continue to grow throughout the balance of the year as new wells located on new and existing pad sites are completed  in april  we commissioned a new project to offload capacity constrained natural gas from a thirdparty gathering system adjacent to the summit utica system  we expect this project to significantly increase volumes on summit utica beginning in the second quarter of  albeit at a lower gathering rate given that we are providing highpressure gathering and compression services and not lowpressure wellhead gathering services williston basin the bison midstream polar and divide and tioga midstream systems provide our midstream services for the williston basin reportable segment  bison midstream gathers associated natural gas production in mountrail and burke counties in north dakota and delivers to thirdparty pipelines serving a thirdparty processing plant in channahon illinois  the polar and divide system gathers crude oil production in williams and divide counties in north dakota and delivers to the colt and basin transload rail terminals as well as other thirdparty intra and interstate pipelines  the polar and divide system also gathers and delivers produced water to various thirdparty disposal wells in the region  tioga midstream is a crude oil produced water and associated natural gas gathering system in williams county north dakota  all crude oil and natural gas gathered on the tioga midstream system is delivered to thirdparty pipelines and all produced water is delivered to thirdparty disposal wells segment adjusted ebitda for the williston basin segment totaled  million for the first quarter of  compared to  million for the prioryear period  compared to the prioryear period first quarter  volumes were negatively impacted due to a minimal number of new wells being commissioned behind our gathering systems during the first quarter of   in addition to lower volumes a certain williston customer has gathering rates that reset up or down annually based on actual volumes delivered relative to a predetermined schedule  the higher gathering rates that we enjoyed for this particular customer in the first quarter of  were lowered in the second half of  and impacted our sequential quarterly and yearoveryear comparisons for this segment  without any new drilling activity in  we would expect to see gathering rates for this particular customer to reset higher in   the williston basin segment benefitted from the recognition of  million in the first quarter of  related to the settlement of a business interruption insurance claim associated with the temporary suspension of produced water gathering activities in      liquids volumes averaged  mbbld in the first quarter of  a decrease of  over the prioryear period and a decrease of  compared to the fourth quarter of   lower liquids volumes were primarily related to natural declines from existing wells on the polar and divide system as no new wells were commissioned during the quarter  certain of our customers remain active across the polar and divide system with three drilling rigs currently working and adding to an existing backlog of more than  drilled uncompleted wells ducs currently behind our williston gathering systems  we expect many of these ducs to begin to be commissioned over the next several months following the startup of new thirdparty longhaul takeaway pipeline associated natural gas volumes averaged  mmcfd in the first quarter of  a decrease of  over the prioryear period and flat compared to the fourth quarter of   volume declines were primarily related to natural declines from existing wells on the bison midstream and tioga midstream systems as only three new wells were connected during the quarter  in addition the severe winter weather experienced late in the fourth quarter of  continued into the beginning of  and negatively impacted volumes during the quarter relative to the prioryear period      piceancedj basins the grand river and the niobrara gp systems provide our midstream services for the piceancedj basins reportable segment  these systems provide natural gas gathering and processing services for producers operating in the piceance basin located in western colorado and eastern utah and in the denverjulesburg dj basin located in northeastern colorado   segment adjusted ebitda totaled  million for the first quarter of  an increase of  from  million for the prioryear period  first quarter  volume throughput averaged  mmcfd an increase of  from  mmcfd in the prioryear period and flat with the fourth quarter of   volume growth relative to the prioryear period was primarily due to ongoing drilling and completion activity from our singlebasin focused private equitybacked customers  these customers commissioned dozens of new wells across our piceance and dj basin gathering systems in  and in the first quarter of  these customers commissioned another  new wells  this activity was partially offset by the impact of our anchor customers continued suspension of drilling activities in the basin and the resulting natural declines from existing production  this impact of our anchor customers volume declines was partially offset by higher minimum volume commitment mvc shortfall payment adjustments associated with our gas gathering agreements  certain of our customers remain active across our piceance and dj gathering systems with three drilling rigs currently working barnett shale the dfw midstream system provides our midstream services for the barnett shale reportable segment  this system gathers and delivers lowpressure natural gas received from pad sites primarily located in southeastern tarrant county texas to downstream intrastate pipelines serving various natural gas hubs in the region  segment adjusted ebitda for the barnett shale segment totaled  million for the first quarter of  a decrease of  from the prioryear period  volume throughput of  mmcfd in the first quarter of  was down  compared to the prioryear period average of  mmcfd and flat with the fourth quarter of   no new wells were commissioned behind the dfw gathering system in the first quarter of  but drilling activity behind the system has recently increased with two rigs added to the field since the end of the first quarter of  and workover rigs returning several dormant wells to service late in the first quarter of   this increased level of activity is largely due to the customer turnover weve experienced behind the system in the last several quarters and we expect that it will lead to increasing volumes in the second half of  marcellus shale the mountaineer midstream system provides our midstream services for the marcellus shale reportable segment this system gathers highpressure natural gas received from upstream pipeline interconnections with antero midstream partners lp and crestwood equity partners lp  natural gas on the mountaineer midstream system is delivered to the sherwood processing complex located in doddridge county west virginia  segment adjusted ebitda for the marcellus shale segment totaled  million for the first quarter of  an increase of  from  million for the prioryear period primarily due to  million of rightofway repair expenses incurred in the prioryear period  volume throughput for this segment averaged  mmcfd in the first quarter of  a decrease of  from  mmcfd in the prioryear period and an increase of  from the  mmcfd in the fourth quarter of   volume throughput increased relative to the fourth quarter of  as a result of our customer commissioning new wells behind our system  we expect our customer to continue to complete its inventory of ducs behind the mountaineer midstream system throughout the balance of the year which we expect will drive volumes higher particularly in the second half of   mvc shortfall payments smlp billed its customers  million in the first quarter of  related to mvcs  for those customers that do not have credit banking mechanisms in their gathering agreements or do not have the ability to use mvc shortfall payments as credits the mvc shortfall payments are accounted for as gathering revenue in the period that they are earned  for the first quarter of  smlp recognized  million of gathering revenue associated with mvc shortfall payments from certain customers in the marcellus shale piceancedj basins williston basin and barnett shale reportable segments  of this amount  million was related to a certain williston basin customer with whom we entered into a gathering agreement amendment during the first quarter of   pursuant to the amendment the customer forfeited its mvc credit bank which had been recorded on smlps balance sheet in prior periods as deferred revenue  mvc shortfall payment adjustments in the first quarter of  totaled  million and included  million of deferred revenue related to mvc shortfall payments and  million related to mvc shortfall payment adjustments from certain customers in the piceancedj basins williston basin and barnett shale reportable

investors section of smlps website at wwwsummitmidstreamcom prior to the beginning of each conference use of nongaap financial measures we report financial results in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap we also present adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow each a nongaap financial measure  we define adjusted ebitda as net income or loss plus interest expense income tax expense depreciation and amortization our proportional adjusted ebitda for equity method investees adjustments related to mvc shortfall payments unitbased and noncash compensation deferred purchase price obligation expense early extinguishment of debt expense impairments and other noncash expenses or losses less interest income income tax benefit income loss from equity method investees and other noncash income or gains  we define distributable cash flow as adjusted ebitda plus cash interest received and cash taxes received less cash interest paid senior notes interest adjustment cash taxes paid and maintenance capital expenditures  because adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow may be defined differently by other entities in our industry our definitions of these nongaap financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other entities thereby diminishing their utility management uses these nongaap financial measures in making financial operating and planning decisions and in evaluating our financial performance furthermore management believes that these nongaap financial measures may provide external users of our financial statements such as investors commercial banks research analysts and others with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results of prior periods as they are expected to be reflective of our core ongoing business adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow are used as supplemental financial measures by external users of our financial statements such as investors commercial banks research analysts and others adjusted ebitda is used to assess the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to make cash distributions and support our indebtedness the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods capital structure or historical cost basis our operating performance and return on capital as compared to those of other entities in the midstream energy sector without regard to financing or capital structure the attractiveness of capital projects and acquisitions and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities and the financial performance of our assets without regard to i income or loss from equity method investees ii the impact of the timing of minimum volume commitments shortfall payments under our gathering agreements or iii the timing of impairments or other noncash income or expense items distributable cash flow is used to assess the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to make future cash distributions and the attractiveness of capital projects and acquisitions and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities both of these measures have limitations as analytical tools and investors should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap for example certain items excluded from adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow are significant components in understanding and assessing an entitys financial performance such as an entitys cost of capital and tax structure adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow do not reflect changes in or cash requirements for our working capital needs and although depreciation and amortization are noncash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements we compensate for the limitations of adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow as analytical tools by reviewing the comparable gaap financial measures understanding the differences between the financial measures and incorporating these data points into our decisionmaking process reconciliations of gaap to nongaap financial measures are attached to this press release we do not provide the gaap financial measures of net income or loss or net cash provided by operating

of summit holdings manages opco a delaware limited liability partnership and provides natural gas and crude oil marketing services in and around our gathering systems presentation and consolidation we prepare our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap as established by the fasb we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates including fair value measurements the reported amounts of revenue and expense and the disclosure of contingencies although management believes these estimates are reasonable actual results could differ from its estimates the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the assets liabilities and results of operations of smlp and its subsidiaries all intercompany transactions among the consolidated entities have been eliminated in consolidation comprehensive income or loss is the same as net income or loss for all periods presented the financial position results of operations and cash flows of acquired drop down assets liabilities expenses or entities that were carved out of entities held by summit investments and included herein have been derived from the accounting records of the respective summit investments subsidiary on a carveout basis smlp recognized its drop down acquisitions at summit investments historical cost because the acquisitions were executed by entities under common control the excess of summit investments net investment over the consideration paid and recognized for a contributed subsidiary is recognized as an addition to partners capital while the excess of purchase price paid and recognized over net investment is recognized as a reduction to partners capital due to the common control aspect we account for drop down transactions on an “asif pooled” basis for the periods during which common control existed these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and the regulations of the sec certain information and note disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap have been condensed or omitted pursuant to those rules and regulations we believe that the disclosures made are adequate to make the information not misleading in the opinion of management the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments including normal recurring adjustments which are necessary to fairly present the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of march    the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations partners capital and cash flows for the threemonth periods ended march   and   the balance sheet at december   included herein was derived from our audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by gaap these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with

results of operations for an interim period are not necessarily indicative of results expected for a full year  summary of significant accounting policies there have been no changes to our significant accounting policies since december   recent accounting pronouncements accounting standard setters frequently issue new or revised accounting rules we review new pronouncements to determine the impact if any on our financial statements accounting standards that have or could possibly have a material effect on our financial statements are discussed below recently adopted accounting pronouncements  we have recently adopted the following accounting pronouncements • asu no  compensation—stock compensation topic  improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting asu  asu  simplifies several aspects for sharebased payment award transactions including income tax consequences the liability or equity classification of awards and classification on the statements of cash flows asu  is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after december   it does not specify a single transition approach rather it specifies retrospective modified retrospective andor prospective transition approaches based on the aspect being applied we adopted the provisions of asu  effective january   the adoption of this standard had no impact on our consolidated financial statements  table of contents accounting pronouncements pending adoption  we are currently in the process of evaluating the applicability andor impact of the following accounting pronouncements • asu no  revenue from contracts with customers topic  asu  under asu  revenue will be recognized under a fivestep model i identify the contract with the customer ii identify the performance obligations in the contract iii determine the transaction price iv allocate the transaction price to performance obligations and v recognize revenue when or as the performance obligation is satisfied asu  is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december   and allows for early adoption  we expect to adopt the provisions of asu  effective january   using the modified retrospective method we have substantially completed our review of our existing contracts under the new guidance however we are still assessing the financial statement impact of adoption for certain items discussed below for contracts where we perform gathering services and earn a perunit fee which is recognized at a point in time revenue will be recognized over time as the service is performed which is expected to accelerate the recognition of revenue by an immaterial amount in addition our contracts generally contain forms of what will be considered variable consideration which will likely be constrained as the volumes are susceptible to factors outside of our control and influence however we will be billing amounts that correspond directly to the value transferred such that the resulting revenue recognized will be similar to current gaap due to the open noncash consideration technical issue as well as completion of our evaluations of mvcs and contributions in aid of construction we cannot currently fully conclude on the impact of adoption we anticipate that we will be able to complete our assessment of the impact of adoption by the end of the third quarter of  • asu no  leases topic  asu  asu  requires that lessees recognize all leases on the balance sheet with the exception of shortterm leases a lease liability will be recorded for the obligation of a lessee to make lease payments arising from a lease a rightofuse asset will be recorded which represents the lessee’s right to use or to control the use of a specified asset for a lease term we are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on lessor accounting but have made no determinations at this time asu  is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after december   and requires the modified retrospective approach for transition we are currently evaluating the provisions of asu  to determine its impact on our financial statements and related disclosures and expect to adopt its provisions effective january   • asu no  revenue from contracts with customers topic  principal versus agent considerations reporting revenue gross versus net asu  asu  does not change the core principle of topic  rather it clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations  we expect to adopt the provisions of asu  effective january   our position regarding the impact of and transition method for this update is the same as for asu  • asu no  revenue from contracts with customers topic  identifying performance obligations and licensing asu  asu  clarifies the following two aspects of topic  i identifying performance obligations and ii the licensing implementation guidance while retaining the related principles for those areas we expect to adopt the provisions of asu  effective january   our position regarding the impact of and transition method for this update is the same as for asu  • asu no  revenue from contracts with customers topic  narrowscope improvements and practical expedients asu  asu  does not change the core principle of the guidance in topic  rather the amendments therein affect only the narrow aspects of topic  including assessing the collectability criterion and issues related to contract modification at transition and completed contracts at transition  we expect to adopt the provisions of asu  effective january   our position regarding the impact of and transition method for this update is the same as for asu   segment information as of march    our reportable segments are • the utica shale which includes our ownership

the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included in the  annual report among other things those financial statements and the related notes include more detailed information regarding the basis of presentation for the following information this discussion contains forwardlooking statements that constitute our plans estimates and beliefs these forwardlooking statements involve numerous risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those discussed in forwardlooking statements actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements this mda comprises the following sections • overview • trends and outlook • how we evaluate our operations • results of operations • liquidity and capital resources • critical accounting estimates • forwardlooking statements overview we are a growthoriented limited partnership focused on developing owning and operating midstream energy infrastructure assets that are strategically located in the core producing areas of unconventional resource basins primarily shale formations in the continental united states we are the owneroperator of or have significant ownership interests in the following gathering systems • ohio gathering a natural gas gathering system and a condensate stabilization facility operating in the appalachian basin which includes the utica and point pleasant shale formations in southeastern ohio • summit utica a natural gas gathering system operating in the appalachian basin which includes the utica and point pleasant shale formations in southeastern ohio • bison midstream an associated natural gas gathering system operating in the williston basin which includes the bakken and three forks shale formations in northwestern north dakota • polar and divide crude oil and produced water gathering systems and transmission pipelines located in the williston basin which includes the bakken and three forks shale formations in northwestern north dakota • tioga midstream crude oil produced water and associated natural gas gathering systems operating in the williston basin which includes the bakken and three forks shale formations in northwestern north dakota • grand river a natural gas gathering and processing system located in the piceance basin which includes the mesaverde formation and the mancos and niobrara shale formations in western colorado and eastern utah • niobrara gp an associated natural gas gathering and processing system operating in the dj basin which includes the niobrara and codell shale formations in northeastern colorado • dfw midstream a natural gas gathering system operating in the fort worth basin which includes the barnett shale formation in northcentral texas and • mountaineer midstream a natural gas gathering system operating in the appalachian basin which includes the marcellus shale formation in northern west virginia  table of contents for additional information on our organization and systems see notes  and  to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements our financial results are driven primarily by volume throughput and expense management we generate the majority of our revenues from the gathering treating and processing services that we provide to our customers a substantial majority of the volumes that we gather treat andor process have a fixedfee rate structure thereby enhancing the stability of our cash flows by providing a revenue stream that is not subject to direct commodity price risk we also earn revenues from i the sale of physical natural gas and ngls purchased under percentageofproceeds arrangements with certain of our customers on the bison midstream and grand river systems ii the sale of natural gas we retain from certain dfw midstream customers and iii the sale of condensate we retain from our gathering services at grand river these additional activities which expose us to direct commodity price risk accounted for less than  of total revenues during the three months ended march   we also have indirect exposure to changes in commodity prices in that persistently low commodity prices may cause our customers to delay andor cancel drilling andor completion activities or temporarily shutin production which would reduce the volumes of natural gas and crude oil and associated volumes of produced water that we gather if certain of our customers cancel or delay drilling andor completion activities or temporarily shutin production the associated mvcs ensure that we will recognize a minimum amount of revenue

previously deferred in connection with an mvc arrangement with a certain williston basin customer for which we determined we had no further performance obligations we include the effect of adjustments related to mvc shortfall payments in our definition of segment adjusted ebitda as such the williston basin segment adjusted ebitda was not impacted because the revenue recognition was offset by the  table of contents associated adjustments related to mvc shortfall payments for this customer see note  to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements • in february   we amended the  srs to include additional guarantor subsidiaries and completed a public offering of  million principal  senior notes concurrent and following the offering we tendered and redeemed all of the outstanding  senior notes the remaining  senior notes were redeemed on march   with payment made on march   we used the proceeds from the issuance of the  senior notes to i fund the repurchase of the outstanding  million principal  senior notes ii pay redemption and call premiums on the  senior notes totaling  million and iii pay  million of the balance outstanding under our revolving credit facility three months ended march   the following items are reflected in our financial results • in march  we acquired the  drop down assets from a subsidiary of summit investments we funded the drop down with borrowings under our revolving credit facility and the execution of the deferred purchase price obligation with summit investments see note  to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements trends and outlook our business has been and we expect our future business to continue to be affected by the following key trends • natural gas ngl and crude oil supply and demand dynamics • growth in production from us shale plays • capital markets activity and cost of capital and • shifts in operating costs and inflation our expectations are based on assumptions made by us and information currently available to us to the extent our underlying assumptions about or interpretations of available information prove to be incorrect our actual results may vary materially from our expected results for additional information see the trends and outlook section of mda included in the  annual report how we evaluate our operations we conduct and report our operations in the

report the financial information used to make decisions and allocate resources in connection with our operations see note  to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements our management uses a variety of financial and operational metrics to analyze our consolidated and segment performance we view these metrics as important factors in evaluating our profitability and determining the amounts of cash distributions to pay to our unitholders these metrics include • throughput volume • revenues • operation and maintenance expenses and • segment adjusted ebitda  table of contents we

financial statements  table of contents deferred purchase price obligation in march  we entered into an agreement with a subsidiary of summit investments to fund a portion of the  drop down whereby we have recognized the deferred purchase price obligation see note  to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements cash flows due to the common control aspect in a drop down transaction we account for drop downs on an “asif pooled” basis for the periods during which common control existed as such cash flows retrospectively reflect the cash flows associated with i the assets acquired from summit investments and ii the assets and liabilities allocated to the partnership from summit investments the components of the net change in cash and cash equivalents were as follows   three

the ongoing development of the summit utica system and williston basin segment and •  million of capital contributions to ohio gathering financing activities cash flows used in financing activities

•  million of net repayments under our revolving credit facility •  million of distributions paid in the first quarter of  declared in respect of the fourth quarter of  and •  million of borrowings from the issuance of  senior notes cash flows provided by financing activities during the three months ended march   primarily reflected •  million of net borrowings under our revolving credit facility primarily to fund the  drop down and  table of contents •  million of distributions paid in the first quarter of  declared in respect of the fourth quarter of  contractual obligations update in march  we borrowed an additional  million under our revolving credit facility and recognized a liability of  million for the deferred purchase price obligation both in connection with the  drop down the deferred purchase price obligation is due no later than december   and is currently expected to be  million based on information available as of march   there are no cash interest payments associated with the deferred purchase price obligation in february  we issued  million principal of  senior unsecured notes due  we used the proceeds from the issuance of the  senior notes to i fund the repurchase of the outstanding  million principal  senior notes ii pay redemption and call premiums on the  senior notes totaling  million and iii pay  million of the balance outstanding under our revolving credit facility capital requirements our business is capital intensive requiring significant investment for the maintenance of existing gathering systems and the acquisition or construction and development of new gathering systems and other midstream assets and facilities our partnership agreement requires that we categorize our capital expenditures as either • maintenance capital expenditures which are cash expenditures including expenditures for the addition or improvement to or the replacement of our capital assets or for the acquisition of existing or the construction or development of new capital assets made to maintain our longterm operating income or operating capacity or • expansion capital expenditures which are cash expenditures incurred for acquisitions or capital improvements that we expect will increase our operating income or operating capacity over the long term for the three months ended march   cash paid for capital expenditures totaled  million see note  to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements which included  million of maintenance capital expenditures for the three months ended march   contributions to equity method investees totaled  million see note  to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements we anticipate that we will continue to make significant expansion capital expenditures in the future consequently our ability to develop and maintain sources of funds to meet our capital requirements is critical to our ability to meet our growth objectives we expect that our future expansion capital expenditures will be funded by borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the issuance of debt and equity instruments we believe that our revolving credit facility together with financial support from our sponsor andor access to the debt and equity capital markets will be adequate to finance our growth objectives for the foreseeable future without adversely impacting our liquidity or our ability to make quarterly cash distributions to our unitholders distributions including idrs based on the terms of our partnership agreement we expect to distribute most of the cash generated by our operations to our unitholders with respect to our payment of idrs to the general partner we reached the second target distribution in connection with the distribution declared in respect of the fourth quarter of  we reached the third target distribution in connection with the distribution declared in respect of the second quarter of  for additional information see note  to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements credit and counterparty concentration risks we examine the creditworthiness of counterparties to whom we extend credit and manage our exposure to credit risk through credit analysis credit approval credit limits and monitoring procedures and for certain transactions we may request letters of credit prepayments or guarantees given the current environment certain of our customers may be temporarily unable to meet their current obligations while this may cause disruption to cash flows we believe that we are properly positioned to deal with the potential disruption because the vast majority of our gathering assets are strategically positioned at the beginning of the midstream value chain the majority of our infrastructure is connected directly to our customer’s wellheads and pad sites which means our gathering systems are typically the first thirdparty infrastructure through which our customer’s commodities flow and in many cases the only way for our customers to get their production to market  table of contents we estimate the quarterly impact of expected mvc shortfall payments for inclusion in our calculation of segment adjusted ebitda as such we have exposure due to nonperformance under our mvc contracts whereby a customer who was not meeting their mvcs does not have the wherewithal to make its mvc shortfall payments when they become due we typically receive payment for all prioryear mvc shortfall billings in the quarter immediately following billing therefore our exposure to risk of nonperformance is limited to and accumulates during the current yeartodate contracted measurement period for additional information see notes   and  to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements offbalance sheet arrangements we had no offbalance sheet arrangements as of or during the three months ended march   critical accounting estimates we prepare our financial statements in accordance with gaap these principles are established by the fasb we employ methods estimates and assumptions based on currently available information when recording transactions resulting from business operations there have been no changes to our significant accounting policies since december   the estimates that we deem to be most critical to an understanding of our financial position and results of operations are those related to determination of fair value and recognition of deferred revenue the preparation and evaluation of these critical accounting estimates involve the use of various assumptions developed from managements analyses and judgments subsequent experience or use of other methods estimates or assumptions could produce significantly different results there have been no changes in the accounting methodology for items that we have identified as critical accounting estimates and no updates or additions to critical accounting estimates during the three months ended

statements while existing fixedrate debt mitigates the downside impact of fluctuations in interest rates future issuances of longterm debt could be impacted by increases in interest rates which could result in higher overall interest costs in addition the borrowings under our revolving credit facility which have a variable interest rate also expose us to the risk of increasing interest rates our

a well used to control the wells pressure also the point at which the hydrocarbons and water exit the ground v table of contents industry overview general the midstream sector of the energy industry provides the link between exploration and production and the delivery of crude oil natural gas and their components to enduse markets the midstream sector consists generally of gathering processing and storage and transportation activities natural gas midstream services companies within the natural gas midstream industry create value at various stages along the natural gas value chain by gathering natural gas from producers at the wellhead separating the hydrocarbons into dry gas and ngls and then routing the separated dry gas and ngls streams for delivery to endmarkets or to the next intermediate stage of the value chain the range of services provided by midstream natural gas service companies are generally divided into the following six categories gathering at the initial stages of the midstream value chain a network of typically small diameter pipelines known as gathering systems directly connect to wellheads pad sites or other receipt points in the production area these gathering systems transport natural gas from the wellhead to downstream pipelines or a central location for treating and processing gathering systems are typically designed to allow gathering of natural gas at different pressures and are scalable to allow for additional production and well connections compression gathering systems are operated at design pressures that enable the maximum amount of production to be gathered from connected wells through a mechanical process known as compression volumes of natural gas at a given pressure are compressed to a sufficiently higher pressure thereby allowing those volumes to be delivered to treating dehydration processing and fractionation facilities and ultimately the market via a higher pressure downstream pipeline since wells produce at progressively lower field pressures as they age it becomes necessary to add additional compression over time to maintain throughput across the gathering system treating and dehydration treating and dehydration involves the removal of impurities such as water carbon dioxide nitrogen and hydrogen sulfide which may be present when natural gas is produced at the wellhead these impurities must be removed for the natural gas to meet the specifications for transportation on longhaul intrastate and interstate pipelines moreover end users will not purchase natural gas with high levels of impurities processing the principal components of natural gas are methane and ethane most natural gas also contains varying amounts of other ngls even after treating and dehydration some natural gas is not suitable for longhaul intrastate and interstate pipeline transportation or commercial use because it contains ngls and condensate this natural gas which is often referred to as liquidsrich natural gas must also be processed to remove these heavier hydrocarbon components ngls not only interfere with pipeline transportation but are also valuable commodities once removed from the natural gas stream the removal and separation of ngls usually takes place in a processing plant and fractionation facility using industrial processes that exploit differences in the weights boiling points vapor pressures and other physical characteristics of ngl components fractionation fractionation is the process by which ngls are separated into individual liquid products for sale to petrochemical and industrial end users the ngl components that can be separated in fractionation generally include ethane propane normal butane isobutane and natural gasoline this mixture of raw ngls is often referred to as ygrade or raw natural gas liquid mix transportation and storage after treating and dehydration processing and fractionation the natural gas and ngl components are either stored or transported and marketed to enduse markets each pipeline system typically has storage capacity located both throughout the pipeline network and at major market centers to help temper seasonal demand and daily supplydemand shifts crude oil midstream services crude oil gathering pipelines typically provide the most costeffective and reliable option for shipping crude oil crude oil gathering systems typically comprise a network of smalldiameter pipelines connected directly to wellheads pad sites or other receipt points that transport crude oil to central receipt points or interconnecting pipelines through larger diameter trunk lines common carrier pipelines frequently transport crude oil from central delivery points to logistics hubs or refineries under tariffs regulated by ferc or state authorities logistic hubs provide storage and connections to other pipeline systems and other modes of transportation such as railroads and trucks pipelines not engaged in the interstate transportation of crude may also be proprietary or leased entirely to a single customer vi table of contents trucking complements pipeline gathering systems by gathering crude oil from operators at remote wellhead locations not served by pipeline gathering systems trucking is generally limited to lowvolume shorthaul movements because trucking costs escalate with distance railroads provide additional transportation capabilities for shipping crude oil between gathering systems pipelines terminals and storage centers and endusers produced water gathering produced water is a byproduct or waste stream associated with crude oil production the cost of managing produced water is a key consideration for crude oil producers pipelines and trucks are used to gather produced water for transport to disposal facilities similar to crude oil gathering trucking is generally limited to lowvolume shorthaul movements contractual arrangements natural gas contracts natural gas midstream services other than transportation and storage are usually provided under contractual arrangements that vary in the amount of commodity price risk they carry three typical types of natural gas gathering contracts are described below feebased  under feebased arrangements the midstream service provider typically receives a fee for each unit of natural gas gathered treated andor compressed at the wellhead and an additional fee per unit of natural gas processed at its facility as a result the midstream service provider bears no direct commodity price risk exposure percentofproceeds  under percentofproceeds arrangements the midstream service provider typically remits to the producers either a percentage of the proceeds from the sale of residue gas and ngls at the tailgate at its own or a thirdparty processing or fractionation plant these types of arrangements expose the gatherer and processor to direct commodity price risk as the revenues from the contracts directly correlate with the fluctuating price of natural gas condensate and ngls keepwhole  under keepwhole arrangements the midstream service provider keeps  of the ngls produced and the processed natural gas or value of the natural gas is returned to the producer since some of the natural gas is used and removed during processing the midstream service provider compensates the producer for the value or amount of natural gas used and removed during processing by supplying additional natural gas or by paying an agreedupon value for the natural gas utilized these arrangements have the highest commodity price exposure for the processor because the costs are dependent on the price of natural gas and the revenues are based on the price of ngls crude oil and produced water contracts crude oil and produced water gathering services are usually provided under feebased contractual arrangements whereby the service provider typically receives a fee for each unit of production gathered at the wellhead as a result the service provider bears no direct commodity price risk exposure vii table of contents part i item  business smlp is a delaware limited partnership that completed its ipo in october  summit

grand river systems ii the sale of physical natural gas that we retain from certain of our dfw midstream system customers to offset a portion of our power expense associated with our electricdrive compression and iii the sale of condensate volumes that we retain on the grand river system during the year ended december   we derived less than  of our revenues from percentofproceeds arrangements and various byproduct hydrocarbon sales in addition the vast majority of our gas gathering and processing agreements include amis our amis cover more than  million acres in the aggregate which includes more than  million acres in ohio gathering certain of our gathering and processing agreements also include mvcs to the extent the customer does not meet its mvc it must make an mvc shortfall payment to cover the shortfall of required volume throughput not shipped or processed either on a monthly quarterly or annual basis we have designed our mvc provisions to ensure that we will generate a certain amount of revenue from each customer over the life of the associated gathering or processing agreement whether by collecting gathering or processing fees on actual throughput or from cash payments to cover any mvc shortfall as of december   we had remaining mvcs totaling  tcfe our mvcs have a weightedaverage remaining life of  years assuming minimum throughput volume for the remainder of the term and average approximately  bcfed through   we use a variety of financial and operational metrics to analyze our performance including among others throughput volume revenues operation and maintenance expenses and segment adjusted ebitda we view  table of contents each of these operational and gaap metrics as important factors in evaluating our profitability and determining the amounts of cash distributions we pay to our unitholders for additional information on our results of operations see item  selected financial data and the results of operations section included in the item

each of which is incorporated herein by reference our sponsor and summit investments energy capital partners together with its affiliated funds is a private equity firm with over  billion in capital commitments that is focused on investing in north americas energy infrastructure energy capital partners has significant energy and financial expertise to complement its investment in us including investments in the power generation midstream oil and gas electric transmission energy equipment and services environmental infrastructure and other energyrelated sectors summit investments which was formed in  by members of our management team and our sponsor is the ultimate owner of our general partner we are managed and operated by the board of directors and executive officers of our general partner which is managed and operated by summit investments as a result due to its ownership interest in summit investments and its representation on summit investments board of managers energy capital partners controls our general partner and its activities thereby controlling smlp in december  energy capital partners approved a unit purchase program of up to  million of smlp common units the purchase program unit purchases which commenced in december  and concluded in june  were made in open market transactions and had no impact on the total number of common units outstanding summit investments acquired  common units and energy capital partners acquired  common units under the purchase program initial public offering smlp was formed in may  in anticipation of its ipo on october   we completed the ipo and the following transactions occurred • summit investments conveyed an interest in summit holdings to our general partner as a capital contribution  table of contents • our general partner conveyed its interest in summit holdings to smlp in exchange for a continuation of its  general partner interest in smlp and the idrs • summit investments conveyed its remaining interest in summit holdings to smlp in exchange for i  common units ii  subordinated units and iii the right to receive cash reimbursement for certain capital expenditures made with respect to the contributed assets and • smlp issued  common units to the public since the ipo we have issued additional common units and general partner interests in connection with drop down transactions one thirdparty acquisition and certain unitbased compensation awards in february  the subordinated units converted to common units on a oneforone basis for additional information see notes   and  to the consolidated financial statements business strategies our principal business strategy is to increase the amount of cash distributions we make to our unitholders over time our plan for continuing to execute this strategy includes the following key components • maintaining our focus on feebased revenue with minimal direct commodity price exposure as we expand our business we intend to maintain our focus on providing midstream energy services under feebased arrangements our midstream services are provided under primarily longterm and feebased contracts with original terms of up to  years we believe that our focus on feebased revenues with minimal direct commodity price exposure is essential to maintaining stable cash flows • capitalizing on organic growth opportunities to maximize throughput on our existing systems we intend to continue to leverage our management teams expertise in constructing developing and optimizing our midstream assets to grow our business through organic development projects we believe that our broad and geographically diverse operating footprint provides us with a competitive advantage to pursue organic development projects that are designed to extend our geographic reach diversify our customer base expand our midstream service offerings increase the number of our hydrocarbon receipt points and maximize volume throughput • diversifying our asset base by expanding our midstream service offerings to new geographic areas our gathering operations in the utica bakken barnett and marcellus shale plays and the piceance and dj basins currently represent our core business we intend to pursue opportunities to diversify our operations into other geographic regions through both greenfield development projects and acquisitions from third parties • partnering with producers to provide midstream services for their development projects in highgrowth unconventional resource plays we seek to promote commercial relationships with established and wellcapitalized producers that are willing to serve as key customers and commit to longterm mvcs andor amis we will continue to pursue partnership opportunities with established producers to develop new midstream energy infrastructure in unconventional resource basins that we believe will complement our existing assets andor enhance our overall business by facilitating our entry into new basins these opportunities generally consist of a strategic acreage position in an unconventional resource play that is wellpositioned for accelerated production but has limited existing midstream energy infrastructure to support such growth competitive strengths we believe that we will be able to execute the components of our principal business strategy successfully because of the following competitive strengths • strategically located assets in core areas of prolific unconventional resource basins supported by partnerships with large producers we believe our assets are strategically positioned within the core areas of five established unconventional resource basins the geologic formations in the basins served by our assets have either relatively low drilling and completion costs highly economic production profiles or a combination of both which incentivize producers to develop more actively than in more marginal areas • feebased revenues underpinned by longterm contracts with amis and mvcs a substantial majority of our revenues for the year ended december   were generated under longterm and feebased  table of contents gathering and processing agreements we believe that longterm feebased gathering and processing agreements enhance the stability of our cash flows by limiting our direct commodity price exposure • capital structure and financial flexibility at december   we had  billion of total indebtedness outstanding see notes   and  to the consolidated financial statements and the unused portion of our  billion revolving credit facility totaled  million  under the terms of our revolving credit facility our total leverage ratio total net indebtedness to consolidated trailing month ebitda as defined in the credit agreement was approximately  to  at december   which compares with the thenexisting total leverage ratio upper limit of not more than  to  as defined in the credit agreement • relationship with a large and committed financial sponsor our sponsor is an experienced energy investor with a proven track record of making substantial longterm investments in highquality energy assets in addition to its direct investment in summit investments energy capital partners began purchasing our common units in open market transactions commencing in december  and concluding in june  we believe that the relationship with and support of our sponsor is a competitive advantage as it brings not only significant financial and management experience but also numerous relationships throughout the energy industry that we believe will continue to benefit us as we seek to grow our business • experienced management team with a proven record of asset acquisition construction development operations and integration expertise our board members and senior leadership team have extensive energy experience see item  directors executive officers and corporate governance—directors and executive officers and a proven track record of identifying consummating financing and integrating significant acquisitions in addition to partnering with major producers to construct and develop midstream energy infrastructure our midstream assets our midstream assets including assets in which we have a significant ownership interest currently operate in the following unconventional resource plays • the utica shale which is served by ohio gathering and summit utica • the williston basin which is served by bison midstream polar and divide and tioga midstream • the piceancedj basins which is served by grand river and niobrara gp • the barnett shale which is served by dfw midstream and • the marcellus shale which is served by mountaineer midstream we compete with other midstream companies producers and intrastate and interstate pipelines competition for volumes is primarily based on reputation commercial terms service levels access to enduse markets geographic proximity of existing assets to a producers acreage and available capacity we may also face competition to gather production drilled outside of our amis and attract producer volumes to our gathering systems additionally we could face incremental competition to the extent we make acquisitions we earn revenue by providing gathering treating andor processing services pursuant to primarily longterm and feebased gathering and processing agreements with some of the largest and most active producers in north america the feebased nature of these agreements enhances the stability of our cash flows by limiting our direct commodity price exposure the significant features of our gathering and processing agreements and the gathering systems to which they relate are discussed in more detail below for additional operating and financial performance information on a consolidated basis and by reportable segment see the results of operations section in item  mda which is incorporated herein by reference areas of mutual interest the vast majority of our gathering and processing agreements contain amis some of which extend through  the amis generally require that any production by our customers within the amis will be shipped on andor processed by our systems in general our customers have not leased acreage that cover our entire amis but to the extent that they lease additional acreage within our amis in the future any production from wells drilled by them within that ami will be gathered andor processed by our systems under certain of our gathering agreements we have agreed to construct pipeline laterals to connect our gathering systems to pad sites located within the ami however we may choose not to participate in a discretionary  table of contents opportunity presented by a customer if we believe that the project would not meet our internal return expectations under this scenario the customer may in certain circumstances construct the additional infrastructure and sell it to us at a price equal to their cost plus an applicable margin or in some cases we may release the relevant acreage dedication from the ami minimum volume commitments certain of our gathering and processing agreements contain mvcs which like amis benefit the development and ongoing operation of a gathering system because they provide a contracted minimum revenue stream at start up as of december   our mvcs some of which extend through  had a weightedaverage remaining life of  years in addition certain of our customers have an aggregate mvc which is a total amount of volume throughput that the customer has agreed to ship andor process on our systems or an equivalent monetary amount over the mvc term in these cases once a customer achieves its aggregate mvc any remaining future mvcs will terminate and the customer will then simply pay the applicable gathering or processing rate multiplied by the actual throughput volumes shipped or processed as a result of this mechanism the weightedaverage remaining period for which our mvcs apply is less than the weightedaverage of the original stated contract terms of our mvcs for additional information on our mvcs see the critical accounting estimates section in mda and notes  and  to the consolidated financial statements utica shale ohio gathering in march  we acquired substantially all of a  ownership interest in ohio gathering from a subsidiary of summit investments nonaffiliated owners have a  ownership interest in ohio gathering ohio gathering comprises a natural gas gathering system and condensate stabilization facility located in the core of the utica shale in southeastern ohio that is currently in service and under development the gathering system spans the condensate liquidsrich and dry gas windows of the utica shale for multiple producers that are targeting natural gas condensate and ngls production from the utica and point pleasant shale formations across harrison guernsey belmont noble and monroe counties in southeastern ohio gulfport and ascent are ohio gatherings key customers condensate and liquidsrich gas production is gathered compressed dehydrated and delivered to the cadiz and seneca processing complexes which are owned by a joint venture between mplx lp “mplx” and the energy and minerals group “emg” dry gas production is gathered compressed dehydrated and delivered to a downstream interconnect with texas eastern transmission or tetco and another thirdparty pipeline which provides access to the northeast and midwest markets substantially all gathering services on the ohio gathering system are provided pursuant to longterm feebased gathering agreements the condensate stabilization facility commenced operations in february   condensate stabilization allows for producers to capture the ngls that would otherwise flash from condensate in atmospheric conditions  as one of the largest stabilization facilities in the utica shale play this facility serves as the origination point for mplx’s cornerstone pipeline which will deliver condensate to marathon petroleum’s refinery in canton ohio our ownership interest in ohio gathering is the primary component of the utica shale reportable segment for additional information see note  to the consolidated financial statements summit utica in march  we acquired certain natural gas gathering pipeline dehydration and compression assets in the utica shale from a subsidiary of summit investments we refer to these assets as the summit utica system the summit utica system is a natural gas gathering system located in the appalachian basin in belmont and monroe counties in southeastern ohio and serves producers targeting the dry gas window of the utica and point pleasant shale formations the system which includes xto and ascent as its key customers is currently in

bison midstream in june  we acquired certain associated natural gas gathering pipeline dehydration and compression assets in the williston basin from a subsidiary of summit investments we refer to these assets as the bison midstream system the bison midstream system is located in mountrail and burke counties in northwestern north dakota it consists of low and highpressure pipeline and seven compressor stations and includes gathering pipelines ranging from three inches to  inches in diameter bison midstream gathers compresses and treats associated natural gas that exists in the crude oil stream produced from the bakken and three forks shale formations these formations are primarily targeted for crude oil production as such producer drilling and completion activity decisions and consequently bison midstreams volume throughput are based largely on the prevailing price of crude oil our gathering agreements for the bison midstream system include longterm feebased or percentofproceeds contracts volume throughput on the bison midstream system is underpinned by mvcs from its key customers in addition to its percentofproceeds gathering agreement with oasis and its feebased gathering agreement with a large us independent crude oil and natural gas company the bison midstream system is also supported by other feebased gathering agreements natural gas gathered on the bison midstream system is delivered to aux sable midstream llcs palermo conditioning plant in palermo north dakota and then delivered to its  bcfd natural gas processing plant in channahon illinois the bison midstream system currently provides associated natural gas midstream services for the williston basin reportable segment polar and divide in may  we acquired certain crude oil and produced water gathering systems and recently commissioned transmission pipelines in the williston basin from a subsidiary of summit investments in connection with the  drop down we also acquired certain additional crude oil and produced water gathering pipelines we refer to these assets which commenced operations in the second quarter of  as the polar and divide system the polar and divide system which is located primarily in williams and divide counties in northwestern north dakota owns operates and is currently developing crude oil and produced water gathering systems and transmission pipelines serving the bakken and three forks shale formations the polar and divide system is underpinned by two longterm feebased gathering agreements with whiting and sm energy in addition to whiting and sm energy the polar and divide system is also supported by other longterm feebased gathering agreements and has executed agreements to expand the system to connect additional customer pad sites crude oil that is gathered by the polar and divide system is primarily delivered to crestwood equity partners lps colt hub rail facility in epping north dakota and produced water is delivered to thirdparty disposal facilities located throughout the williston basin the polar and divide system also has interconnects into enbridge’s north dakota pipeline system in williams county north dakota and global partners lps basin transload rail terminal in columbus north dakota and has other projects underway to interconnect with additional longhaul takeaway pipelines the polar and divide system currently provides crude oil and produced water midstream services for the williston basin reportable segment tioga midstream in march  we acquired certain associated natural gas crude oil and produced water gathering systems in the williston basin from a subsidiary of summit investments we refer to these assets which commenced natural gas operations in the fourth quarter of  and liquids operations in the third quarter of  as the tioga midstream system the tioga midstream system is located in williams county north dakota  all gathering services on the tioga midstream system are provided pursuant to longterm feebased gathering agreements with hess which is primarily targeting crude oil production from the bakken and three forks shale formations  the gathering agreements underpinning the tioga system include an annual rate redetermination  table of contents mechanism which effectively serves to protect future cash flows by resetting the gathering rate upward from preestablished base gathering rates in the event that hess varies from certain preestablished minimum production thresholds the annual rate redeterminations can also reset the gathering rate lower in the event that hess exceeds the minimum production threshold all crude oil produced water and natural gas gathered on the tioga midstream system is delivered to downstream pipelines and disposal wells

and compression assets in the piceance basin from a third party we refer to these assets as the grand river system the grand river system is primarily located in garfield county one of the largest natural gas producing counties in colorado it gathers natural gas from the mesaverde formation and the mancos and niobrara shale formations located within the piceance basin in march  we acquired certain natural gas gathering pipeline dehydration compression and processing assets in the piceance basin from a subsidiary of summit investments we refer to these assets as the red rock gathering system or red rock gathering summit investments acquired red rock gathering from a subsidiary of energy transfer partners lp in october  red rock gathering gathers and processes natural gas from the mesaverde formation and the mancos and niobrara shale formations located in western colorado and eastern utah red rock gathering is primarily located in garfield rio blanco and mesa counties in colorado and uintah and grand counties in utah the grand river and red rock gathering systems have been connected and are managed as a single system which we collectively refer to as the grand river system the grand river system is primarily a lowpressure gathering system that was originally designed to gather natural gas produced from directional wells targeting the liquidsrich mesaverde formation the mesaverde is a shallow tight sands geologic formation that producers have targeted with directional drilling for several decades we also gather natural gas from our customers wells targeting the mancos and niobrara shale formations which underlie the mesaverde formation via a mediumpressure gathering system natural gas gathered andor processed on the grand river system is compressed dehydrated processed andor discharged to downstream pipelines serving i enterprise product partners  bcfd processing facility located in meeker colorado ii williams partners lps northwest pipeline and iii kinder morgan incs transcolorado pipeline system processed ngls from grand river are injected into enterprises midamerica pipeline system or delivered to local markets in addition certain of our gathering agreements with our grand river customers permit us to retain condensate volumes that naturally discharge from the liquidsrich natural gas as it moves across our system the grand river system has multiple longterm feebased gathering agreements with encana as well as feebased agreements with black hills exploration and production inc black hills and terra both of which include longterm acreage dedications and mvcs cert ain of the grand river systems other gathering and processing agreements include mvcs and amis in  we executed an expansion agreement with a wholly owned subsidiary of ursa resources group ii llc ursa to provide additional throughput capacity in exchange for new mvcs this new capacity will be utilized by ursa as it executes a drilling plan through  in connection with the black hills gathering agreement in march  we commissioned a  mmcfd cryogenic processing plant and related gas gathering infrastructure in the debeque colorado area to support black hills development of its acreage targeting the liquidsrich mancos and  table of contents niobrara formations in connection with the terra gathering agreement we agreed to expand our gathering and compression services by constructing gas gathering infrastructure in the rifle colorado area we anticipate that the majority of our nearterm throughput on the grand river system will continue to originate from the mesaverde formation we expect to continue to pursue additional volumes on the lowpressure system to more fully utilize the systems existing throughput capacity in addition we believe that the grand river system is optimally located for expansion to gather future production from the mancos and niobrara shale formations the grand river system currently provides midstream services for the piceancedj basins reportable segment niobrara gp in march  we acquired certain associated natural gas gathering systems in the dj basin from a subsidiary of summit investments we refer to these assets which were operational when purchased by summit investments as the niobrara gp system the system which is located in weld county colorado comprises a lowpressure

midstream in  and  we acquired certain natural gas gathering pipeline and compression assets in the barnett shale from third parties we refer to these assets as the dfw midstream system the dfw midstream system is primarily located in southeastern tarrant county in northcentral texas as the largest natural gasproducing county in texas we consider this area to be the core of the core of the barnett shale because of the quality of the geology and the high production profile of the wells drilled to date based on peak month average daily production rates sourced from the railroad commission of texas as of december  this area contains the most prolific wells in the barnett shale for example the two largest and five of the  largest wells drilled in the barnett shale are connected to the dfw midstream system the dfw midstream system which includes gathering pipelines ranging from four inches to  inches in diameter is located under both private and public property and is partially located along existing electric transmission corridors compression on the system is powered by electricity to offset the costs we incur to operate the systems electricdrive compressors we either retain a fixed percentage of the natural gas that we gather or pass through a portion of the power expense to our customers the dfw midstream system currently has six primary interconnections with thirdparty primarily intrastate pipelines these interconnections enable us to connect our customers directly or indirectly with the major natural gas market hubs in texas and louisiana the dfw midstream system is underpinned by a longterm feebased gathering agreement with total and by other longterm feebased gathering agreements we designed the dfw midstream system to benefit from incremental volumes arising from highdensity infill drilling on existing pad sites that are already connected to the gathering system and as such would not require significant additional capital expenditures development of the dfw midstream system has enabled our customers to efficiently produce natural gas by utilizing horizontal drilling techniques from pad sites already connected in our amis given the urban nature of southeastern tarrant county we expect that the majority of future natural gas drilling in this area will occur from existing pad site locations the dfw midstream system

reportable segment as of december       throughput capacity mmcfd marcellus shale       contract terms related to amis and mvcs are excluded for confidentiality purposes mountaineer midstream in june  we acquired certain highpressure natural gas gathering pipelines and compression assets located in the liquidsrich window of the marcellus shale play from an affiliate of markwest energy partners lp “markwest” which was subsequently acquired by mplx we refer to these assets as the mountaineer midstream system this system which operates in the appalachian basin benefits from its location in doddridge and harrison counties in west virginia where it gathers natural gas under a longterm feebased contract with antero the mountaineer midstream system consists of newly constructed highpressure natural gas gathering pipelines ranging from eight inches to  inches in diameter and two compressor stations this liquidsrich natural gas gathering and compression system serves as a critical inlet to mplxs sherwood processing complex a primary destination for liquidsrich natural gas in northern west virginia which provides downstream access to midwest midatlantic and northeast regions of the united states in november  we amended our original feebased natural gas gathering agreement with antero whereby we agreed to construct approximately nine miles of highpressure inch pipeline on the mountaineer midstream system the zinnia loop the zinnia loop which was commissioned in  is underpinned by a minimum revenue commitment from antero and increased throughput capacity to  mmcfd to support anteros drilling activities the mountaineer midstream system currently provides midstream services for the marcellus shale reportable segment for additional information relating to our business and gathering systems see the trends and outlook and results of operations sections in item  mda regulation of the natural gas and crude oil industries general sales by producers of natural gas crude oil condensate and ngls are currently made at market prices however gathering and transportation services are subject to various types of regulation which may affect certain aspects of our business and the market for our services ferc regulates the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce and the interstate transportation of crude oil petroleum products and ngls ferc regulation includes reviewing and accepting or approving rates and other terms and conditions for such transportation services ferc is also authorized to prevent and sanction market manipulation in natural gas markets while the ftc is authorized to prevent and sanction market manipulation in petroleum markets state and municipal regulations may apply to the production and gathering of natural gas the construction and operation of natural gas and crude oil facilities and the rates and practices of gathering systems and intrastate pipelines regulation of crude oil and natural gas exploration production and sales sales of crude oil and ngls are not currently regulated and are transacted at market prices in  the us congress enacted the natural gas wellhead decontrol act which removed all remaining price and nonprice controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas ferc which has the authority under the nga to regulate the prices and other terms and conditions of the sale of natural gas for resale in interstate commerce has issued blanket authorizations for all gas resellers subject to its regulation except interstate pipelines to resell natural gas at market prices either congress or ferc with respect to the resale of gas in interstate commerce however could reimpose price controls in the future exploration and production operations are subject to various types of federal state and local regulation including but not limited to permitting well location methods of drilling well operations and conservation of resources while these regulations do not directly apply to our business they may affect our customers ability to produce natural gas regulation of the gathering and transportation of natural gas and crude oil we believe that the majority of our natural gas pipeline facilities qualify as gathering facilities that are exempt from the jurisdiction of ferc on february   polar midstreams ferc tariff for interstate movements of crude oil on its little muddy pipeline in north dakota became effective that tariff is subject to ferc jurisdiction and oversight pursuant to fercs  table of contents authority under the ica we are also generally subject to fercs antimarket manipulation regulations the distinction between federally unregulated natural gas and crude oil pipelines and fercregulated natural gas and crude oil pipelines has been the subject of extensive litigation and changes in the policies and interpretations of laws and regulations in addition the status of any individual pipeline system may be determined by ferc on a casebycase basis although ferc has made no determinations as to the status of our facilities consequently the classification and regulation of pipeline systems including some of our pipelines could change based on future determinations by ferc or the courts intrastate pipelines which may include some pipelines that perform gathering functions may be subject to safety regulation by the dot although typically state regulatory authorities operating under a federal certification perform this function state regulatory authorities also have jurisdiction over the rates and practices of intrastate pipelines and gathering systems including requirements for ratable takes or nondiscriminatory access to pipeline services the basis for state regulation and the degree of regulatory oversight of gathering systems and intrastate pipelines varies from state to state in texas we are regulated as a gas utility and have filed tariffs with the railroad commission of texas to establish rates and terms of service for our dfw midstream system assets we have not been required to file tariffs in the other states in which we operate although we are required to submit shape files and other information regarding the location and construction of underground gathering pipelines in north dakota the states in which we operate have adopted complaintbased regulation that allows natural gas producers and shippers to file complaints with state regulators in an effort to resolve access issues and rate grievances among other matters state authorities in the states in which we operate generally have not initiated investigations of the rates or practices of gathering systems or intrastate pipelines in the absence of a complaint state regulation of intrastate pipelines continues to evolve and may become more stringent in the future for example the north dakota industrial commission recently adopted rule changes that resulted in additional construction and monitoring requirements for all pipelines including but not limited to those that transport produced water and has recently adopted reclamation bonding requirements for certain underground gathering pipelines in north dakota natural gas crude oil and produced water production gathering and transportation including the construction of new gathering facilities and expansion of existing gathering facilities may also be subject to local regulation such as approval and permit requirements antimarket manipulation rules we are subject to the antimarket manipulation provisions in the nga and the ngpa as amended by the energy policy act of  which authorize ferc to impose fines of up to  per day per violation of the nga the ngpa or their implementing regulations in addition the ftc holds statutory authority under the energy independence and security act of  to prevent market manipulation in petroleum markets including the authority to request that a court impose fines of up to  per violation these agencies have promulgated broad rules and regulations prohibiting fraud and manipulation in oil and gas markets the cftc is directed under the cea to prevent price manipulations in the commodity and futures markets including the energy futures markets pursuant to statutory authority the cftc has adopted antimarket manipulation regulations that prohibit fraud and price manipulation in the commodity and futures markets the cftc also has statutory authority to seek civil penalties of up to the greater of  per day per violation or triple the monetary gain to the violator for violations of the antimarket manipulation sections of the cea we are also subject to various reporting requirements that are designed to facilitate transparency and prevent market manipulation safety and maintenance we are subject to regulation by the dot which establishes federal safety standards for the design construction operation and maintenance of natural gas and crude oil pipeline facilities in the pipeline safety act of  congress expanded the dots regulatory authority to include regulated gathering lines that had previously been exempt from federal jurisdiction the pipeline safety improvement act of  and the pipeline inspection protection enforcement and safety act of  established mandatory inspections for certain us oil and natural gas transmission pipelines in high consequence areas the pipeline safety regulatory certainty and job creation act of  reauthorizes funding for federal pipeline safety programs through  increases penalties for safety violations establishes additional safety requirements for newly constructed pipelines and requires studies of certain safety issues that could result in the adoption of new regulatory requirements for existing pipelines the dot has delegated the implementation of safety requirements to phmsa which has adopted and enforces safety standards and procedures applicable to a limited number of our pipelines in addition many states including the states in which we operate have adopted regulations that are identical to or more restrictive than existing dot regulations for intrastate pipelines among the regulations applicable to us phmsa requires pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs for certain pipelines located in high consequence areas which include highpopulation areas such as the dallasfort worth greater metropolitan area where our dfw midstream system  table of contents is located while the majority of our pipelines meet the dot definition of gathering lines and are thus currently exempt from the integrity management requirements of phmsa we also operate a limited number of pipelines that are subject to the integrity management requirements those regulations require operators including us to • perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity • identify and characterize applicable threats to pipeline segments that could impact a high consequence area • maintain processes for data collection integration and analysis • repair and remediate pipelines as necessary • adopt and maintain procedures standards and training programs for control room operations and • implement preventive and mitigating actions in october  phmsa proposed changes to its pipeline safety regulations that would significantly extend the integrity management requirements to previously exempt pipelines and would impose additional obligations on pipeline operators that are already subject to the integrity management requirements phmsa’s proposed rule would also require annual reporting of safetyrelated conditions and incident reports for all gathering lines and gravity lines including pipelines that are currently exempt from phmsa regulations phmsa recently adopted regulations that impose pipeline incident prevention and response measures on pipeline operators phmsa has also issued an advisory bulletin providing guidance on verification of records related to pipeline maximum allowable operating pressure pipelines that do not meet phmsa’s record verification standards may be required to perform additional testing or reduce their operating pressures gathering systems like ours are also subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations including the federal occupational safety and health act and comparable state statutes the purposes of which are to protect the health and safety of workers both generally and within the pipeline industry in addition the occupational safety and health administration hazard communication standard epa community righttoknow regulations under title iii of the federal superfund amendment and reauthorization act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that such information be provided to employees state and local government authorities and the public environmental matters general our operation of pipelines and other assets for the gathering treating andor processing of natural gas and the gathering of crude oil and produced water is subject to stringent and complex federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment as an owner or operator of these assets we must comply with these laws and regulations at the federal state and local levels these laws and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities in many ways such as • requiring the installation of pollutioncontrol equipment or otherwise restricting the way we operate • limiting or prohibiting construction activities in sensitive areas such as wetlands coastal regions or areas inhabited by endangered or threatened species • delaying system modification or upgrades during permit reviews • requiring investigatory and remedial actions to mitigate pollution conditions caused by our operations or attributable to former operations and • enjoining the operations of facilities deemed to be in noncompliance with permits or permit requirements issued pursuant to or imposed by such environmental laws and regulations failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger administrative civil and criminal enforcement measures including the assessment of monetary penalties certain environmental statutes impose strict joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where substances hydrocarbons or wastes have been disposed or otherwise released moreover it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances hydrocarbons or other waste products into the environment the trend in environmental regulation is to place more stringent requirements resulting in more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment thus there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation and actual future expenditures may be  table of contents different from the amounts we currently anticipate we try to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and plan accordingly to remain in compliance with changing environmental laws and regulations and to minimize the costs of such compliance we also actively participate in industry groups that help formulate recommendations for addressing existing and future regulations the following is a discussion of the material environmental laws and regulations that relate to our business hazardous substances and waste our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to the management and release of solid and hazardous wastes and other substances including hydrocarbons these laws generally regulate the generation storage treatment transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and may impose strict joint and several liability for the investigation and remediation of affected areas where hazardous substances may have been released or disposed furthermore the toxic substances control act and analogous state laws impose requirements on the use storage and disposal of various chemicals and chemical substances at our facilities cercla and comparable state laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment we may handle hazardous substances within the meaning of cercla or similar state statutes in the course of our ordinary operations and as a result may be jointly and severally liable under cercla for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which these hazardous substances have been released into the environment we also generate industrial wastes that are subject to the requirements of the rcra and comparable state statutes while the rcra regulates both solid and hazardous wastes it imposes strict requirements on the generation storage treatment transportation and disposal of hazardous wastes although we generate minimal hazardous waste it is possible that nonhazardous wastes which could include wastes currently generated during our operations will in the future be designated as hazardous wastes and therefore be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements moreover from time to time the epa and state regulatory agencies have considered the adoption of stricter disposal standards for nonhazardous wastes including natural gas wastes we currently own or lease properties where hydrocarbons are being or have been handled for many years although we believe that the previous operators utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us or on or under the other locations where these hydrocarbons and wastes have been transported for treatment or disposal without our knowledge these properties and the wastes disposed thereon may be subject to cercla the rcra and analogous state laws under these laws we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators to clean up contaminated property including contaminated groundwater or to perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination we are not currently aware of any facts events or conditions relating to such requirements that could materially impact our operations or financial condition air emissions our operations are subject to the federal caa and comparable state and local laws and regulations these laws and regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources including our facilities and also impose various monitoring control and reporting requirements such laws and regulations may require that we obtain preapproval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions obtain and strictly comply with air permits containing various emissions and operational limitations and utilize specific emission control technologies to limit emissions our failure to comply with these requirements could subject us to monetary penalties injunctions conditions or restrictions on operations and criminal enforcement actions furthermore we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future to obtain and maintain operating permits and approvals for air pollutant emitting sources in october  the epa issued a new lower naaqs for ozone the previous ozone standard was set at  parts per billion ppb the revised standard has been lowered to  ppb the lowered ozone naaqs could result in a significant expansion of ozone nonattainment areas across the united states including areas in which we operate which could subject us to increased regulatory burdens in the form of more stringent emission controls emission offset requirements and increased permitting delays and costs impacts from the new standard have not yet been determined as states are still in the process of incorporating the new standard into their respective state implementation plans we will continue to monitor developments to determine if any adverse effects on our operations can be expected on june   the epa finalized revisions to its  new source performance standard nsps oooo for the oil and gas industry to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases  most notably methane  along with smogforming vocs the revisions which are published in the federal register under subpart ooooa included the  table of contents addition of methane to the pollutants covered by the rule along with requirements for detecting and repairing leaks at gathering and boosting stations the revised rule applies to sources that have been modified constructed or reconstructed after september   while we do not expect this rule to significantly impact our existing operations future modifications or new construction may be adversely affected by the revised rule on november   the bureau of land management blm issued a final rule to reduce venting and flaring of natural gas on public and indian lands the final rule mirrors many of the requirements found in nsps ooooa with additional natural gas royalty requirements for flared volumes at sites already connected to gas capture infrastructure while the rule is expected to have little or no direct impact on our operations our customers that are primarily upstream wellhead operators may be impacted by the requirements in this rule water discharges the cwa and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters which impacts our ability to conduct construction activities in waters and wetlands certain state regulations and the general permits issued under the federal national pollutant discharge elimination system program prohibit the discharge of pollutants and chemicals in addition the clean water act and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities these permits require us to control storm water runoff from some of our facilities some states also maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative civil and criminal penalties for noncompliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the clean water act and analogous state laws and regulations oil pollution act the opa requires the preparation of an spcc plan for facilities engaged in drilling producing gathering storing processing refining transferring distributing using or consuming oil and oil products and which due to their location could reasonably be expected to discharge oil in harmful quantities into or upon the navigable waters of the united states the owner or operator of an spccregulated facility is required to prepare a written sitespecific spill prevention plan which details how a facilitys operations comply with the requirements to be in compliance the facilitys spcc plan must satisfy all of the applicable requirements for drainage bulk storage tanks tank car and truck loading and unloading transfer operations intrafacility piping inspections and records security and training certain of our facilities are classified as spccregulated facilities we believe that they are in substantial compliance with all applicable requirements of opa hydraulic fracturing hydraulic fracturing is an important and increasingly common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas andor crude oil from dense subsurface rock formations and is primarily presently regulated by state agencies however congress has in the past and may in the future consider legislation to regulate hydraulic fracturing by federal agencies many states have already adopted laws andor regulations that require disclosure of the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing and are considering legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting disclosure and well construction requirements on oil andor natural gas drilling activities the epa is also moving forward with various related regulatory actions including approving new regulations requiring green completions of hydraulicallyfractured wells and corresponding reporting requirements that went into effect in  revisions to the green completion regulations were finalized in june  and include additional requirements to reduce methane and vocs we do not believe these new regulations will have a direct effect on our operations but because natural gas andor crude oil production using hydraulic fracturing is growing rapidly in the united states if new or more stringent federal state or local legal restrictions relating to such drilling activities or to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted this could result in a reduction in the supply of natural gas andor crude oil endangered species act the endangered species act restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats some of our pipelines may be located in areas that are designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species national environmental policy act the nepa establishes a national environmental policy and goals for the protection maintenance and enhancement of the environment and provides a process for implementing these goals within federal agencies major projects having the potential to significantly impact the environment require review under nepa many of our activities are covered under categorical exclusions which results in an expedited nepa review process large upstream and downstream projects with significant cumulative impacts may be subject to longer nepa review processes which could impact the timing of those projects and our services associated with them climate change the epa has adopted regulations under the caa that among other things establish ghg emission limits from motor vehicles as well as establish psd construction and title v operating permit reviews for certain large stationary sources that are potential major sources of ghg emissions facilities required to obtain  table of contents psd permits for their ghg emissions also will be required to meet “best available control technology” standards that will be established by the states or in some cases by the epa on a casebycase basis epa rules also require the reporting of ghg emissions from specified large ghgemitting sources in the united states including onshore and offshore oil and natural gas systems we are required to report under these rules for our assets that have ghg emissions above the reporting thresholds in october  the epa issued revisions to subpart w of the ghg reporting rule to include reporting requirements for gathering and booster stations onshore natural gas transmission pipelines and completions and workovers of oil wells with hydraulic fracturing this development will result in increased monitoring and reporting for our operations and for upstream producers for whom we provide midstream services the epa continues to consider additional climate change requirements for the energy industry on november   the epa issued an information collection request icr under section  of the caa to gather and evaluate source specific information from the oil and natural gas sector the information will be used to potentially draft new regulations to reduce methane emissions from existing sources not currently covered by the nsps under subparts oooo and ooooa it is unclear what impact this information collection request will have on future methane rulemakings and changes in political administration may impact whether this information is used for any future methane rulemakings as well as enforcement development and implementation of climate change requirements generally we will continue to monitor such developments to determine if they will impact our operations in addition almost half of the states either individually or through multistate regional initiatives have begun to address ghg emissions primarily through the planned development of emission inventories or regional ghg cap and trade programs most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring either major sources of emissions such as electric power plants or major producers of fuels such as refineries and gas processing plants to acquire and surrender emission allowances in general the number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year until the overall ghg emission reduction goal is achieved depending on the scope of a particular program we could be required to purchase and surrender allowances for ghg emissions resulting from our operations eg at compressor stations although most of the statelevel initiatives have to date been focused on large sources of ghg emissions such as electric power plants it is possible that certain components of our operations such as our gasfired compressors could become subject to statelevel ghgrelated regulation further in december  over  countries including the united states reached an agreement to reduce global ghg emissions the agreement entered into force in november  after over  countries including the united states ratified or otherwise consented to be bound by the agreement legislation or regulations that may be adopted to address climate change could also affect the markets for our products by making our products more or less desirable than competing sources of energy to the extent that our products are competing with higher ghgemitting energy sources our products would become more desirable in the market with more stringent limitations on ghg emissions conversely to the extent that our products are competing with lower ghgemitting energy sources such as solar and wind our products would become less desirable in the market with more stringent limitations on ghg emissions other information employees  smlp does not have any employees all of the employees required to conduct and support its operations are employed by summit investments but these individuals are sometimes referred to as its employees the officers of our general partner manage our operations and activities as of december   summit investments employed   people who provide direct fulltime support to our operations none of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and we have never experienced any business interruption as a result of any labor disputes availability of reports  we make certain filings with the sec including among other filings our annual report on form k quarterly reports on form q current reports on form k and all amendments and exhibits to those reports available free of charge through our

table of contents item a risk factors item a risk factors is divided into the following sections • risks related to our business • risks inherent in an investment in us • tax risks risks related to our business our principal business strategy is to increase the amount of cash distributions we make to our unitholders over time we may not have sufficient cash from operations following the establishment of cash reserves and payment of fees and expenses including cost reimbursements of expenses incurred on our behalf by our general partner to enable us to pay the mqd or any distribution to holders of our common units to pay the mqd of  per unit per quarter or  per unit on an annualized basis we will require available cash of  million per quarter or  million per year based on units outstanding as of december    we may not have sufficient available cash from operating surplus each quarter to pay the mqd the amount of cash we can distribute on our units principally depends upon the amount of cash we generate from our operations which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on among other things • the volumes we gather treat and process • the level of production of natural gas and crude oil and associated volumes of produced water from wells connected to our gathering systems which is dependent in part on the demand for and the market prices of crude oil natural gas and ngls • damage to pipelines facilities related equipment and surrounding properties caused by earthquakes floods fires severe weather explosions and other natural disasters accidents and acts of terrorism • leaks or accidental releases of hazardous materials into the environment • weather conditions and seasonal trends • changes in the fees we charge for our services • the level of competition from other midstream energy companies in our areas of operation • changes in the level of our operating maintenance and general and administrative expenses • regulatory action affecting the supply of or demand for crude oil natural gas and ngls the fees we can charge how we contract for services our existing contracts our operating and maintenance costs or our operating flexibility and • prevailing economic and market conditions in addition the actual amount of cash we will have available for distribution will depend on other factors some of which are beyond our control including • the level and timing of capital expenditures we make • the level of our operating maintenance and general and administrative expenses including reimbursements of expenses incurred on our behalf by our general partner • the cost of acquisitions if any • our debt service requirements and other liabilities including the deferred purchase price obligation • fluctuations in our working capital needs • our ability to borrow funds and access capital markets • restrictions contained in our debt agreements • the amount of cash reserves established by our general partner • not receiving anticipated shortfall payments from our customers • adverse legal judgments fines and settlements and  table of contents • other business risks affecting our cash levels we depend on certain customers for a significant portion of our revenues the loss of or material nonpayment or nonperformance by or the curtailment of production by any one or more of these customers could materially adversely affect our revenues cash flows and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders certain of our customers may have material financial and liquidity issues or may as a result of operational incidents or other events be disproportionately affected as compared to larger bettercapitalized companies any material nonpayment or nonperformance by any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and cash flows and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders we expect our exposure to concentrated risk of nonpayment or nonperformance to continue as long as we remain substantially dependent on a relatively small number of customers for a significant portion of our revenues if our customers curtail or reduce production in our areas of operation it could reduce throughput on our system and therefore materially adversely affect our revenues cash flows and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders we are exposed to the creditworthiness and performance of our customers suppliers and contract counterparties and any material nonpayment or nonperformance by one or more of these parties could materially adversely affect our financial and operating results although we attempt to assess the creditworthiness and associated liquidity of our customers suppliers and contract counterparties there can be no assurance that our assessments will be accurate or that there will not be a rapid or unanticipated deterioration in their creditworthiness which may have an adverse impact on our business results of operations financial condition and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders in addition there can be no assurance that our contract counterparties will perform or adhere to existing or future contractual arrangements including making any required shortfall payments the policies and procedures we use to manage our exposure to credit risk such as credit analysis credit monitoring and if necessary requiring credit support cannot fully eliminate counterparty credit risks to the extent our policies and procedures prove to be inadequate our financial and operational results may be negatively impacted some of our counterparties may be highly leveraged have limited financial resources andor have recently experienced a rating agency downgrade and will be subject to their own operating and regulatory risks even if our credit review and analysis mechanisms work properly we may experience financial losses in our dealings with such parties in addition volatility in commodity prices could have a negative impact on our counterparties which in turn could have a negative impact on their ability to meet their obligations to us any material nonpayment or nonperformance by any of our counterparties or suppliers could require us to pursue substitute counterparties or suppliers for the affected operations or reduce our operations there can be no assurance that any such efforts would be successful or would provide similar financial and operational results adverse developments in our areas of operation could materially adversely impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows and reduce our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders our operations are focused on gathering treating and processing services in five unconventional resource basins i the appalachian basin which includes the utica and point pleasant shale formations in southeastern ohio and the marcellus shale formation in northern west virginia ii the williston basin which includes the bakken and three forks shale formations in northwestern north dakota iii the fort worth basin which includes the barnett shale formation in northcentral texas iv the piceance basin which includes the mesaverde formation and the mancos and niobrara shale formations in western colorado and eastern utah and v the dj basin which includes the which includes the niobrara shale formation in northeastern colorado due to our limited industry and geographic diversity adverse developments in the natural gas and crude oil industries or in our existing areas of operation could have a significantly greater impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows significant prolonged weakness in natural gas ngl and crude oil prices could reduce throughput on our systems and materially adversely affect our revenues and cash available to make cash distributions to our unitholders current natural gas ngl and crude oil prices have had a negative impact on exploration development and production activity in our areas of operation unchanged or lower natural gas ngl and crude oil prices could result in a further decline in the production of natural gas and crude oil thereby resulting in reduced throughput on our gathering systems additionally due to the extended period of historically low natural gas prices and decline in ngl  table of contents and crude oil prices certain of our customers in each of our areas of operations have and others could reduce drilling activity and capital expenditure budgets if natural gas ngl andor crude oil prices remain depressed or decrease further it could cause sustained reductions in exploration or production activity in our areas of operation and result in a further reduction in throughput on our systems which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders because of the natural decline in production from our customers existing wells our success depends in part on our customers replacing declining production and also on our ability to maintain levels of throughput on our systems any decrease in the volumes that we gather and process could materially adversely affect our business and operating results the customer volumes that support our business depend on the level of production from natural gas and crude oil wells connected to our systems the production from which may be less than expected and will naturally decline over time as a result our cash flows associated with these wells will also decline over time to maintain or increase throughput levels on our systems we must obtain new sources of volume throughput the primary factors affecting our ability to obtain new sources of volume throughput include i the level of successful drilling activity in our areas of operation and ii our ability to compete for new volumes on our systems we have no control over the level of drilling activity in our areas of operation the amount of reserves associated with wells connected to our systems or the rate at which production from a well declines in addition we have no control over producers or their drilling and production decisions which are affected by among other things • the availability and cost of capital • prevailing and projected hydrocarbon commodity prices • demand for crude oil natural gas and other hydrocarbon products including ngls • levels of reserves • geological considerations • environmental or other governmental regulations including the availability of drilling permits and the regulation of hydraulic fracturing and • the availability of drilling rigs and other costs of production and equipment fluctuations in energy prices can also greatly affect the development of new crude oil and natural gas reserves drilling and production activity generally decreases as commodity prices decrease in general terms the prices of crude oil natural gas and other hydrocarbon products fluctuate in response to changes in supply and demand market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control these factors include • worldwide economic and geopolitical conditions • weather conditions and seasonal trends • the levels of domestic production and consumer demand • the availability of imported lng • the ability to export lng • the availability of transportation and storage systems with adequate capacity • the volatility and uncertainty of regional pricing differentials and premiums • the price and availability of alternative fuels • the effect of energy conservation measures • the nature and extent of governmental regulation and taxation and • the anticipated future prices of crude oil natural gas and other hydrocarbon products including ngls because of these factors even if new crude oil or natural gas reserves are known to exist in areas served by our assets producers may choose not to develop those reserves if reductions in drilling activity result in our inability to maintain the current levels of throughput on our systems those reductions could reduce our revenues and cash flows and materially adversely affect our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders in addition it may be more difficult to maintain or increase the current volumes on our gathering systems as several of the formations in the unconventional resource plays in which we operate generally have higher initial  table of contents production rates and steeper production decline curves than wells in more conventional basins should we determine that the economics of our gathering treating and processing assets do not justify the capital expenditures needed to grow or maintain volumes associated therewith revenues associated with these assets will decline over time in addition to capital expenditures to support growth the steeper production decline curves associated with unconventional resource plays may require us to incur higher maintenance capital expenditures over time which will reduce our cash available for distribution many of our costs are fixed and do not vary with our throughput these costs will not decline ratably or at all should we experience a reduction in throughput which could result in a decline in our revenues and cash flows and materially adversely affect our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders if our customers do not increase the volumes they provide to our gathering systems our growth strategy and ability to increase cash distributions to our unitholders may be materially adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in attracting new customers andor new gathering opportunities with existing customers our ability to increase cash distributions to our unitholders will be impaired our customers are not obligated to provide additional volumes to our gathering systems and they may determine in the future that drilling activities in areas outside of our current areas of operation are strategically more attractive to them reductions by our customers in our areas of mutual interest could result in reductions in throughput on our systems and materially adversely impact our ability to grow our operations and increase cash distributions to our unitholders certain of our gathering and processing agreements contain provisions that can reduce the cash flow stability that the agreements were designed to achieve we designed those gathering and processing agreements that contain mvc provisions to generate stable cash flows for us over the life of the mvc contract term while also minimizing our direct commodity price risk under certain of these mvcs our customers agree to ship a minimum volume on our gathering systems or send a minimum volume to our processing plants or in some cases to pay a minimum monetary amount over certain periods during the term of the mvc in addition our gathering and processing agreements may also include an aggregate mvc which represents the total amount that the customer must flow on our gathering system or send to our processing plants or an equivalent monetary amount over the mvc term if such customers actual throughput volumes are less than its mvc for the contracted measurement period it must make a shortfall payment to us at the end of the applicable measurement period the amount of the shortfall payment is based on the difference between the actual throughput volume shipped or processed for the applicable period and the mvc for the applicable period multiplied by the applicable fee to the extent that a customers actual throughput volumes are above or below its mvc for the applicable contracted measurement period certain of our gathering agreements contain provisions that allow the customer to use the excess volumes or the shortfall payment to credit against future excess volumes or future shortfall payments which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders we do not intend to obtain independent evaluations of the reserves connected to our gathering systems on a regular or ongoing basis therefore in the future customer volumes on our systems could be less than we anticipate we have not obtained and do not intend to obtain independent evaluations of all of the reserves connected to our systems moreover even if we did obtain independent evaluations of all of the reserves connected to our systems such evaluations may prove to be incorrect crude oil and natural gas reserve engineering requires subjective estimates of underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas and assumptions concerning future crude oil and natural gas prices future production levels and operating and development costs accordingly we may not have accurate estimates of total reserves dedicated to our systems or the anticipated life of such reserves if the total reserves or estimated life of the reserves connected to our gathering systems are less than we anticipate and we are unable to secure additional volumes it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders our industry is highly competitive and increased competitive pressure could materially adversely affect our business and operating results we compete with other midstream companies in our areas of operations some of which are large companies that have greater financial managerial and other resources than we do in addition some of our competitors may have assets in closer proximity to natural gas and crude oil supplies and may have available idle capacity in existing assets that would not require new capital investments for use our competitors may expand or construct gathering systems that would create additional competition for the services we provide to our customers because our customers do not have leases that cover the entirety of our areas of mutual interest noncustomer producers that  table of contents lease acreage within any of our areas of mutual interest may choose to use one of our competitors for their gathering andor processing service needs in addition our customers may develop their own gathering systems outside of our areas of mutual interest our ability to renew or replace existing contracts with our customers at rates sufficient to maintain current revenues and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by the activities of our competitors and our customers all of these competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders we may not be able to renew or replace expiring contracts at favorable rates or on a longterm basis our gathering treating and processing contracts have terms of various durations as these contracts expire we may have to negotiate extensions or renewals with existing customers or enter into new contracts with other customers we may be unable to obtain new contracts on favorable commercial terms if at all we also may be unable to maintain the economic structure of a particular contract with an existing customer or the overall mix of our contract portfolio moreover we may be unable to obtain areas of mutual interest from new customers in the future and we may be unable to renew existing areas of mutual interest with current customers as and when they expire the extension or replacement of existing contracts depends on a number of factors beyond our control including • the level of existing and new competition to provide gathering andor processing services in our areas of operation • the macroeconomic factors affecting gathering treating and processing economics for our current and potential customers • the balance of supply and demand on a shortterm seasonal and longterm basis in our markets • the extent to which the customers in our areas of operation are willing to contract on a longterm basis and • the effects of federal state or local regulations on the contracting practices of our customers to the extent we are unable to renew our existing contracts on terms that are favorable to us or successfully manage our overall contract mix over time our revenues and cash flows could decline and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders could be materially adversely affected if thirdparty pipelines or other midstream facilities interconnected to our gathering systems become partially or fully unavailable our revenues and cash flows and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders could be materially adversely affected our gathering systems connect to thirdparty pipelines and other midstream facilities such as processing plants rail terminals and produced water disposal facilities the continuing operation of such thirdparty pipelines and other midstream facilities is not within our control these pipelines and other midstream facilities may become unavailable due to issues including but not limited to testing turnarounds line repair reduced operating pressure lack of operating capacity regulatory requirements curtailments of receipt or deliveries due to insufficient capacity or because of damage from other hazards in addition we do not have interconnect agreements with all of these pipelines and other facilities and the agreements we do have may be terminated in certain circumstances andor on short notice if any of these pipelines or other midstream facilities become unavailable for any reason or if these third parties are otherwise unwilling to receive or transport the natural gas crude oil and produced water that we gather andor process our revenues cash flows and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders could be materially adversely affected we have a relatively limited ownership history with respect to certain of our assets there could be unknown events or conditions or increased maintenance or repair expenses and downtime associated with our pipelines that could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results we have a relatively limited history of operating certain of our assets there may be historical occurrences or latent issues regarding certain of our pipeline systems of which we may be unaware and that may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations any significant increase in maintenance and repair expenditures or loss of revenue due to the condition of our pipeline systems could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders  table of contents crude oil and natural gas production and gathering may be adversely affected by weather conditions and terrain which in turn could negatively impact the operations of our gathering treating and processing facilities and our construction of additional facilities extended periods of below freezing weather and unseasonably wet weather conditions especially in north dakota ohio and west virginia can be severe and can adversely affect crude oil and natural gas operations due to the potential shutin of producing wells or decreased drilling activities the result of these types of interruptions could result in a decrease in the volumes supplied to our gathering systems further delays and shutdowns caused by severe weather may have a material negative impact on the continuous operations of our gathering treating and processing systems including interruptions in service these types of interruptions could negatively impact our ability to meet our contractual obligations to our customers and thereby give rise to certain termination rights andor the release of dedicated acreage any resulting terminations or releases could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations we also may be required to incur additional costs and expenses in connection with the design and installation of our facilities due to their location and surrounding terrain we may be required to install additional facilities incur additional capital and operating expenditures or experience interruptions in or impairments of our operations to the extent that the facilities are not designed or installed correctly for example certain of our pipeline facilities are located in mountainous areas such as our utica shale and marcellus shale operations which may require specially designed facilities and special installation considerations if such facilities are not designed or installed correctly do not perform as intended or fail we may be required to incur significant capital expenditures to correct or repair the deficiencies or may incur significant damages to or loss of facilities and our operations may be interrupted as a result of deficiencies or failures in addition such deficiencies may cause damage to the surrounding environment including slope failures stream impacts and other natural resource damages and we may as a result also be subject to increased operating expenses or environmental penalties and fines interruptions in operations at any of our facilities may adversely affect our operations and cash flows available for distribution to our unitholders our operations depend upon the infrastructure that we have developed and constructed any significant interruption at any of our gathering treating or processing facilities or in our ability to provide gathering treating or processing services could adversely affect our operations and cash flows available for distribution to our unitholders operations at our facilities could be partially or completely shut down temporarily or permanently as the result of circumstances not within our control such as • severe weather • unscheduled turnarounds or catastrophic events at our physical plants or pipeline facilities • restrictions imposed by governmental authorities or court proceedings • labor difficulties that result in a work stoppage or slowdown • a disruption in the supply of resources necessary to operate our midstream facilities • damage to our facilities resulting from production volumes that do not comply with applicable specifications and • inadequate transportation andor market access to support production volumes including lack of pipeline rail terminals produced water disposal facilities andor thirdparty processing capacity any significant interruption at any of our gathering treating or processing facilities or in our ability to provide gathering treating or processing services could adversely affect our operations and cash flows available for distribution to our unitholders our business involves many hazards and operational risks some of which may not be fully covered by insurance if a significant incident or event occurs for which we are not adequately insured or if we fail to recover all anticipated insurance proceeds for significant incidents or events for which we are insured our operations and financial results could be materially adversely affected our operations are subject to all of the risks and hazards inherent in the operation of gathering treating and processing systems including • damage to pipelines processing plants compression assets related equipment and surrounding properties caused by tornadoes floods fires and other natural disasters and acts of terrorism • inadvertent damage from construction vehicles farm and utility equipment  table of contents • leaks or losses resulting from the malfunction of equipment or facilities • ruptures fires and explosions and • other hazards that could also result in personal injury and loss of life pollution and suspension of operations these risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury andor loss of life severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment and pollution or other environmental damage the location of certain of our systems in or near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers and industrial sites could increase the damages resulting from these risks these risks may also result in curtailment or suspension of our operations a natural disaster or any event such as those described above affecting the areas in which we and our customers operate could have a material adverse effect on our operations accidents or other operating risks could further result in loss of service available to our customers such circumstances including those arising from maintenance and repair activities could result in service interruptions on portions or all of our gathering systems potential customer impacts arising from service interruptions on segments of our gathering systems could include limitations on our ability to satisfy customer requirements obligations to temporarily waive minimum volume commitments during times of constrained capacity and solicitation of existing customers by others for potential new projects that would compete directly with our existing services such circumstances could materially adversely impact our ability to meet contractual obligations and retain customers with a resulting negative impact on our business and results of operations and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders our insurance coverage is provided by policies that cover all of our assets and those of summit investments and its nonsmlp subsidiaries therefore it is possible that an incident or incidents at those subsidiaries could exhaust claim capacity and leave smlp and its subsidiaries exposed to risk of loss should they experience a loss during the same policy cycle in addition although we have a range of insurance programs providing varying levels of protection for public liability damage to property loss of income and certain environmental hazards we may not be insured against all causes of loss claims or damage that may occur if a significant incident or event occurs for which we are not fully insured it could materially adversely affect our operations and financial condition furthermore we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates andor claims by summit investments or its nonsmlp subsidiaries may increase rates on all of the insuredasset group including those owned by smlp and its subsidiaries as a result of industry or market conditions some of which are beyond our control premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies may substantially increase in some instances certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage additionally with regard to the assets we have acquired we have limited indemnification rights to recover from the seller of the assets in the event of any potential environmental liabilities we intend to grow our business in part by seeking strategic acquisition opportunities if we are unable to make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms from third parties our future growth will be affected and the acquisitions we do make may reduce rather than increase our cash generated from operations our ability to grow depends in part on our ability to make acquisitions that increase our cash generated from operations the acquisition component of our strategy also relies in part on the continued divestiture of midstream assets by industry participants a material decrease in such divestitures would limit our opportunities for future acquisitions and could materially adversely affect our ability to grow our operations and increase our cash distributions to our unitholders if we are unable to make accretive acquisitions from third parties whether because we are i unable to identify attractive acquisition candidates or negotiate acceptable purchase contracts ii unable to obtain financing for these acquisitions on economically acceptable terms iii outbid by competitors or iv unable to obtain necessary governmental or thirdparty consents or for any other reason then our future growth and ability to increase cash distributions on a perunit basis will be limited if we are unable to acquire assets from third parties in the near or long term it may adversely affect our ability to grow our business even if we do make acquisitions that we believe will be accretive these acquisitions may nevertheless result in a decrease in the cash generated from operations any acquisition involves potential risks including among other things • mistaken assumptions about volumes revenues and costs including synergies and potential growth • an inability to secure adequate customer commitments to use the acquired systems or facilities • the risk that natural gas or crude oil reserves expected to support the acquired assets may not be of the anticipated magnitude or may not be developed as anticipated or at all  table of contents • an inability to successfully integrate the assets or businesses we acquire • coordinating geographically disparate organizations systems and facilities • the assumption of unknown liabilities for which we are not indemnified or for which our indemnity is inadequate • mistaken assumptions about the overall costs of debt or equity capital • the diversion of managements and employees attention from other business concerns • unforeseen difficulties operating in new geographic areas and business lines • customer or key employee losses at the acquired businesses • higherthananticipated production declines and • improperly constructed facilities if we consummate any future acquisitions our capitalization results of operations and future growth may change significantly and our unitholders will not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic financial and other relevant information that we will consider in deciding to engage in these future acquisitions which may reduce rather than increase our cash generated from operations substantially all of the assets owned by summit investments have been contributed to the partnership in connection with our drop down transactions and as a result our growth strategy has become more dependent on making acquisitions from third parties this shift from a growth strategy focused primarily on acquisitions from summit investments to one focused primarily on thirdparty acquisitions could materially adversely affect our ability to grow our operations and increase our cash distributions to our unitholders we may fail to successfully integrate gathering system acquisitions into our existing business in a timely manner which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders or fail to realize all of the expected benefits of the acquisitions which could negatively impact our future results of operations integration of future gathering system acquisitions could be a complex timeconsuming and costly process particularly if the acquired assets significantly increase our size andor i diversify the geographic areas in which we operate or ii the service offerings that we provide the failure to successfully integrate the acquired assets with our existing business in a timely manner may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders if any of the risks described above or in the immediately preceding risk factor or unanticipated liabilities or costs were to materialize with respect to future acquisitions or if the acquired assets were to perform at levels below the forecasts we used to evaluate them then the anticipated benefits from the acquisition may not be fully realized if at all and our future results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to unitholders could be negatively impacted our construction of new assets may not result in revenue increases and will be subject to regulatory environmental political legal and economic risks which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition one of the ways we intend to grow our business is through organic growth projects the construction of additions or modifications to our existing systems and the construction of new midstream assets involve numerous regulatory environmental political legal and economic uncertainties that are beyond our control such expansion projects may also require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital and financing traditional or otherwise may not be available on economically acceptable terms or at all if we undertake these projects our revenue may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds for a particular project and they may not be completed on schedule at the budgeted cost or at all moreover we could construct facilities to capture anticipated future production growth in a region where such growth does not materialize or only materializes over a period materially longer than expected to the extent we rely on estimates of future production in our decision to construct additions to our systems such estimates may prove to be inaccurate due to the numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of future production as a result new facilities may not attract enough throughput to achieve our expected investment return which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition  table of contents in addition the construction of additions or modifications to our existing gathering treating and processing assets and the construction of new midstream assets may require us to obtain new rightsofway or federal and state environmental or other authorizations the approval process for gathering treating and processing activities has become increasingly challenging due in part to state and local concerns related to unregulated exploration and production and gathering treating and processing activities in new production areas such authorization may not be granted or if granted such authorization may include burdensome or expensive conditions as a result we may be unable to obtain such rightsofway or other authorizations and may therefore be unable to connect new volumes to our systems or capitalize on other attractive expansion opportunities additionally it may become more expensive for us to obtain new rightsofway or authorizations or to renew existing rightsofway or authorizations if the cost of renewing or obtaining new rightsofway or authorizations increases materially our cash flows could be materially adversely affected we require access to significant amounts of additional capital to implement our growth strategy as well as to meet potential future capital requirements under certain of our gathering and processing agreements limited access andor availability of the debt and equity capital markets could impair our ability to grow or cause us to be unable to meet future capital requirements to expand our asset base whether through acquisitions or organic growth we will need to make expansion capital expenditures we also frequently consider and enter into discussions with third parties regarding potential acquisitions in addition the terms of certain of our gathering and processing agreements also require us to spend significant amounts of capital over a short period of time to construct and develop additional midstream assets to support our customers development projects depending on our customers future development plans it is possible that the capital we would be required to spend to construct and develop such assets could exceed our ability to finance those expenditures using our cash reserves or available capacity under our revolving credit facility we plan to use cash from operations incur borrowings andor sell additional common units or other securities to fund our future expansion capital expenditures using cash from operations to fund expansion capital expenditures will directly reduce our cash available for distribution to unitholders our ability to obtain financing or to access the capital markets for future debt or equity offerings may be limited by i our financial condition at the time of any such financing or offering ii covenants in our debt agreements iii general economic conditions and contingencies iv the impact of any secondary offering of common units by summit investments or the sponsor and v uncertainties that are beyond our control furthermore we do not have a contractual commitment from our sponsor or summit investments to provide any direct or indirect financial assistance to us as such if we are unable to raise expansion capital we may lose the opportunity to make acquisitions or to gather treat and process new production volumes from our customers with whom we have agreed to construct and develop midstream assets in the future even if we are successful in obtaining funds for expansion capital expenditures through equity or debt financings the terms thereof could limit our ability to pay distributions to our common unitholders in addition incurring additional debt may significantly increase our interest expense and financial leverage and issuing additional units representing limited partner interests may result in significant common unitholder dilution and increase the aggregate amount of cash required to maintain the thencurrent distribution rate which could materially decrease our ability to pay distributions at the thencurrent distribution rate because our common units are yieldoriented securities increases in interest rates could materially adversely impact our unit price our ability to issue equity or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders interest rates are generally near historic lows and may increase in the future as a result interest rates on our future credit facilities and debt offerings could be higher than current levels causing our financing costs to increase as with other yieldoriented securities our unit price is impacted by the level of our cash distributions and implied distribution yield the distribution yield is often used by investors to compare and rank yieldoriented securities for investment decisionmaking purposes therefore changes in interest rates either positive or negative may affect the yield requirements of investors who invest in our common units and a rising interest rate environment could have a material adverse impact on our unit price our ability to issue equity or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes and our ability to make cash distributions at our intended levels debt we incur in the future may limit our flexibility to obtain financing and to pursue other business opportunities at december    we had  billion of indebtedness outstanding and the unused portion of our  billion revolving credit facility totaled  million  our future level of debt could have significant consequences including among other things  table of contents • limiting our ability to obtain additional financing if necessary for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or other purposes andor obtaining such financing on favorable terms • reducing our funds available for operations future business opportunities and cash distributions to unitholders by that portion of our cash flow required to make interest payments on our debt • increasing our vulnerability to competitive pressures or a downturn in our business or the economy generally and • limiting our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions our ability to service our debt will depend upon among other things our future financial and operating performance which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial business regulatory and other factors some of which are beyond our control if our operating results are not sufficient to service any future indebtedness we will be forced to take actions such as reducing distributions reducing or delaying our business activities acquisitions investments or capital expenditures selling assets or seeking additional equity capital we may not be able to effect any of these actions on satisfactory terms or at all restrictions in our revolving credit facility and senior notes indentures could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations ability to make cash distributions to unitholders and value of our common units we are dependent upon the earnings and cash flows generated by our operations to meet our debt service obligations and to make cash distributions to our unitholders the operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our revolving credit facility our senior notes indentures and any future financing agreements could restrict our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to expand or pursue our business activities which may in turn limit our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders for example our revolving credit facility and indentures restrict our ability to among other things • incur or guarantee certain additional debt • make certain cash distributions on or redeem or repurchase certain units • make certain investments and acquisitions • make certain capital expenditures • incur certain liens or permit them to exist • enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates • merge or consolidate with another company or otherwise engage in a change of control transaction and • transfer sell or otherwise dispose of certain assets our revolving credit facility and senior notes indentures also contain covenants requiring us to maintain certain financial ratios and meet certain tests our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot guarantee that we will meet those ratios and tests the provisions of our revolving credit facility and senior notes indentures may affect our ability to obtain future financing and pursue attractive business opportunities as well as affect our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in business conditions in addition a failure to comply with the provisions of revolving credit facility or senior notes indentures could result in a default or an event of default that could enable our lenders or senior noteholders to declare the outstanding principal of that debt together with accrued and unpaid interest to be immediately due and payable if we were unable to repay the accelerated amounts the lenders under our revolving credit facility could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such debt if the payment of our debt is accelerated our assets may be insufficient to repay such debt in full and our unitholders could experience a partial or total loss of their investment the revolving credit facility also has cross default provisions that apply to any other indebtedness we may have and the indentures have cross default provisions that apply to certain other indebtedness a portion of our revenues are directly exposed to changes in crude oil natural gas and ngl prices and our exposure may increase in the future during the year ended december   we derived  of our revenues from i the sale of processed natural gas and ngls pursuant to our percentofproceeds contracts with certain of our customers on the bison midstream and grand river systems ii the sale of physical natural gas that we retain from certain of our dfw midstream customers to offset a portion of our power expense associated with our electricdrive compression and iii the sale  table of contents of condensate volumes that we retain at grand river consequently our existing operations and cash flows have limited direct exposure to commodity price risk although we will seek to limit our commodity price exposure with new customers in the future our efforts to obtain feebased contractual terms may not be successful or the local market for our services may not support feebased gathering and processing agreements for example we have percentofproceeds contracts with certain natural gas producer customers and we may in the future enter into additional percentofproceeds contracts with these customers or other customers or enter into keepwhole arrangements which would increase our exposure to commodity price risk as the revenues generated from those contracts directly correlate with the fluctuating price of the underlying commodities furthermore we may acquire or develop additional midstream assets in the future that have a greater exposure to fluctuations in commodity price risk than our current operations future exposure to the volatility of natural gas and crude oil prices could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition for example for a small portion of the natural gas gathered on our systems we purchase natural gas from producers prior to delivering the natural gas to pipelines where we typically resell the natural gas under arrangements including sales at index prices generally the gross margins we realize under these arrangements decrease in periods of low natural gas prices if we expand the implementation of such natural gas purchase and sale arrangements within our business such fluctuations could materially affect our business a change in laws and regulations applicable to our assets or services or the interpretation or implementation of existing laws and regulations may cause our revenues to decline or our operation and maintenance expenses to increase various aspects of our operations are subject to regulation by the various federal state and local departments and agencies that have jurisdiction over participants in the energy industry the regulation of our activities and the natural gas and crude oil industries frequently change as they are reviewed by legislators and regulators in  the north dakota industrial commission began to oversee the integrity and location of underground gathering pipelines that are not monitored by other state or federal agencies and recently adopted additional rule changes that result in additional construction and monitoring requirements for all pipelines including but not limited to those that transport produced water and has recently adopted reclamation bonding requirements for certain underground gathering pipelines in  the dot through phmsa proposed changes to its pipeline safety regulations that would extend pipeline safety regulation to previously unregulated gathering systems and increase safety requirements for other pipelines as well penalties for violating federal safety standards have recently increased in addition the adoption of proposals for more stringent legislation regulation or taxation of drilling activity could directly curtail such activity or increase the cost of drilling resulting in reduced levels of drilling activity and therefore reduced demand for our services regulatory agencies establish and from time to time change priorities which may result in additional burdens on us such as additional reporting requirements and more frequent audits of operations our operations and the markets in which we participate are affected by these laws regulations and interpretations and may be affected by changes to them or their implementation which may cause us to realize materially lower revenues or incur materially increased operation and maintenance costs or both increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing could result in reductions or delays in customer production which could materially adversely impact our revenues hydraulic fracturing is an important and increasingly common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas andor crude oil from dense subsurface rock formations and is primarily regulated by state agencies however congress has in the past and may in the future consider legislation to regulate hydraulic fracturing by federal agencies many states have already adopted laws andor regulations that require disclosure of the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing and are considering legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting disclosure and well construction requirements on crude oil andor natural gas drilling activities epa regulations require among other matters green completions of hydraulicallyfractured wells the requirement to conduct green completions and the corresponding notification and reporting requirements went into effect in  revisions to the green completion regulations were finalized in june  and include additional requirements to reduce methane and vocs if new or more stringent federal state or local legal restrictions relating to such drilling activities or to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted this could result in a reduction in the supply of natural gas andor crude oil which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition we are subject to ferc jurisdiction federal antimarket manipulation laws and regulations potentially other federal regulatory requirements and state and local regulation and could be materially affected by changes in such laws and regulations or in the way they are interpreted and enforced we believe that our natural gas pipeline facilities qualify as gathering facilities that are exempt from the jurisdiction of ferc under the nga and the ngpa interstate movements of crude oil on polar midstream’s little muddy  table of contents pipeline in north dakota are subject to ferc jurisdiction under the ica we are also generally subject to the antimarket manipulation provisions in the nga as amended by the energy policy act of  and to fercs regulations thereunder which authorize ferc to impose fines of up to  per day per violation of the nga or its implementing regulations in addition the ftc holds statutory authority under the energy independence and security act of  to prevent market manipulation in oil markets and has adopted broad rules and regulations prohibiting fraud and market manipulation the ftc is also authorized to seek fines of up to  per violation the cftc is directed under the cea to prevent price manipulation in the commodity futures and swaps markets including the energy markets pursuant to the doddfrank act and other authority the cftc has adopted additional antimarket manipulation regulations that prohibit fraud and price manipulation in the commodity futures and swaps markets the cftc also has statutory authority to seek civil penalties of up to the greater of  per violation or triple the monetary gain to the violator for each violation of the antimarket manipulation provisions of the cea the distinction between federally unregulated natural gas and crude oil pipelines and fercregulated natural gas and crude oil pipelines has been the subject of extensive litigation and is determined by ferc on a casebycase basis ferc has made no determinations as to the status of our facilities consequently the classification and regulation of some of our pipelines could change based on future determinations by ferc congress or the courts if our natural gas gathering operations or crude oil operations beyond the little muddy pipeline become subject to ferc jurisdiction under the nga the ngpa or the ica the result may materially adversely affect the rates we are able to charge and the services we currently provide and may include the potential for a termination of our gathering agreements with our customers in addition if any of our facilities were found to have provided services or otherwise operated in violation of the nga the ngpa or the ica this could result in the imposition of civil penalties as well as a requirement to disgorge charges collected for such services in excess of the rate established by ferc we are subject to state and local regulation regarding the construction and operation of our gathering treating and processing systems as well as state ratable take statutes and regulations regulation of the construction and operation of our facilities may affect our ability to expand our facilities or build new facilities and such regulation may cause us to incur additional operating costs or limit the quantities of natural gas and crude oil we may gather treat and process ratable take statutes and regulations generally require gatherers to take natural gas and crude oil production that may be tendered for gathering without undue discrimination these requirements restrict our right to decide whose production we gather treat and process many states have adopted complaintbased regulation of gathering treating and processing activities which allows producers and shippers to file complaints with state regulators in an effort to resolve access issues rate grievances and other matters other state and municipal regulations do not directly apply to our business but may nonetheless affect the availability of natural gas and crude oil for gathering treating and processing including state regulation of production rates maximum daily production allowable from wells and other activities related to drilling and operating wells while our facilities currently are subject to limited state and local regulation there is a risk that state or local laws will be changed or reinterpreted which may materially affect our operations operating costs and revenues we are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations that may expose us to significant costs and liabilities our gathering treating and processing operations are subject to stringent and complex federal state and local environmental laws and regulations including laws and regulations regarding the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection including for example the caa cercla the cwa the opa the rcra the endangered species act and the toxic substances control act these laws and regulations may impose numerous obligations that are applicable to our operations including the acquisition of permits to conduct regulated activities the incurrence of capital or operating expenditures to limit or prevent releases of materials from our pipelines and facilities and the imposition of substantial liabilities and remedial obligations for pollution resulting from our operations or at locations currently or previously owned or operated by us for additional information on specific laws and regulations see the environmental matters—air emissions section of item  business numerous governmental authorities such as the epa and analogous state agencies have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them oftentimes requiring difficult and costly corrective actions or costly pollution control measures failure to comply with these laws regulations and requisite permits may result in the assessment of significant administrative civil and criminal penalties the imposition of remedial obligations and the issuance of injunctions limiting or preventing some or all of our operations in addition we may experience a delay in obtaining or be unable to obtain required permits or regulatory authorizations which may cause us to lose potential and current customers interrupt our operations and limit our growth and revenue  table of contents there is a risk that we may incur significant environmental costs and liabilities in connection with our operations due to historical industry operations and waste disposal practices our handling of hydrocarbons and other wastes and potential emissions and discharges related to our operations joint and several strict liability may be incurred without regard to fault under certain of these environmental laws and regulations in connection with discharges or releases of hydrocarbon wastes on under or from our properties and facilities many of which have been used for midstream activities for a number of years oftentimes by third parties not under our control private parties including the owners of the properties through which our gathering systems pass and on which certain of our facilities are located may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage for example an accidental release from one of our pipelines could subject us to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup and restoration costs claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage and fines or penalties for related violations of environmental laws or regulations in addition changes in environmental laws occur frequently and any such changes that result in additional permitting obligations or more stringent and costly waste handling storage transport disposal or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial position we may not be able to recover all or any of these costs from insurance we may incur greater than anticipated costs and liabilities as a result of pipeline safety requirements the dot through phmsa has adopted and enforces safety standards and procedures applicable to our pipelines in addition many states including the states in which we operate have adopted regulations that are identical to or more restrictive than existing dot regulations for intrastate pipelines among the regulations applicable to us phmsa requires pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs for certain pipelines located in high consequence areas which include high population areas such as the dallasfort worth greater metropolitan area where our dfw midstream system is located while the majority of our pipelines meet the dot definition of gathering lines and are thus currently exempt from phmsas integrity management requirements we also operate a limited number of pipelines that are subject to the integrity management requirements the regulations require operators including us to • perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity • identify and characterize applicable threats to pipeline segments that could impact a high consequence area • maintain processes for data collection integration and analysis • repair and remediate pipelines as necessary • adopt and maintain procedures standards and training programs for control room operations and • implement preventive and mitigating actions for additional information on phmsa regulations relating to pipeline safety see the regulation of the natural gas and crude oil industries—safety and maintenance section of item  business phmsa has also issued an advisory bulletin which among other things advises pipeline operators that if they are relying on design construction inspection testing or other data to determine the pressures at which their pipelines should operate the records of that data must be traceable verifiable and complete locating such records and in the absence of any such records verifying maximum pressures through physical testing or modifying or replacing facilities to meet the demands of such pressures could significantly increase our costs additionally failure to locate such records or verify maximum pressures could result in reductions of allowable operating pressures which would reduce available capacity of our pipelines while we believe that we are in compliance with existing safety laws and regulations increased penalties for safety violations and potential regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our operations operating and maintenance expenses and revenues climate change legislation regulatory initiatives and litigation could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the services we provide in recent years the us congress has considered legislation to restrict or regulate emissions of ghgs such as carbon dioxide and methane that may be contributing to global warming it presently appears unlikely that comprehensive climate legislation will be passed by either house of congress in the near future although energy legislation and other initiatives are expected to be proposed that may be relevant to ghg emissions issues for example the final revisions to the nsps found in  cfr  subpart oooo now ooooa which now include ghg emission reduction requirements  table of contents in addition almost half of the states either individually or through multistate regional initiatives have begun to address ghg emissions primarily through the planned development of emission inventories or regional ghg cap and trade programs most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring either major sources of emissions such as electric power plants or major producers of fuels such as refineries and gas processing plants to acquire and surrender emission allowances in general the number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year until the overall ghg emission reduction goal is achieved depending on the scope of a particular program we could be required to purchase and surrender allowances for ghg emissions resulting from our operations eg at compressor stations although most of the statelevel initiatives have to date been focused on large sources of ghg emissions such as electric power plants it is possible that certain components of our operations such as our gasfired compressors could become subject to statelevel ghgrelated regulation independent of congress the epa has begun to adopt regulations under its existing caa authority in  the epa published its findings that emissions of ghgs present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are contributing to warming of the earths atmosphere and other climatic changes based on these findings the epa adopted regulations that among other things establish psd construction and title v operating permit reviews for certain large stationary sources of ghg emissions for additional information on epa regulations adopted under the caa see the environmental matters—climate change section of item  business further in december  over  countries including the united states reached an agreement to reduce global ghg emissions the agreement entered into force in november  after over  countries including the united states ratified or otherwise consented to be bound by the agreement if and to the extent the united states implements this agreement it could have a material adverse effect on our business and that of our customers although it is not possible at this time to accurately estimate how potential future laws or regulations addressing ghg emissions would impact our business either directly or indirectly any future federal or state laws or implementing regulations that may be adopted to address ghg emissions could require us to incur increased operating costs and could materially adversely affect demand for our services the potential increase in the costs of our operations resulting from any legislation or regulation to restrict emissions of ghg could include new or increased costs to operate and maintain our facilities install new emission controls on our facilities acquire allowances to authorize our ghg emissions pay any taxes related to our ghg emissions and administer and manage a ghg emissions program while we may be able to include some or all of such increased costs in the rates we charge such recovery of costs is uncertain moreover incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources could reduce demand for our services we cannot predict with any certainty at this time how these possibilities may affect our operations the implementation of statutory and regulatory requirements for swap transactions could have an adverse impact on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business and increase the working capital requirements to conduct these activities congress adopted comprehensive financial reform legislation under the doddfrank act that establishes federal oversight and regulation of the overthecounter derivatives market and entities such as us that participate in that market this legislation requires the cftc and the sec and other regulatory authorities to promulgate certain rules and regulations including rules and regulations relating to the regulation of certain swaps market participants such as swap dealers the clearing of certain swaps through central counterparties the execution of certain swaps on designated contract markets or swap execution facilities mandatory margin requirements for uncleared swaps and the reporting and recordkeeping of swaps while most of the regulations have been promulgated and are already in effect the rulemaking and implementation process is still ongoing moreover cftc continues to refine its initial rulemakings under the doddfrank act as a result we cannot yet predict the ultimate effect of the rules and regulations on our business and while most of the regulations have been adopted any new regulations or modifications to existing regulations could increase the cost of derivative contracts limit the availability of derivatives to protect against risks that we encounter reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties the cftc has proposed federal position limits on certain core futures and equivalent swaps contracts in the major energy and other markets with exceptions for certain bona fide hedging transactions provided that various conditions are satisfied if finalized the position limits rule and its companion rule on aggregation among entities under common ownership or control may have an impact on our ability to hedge our exposure to certain enumerated commodities in  the cftc implemented final rules regarding mandatory clearing of certain classes of interest rate swaps and certain classes of index credit default swaps mandatory trading on designated contract markets or swap execution facilities of certain interest rate swaps and index credit default swaps also began in  at this time  table of contents the cftc has not proposed any rules designating other classes of swaps including physical commodity swaps for mandatory clearing the cftc and prudential banking regulators also recently adopted mandatory margin requirements on uncleared swaps between swap dealers and certain other counterparties although we may qualify for a commercial enduser exception from the mandatory clearing trade execution and uncleared swaps margin requirements mandatory clearing and trade execution requirements and uncleared swaps margin requirements applicable to other market participants such as swap dealers may affect the cost and availability of the swaps that we use for hedging under the doddfrank act the cftc is also directed generally to prevent price manipulation and fraud in the following two markets a physical commodities traded in interstate commerce including physical energy and other commodities as well as b financial instruments such as futures options and swaps pursuant to the doddfrank act the cftc has adopted additional antimarket manipulation antifraud and disruptive trading practices regulations that prohibit among other things fraud and price manipulation in the physical commodities futures options and swaps markets should we violate these laws and regulations we could be subject to cftc enforcement action and material penalties and sanctions we currently enter into forward contracts with third parties to buy power and sell natural gas in an attempt to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in the price of natural gas with respect to those volumes the cftc has finalized an interpretation clarifying whether certain forwards with volumetric optionality are regulated as forwards or qualify as options on commodities and therefore swaps this interpretation may have an impact on our ability to enter into certain forwards or may impose additional requirements with respect to certain transactions in addition to the doddfrank act the european union and other foreign regulators have adopted and are implementing local reforms generally comparable with the reforms under the doddfrank act implementation and enforcement of these regulatory provisions may reduce our ability to hedge our market risks with nonus counterparties and may make any transactions involving crossborder swaps more expensive and burdensome additionally the lack of regulatory equivalency across jurisdictions may increase compliance costs and make it more costly to satisfy regulatory obligations we do not own all of the land on which our pipelines and facilities are located which could result in disruptions to our operations we do not own all of the land on which our pipelines and facilities have been constructed and we are therefore subject to the possibility of more onerous terms andor increased costs to retain necessary land use if we do not have valid rightsofway or if such rightsofway lapse or terminate or if our pipelines are not properly located within the boundaries of such rightsofway we obtain the rights to construct and operate our pipelines on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time if we were to be unsuccessful in renegotiating rightsofway we might have to relocate our facilities our loss of these rights through our inability to renew rightofway contracts or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders terrorist attacks and threats escalation of military activity in response to these attacks or acts of war could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations terrorist attacks and threats escalation of military activity or acts of war may have significant effects on general economic conditions fluctuations in consumer confidence and spending and market liquidity each of which could materially and adversely affect our business future terrorist attacks rumors or threats of war actual conflicts involving the united states or its allies or military or trade disruptions may significantly affect our operations and those of our customers strategic targets such as energyrelated assets may be at greater risk of future attacks than other targets in the united states disruption or significant increases in energy prices could result in governmentimposed price controls it is possible that any of these occurrences or a combination of them could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations civil protests and resulting regulatory uncertainty may prevent or delay construction and the realization of revenues associated with pipeline projects civil protests regarding environmental and social issues including construction of infrastructure associated with fossil fuels may prevent or delay the construction of such infrastructure and realization of associated revenues for example we have planned to construct and made certain capital investments in a crude oil pipeline that is planned to connect to energy transfer partners dakota access pipeline project dapl being developed by dakota access llc delays associated with construction of dapl have delayed the construction of our pipeline and may adversely affect our business as it relates to anticipated revenues associated with transportation of crude oil from our pipeline systems to dapl delays associated with the construction of dapl include civil protests by individuals  table of contents affiliated with or sympathetic to the standing rock sioux native american tribe and associated legal proceedings and

evaluate the easement request these actions are currently under review by the trump administration however the development of an environmental impact statement could delay or ultimately prevent approval of the easement which could further delay construction of dapl additional protests or legal actions may arise in connection with dapl or other projects that could delay construction of our gathering pipelines that connect to those projects and in turn receipt of revenues associated with our projects our operations depend on the use of information technology it systems that could be the target of a cyberattack our operations depend on the use of sophisticated it systems our it systems and networks as well as those of our customers vendors and counterparties may become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches which in turn could result in the unauthorized release and misuse of confidential or proprietary information as well as disrupt our operations or damage our facilities or those of third parties which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and increase our operating and capital costs which could reduce the amount of cash otherwise available for distribution we may be required to incur additional costs to modify or enhance our it systems or to prevent or remediate any such attacks our ability to operate our business effectively could be impaired if we fail to attract and retain key management personnel our ability to operate our business and implement our strategies depends on our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled management personnel with midstream energy industry experience and competition for these persons in the midstream energy industry is intense given our size we may be at a disadvantage relative to our larger competitors in the competition for these personnel we may not be able to continue to employ our senior executives and key personnel or attract and retain qualified personnel in the future and our failure to retain or attract our senior executives and key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our ability to effectively operate our business a shortage of skilled labor in the midstream energy industry could reduce employee productivity and increase costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations the operation of gathering treating and processing systems requires skilled laborers in multiple disciplines such as equipment operators mechanics and engineers among others we have from time to time encountered shortages for these types of skilled labor if we experience shortages of skilled labor in the future our labor and overall productivity or costs could be materially adversely affected if our labor prices increase or if we experience materially increased health and benefit costs with respect to our general partners employees our business and results of operations and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders could be materially adversely affected risks inherent in an investment in us summit investments indirectly owns and controls our general partner which has sole responsibility for conducting our business and managing our operations and limited duties to us and our unitholders our general partner and its affiliates have conflicts of interest with us and they may favor their own interests to the detriment of us and our unitholders summit investments controls our general partner and has authority to appoint all of the officers and directors of our general partner some of whom will also be officers directors or principals of energy capital partners the entity that controls summit investments although our general partner has a duty to manage us in a manner that is in our best interests the directors and officers of our general partner also have a duty to manage our general partner in a manner that is in the best interests of its owner conflicts of interest will arise between summit investments and its owners and our general partner on the one hand and us and our unitholders on the other hand in resolving these conflicts of interest our general partner may favor its own interests and the interests of summit investments and its owners over our interests and the interests of our unitholders these conflicts include the following situations among others  table of contents • neither our partnership agreement nor any other agreement requires summit investments or its owners to pursue a business strategy that favors us and the directors and officers of summit investments have a fiduciary duty to make these decisions in the best interests of the owners of summit investments which may be contrary to our interests summit investments may choose to shift the focus of their investment and growth to areas not served by our assets • summit investments is not limited in its ability to compete with us and in the future may offer business opportunities or sell midstream assets to third parties without first offering us the right to bid for them • our general partner is allowed to take into account the interests of parties other than us such as summit investments and its owners in resolving conflicts of interest • our partnership agreement replaces the fiduciary duties that would otherwise be owed by our general partner to us and our unitholders with contractual standards governing its duties to us and our unitholders these contractual standards limit our general partners liabilities and the rights of our unitholders with respect to actions that without the limitations might constitute breaches of fiduciary duty • except in limited circumstances our general partner has the power and authority to conduct our business without unitholder approval • our general partner determines the amount and timing of asset purchases and sales borrowings issuance of additional partnership interests and the creation reduction or increase of reserves each of which can affect the amount of cash that is distributed to our unitholders • our general partner determines the amount and timing of any capital expenditures and whether a capital expenditure is classified as a maintenance capital expenditure which reduces operating surplus or an expansion capital expenditure which does not reduce operating surplus this determination can affect the amount of cash that is distributed to our unitholders and to our general partner • our general partner determines which costs incurred by it are reimbursable by us • our general partner may cause us to borrow funds to permit the payment of cash distributions even if the purpose or effect of the borrowing is to make incentive distribution payments • our partnership agreement permits us to classify up to  million as operating surplus even if it is generated from asset sales nonworking capital borrowings or other sources that would otherwise constitute capital surplus this cash may be used to fund distributions on our common units or to our general partner in respect of the general partner interest or the idrs • our partnership agreement does not restrict our general partner from causing us to pay it or its affiliates for any services rendered to us or entering into additional contractual arrangements with any of these entities on our behalf • our general partner intends to limit its liability regarding our contractual and other obligations • our general partner may exercise its right to call and purchase all of the common units not owned by it and its affiliates if they own more than  of the common units • our general partner controls the enforcement of the obligations that it and its affiliates owe to us • our general partner decides whether to retain separate counsel accountants or others to perform services for us • our general partner may elect to cause us to issue common units to it in connection with a resetting of the target distribution levels related to our general partners idrs without the approval of the conflicts committee or our unitholders this election may result in lower distributions to our other unitholders in certain situations our general partner interest or the control of our general partner may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent if energy capital partners the private equity firm that controls summit investments consummates a transaction involving a sale or other disposition of its interests in summit investments the transaction would result in a change of control of smlp because summit investments indirectly owns and controls our general partner in addition our general partner may transfer its general partner interest to a third party in a merger or in a sale of all or substantially all of its assets without the consent of the unitholders furthermore our partnership agreement does not restrict the ability of summit investments to transfer all or a portion of its ownership interest in our general  table of contents partner to a third party the owner of summit investments or new members of our general partner as applicable would then be in a position to replace the board of directors and officers of our general partner with their own designees and thereby exert significant control over the decisions made by the board of directors and officers this effectively permits a change of control without the vote or consent of the unitholders our general partners idrs may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent our general partner may transfer the idrs it owns to a third party at any time without the consent of our unitholders if our general partner transfers the idrs to a third party but retains its general partner interest our general partner may not have the same incentive to grow our business and increase quarterly distributions to unitholders over time as it would if it had retained ownership of the idrs our sponsor is not limited in its ability to compete with us and is not obligated to offer us the opportunity to acquire additional assets or businesses which could limit our ability to grow and could materially adversely affect our results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders our sponsor has significantly greater resources than us and has experience making investments in midstream energy businesses although it controls summit investments our sponsor may compete with us for investment opportunities and may own interests in entities that compete with us our sponsor is not prohibited from owning assets or engaging in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us in addition our sponsor and summit investments may acquire construct or dispose of additional midstream or other assets and may be presented with new business opportunities without any obligation to offer us the opportunity to purchase or construct such assets or to engage in such business opportunities pursuant to the terms of our partnership agreement the doctrine of corporate opportunity or any analogous doctrine does not apply to our general partner its officers and directors or any of its affiliates including summit investments and our sponsor and its respective executive officers directors and principals any such person or entity that becomes aware of a potential transaction agreement arrangement or other matter that may be an opportunity for us will not have any duty to communicate or offer such opportunity to us any such person or entity will not be liable to us or to any limited partner for breach of any fiduciary duty or other duty by reason of the fact that such person or entity pursues or acquires such opportunity for itself directs such opportunity to another person or entity or does not communicate such opportunity or information to us this may create actual and potential conflicts of interest between us and affiliates of our general partner and result in less than favorable treatment of us and our unitholders the amount of cash we have available for distribution to holders of our common units depends primarily on our cash flows rather than on our profitability which may prevent us from making distributions even during periods in which we record net income the amount of cash we have available for distribution depends primarily upon our cash flows and not solely on profitability which will be affected by noncash items as a result we may make cash distributions during periods when we report net losses for gaap purposes and may not make cash distributions during periods when we report net income for gaap purposes the market price of our common units may fluctuate significantly and due to limited daily trading volumes an investor could lose all or part of its investment in us of the  common units outstanding at december    summit investments beneficially owned  common units in connection with the purchase program a subsidiary of energy capital partners had acquired  common units as of december    an investor may not be able to resell its common units at or above its acquisition price additionally limited liquidity may result in wide bidask spreads contribute to significant fluctuations in the market price of the common units and limit the number of investors who are able to buy the common units the market price of our common units may decline and be influenced by many factors some of which are beyond our control including among others • our quarterly distributions • our quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry • the loss of a large customer • announcements by our customers or others regarding our customers or changes in our customers’ credit ratings liquidity position leverage profile andor other financial or creditrelated metrics  table of contents • announcements by our competitors of significant contracts or acquisitions • changes in accounting standards policies guidance interpretations or principles • general economic and geopolitical conditions • the failure of securities analysts to cover our common units or changes in financial estimates by analysts • future sales of our common units including those held by summit investments and its subsidiaries and energy capital partners and • other factors described in these risk factors our sponsor has rights to require underwritten offerings that could limit our ability to raise capital in the public equity market our sponsor and any other unitholders that have registration rights may require us to conduct underwritten offerings of our common units if we want to access the capital markets debt and equity those unitholders’ ability to sell a portion of their common units could satisfy investors’ demand for our common units reduce the market price for our common units or interfere with our financing plans and thereby could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders if we fail to develop or maintain an effective system of internal controls we may not be able to report our financial results timely and accurately or prevent fraud which would likely have a negative impact on the market price of our common units as a publicly traded partnership we are subject to the public reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  as amended including the rules thereunder that will require our management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and timely financial reports prevent fraud and to operate successfully as a publicly traded partnership we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap our efforts to develop and maintain our internal controls may not be successful and we may be unable to maintain effective controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future or to comply with our obligations under section  of the sarbanesoxley act of  given the difficulties inherent in the design and operation of internal controls over financial reporting in addition to our limited accounting personnel and management resources we can provide no assurance as to our or our independent registered public accounting firms future conclusions about the effectiveness of our internal controls and we may incur significant costs in our efforts to comply with section  of the sarbanesoxley act of  any failure to implement and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could subject us to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of confidence in our reported financial information which could have an adverse effect on our business and would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our common units our partnership agreement replaces our general partners fiduciary duties to unitholders with contractual standards governing its duties our partnership agreement contains provisions that eliminate fiduciary duties to which our general partner would otherwise be held by state fiduciary duty law and replaces those duties with several different contractual standards for example our partnership agreement permits our general partner to make a number of decisions in its individual capacity as opposed to in its capacity as our general partner or otherwise free of any duties to us and our unitholders other than the implied contractual covenant of good faith and fair dealing this entitles our general partner to consider only the interests and factors that it desires and relieves it of any duty or obligation to give any consideration to any interest of or factors affecting us our affiliates or our limited partners examples of decisions that our general partner may make in its individual capacity include among others • how to allocate corporate opportunities among us and its affiliates • whether to exercise its limited call right • whether to seek approval of the resolution of a conflict of interest by the conflicts committee • how to exercise its voting rights with respect to the units it owns • whether to exercise its registration rights • whether to elect to reset target distribution levels • whether to transfer the idrs or any units it owns to a third party and  table of contents • whether or not to consent to any merger or consolidation of the partnership or amendment to the partnership agreement by purchasing a common unit a common unitholder agrees to become bound by the provisions in the partnership agreement including the provisions discussed above our partnership agreement limits the liabilities of our general partner and the rights of our unitholders with respect to actions taken by our general partner that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duty our partnership agreement contains provisions that limit the liability of our general partner and the rights of our unitholders with respect to actions taken by our general partner that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duty under state fiduciary duty law for example our partnership agreement provides that • whenever our general partner makes a determination or takes or declines to take any other action in its capacity as our general partner our general partner is required to make such determination or take or decline to take such other action in good faith meaning that it subjectively believed that the decision was in our best interests and will not be subject to any other or different standard imposed by our partnership agreement delaware law or any other law rule or regulation or at equity • our general partner will not have any liability to us or our unitholders for decisions made in its capacity as a general partner so long as such decisions are made in good faith • our general partner and its officers and directors will not be liable for monetary damages to us our limited partners or their assignees resulting from any act or omission unless there has been a final and nonappealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that our general partner or its officers and directors as the case may be acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud or willful misconduct or in the case of a criminal matter acted with knowledge that the conduct was criminal and • our general partner will not be in breach of its obligations under the partnership agreement or its duties to us or our unitholders if a transaction with an affiliate or the resolution of a conflict of interest is i approved by the conflicts committee although our general partner is not obligated to seek such approval ii approved by the vote of a majority of the outstanding common units excluding any common units owned by our general partner and its affiliates iii on terms no less favorable to us than those generally being provided to or available from unrelated third parties or iv fair and reasonable to us taking into account the totality of the relationships among the parties involved including other transactions that may be particularly favorable or advantageous to us in connection with a situation involving a transaction with an affiliate or a conflict of interest any determination by our general partner or the conflicts committee must be made in good faith if an affiliate transaction or the resolution of a conflict of interest is not approved by our common unitholders or the conflicts committee and the board of directors of our general partner determines that the resolution or course of action taken with respect to the affiliate transaction or conflict of interest satisfies either of the standards set forth in the final two subclauses above then it will be presumed that in making its decision the board of directors acted in good faith and in any proceeding brought by or on behalf of any limited partner or the partnership the person bringing or prosecuting such proceeding will have the burden of overcoming such presumption our general partner intends to limit its liability regarding our obligations our general partner intends to limit its liability under contractual arrangements so that the counterparties to such arrangements have recourse only against our assets and not against our general partner or its assets our general partner may therefore cause us to incur indebtedness or other obligations that are nonrecourse to our general partner our partnership agreement provides that any action taken by our general partner to limit its liability is not a breach of our general partners fiduciary duties even if we could have obtained more favorable terms without the limitation on liability in addition we are obligated to reimburse or indemnify our general partner to the extent that it incurs obligations on our behalf any such reimbursement or indemnification payments would reduce the amount of cash otherwise available for distribution to our unitholders  table of contents our partnership agreement requires that we distribute all of our available cash which could limit our ability to grow and make acquisitions we expect that we will distribute all of our available cash to our unitholders and will rely primarily upon external financing sources including commercial bank borrowings and the issuance of debt and equity securities to fund our acquisitions and expansion capital expenditures as a result to the extent we are unable to finance growth externally our cash distribution policy will significantly impair our ability to grow in addition because we intend to distribute all of our available cash we may not grow as quickly as businesses that reinvest their available cash to expand ongoing operations to the extent we issue additional units in connection with any acquisitions or expansion capital expenditures the payment of distributions on those additional units may increase the risk that we will be unable to maintain or increase our perunit distribution level there are no limitations in our partnership agreement our revolving credit facility or senior notes indentures on our ability to issue additional units including units ranking senior to the common units the incurrence of additional commercial borrowings or other debt to finance our growth strategy would result in increased interest expense which in turn may impact the available cash that we have to distribute to our unitholders while our partnership agreement requires us to distribute all of our available cash our partnership agreement including provisions requiring us to make cash distributions contained therein may be amended while our partnership agreement requires us to distribute all of our available cash our partnership agreement including provisions requiring us to make cash distributions contained therein may be amended our partnership agreement can be amended with the consent of our general partner and the approval of a majority of the outstanding common units including common units held by affiliates of our general partner as of december    summit investments beneficially owned  common units out of  outstanding common units additionally in connection with the purchase program a subsidiary of energy capital partners had acquired  common units as of december    reimbursements due to our general partner and its affiliates for expenses incurred on our behalf will reduce cash available for distribution to our common unitholders the amount and timing of such reimbursements will be determined by our general partner prior to making any distribution on our common units we will reimburse our general partner and its affiliates including summit investments for expenses they incur and payments they make on our behalf under our partnership agreement we will reimburse our general partner and its affiliates for certain expenses incurred on our behalf including without limitation salary bonus incentive compensation and other amounts paid to our general partners employees and executive officers who provide services necessary to run our business our partnership agreement provides that our general partner will determine in good faith the expenses that are allocable to us the reimbursement of expenses to our general partner and its affiliates will reduce the amount of available cash to pay cash distributions to our unitholders our general partner may elect to cause us to issue common units to it in connection with a resetting of the mqd and the target distribution levels related to our general partners idrs without the approval of the conflicts committee or our unitholders this election may result in lower distributions to our unitholders in certain situations our general partner has the right at any time when it has received incentive distributions at the highest level to which it is entitled  for each of the prior four consecutive fiscal quarters and the amount of each such distribution did not exceed adjusted operating surplus for such quarter to reset the initial target distribution levels at higher levels based on our cash distribution at the time of the exercise of the reset election following a reset election by our general partner the mqd will be reset to an amount equal to the average cash distribution per unit for the two fiscal quarters immediately preceding the reset election such amount is referred to as the reset mqd and the target distribution levels will be reset to correspondingly higher levels based on percentage increases above the reset mqd in the event of a reset of target distribution levels our general partner will be entitled to receive the number of common units equal to that number of common units that would have entitled it to an average aggregate quarterly cash distribution in the prior two quarters equal to the average of the distributions on the idrs in the prior two quarters our general partner will also be issued the number of general partner units necessary to maintain its general partner interest in us that existed immediately prior to the reset election we anticipate that our general partner would exercise this reset right to facilitate acquisitions or internal growth projects that would not be sufficiently accretive to cash distributions per common unit without such conversion however it is possible that our  table of contents general partner could exercise this reset election at a time when we are experiencing declines in our aggregate cash distributions or at a time when our general partner expects that we will experience declines in our aggregate cash distributions in the foreseeable future in such situations our general partner may be experiencing or may expect to experience declines in the cash distributions it receives related to its idrs and may therefore desire to be issued common units which are entitled to specified priorities with respect to our distributions and which therefore may be more advantageous for the general partner to own in lieu of the right to receive incentive distribution payments based on target distribution levels that are less certain to be achieved in the thencurrent business environment as a result a reset election may cause our common unitholders to experience dilution in the amount of cash distributions that they would have otherwise received had we not issued common units to our general partner in connection with resetting the target distribution levels related to our general partners idrs the new york stock exchange does not require a publicly traded partnership like us to comply with certain of its corporate governance requirements we have listed our common units on the new york stock exchange because we are a publicly traded partnership the new york stock exchange does not require us to have and we do not intend to have a majority of independent directors on our general partners board of directors or to establish a nominating and corporate governance committee additionally any future issuance of additional common units or other securities including to affiliates will not be subject to the new york stock exchanges shareholder approval rules accordingly unitholders will not have the same protections afforded to certain corporations that are subject to all of the new york stock exchange corporate governance requirements holders of our common units have limited voting rights and are not entitled to elect our general partner or its directors unlike the holders of common stock in a corporation holders of our common units have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business and therefore limited ability to influence managements decisions regarding our business unitholders have no right on an annual or ongoing basis to elect our general partner or its board of directors the board of directors of our general partner has been chosen by summit investments furthermore if our unitholders are dissatisfied with the performance of our general partner they have little ability to remove our general partner as a result of these limitations the price at which the common units trade could be diminished because of the absence or reduction of a takeover premium in the trading price our partnership agreement also contains provisions limiting the ability of our unitholders to call meetings or to acquire information about our operations as well as other provisions limiting the unitholders ability to influence the manner or direction of management even if holders of our common units are dissatisfied they may not be able to remove our general partner without its consent the vote of the holders of at least   of all outstanding limited partner units voting together as a single class is required to remove our general partner as of december    summit investments beneficially owned  common units out of  outstanding common units representing a voting block sufficient to prevent the other limited partners from removing our general partner our partnership agreement restricts the voting rights of unitholders owning  or more of our common units unitholders voting rights are further restricted by a provision of our partnership agreement providing that any person or group that owns  or more of any class of units then outstanding cannot vote on any matter other than our general partner its affiliates their transferees and persons who acquired such units with the prior approval of the board of directors of our general partner our general partner interest or the control of our general partner may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent our general partner may transfer its general partner interest to a third party in a merger or in a sale of all or substantially all of its assets without the consent of the unitholders furthermore our partnership agreement does not restrict the ability of summit investments to transfer all or a portion of its ownership interest in our general partner to a third party the new owner of our general partner would then be in a position to replace the board of directors and officers of our general partner with its own designees and thereby exert significant control over the decisions made by the board of directors and officers this effectively permits a change of control without the vote or consent of the unitholders  table of contents we may issue additional units without unitholder approval which would dilute existing ownership interests our partnership agreement does not limit the number of additional limited partner interests including limited partner interests that rank senior to the common units that we may issue at any time without the approval of our unitholders the issuance by us of additional common units or other equity securities of equal or senior rank will have the following effects • decreasing our existing unitholders proportionate ownership interest in us and • because the amount payable to holders of idrs is based on a percentage of the total cash available for distribution the distributions to holders of idrs will increase even if the perunit distribution on common units remains the same in addition the issuance by us of additional common units or other equity securities of equal or senior rank may have the following effects • decreasing the amount of cash available for distribution on each unit • increasing the ratio of taxable income to distributions • diminishing the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding unit and • causing the market price of the common units to decline summit investments or our sponsor may sell units in the public or private markets and such sales could have an adverse impact on the trading price of the common units as of december    summit investments beneficially owned  common units out of  outstanding common units additionally in connection with the purchase program a subsidiary of energy capital partners had acquired  common units as of december    the sale of any of these units in the public or private markets could have an adverse impact on the price of the common units or on any trading market that may develop our general partner has a limited call right that may require an investor to sell its units at an undesirable time or price if at any time our general partner and its affiliates own more than  of our outstanding common units our general partner will have the right which it may assign to any of its affiliates or to us but not the obligation to acquire all but not less than all of the common units held by unaffiliated persons at a price that is not less than their thencurrent market price as calculated pursuant to the terms of our partnership agreement as a result an investor may be required to sell its common units at an undesirable time or price and may not receive any return on its investment an investor may also incur a tax liability upon a sale of its units as of december    summit investments beneficially owned  common units out of  outstanding common units additionally in connection with the purchase program a subsidiary of energy capital partners had acquired  common units as of december   as such our general partner and its affiliates controlled a total of  common units or  of our common units outstanding as of december    an investors liability may not be limited if a court finds that unitholder action constitutes control of our business a general partner of a partnership generally has unlimited liability for the obligations of the partnership except for those contractual obligations of the partnership that are expressly made without recourse to the general partner our partnership is organized under delaware law and we conduct business in a number of other states the limitations on the liability of holders of limited partner interests for the obligations of a limited partnership have not been clearly established in some of the other states in which we do business an investor could be liable for any and all of our obligations as if it was a general partner if a court or government agency were to determine that • we were conducting business in a state but had not complied with that particular states partnership statute or • an investors right to act with other unitholders to remove or replace our general partner to approve some amendments to our partnership agreement or to take other actions under our partnership agreement constitute control of our business  table of contents unitholders may have liability to repay distributions that were wrongfully distributed to them under certain circumstances unitholders may have to repay amounts wrongfully returned or distributed to them under delaware law we may not make a distribution if the distribution would cause our liabilities to exceed the fair value of our assets delaware law provides that for a period of three years from the date of an impermissible distribution limited partners who received the distribution and who knew at the time of the distribution that it violated delaware law will be liable to the limited partnership for the distribution amount substituted limited partners are liable both for the obligations of the assignor to make contributions to the partnership that were known to the substituted limited partner at the time it became a limited partner and for those obligations that were unknown if the liabilities could have been determined from the partnership agreement neither liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interest nor liabilities that are nonrecourse to the partnership are counted for purposes of determining whether a distribution is permitted if an investor is not an eligible holder it may not receive distributions or allocations of income or loss on those common units and those common units will be subject to redemption we have adopted certain requirements regarding those investors who may own our common units eligible holders are us individuals or entities subject to us federal income taxation on the income generated by us or entities not subject to us federal income taxation on the income generated by us so long as all of the entitys owners are us individuals or entities subject to such taxation if an investor is not an eligible holder our general partner may elect not to make distributions or allocate income or loss on that investors units and it runs the risk of having its units redeemed by us at the lower of purchase price cost or the thencurrent market price the redemption price may be paid in cash or by delivery of a promissory note as determined by our general partner tax risks our tax treatment depends on our status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes if the irs were to treat us as a corporation for federal income tax purposes which would subject us to entitylevel taxation then our cash available for distribution to our unitholders would be substantially reduced the anticipated aftertax economic benefit of an investment in our common units depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes despite the fact that we are a limited partnership under delaware law it is possible in certain circumstances for a partnership such as ours to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes a change in current law could cause us to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject us to taxation as an entity if we were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes we would pay federal income tax on our taxable income at the corporate tax rate which is currently a maximum of  and would likely pay state and local income tax at varying rates distributions would generally be taxed again as corporate dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits and no income gains losses deductions or credits would flow through to unitholders because a tax would be imposed upon us as a corporation our cash available for distribution would be substantially reduced therefore if we were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes there would be material reduction in the anticipated cash flows and aftertax return to our unitholders likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of our common units our partnership agreement provides that if a law is enacted or existing law is modified or interpreted in a manner that subjects us to taxation as a corporation or otherwise subjects us to entitylevel taxation for federal state or local income tax purposes the minimum quarterly distribution amount and the target distribution amounts may be adjusted to reflect the impact of that law on us if we were subjected to a material amount of additional entitylevel taxation by individual states it would reduce our cash available for distribution to our unitholders changes in current state law may subject us to additional entitylevel taxation by individual states because of state budget deficits and other reasons several states are evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entitylevel taxation through the imposition of state income franchise and other forms of taxation imposition of any such taxes may substantially reduce the cash available for distribution our partnership agreement provides that if a law is enacted or existing law is modified or interpreted in a manner that subjects us to entitylevel taxation the minimum quarterly distribution amount and the target distribution amounts may be adjusted to reflect the impact of that law on us  table of contents the tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships or an investment in our common units could be subject to potential legislative judicial or administrative changes and differing interpretations possibly on a retroactive basis the present us federal income tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships including us or an investment in our common units may be modified by administrative legislative or judicial changes or differing interpretations at any time from time to time members of congress and the president propose and consider substantive changes to the existing federal income tax laws that affect publicly traded partnerships if successful these or other similar proposals could eliminate the qualifying income exception to the treatment of all publicly traded partnerships as corporations upon which we rely for our treatment as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes in addition the us treasury department and the irs have issued final regulations concerning which activities give rise to qualifying income within the meaning of section  of the internal revenue code of  as amended the internal revenue code we do not believe the final regulations adversely affect the amount of our gross income treated as qualifying income or our ability to qualify as a publicly traded partnership however any change to these finalized regulations could modify the amount of our gross income that we are able to treat as qualifying income for the purposes of the qualifying income requirement any modification to the us federal income tax laws may be applied retroactively and could make it more difficult or impossible for us to meet the exception for certain publicly traded partnerships to be treated as partnerships for us federal income tax purposes we are unable to predict whether any of these changes or other proposals will ultimately be enacted any such changes could negatively impact the value of an investment in our common units our unitholders share of our income will be taxable to them for federal income tax purposes even if they do not receive any cash distributions from us because a unitholder will be treated as a partner to whom we will allocate taxable income that could be different in amount than the cash we distribute a unitholders allocable share of our taxable income will be taxable to it which may require the payment of federal income taxes and in some cases state and local income taxes on its share of our taxable income even if the unitholder receives no cash distributions from us our unitholders may not receive cash distributions from us equal to their share of our taxable income or even equal to the actual tax liability that results from that income if the irs contests the federal income tax positions we take the market for our common units may be adversely impacted and the cost of any irs contest will reduce our cash available for distribution to our unitholders the irs may adopt positions that differ from the positions we take and the irss positions may ultimately be sustained it may be necessary to resort to administrative or court proceedings to sustain some or all of the positions we take and such positions may not ultimately be sustained any contest with the irs and the outcome of any irs contest may have an adverse impact on the market for our common units and the price at which they trade in addition our costs of any contest with the irs will be borne indirectly by our unitholders and our general partner because the costs will reduce our cash available for distribution tax gain or loss on the disposition of our common units could be more or less than expected if a unitholder sells its common units a gain or loss will be recognized for federal income tax purposes equal to the difference between the amount realized and the unitholders tax basis in those common units because distributions in excess of a unitholders allocable share of its net taxable income decrease its tax basis in its common units the amount if any of such prior excess distributions with respect to the common units it sells will in effect become taxable income to the unitholder if it sells such common units at a price greater than its tax basis in those common units even if the price it receives is less than its original cost furthermore a substantial portion of the amount realized on any sale of a unitholders common units whether or not representing gain may be taxed as ordinary income due to potential recapture items including depreciation recapture in addition because the amount realized includes a unitholders share of our nonrecourse liabilities if a unitholder sells its common units it may incur a tax liability in excess of the amount of cash it receives from the sale taxexempt entities and nonus persons face unique tax issues from owning our common units that may result in adverse tax consequences to them investment in common units by taxexempt entities such as employee benefit plans and individual retirement accounts iras and nonus persons raises issues unique to them for example virtually all of our income allocated to organizations that are exempt from federal income tax including iras and other retirement plans will be unrelated business taxable income and will be taxable to them distributions to nonus persons will be reduced  table of contents by withholding taxes at the highest applicable effective tax rate and nonus persons will be required to file federal income tax returns and pay tax on their share of our taxable income taxexempt entities and nonus persons should consult a tax advisor before investing in our common units we will treat each purchaser of common units as having the same tax benefits without regard to the actual common units purchased the irs may challenge this treatment which could adversely affect the value of the common units because we cannot match transferors and transferees of common units and because of other reasons we will adopt depreciation and amortization positions that may not conform to all aspects of existing treasury regulations a successful irs challenge to those positions could adversely affect the amount of tax benefits available to our unitholders it also could affect the timing of these tax benefits or the amount of gain from our unitholders sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of our common units or result in audit adjustments to our unitholders tax returns we prorate our items of income gain loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our units each month based upon the ownership of our units on the first business day of each month instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is transferred the irs may challenge aspects of our proration method and if its challenge is successful we would be required to change the allocation of items of income gain loss and deduction among our unitholders we prorate our items of income gain loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our units each month based upon the ownership of our units on the first business day of each month instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is transferred the us treasury department and the irs have issued treasury regulations that permit publicly traded partnerships to use a monthly simplifying convention that is similar to ours but they do not specifically authorize all aspects of the proration method we have adopted if the irs were to successfully challenge this method we could be required to change the allocation of items of income gain loss and deduction among our unitholders a unitholder whose common units are loaned to a short seller to effect a short sale of common units may be considered as having disposed of those common units if so he would no longer be treated for federal income tax purposes as a partner with respect to those common units during the period of the loan and may recognize gain or loss from the disposition because a unitholder whose common units are loaned to a short seller to effect a short sale of common units may be considered as having disposed of the loaned common units he may no longer be treated for federal income tax purposes as a partner with respect to those common units during the period of the loan to the short seller and the unitholder may recognize gain or loss from such disposition moreover during the period of the loan to the short seller any of our income gain loss or deduction with respect to those common units may not be reportable by the unitholder and any cash distributions received by the unitholder as to those common units could be fully taxable as ordinary income unitholders desiring to assure their status as partners and avoid the risk of gain recognition from a loan to a short seller are advised to consult a tax advisor to discuss whether it is advisable to modify any applicable brokerage account agreements to prohibit their brokers from loaning their common units we have adopted certain valuation methodologies in determining a unitholders allocations of income gain loss and deduction the irs may challenge these methodologies or the resulting allocations and such a challenge could adversely affect the value of our common units in determining the items of income gain loss and deduction allocable to our unitholders in certain circumstances including when we issue additional units we must determine the fair market value of our assets although we may from time to time consult with professional appraisers regarding valuation matters we make many fair market value estimates using a methodology based on the market value of our common units as a means to measure the fair market value of our assets the irs may challenge these valuation methods and the resulting allocations of income gain loss and deduction a successful irs challenge to these methods or allocations could adversely affect the amount character and timing of taxable income or loss being allocated to our unitholders it also could affect the amount of gain from our unitholders sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of the common units or result in audit adjustments to our unitholders tax returns without the benefit of additional deductions  table of contents the sale or exchange of  or more of our capital and profits interests during any twelvemonth period will result in the termination of our partnership for federal income tax purposes we will be considered to have technically terminated our partnership for federal income tax purposes if there is a sale or exchange of  or more of the total interests in our capital and profits within a twelvemonth period for purposes of determining whether the  threshold has been met multiple sales of the same interest will be counted only once our technical termination would among other things result in the closing of our taxable year for all unitholders which would result in us filing two tax returns and our unitholders could receive two schedules k if relief was not available as described below for one fiscal year and would result in a deferral of depreciation deductions allowable in computing our taxable income in the case of a unitholder reporting on a taxable year other than a fiscal year ending december  the closing of our taxable year may also result in more than twelve months of our taxable income or loss being includable in the unitholders taxable income for the year of termination our termination currently would not affect our classification as a partnership for federal income tax purposes but instead we would be treated as a new partnership for tax purposes if treated as a new partnership we must make new tax elections and could be subject to penalties if we are unable to determine that a termination occurred the irs has announced a publicly traded partnership technical termination relief program whereby if a publicly traded partnership that technically terminated requests publicly traded partnership technical termination relief and such relief is granted by the irs among other things the partnership will only have to provide one schedule k to unitholders for the year notwithstanding two partnership tax years if the irs makes audit adjustments to our income tax returns for tax years beginning after december   it may assess and collect any taxes including any applicable penalties and interest resulting from such audit adjustment directly from us in which case our cash available for distribution to our unitholders could be substantially reduced pursuant to the bipartisan budget act of  for tax years beginning after december   if the irs makes audit adjustments to our income tax returns it may assess and collect any taxes including any applicable penalties and interest resulting from such audit adjustment directly from us generally we expect to elect to have our general partner and our unitholders take such audit adjustment into account in accordance with their interests in us during the tax year under audit but there can be no assurance that such election will be effective in all circumstances if we are unable to have our general partner and our unitholders take such audit adjustment into account in accordance with their interests in us during the tax year under audit our current unitholders may bear some or all of the tax liability resulting from such audit adjustment even if such unitholders did not own our units during the tax year under audit if as a result of any such audit adjustment we are required to make payments of taxes penalties and interest our cash available for distribution to our unitholders could be substantially reduced these rules are not applicable to us for tax years beginning on or prior to december   as a result of investing in our common units our unitholders may become subject to state and local taxes and return filing requirements in jurisdictions where we operate or own or acquire properties in addition to federal income taxes our unitholders will likely be subject to other taxes including state and local taxes unincorporated business taxes and estate inheritance or intangible taxes that are imposed by the various jurisdictions in which we conduct business or control property now or in the future even if the unitholders do not live in any of those jurisdictions our unitholders will likely be required to file state and local income tax returns and pay state and local income taxes in some or all of these various jurisdictions further our unitholders may be subject to penalties for failure to comply with those requirements some of the states in which we conduct business currently impose a personal income tax on individuals as we make acquisitions or expand our business we may control assets or conduct business in additional states that impose a personal income tax it is the unitholders responsibility to file all federal state and local tax returns item b unresolved staff comments not applicable

distributions and our ability to change our cash distribution policy there is no guarantee that our unitholders will receive quarterly distributions from us we do not have a legal obligation to pay the minimum quarterly distribution or any other distribution except to the extent we have available cash as defined in our partnership agreement our cash distribution policy may be changed at any time and is subject to certain restrictions including the following • our cash distribution policy is subject to restrictions on distributions under our revolving credit facility our revolving credit facility contains financial tests and covenants that we must satisfy should we be unable to satisfy these restrictions we may be prohibited from making cash distributions notwithstanding our stated cash distribution policy • our general partner has the authority to establish cash reserves for the prudent conduct of our business and for future cash distributions to our unitholders and the establishment or increase of those cash reserves could result in a reduction in cash distributions to our unitholders from the levels we currently anticipate pursuant to our stated distribution policy any determination to establish cash reserves made by our general partner in good faith will be binding on our unitholders  table of contents • although our partnership agreement requires us to distribute all of our available cash our partnership agreement including the provisions requiring us to distribute all of our available cash may be amended we can amend our partnership agreement with

determined by our general partner taking into consideration the terms of our partnership agreement • under delaware law we may not make a distribution if the distribution would cause our liabilities to exceed the fair value of our assets • we may lack sufficient cash to pay distributions to our unitholders due to cash flow shortfalls attributable to a number of operational commercial or other factors as well as increases in our operating or general and administrative expenses principal and interest payments on our debt tax expenses working capital requirements and anticipated cash needs our cash available for distribution to unitholders is directly impacted by our cash expenses necessary to run our business and will be reduced dollarfordollar to the extent such uses of cash increase

northern west virginia for additional information on our organization and systems see notes  and  to the consolidated financial statements our financial results are driven primarily by volume throughput and expense management we generate the majority of our revenues from the gathering treating and processing services that we provide to our customers a substantial majority of the volumes that we gather treat andor process have a fixedfee rate structure thereby enhancing the stability of our cash flows by providing a revenue stream that is not subject to direct commodity price risk we also earn revenues from i the sale of physical natural gas and ngls purchased under percentageofproceeds arrangements with certain of our customers on the bison midstream and grand river systems ii the sale of natural gas we retain from certain dfw midstream customers and iii the sale of condensate we retain from our gathering services at grand river these additional activities which expose us to direct commodity price risk accounted for less than  of total revenues during the year ended december   we also have indirect exposure to changes in commodity prices in that persistently low commodity prices may cause our customers to delay andor cancel drilling andor completion activities or temporarily shutin production which would reduce the volumes of natural gas and crude oil and associated volumes of produced water that we gather if certain of our customers cancel or delay drilling andor completion activities or temporarily shutin production the associated mvcs ensure that we will recognize a minimum amount of revenue the following table presents certain annual consolidated financial data   year ended december             in thousands net loss              reportable

results • in march  we acquired the  drop down assets from a subsidiary of summit investments we funded the drop down with borrowings under our revolving credit facility and the execution of the deferred purchase price obligation with summit investments see notes   and  to the consolidated financial statements • in june  an impairment loss was recognized by occ we recorded our    share of the impairment loss or   million  in loss from equity method investees in the consolidated statements of operations we exclude income or loss from equity method investees from our definition of segment adjusted ebitda as such utica shale segment adjusted ebitda was not impacted by the impairment loss see note  to the consolidated financial statements • in september  we completed an underwritten

contribution see notes  and  to the consolidated financial statements • in may  we completed an underwritten public offering of  common units at a price of  per unit and used a portion of the net proceeds to partially fund the polar and divide drop down following the offering our general partner made a capital contribution to us to maintain its approximate  general partner interest see note  to the consolidated financial statements • in september  we recognized  million of gathering services and related fees revenue that had been previously deferred in connection with an mvc arrangement with a certain piceancedj basins customer which was determined to no longer be recoverable by the customer we include the effect of adjustments related to mvc shortfall payments in our definition of segment adjusted ebitda as such piceancedj basins segment adjusted ebitda was not impacted because the revenue recognition was offset by the associated adjustments related to mvc shortfall payments for this customer see note  to the consolidated financial statements • in september and december  we recognized additional accruals for environmental remediation expenses totaling  million associated with the rupture of a produced water gathering pipeline in the williston basin reportable segment see note  to the consolidated financial statements • after a slight pause midyear  crude oil and ngl prices continued to decline in response to the global supply surplus as a result several of the producers in our areas of operations announced plans to cancel delay andor reduce drilling plans which in turn negatively impacted the margins that we earn slowing the growth in net income in addition to impacting the margins that we earn and net income the goodwill that we had previously recognized in connection with our acquisitions of polar and divide and grand river was determined to be fully impaired resulting in a writeoff of  million see note  to the consolidated financial statements year ended december   the following items are reflected in our financial results • in the second half of  crude oil and ngl prices began to decline negatively impacting producers in each of our areas of operation the impact of these declines were most evident in our north dakota operations where our percentage of feebased gathering agreements is less than that of our other systems in addition to impacting the margins that we earned the goodwill that we had previously recognized in connection with our acquisition of bison midstream was determined to be fully impaired resulting in a writeoff of  million see note  to the consolidated financial statements • in march  we acquired red rock gathering from a subsidiary of summit investments in a drop down transaction see notes  and  to the consolidated financial statements we also completed several system expansion projects across all systems • in march  we completed an underwritten public offering of  common units at a price of  per unit and used a portion of the net proceeds to partially fund the red rock drop down  table of contents following the offering our general partner made a capital contribution to us to maintain its approximate  general partner interest see note  to the consolidated financial statements • in july  we issued  million of  senior notes and used the proceeds to repay a portion of our outstanding revolving credit facility balance see note  to the consolidated financial statements trends and outlook our business has been and we expect our future business to continue to be affected by the following key trends • natural gas ngl and crude oil supply and demand dynamics • growth in production from us shale plays • capital markets activity and cost of capital and • shifts in operating costs and inflation our expectations are based on assumptions made by us and information currently available to us to the extent our underlying assumptions about or interpretations of available information prove to be incorrect our actual results may vary materially from our expected results natural gas ngl and crude oil supply and demand dynamics natural gas continues to be a critical component of energy supply and demand in the united states the price of natural gas rebounded during  with the new york mercantile exchange or nymex natural gas futures price at  per one million british thermal units mmbtu as of december   compared with  per mmbtu as of december   despite the significant increase natural gas prices continue to trade at lowerthanaverage historical prices due in part to increased natural gas production and the amount of natural gas in storage in the continental united states in the near term we believe that until the supply of natural gas in storage has been reduced natural gas prices are likely to remain constrained over the long term we believe that the prospects for continued natural gas demand are favorable and will be driven primarily by global population and economic growth as well as the continued displacement of coalfired electricity generation by natural gasfired electricity generation in addition certain of our gathering systems are directly affected by crude oil supply and demand dynamics similar to natural gas prices crude oil prices increased significantly during  with the west texas intermediate wti crude oil price benchmark increasing by  from february to december of  when it closed at  per barrel in response to the increase in crude oil prices the number of active crude oil drilling rigs in the continental united states increased from a low of  in may  to  in december  according to baker hughes over the next several years we expect that crude oil prices will rebound sufficiently to support continued drilling and increasing production in the bakken shale eagle ford shale permian basin and niobrara shale growth in production from us shale plays over the past several years natural gas production from unconventional shale resources has increased significantly due to advances in technology that allow producers to extract significant volumes of natural gas from unconventional shale plays on favorable economic terms relative to most conventional plays in recent years a number of producers and their joint venture partners including large international operators industrial manufacturers and private equity sponsors have committed significant capital to the development of these unconventional resources including the piceance basin barnett bakken marcellus and utica shale plays in which we operate and we believe that these longterm capital investments will support sustained drilling activity in unconventional shale plays capital markets availability and cost of capital credit markets improved substantially throughout  as borrowing costs were lower relative to the levels generally experienced during the  global financial crisis for virtually all energy industryrelated borrowers the credit market trends in the crude oil and natural gas industry during  were unique relative to the broader economy while borrowing costs came down for the oil and natural gas industry as a whole the federal reserve announced that it raised its benchmark federalfunds rate from  and  to a range between  and  in december  the federal reserve also announced its intent to continue to raise interest rates gradually in the future to the extent that economic growth continues capital markets conditions including but not limited to availability and higher borrowing costs could affect our ability to access the debt capital markets to the extent necessary to fund our future growth in addition interest rates on future credit facilities and debt offerings could be higher than current levels causing our financing costs to increase accordingly although this could limit our ability to raise debt capital on acceptable terms we expect to remain competitive with respect to acquisitions and capital projects as our peers and competitors would likely face similar circumstances  table of contents shifts in operating costs and inflation throughout most of the last five years high levels of crude oil and natural gas exploration development and production activities across the united states resulted in increased competition for personnel and equipment as well as higher prices for labor supplies equipment and other services beginning in  this dynamic began to shift as prices for crude oil and natural gasrelated services decreased in line with overall decline in demand for these goods and services while we expect lower servicerelated costs in the near term we expect that over the longer term these costs will continue to have a high correlation to changes in the prevailing price of crude oil and natural gas how we evaluate our operations we conduct and report our operations in the midstream energy industry through five reportable segments • the utica shale which includes our ownership interest in ohio gathering and is served by summit utica • the williston basin which is served by bison midstream polar and divide and tioga midstream • the piceancedj basins which is served by grand river and niobrara gp • the barnett shale which is served by dfw midstream and • the marcellus shale which is served by mountaineer midstream each of our reportable segments provides midstream services in a specific geographic area our reportable segments reflect the way in which we internally report the financial information used to make decisions and allocate resources in connection with our operations see note  to the consolidated financial statements our management uses a variety of financial and operational metrics to analyze our consolidated and segment performance we view these metrics as important factors in evaluating our profitability and determining the amounts of cash distributions to pay to our unitholders these metrics include • throughput volume • revenues • operation and maintenance expenses and • segment adjusted ebitda throughput volume the volume of i natural gas that we gather treat andor process and ii crude oil and produced water that we gather depends on the level of production from natural gas or crude oil wells connected to our gathering systems aggregate production volumes are impacted by the overall amount of drilling and completion activity furthermore because the production rate of natural gas and crude oil wells decline over time production can only be maintained or increased by new drilling or other activity as a result we must continually obtain new supplies of production to maintain or increase the throughput volume on our systems our ability to maintain or increase throughput volumes from existing customers and obtain new supplies of throughput is impacted by • successful drilling activity within our amis • the level of workovers and recompletions of wells on existing pad sites to which our gathering systems are connected • the number of new pad sites in our amis awaiting connections • our ability to compete for volumes from successful new wells in the areas in which we operate outside of our existing amis and • our ability to gather treat andor process production that has been released from commitments with our competitors we report volumes gathered for natural gas in cubic feet per day we aggregate crude oil and produced water gathering and report volumes gathered in barrels per day  table of contents revenues our revenues are primarily attributable to the volumes that we gather treat andor process and the rates we charge for those services a substantial majority of our gathering and processing agreements are feebased which limits our direct commodity price exposure we also have percentofproceeds arrangements under which the gathering and processing revenues that we earn correlate directly with the fluctuating price of natural gas condensate and ngls many of our gathering and processing agreements contain mvcs pursuant to which our customers agree to ship or process a minimum volume of production on our gathering systems or in some cases to pay a minimum monetary amount over certain periods during the term of the mvc these mvcs support our revenues and serve to mitigate the financial impact associated with declining volumes operation and maintenance expenses we seek to maximize the profitability of our operations in part by minimizing to the extent appropriate expenses directly tied to operating our assets direct labor costs compression costs ad valorem taxes repair and noncapitalized maintenance costs integrity management costs utilities and contract services comprise the most significant portion of our operation and maintenance expense other than utilities expense these expenses are largely independent of volumes delivered through our gathering systems but may fluctuate depending on the activities performed during a specific period segment adjusted ebitda segment adjusted ebitda is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of our financial statements such as investors commercial banks research analysts and others segment adjusted ebitda is used to assess • the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to make cash distributions and support our indebtedness • the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods capital structure or historical cost basis • our operating performance and return on capital as compared to those of other companies in the midstream energy sector without regard to financing or capital structure • the attractiveness of capital projects and acquisitions and the overall rates of return on alternative investment

capital requirements our principal business strategy is to increase the amount of cash distributions we make to our unitholders over time our ability to grow cash distributions depends in part on our ability to capitalize on organic growth opportunities and make acquisitions that increase the amount of cash generated from our operations on a perunit basis along with other factors  table of contents developing owning and operating midstream energy infrastructure assets requires significant investment in the maintenance of existing gathering systems and the construction and development of new gathering systems and other midstream assets and facilities our partnership agreement requires that we categorize our capital expenditures as either • maintenance capital expenditures which are cash expenditures including expenditures for the addition or improvement to or the replacement of our capital assets or for the acquisition of existing or the construction or development of new capital assets made to maintain our longterm operating income or operating capacity or • expansion capital expenditures which are cash expenditures incurred for acquisitions or capital improvements

million for the year ended december   and  million for the year ended december   see note  to the consolidated financial statements the yearoveryear declines in cash paid for capital expenditures primarily reflected the buildout in  and  of recently acquired systems and the completion of several large capital projects on legacy systems the acquisition component of our principal business strategy has required and will continue to require significant expenditures by us consequently our ability to develop and maintain sources of funds to meet our capital requirements is critical to our ability to meet our growth objectives we intend to continue to pursue accretive acquisitions of midstream assets from third parties however their size timing andor contribution to our operations and financial results cannot be reasonably estimated furthermore there are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our current expectations to change including but not limited to i the ability to reach agreement with third parties ii prevailing conditions and outlook in the natural gas crude oil and natural gas liquids industries and markets and iii our ability to obtain financing from commercial banks the capital markets or other sources such as our sponsor and summit investments among other factors we rely primarily on external financing sources including commercial bank borrowings and the issuance of debt and equity securities to fund our acquisitions and expansion capital expenditures we believe that our revolving credit facility together with financial support from our sponsor andor access to the debt and equity capital markets will be adequate to finance our growth objectives for the foreseeable future without adversely impacting our liquidity or our ability to make quarterly cash distributions to our unitholders distributions including idrs based on the terms of our partnership agreement we expect to distribute most of the cash generated by our operations to our unitholders with respect to our payment of idrs to the general partner we reached the second target distribution in connection with the distribution declared in respect of the fourth quarter of  we reached the third target distribution in connection with the distribution declared in respect of the second quarter of  for additional information see our cash distribution policy and restrictions on distributions in item  market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities and note  to the consolidated financial statements credit and counterparty concentration risks we examine the creditworthiness of counterparties to whom we extend credit and manage our exposure to credit risk through credit analysis credit approval credit limits and monitoring procedures and for certain transactions we may request letters of credit prepayments or guarantees given the current environment certain of our customers may be temporarily unable to meet their current obligations while this may cause disruption to cash flows we believe that we are properly positioned to deal with the potential disruption because the vast majority of our gathering assets are strategically positioned at the beginning of the midstream value chain the majority of our infrastructure is connected directly to our customer’s wellheads and pad sites which means our gathering systems are typically the first thirdparty infrastructure through which our customer’s commodities flow and in many cases the only way for our customers to get their production to market  table of contents we have exposure due to nonperformance under our mvc contracts whereby a customer who was not meeting their mvcs does not have the wherewithal to make its mvc shortfall payments when they become due we typically receive payment for all prioryear mvc shortfall billings in the quarter immediately following billing therefore our exposure to risk of nonperformance is limited to and accumulates during the current yeartodate contracted measurement period for additional information see notes   and  to the consolidated financial statements offbalance sheet arrangements we had no offbalance sheet arrangements as of or during the year ended december   critical accounting estimates we prepare our financial statements in accordance with gaap these principles are established by the fasb we employ methods estimates and assumptions based on currently available information when recording transactions resulting from business operations our significant accounting policies are described in note  to the consolidated financial statements the estimates that we deem to be most critical to an understanding of our financial position and results of operations are those related to determination of fair value and recognition of deferred revenue the preparation and evaluation of these critical accounting estimates involve the use of various assumptions developed from managements analyses and judgments subsequent experience or use of other methods estimates or assumptions could produce significantly different results our critical accounting estimates are as follows recognition and impairment of longlived assets our longlived assets include property plant and equipment amortizing intangible assets and goodwill property plant and equipment and amortizing intangible assets as of december   we had net property plant and equipment with a carrying value of approximately  billion and net amortizing intangible assets with a carrying value of approximately  million  when evidence exists that we will not be able to recover a longlived assets carrying value through future cash flows we write down the carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value we test assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a longlived asset may not be recoverable as well as in connection with any goodwill impairment evaluations with respect to property plant and equipment and our amortizing intangible assets the carrying value of a longlived asset is not recoverable if the carrying value exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the assets use and eventual disposal in this situation we recognize an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the assets fair value we determine fair value using an income approach in which we discount the assets expected future cash flows to reflect the risk associated with achieving the underlying cash flows any impairment determinations involve significant assumptions and judgments differing assumptions regarding any of these inputs could have a significant effect on the various valuations as such the fair value measurements utilized within these estimates are classified as nonrecurring level  measurements in the fair value hierarchy because they are not observable from objective sources due to the volatility of the inputs used we cannot predict the likelihood of any future impairment for additional information see notes   and  to the consolidated financial statements goodwill we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually on september  and whenever events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value including goodwill  impairment evaluations  we performed our  annual goodwill impairment analysis as of september  and concluded that none of our goodwill had been impaired  impairment evaluations  during the latter part of the fourth quarter of  and the early part of the first quarter of  the declines in forward prices for natural gas ngls and crude oil accelerated significantly as a result the energy sectors public debt and equity market experienced increased volatility particularly for comparable companies operating in the midstream services sector additionally during this period the values of our publicly traded equity and debt instruments decreased as did those of comparable midstream companies due to i the increased market volatility ii the decrease in market values of comparable companies iii the continued trend of falling commodity prices and iv the finalization of our annual financial and operating plans which took into account  table of contents changes resulting from expected levels of drilling activity we concluded that a triggering event occurred which required that we test the goodwill associated with our grand river and polar and divide reporting units for impairment as of december   in connection therewith we concluded that the goodwill associated with our grand river and polar and divide reporting units was fully impaired and we wrote off the associated balances  impairment evaluations  during the latter part of the fourth quarter of  the declines in prices for natural gas ngls and crude oil accelerated negatively impacting producers in each of our areas of operation as a result we considered whether any of our goodwill could have been impaired in connection with this assessment we concluded that a fourth quarter triggering event had occurred which required that we test the goodwill associated with our polar and divide and bison midstream reporting units for impairment as of december   in connection therewith we concluded that i the goodwill associated with our polar and divide reporting unit was not impaired and ii the goodwill associated with our bison midstream reporting unit was fully impaired and we wrote off the associated balance see notes  and  for additional information deferred purchase price obligation we recognized the deferred purchase price obligation to reflect the present value of the remaining consideration our calculation of the remaining consideration incorporates • actual capital expenditures and business adjusted ebitda for the period from march   through the respective balance sheet date and • estimates of i capital expenditures made between the respective balance sheet date and december   and ii business adjusted ebitda an incomebased measure during the period from the respective balance sheet date to december   the calculation of the prospective component of remaining consideration represents managements best estimate of these two financial measures we then discount the remaining consideration using a commensurate riskadjusted discount rate and recognize the present value on our consolidated balance sheets with the change in present value recognized in earnings in the period of change the estimates and expectations used in calculating the prospective component of remaining consideration and the present value calculation of the remaining consideration involve a significant amount of judgment as the calculations are based on future events andor conditions including i revenues ii estimates of future volume throughput capital expenditures operating costs and their timing and iii economic and regulatory climates among other factors our estimates of these inputs are inherently imprecise because they reflect our expectation of future conditions that are largely outside of our control while the assumptions used are consistent with our current business plans and investment decisions these assumptions could change significantly during the period leading up to settlement of the deferred purchase price obligation see note  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information minimum volume commitments certain of our gathering agreements provide for a monthly quarterly or annual mvc from our customers as of december   we had mvcs totaling  bcfed through   under these mvcs our customers agree to ship andor process a minimum volume of production on our gathering systems or to pay a minimum monetary amount over certain periods during the term of the mvc a customer must make a shortfall payment to us at the end of the contracted measurement period if its actual throughput volumes are less than its mvc for that period certain customers are entitled to utilize shortfall payments to offset gathering fees in one or more subsequent contracted measurement periods to the extent that such customers throughput volumes in a subsequent contracted measurement period exceed its mvc for that period we recognize customer billings for obligations under their mvcs as revenue when the obligations are billable under the contract and the customer does not have the right to utilize shortfall payments to offset gathering fees in excess of its mvcs in subsequent periods we billed  million of mvc shortfall payments to customers that did not meet their mvcs during  for those customers that do not have credit banking mechanisms in their gathering agreements or have no ability to use mvc shortfall payments as credits the mvc shortfall payments from these customers are accounted for as gathering revenue in the period that they are earned we recognized  million of gathering revenue due to the credit bank expiration of previous mvc shortfall payments mvc shortfall

excess volumes of natural gas or ii expired or lapsed through the passage of time pursuant to the terms of the applicable gathering agreement we also recognize deferred revenue when it is determined that a given amount of mvc shortfall payments cannot be recovered by offsetting gathering or processing fees in subsequent contracted measurement periods in making this determination we consider both quantitative and qualitative facts and circumstances including but not limited to contract terms capacity of the associated pipeline or receipt point andor expectations regarding future investment drilling and production we classify deferred revenue as a current liability for arrangements where the expiration of a customers right to utilize shortfall payments is twelve months or less we classify deferred revenue as noncurrent for arrangements where the expiration of the right to utilize shortfall payments and our estimate of its potential utilization is more than  months as of december   noncurrent deferred revenue totaled  million and represents amounts that provide these customers the ability to offset their gathering fees as determined by the mvc contract to the extent that their throughput volumes exceed their mvc adjustments for mvc shortfall payments we estimate the impact of expected mvc shortfall payments for inclusion in our calculation of segment adjusted ebitda adjustments related to mvc shortfall payments account for • the net increases or decreases in deferred revenue for mvc shortfall payments and • our inclusion of expected annual mvc shortfall payments we include a proportional amount of these historical or expected mvc shortfall payments in our calculation of segment adjusted ebitda each quarter until we actually recognize the shortfall payment these adjustments have not been billed to our customers and are not recognized in our consolidated financial statements we estimate expected mvc shortfall payments based on assumptions

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our current interest rate risk exposure is largely related to our debt portfolio as of december   we had  million principal of fixedrate senior notes and  million outstanding under our variable rate revolving credit facility see note  to the consolidated financial statements while existing fixedrate debt mitigates the downside impact of fluctuations in interest rates future issuances of longterm debt could be impacted by increases in interest rates which could result in higher overall interest costs in addition the borrowings under our revolving credit facility which have a variable interest rate also expose us to the risk of increasing interest rates for the year ended december   a hypothetical  increase decrease in interest rates would have increased decreased our interest expense by approximately  million assuming no changes in amounts drawn or other variables under our revolving credit facility or senior notes commodity price risk we currently generate a substantial majority of our revenues pursuant to primarily longterm and feebased gathering agreements many of which include mvcs and areas of mutual interest our direct commodity price exposure relates to i our sale of physical natural gas we retain from certain dfw midstream system customers ii our procurement of electricity to operate our electricdrive compression assets on the dfw midstream system iii the sale of condensate volumes that we retain on the grand river system and iv the sale of processed natural gas and ngls pursuant to our percentofproceeds contracts with certain of our customers on the bison midstream and grand river systems our gathering agreements with certain dfw midstream system customers permit us to retain a certain quantity of natural gas that we sell to offset the power costs we incur to operate our electricdrive compression assets our gathering agreements with our grand river customers permit us to retain condensate volumes from the grand river system gathering lines we manage our direct exposure to natural gas and power prices through the use of forward power purchase contracts with wholesale power providers that require us to purchase a fixed quantity of power at a fixed heat rate based on prevailing natural gas prices on the waha hub index because we also sell our retainage gas at prices that are based on the waha hub index we have effectively fixed the relationship between our compression electricity expense and natural gas sales we do not enter into risk

which owns i certain crude oil and produced water gathering pipelines which are managed and reported as part of the polar and divide system subsequent to the  drop down and ii niobrara gp which is managed and reported as part of the grand river system subsequent to the  drop down presentation and consolidation we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap as established by the fasb we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates including fair value measurements the reported amounts of revenue and expense and the disclosure of contingencies although management believes these estimates are reasonable actual results could differ from its estimates the consolidated financial statements include the assets liabilities and results of operations of smlp and its wholly owned subsidiaries all intercompany transactions among the consolidated entities have been eliminated in consolidation for the purposes of the consolidated financial statements smlps results of operations reflect the results of operations of i bison midstream polar and divide grand river niobrara gp dfw

allocations and estimates were based on methodologies that management believes are reasonable the carveout results reflected herein however may not reflect what these entities financial position results of operations or cash flows would have been if any had been a standalone company smlp recognized its drop down acquisitions at summit investments historical cost because the acquisitions were executed by entities under common control the excess of summit investments net investment over the consideration paid and recognized for a contributed subsidiary is recognized as an addition to partners capital while the excess of purchase price paid and recognized over net investment is recognized as a reduction to partners capital due to the common control aspect we account for drop down transactions on an “asif pooled” basis for the periods during which common control existed  table of contents reclassifications in the first quarter of  we adopted asu no  interest—imputation of

investments with original maturities of three months or less accounts receivable accounts receivable relate to gathering and other services provided to our customers and other counterparties we evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable and the need for an allowance for doubtful accounts based on customerspecific facts and circumstances to the extent we doubt the collectability of a specific customer or counterparty receivable we recognize an allowance for doubtful accounts other current assets other current assets primarily consist of the current portion of prepaid expenses that are charged to expense over the period of benefit or the life of the related contract property plant and equipment we record property plant and equipment at historical cost of construction or fair value of the assets at acquisition we capitalize expenditures that extend the useful life of an asset or enhance its productivity or efficiency from its original design over the expected remaining period of use for maintenance and repairs that do not add capacity or extend the useful life of an asset we recognize expenditures as an expense as incurred we capitalize project costs incurred during construction including interest on funds borrowed to finance the construction of facilities as construction in progress to the extent that summit investments incurred interest expense related to capital projects of assets that have been acquired by the partnership the associated interest expense is allocated to the drop down assets as a noncash equity contribution and capitalized into the basis of the asset we record depreciation on a straightline basis over an asset’s estimated useful life we base our estimates for useful life on various factors including age in the case of acquired assets manufacturing specifications technological advances and historical data concerning useful lives of similar assets estimates of useful lives follow   useful lives in years gathering and processing systems and related equipment  other  construction in progress is depreciated consistent with its applicable asset class once it is placed in service land and line fill are not depreciated we base an asset’s carrying value on estimates assumptions and judgments for useful life and salvage value upon sale retirement or other disposal we remove the carrying value of an asset and its accumulated depreciation from our balance sheet and recognize the related gain or loss if any accrued capital expenditures are reflected in trade accounts payable asset retirement obligations we record a liability for asset retirement obligations only if and when a future asset retirement obligation with a determinable life is identified for identified asset retirement obligations we then evaluate whether the expected date and related costs of retirement can be estimated we have concluded that our gathering and processing assets have an indeterminate life because they are owned and will operate for an indeterminate period when properly maintained because we did not have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amount or timing of such obligations and we have no current plan to discontinue use of any significant assets we did not provide for any asset retirement obligations as of december   or   amortizing intangibles upon the acquisition of dfw midstream certain of its gas gathering contracts were deemed to have abovemarket pricing structures while another was deemed to have pricing that was below market we have recognized the abovemarket contracts as favorable gas gathering contracts we have recognized the belowmarket contract as the unfavorable gas gathering contract and included it in other noncurrent liabilities we amortize these contracts using a straightline method over the contracts estimated useful life we define useful life as the period over which the contract is expected to contribute to our future cash flows these contracts have original terms ranging from  years to  years we recognize the amortization expense associated with these contracts in other revenues  table of contents we amortize all other gas gathering contracts or contract intangibles over the period of economic benefit based upon expected revenues over the life of the contract the useful life of these contracts ranges from  years to  years we recognize the amortization expense associated with these contracts in depreciation and amortization expense we have rightsofway associated with city easements and easements granted within existing rightsofway we amortize these intangible assets over the shorter of the contractual term of the rightsofway or the estimated useful life of the gathering system the contractual terms of the rightsofway range from  years to  years we recognize the amortization expense associated with rightsofway assets in depreciation and amortization expense goodwill goodwill represents consideration paid in excess of the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired in a business combination we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually on september  we also evaluate goodwill whenever events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we test goodwill for impairment using a twostep quantitative test in the first step we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill to estimate the fair value of the reporting units under step one we utilize two valuation methodologies the market approach and the income approach both of these approaches incorporate significant estimates and assumptions to calculate enterprise fair value for a reporting unit the most significant estimates and assumptions inherent within these two valuation methodologies are i determination of the weightedaverage cost of capital ii the selection of guideline public companies iii market multiples iv weighting of the income and market approaches v growth rates vi commodity prices and vi the expected levels of throughput volume gathered changes in these and other assumptions could materially affect the estimated amount of fair value for any of our reporting units if the reporting unit’s fair value exceeds its carrying amount we conclude that the goodwill of the reporting unit has not been impaired and no further work is performed if we determine that the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value we proceed to step two in step two we compare the carrying value of the reporting unit to its implied fair value significant estimates and assumptions utilized in the determination of a reporting units implied fair value are based on a variety of factors specific to a given reporting units individual assets and liabilities as well as market and industry considerations if we determine that the carrying amount of a reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value we recognize the excess of the carrying value over the implied fair value as an impairment loss equity method investments we account for investments in which we exercise significant influence using the equity method so long as we i do not control the investee and ii are not the primary beneficiary we recognize these investments in investment in equity method investees in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets we recognize our proportionate share of earnings or loss in net income on a onemonth lag we recognize an otherthantemporary impairment for losses in the value of equity method investees when evidence indicates that the carrying amount is no longer supportable evidence of a loss in value might include but would not necessarily be limited to absence of an ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment or inability of the equity method investee to sustain an earnings capacity that would justify the carrying amount of the investment a current fair value of an investment that is less than its carrying amount may indicate a loss in value of the investment we evaluate our equity method investments whenever evidence exists that would indicate a need to assess the investment for potential impairment other noncurrent assets other noncurrent assets primarily consist of external costs incurred in connection with the closing of our revolving credit facility and related amendments we capitalize and then amortize these debt issuance costs on a straightline basis over the life of the respective debt instrument we recognize amortization of revolving credit facility debt issuance costs in interest expense debt issuance costs debt issuance costs other than those associated with our revolving credit facility are reflected in the carrying value of the senior notes as an adjustment to the principal amount and amortized on a straightline basis over the life of the respective debt instrument we recognize senior notes debt issuance costs in interest expense deferred purchase price obligation we recognize a liability for the deferred purchase price obligation as defined later to reflect the expected value of the remaining consideration to be paid in  for the acquisition of the  drop down assets we estimate remaining consideration by summing the calculations of i actual capital expenditures incurred and business adjusted ebitda as defined later recognized from the  drop down assets during the period since closing the  drop down to the current balance sheet date and ii  table of contents estimates of projected capital expenditures and business adjusted ebitda related to the  drop down assets for periods subsequent to the respective balance sheet date until december   we discount the remaining consideration using a commensurate riskadjusted discount rate and recognize the change in present value of the remaining consideration in earnings in the period of change our recognition of the change in present value of the remaining consideration in the consolidated statements of operations represents the change in present value which comprises a time value of money concept as well as i actual results from the  drop down assets and ii adjustments to projections and the expected value of the remaining consideration see note  impairment of longlived assets we test assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a longlived asset may not be recoverable the carrying value of a longlived asset except goodwill is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition if we conclude that an assets carrying value will not be recovered through future cash flows we recognize an impairment loss on the longlived asset equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its fair value we determine fair value using either a marketbased approach or an incomebased approach we discuss our policy for goodwill impairment above derivative contracts we have commodity price exposure related to our sale of the physical natural gas we retain from certain dfw midstream system customers and our procurement of electricity to operate the dfw midstream systems electricdrive compression assets our gas gathering agreements with certain dfw midstream customers permit us to retain a certain quantity of natural gas that we gather to offset the power costs we incur to operate these electricdrive compression assets we manage this direct exposure to natural gas and power prices through the use of forward power purchase contracts with wholesale power providers that require us to purchase a fixed quantity of power at a fixed heat rate based on prevailing natural gas prices based on the waha hub index because we sell our retainage gas from these customers at prices that are based on the waha hub index we have effectively fixed the relationship between a portion of our compression electricity expense and natural gas retainage sales accounting standards related to derivative instruments and hedging activities allow for normal purchase or sale elections and hedge accounting designations which generally eliminate or defer the requirement for marktomarket recognition in net income and thus reduce the volatility of net income that can result from fluctuations in fair values we have designated these contracts as normal under the normal purchase and sale exception under the accounting standards for derivatives we do not enter into risk management contracts for speculative purposes fair value of financial instruments the fairvaluemeasurement standard under gaap defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date the standard characterizes inputs used in determining fair value according to a hierarchy that prioritizes those inputs based upon the degree to which the inputs are observable the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows • level  inputs represent quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities • level  inputs other than quoted prices included within level  that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly for example quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets not considered to be active inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability or marketcorroborated inputs and • level  inputs that are not observable from objective sources such as management’s internally developed assumptions used in pricing an asset or liability for example an internally developed present value of future cash flows model that underlies managements fair value measurement commitments and contingencies we record accruals for loss contingencies when we determine that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and that such economic loss can be reasonably estimated such determinations are subject to interpretations of current facts and circumstances forecasts of future events and estimates of the financial impacts of such events we recognize gain contingencies when their realization is assured beyond a reasonable doubt noncontrolling interest noncontrolling interest represents the ownership interests of thirdparty entities in the net assets of our consolidated subsidiaries for financial reporting purposes we consolidate opco and its wholly owned subsidiaries with our wholly owned subsidiaries and the  ownership interest in opco is reflected as noncontrolling interest in partners capital we reflect changes in our ownership of opco as adjustments to noncontrolling interest  table of contents revenue recognition we generate the majority of our revenue from the gathering treating and processing services that we provide to our customers we also generate revenue from our marketing of natural gas ngls and condensate we realize revenues by receiving fees from our customers or by selling the residue natural gas ngls and condensate we recognize revenue earned from feebased gathering treating and processing services in gathering services and related fees revenue we also earn revenue from the sale of physical natural gas purchased from our customers under percentageofproceeds arrangements these revenues are recognized in natural gas ngls and condensate sales with corresponding expense recognition for the producers share of the proceeds in cost of natural gas and ngls we sell substantially all of the natural gas that we retain from certain dfw midstream customers to offset the power expenses of the electricdriven compression on the dfw midstream system we also sell condensate retained from our gathering services at grand river revenues from the retainage of natural gas and condensate are recognized in natural gas ngls and condensate sales the associated expense is included in operation and maintenance expense certain customers reimburse us for costs we incur on their behalf we record costs incurred and reimbursed by our customers on a gross basis with the revenue component recognized in other revenues we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an exchange arrangement exists ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered iii the price is fixed or determinable and iv collectability is reasonably assured we provide gathering andor processing services principally under contracts that contain one or more of the following arrangements • feebased arrangements under feebased arrangements we receive a fee or fees for one or more of the following services i natural gas gathering treating andor processing and ii crude oil andor produced water gathering • percentofproceeds arrangements under percentofproceeds arrangements we generally purchase natural gas from producers at the wellhead or other receipt points gather the wellhead natural gas through our gathering system treat the natural gas process the natural gas andor sell the natural gas to a third party for processing we then remit to our producers an agreedupon percentage of the actual proceeds received from sales of the residue natural gas and ngls certain of these arrangements may also result in returning all or a portion of the residue natural gas andor the ngls to the producer in lieu of returning sales proceeds the margins earned are directly related to the volume of natural gas that flows through the system and the price at which we are able to sell the residue natural gas and ngls certain of our gathering and processing agreements provide for a monthly quarterly or annual mvc under these mvcs our customers agree to ship andor process a minimum volume of production on our gathering systems or to pay a minimum monetary amount over certain periods during the term of the mvc a customer must make a shortfall payment to us at the end of the contracted measurement period if its actual throughput volumes are less than its mvc for that period certain customers are entitled to utilize shortfall payments to offset gathering fees in one or more subsequent contracted measurement periods to the extent that such customers throughput volumes in a subsequent contracted measurement period exceed its mvc for that contracted measurement period we recognize customer billings for obligations under their mvcs as revenue when the obligations are billable under the contract and the customer does not have the right to utilize shortfall payments to offset gathering or processing fees in excess of its mvcs in subsequent periods we record customer billings for obligations under their mvcs as deferred revenue when the customer has the right to utilize shortfall payments to offset gathering or processing fees in subsequent periods we recognize deferred revenue under these arrangements in revenue once all contingencies or potential performance obligations associated with the related volumes have either i been satisfied through the gathering or processing of future excess volume throughput or ii expired or lapsed through the passage of time pursuant to the terms of the applicable gathering or processing agreement we also recognize deferred revenue in revenues when it is determined that a given amount of mvc shortfall payments cannot be recovered by offsetting gathering or processing fees in subsequent contracted measurement periods in making this determination we consider both quantitative and qualitative facts and circumstances including but not limited to contract terms capacity of the associated pipeline or receipt point andor expectations regarding future investment drilling and production we classify deferred revenue as a current liability for arrangements where the expiration of a customers right to utilize shortfall payments is  months or less we classify deferred revenue as noncurrent for arrangements where  table of contents the expiration of the right to utilize shortfall payments and our estimate of its potential utilization is more than  months unitbased compensation for awards of unitbased compensation we determine a grant date fair value and recognize the related compensation expense in the statements of operations over the vesting period of the respective awards income taxes as a partnership we are generally not subject to federal and state income taxes except as noted below however our unitholders are individually responsible for paying federal and state income taxes on their share of our taxable income net income or loss for gaap purposes may differ significantly from taxable income reportable to our unitholders as a result of differences between the tax basis and the gaap basis of assets and liabilities and the taxable income allocation requirements under our partnership agreement in general legal entities that are chartered organized or conducting business in the state of texas are subject to a franchise tax the texas margin tax the texas margin tax has the characteristics of an income tax because it is determined by applying a tax rate to a tax base that considers both revenues and expenses  our financial statements reflect provisions for these tax obligations earnings or loss per unit we determine basic epu by dividing the net income or loss that is attributed in accordance with the net income and loss allocation provisions of our partnership agreement to limited partners under the twoclass method after deducting i  the    noncontrolling interest in opco for periods subsequent to the  drop down ii any net income or loss of contributed subsidiaries that is attributable to summit investments iii the general partners approximate  interest in net income or loss and iv any payment of idrs by the weightedaverage number of limited partner units outstanding diluted epu reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other agreements to issue common units such as unitbased compensation were exercised settled or converted into common units and included in the weightedaverage number of units outstanding when it is determined that potential common units resulting from an award subject to performance or market conditions should be included in the diluted epu calculation the impact is reflected by applying the treasury stock method comprehensive income or loss comprehensive income or loss is the same as net income or loss for all periods presented environmental matters we are subject to various federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment liabilities for loss contingencies including environmental remediation costs arising from claims assessments litigation fines and penalties and other sources are charged to expense when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment andor remediation can be reasonably estimated we accrue for losses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such losses are probable and reasonably estimable such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties or insurers are recorded as assets when their realization is assured beyond a reasonable doubt carveout entities assets liabilities and expenses  for drop down transactions involving entities that were carved out of other entities the majority of the assets and liabilities allocated to the carveout entity are specifically identified based on the original entitys existing divisional organization goodwill is allocated to the carveout entity based on initial purchase accounting estimates revenues and depreciation and amortization are specifically identified based on the relationship of the carveout entity to the original entitys existing divisional structure operation and maintenance and general and administrative expenses are allocated to the carveout entity based on volume throughput for drop down transactions involving assets liabilities and expenses that were carved out of other entities the majority of the assets and liabilities allocated to the carveout are specifically identified based on the original entitys existing divisional organization depreciation and amortization are specifically identified based on the relationship of the carveout entity to the original entitys existing divisional structure general and administrative expenses are allocated to the carveout entity based on an allocation of summit investments consolidated expenses allocation of certain liabilities in drop downs  for drop down transactions involving assets for which their development was funded with debt incurred by summit investments or a subsidiary thereof which was allocated to but not ultimately assumed by the partnership and later replaced with bank borrowings or debt capital at the partnership we allocate a portion of that debt net of debt issuance costs to the drop down assets during the common control period interest expense is allocated and recognized during the common control period any outstanding debt balance or principal is included in the calculation of the excess or deficit of acquired carrying value relative to consideration paid and recognized  table of contents recent accounting pronouncements accounting standard setters frequently issue new or revised accounting rules we review new pronouncements to determine the impact if any on our financial statements accounting standards that have or could possibly have a material effect on our financial statements are discussed below recently adopted accounting pronouncements  we have recently adopted the following accounting pronouncements • asu no  interest—imputation of interest subtopic  simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs asu  under asu  entities that have historically presented debt issuance costs as an asset related to a recognized debt liability will be required to present those costs as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability in august  the fasb amended asu  to address the presentation and subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs related to line of credit “loc” arrangements the amendment permits an entity to defer and present debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortize debt issuance costs ratably over the term of a loc arrangement regardless of whether there are outstanding borrowings under that loc arrangement  this new standard became effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december   the january  adoption of this update resulted in a reclassification from other noncurrent assets to longterm debt of the debt issuance costs associated with our senior notes see note  debt issuance costs associated with the revolving credit facility will remain in other noncurrent assets this standard had no impact on interest expense net income or loss epu or partners capital • asu no  statement of cash flows topic  classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments a consensus of the emerging issues task force asu  asu  addresses how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statements of cash flows the applicable provisions relate to distributions received from equity method investees asu  prescribes a method for differentiating between returns of investment which should be classified as inflows from investing activities and returns on investment which should be classified as inflows from operating activities with respect to distributions from equity method investees entities make this determination by applying a cumulativeearnings approach or a nature of the distribution approach the asu formalizes each of these methods and allows an entity to choose either one as an accounting policy election asu  is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after december   early adoption is permitted the amendments in asu  are to be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented we have adopted the provisions of asu  as of december   and have elected the nature of the distribution approach the adoption of this standard had no impact on our financial statements accounting pronouncements pending adoption  we are currently in the process of evaluating the applicability andor impact of the following accounting pronouncements • asu no  revenue from contracts with customers topic  asu  under asu  revenue will be recognized under a fivestep model i identify the contract with the customer ii identify the performance obligations in the contract iii determine the transaction price iv allocate the transaction price to performance obligations and v recognize revenue when or as the performance obligation is satisfied asu  is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december   and allows for early adoption  we expect to adopt the provisions of asu  effective january   using the modified retrospective method we have substantially completed our review of our existing contracts under the new guidance however we are still assessing the financial statement impact of adoption for certain items discussed below for contracts where we perform gathering services and earn a perunit fee which is recognized at a point in time revenue will be recognized over time as the service is performed which is expected to accelerate the recognition of revenue by an immaterial amount in addition our contracts generally contain forms of what will be considered variable consideration which will likely be constrained as the volumes are susceptible to factors outside of our control and influence however we will be billing amounts that correspond directly to the value transferred such that the resulting revenue recognized will be similar to current gaap due to certain open technical issues such as contributions in aid of construction and noncash consideration as well as completion of our evaluations of mvcs we cannot currently fully conclude on the impact of adoption we anticipate that we will be able to complete our assessment of the impact of adoption by the end of the third quarter of  • asu no  leases topic  asu  asu  requires that lessees recognize all leases on the balance sheet with the exception of shortterm leases a lease liability will be recorded for  table of contents the obligation of a lessee to make lease payments arising from a lease a rightofuse asset will be recorded which represents the lessee’s right to use or to control the use of a specified asset for a lease term we are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on lessor accounting but have made no determinations at this time asu  is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after december   and requires the modified retrospective approach for transition we are currently evaluating the provisions of asu  to determine its impact on our financial statements and related disclosures and expect to adopt its provisions effective january   • asu no  revenue from contracts with customers topic  principal versus agent considerations reporting revenue gross versus net asu  asu  does not change the core principle of topic  rather it clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations  we expect to adopt the provisions of asu  effective january   our position regarding the impact of and transition method for this update is the same as for asu  • asu no  compensation—stock compensation topic  improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting asu  asu  simplifies several aspects for sharebased payment award transactions including income tax consequences the liability or equity classification of awards and classification on the statements of cash flows asu  is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after december   it does not specify a single transition approach rather it specifies retrospective modified retrospective andor prospective transition approaches based on the aspect being applied as a partnership that is generally not subject to taxes the primary impact of adopting asu  will be to change our classification of certain sharebased payment awards activity in the statements of cash flows • asu no  revenue from contracts with customers topic  identifying performance obligations and licensing asu  asu  clarifies the following two aspects of topic  i identifying performance obligations and ii the licensing implementation guidance while retaining the related principles for those areas we expect to adopt the provisions of asu  effective january   our position regarding the impact of and transition method for this update is the same as for asu  • asu no  revenue from contracts with customers topic  narrowscope improvements and practical expedients asu  asu  does not change the core principle of the guidance in topic  rather the amendments therein affect only the narrow aspects of topic  including assessing the collectability criterion and issues related to contract modification at transition and completed contracts at transition  we expect to adopt the provisions of asu  effective january   our position regarding the impact of and transition method for this update is the same as for asu  •  segment information as of december   our reportable segments are • the utica shale which includes our ownership

that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value including goodwill we performed our annual goodwill impairment testing for the mountaineer midstream reporting unit as of september   using a combination of the income and market approaches we determined that its fair value substantially exceeded its carrying value including goodwill as such there were  no  impairments of goodwill during   annual impairment evaluation  in september  we performed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of september  using a combination of the income and market approaches we determined that the fair value of the grand river mountaineer midstream and polar and divide reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value including goodwill we also determined that the fair value of the bison midstream reporting unit exceeded its carrying value however it did not exceed its carrying value including goodwill by a substantial amount because the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value including goodwill there were no associated impairments of goodwill in connection with our  annual goodwill impairment test fourth quarter  goodwill impairment  during the latter part of the fourth quarter of  the declines in prices for natural gas ngls and crude oil accelerated negatively impacting producers in each of our areas of operation as a result we considered whether the goodwill associated with our grand river mountaineer midstream polar and divide and bison midstream reporting units could have been impaired our assessments related to grand river and mountaineer midstream did not result in an indication that the associated goodwill had been impaired our assessment related to the polar and divide and bison midstream reporting units did result in an indication that the associated goodwill could have been impaired we noted that both reporting units were impacted by the recent price declines we also noted that a key bison midstream customer announced that it was delaying its previously announced drilling plans which caused smlp to reduce its forecasted volume assumption the impact of these events increased the likelihood that the goodwill associated with the polar and divide and bison midstream reporting units could have been impaired as such we concluded that a triggering event occurred during the fourth quarter of  requiring that we test the goodwill associated with these reporting units for impairment in connection therewith we reperformed our step one analyses for each as of december   to estimate the fair value of the reporting units we utilized two valuation methodologies the market approach and the income approach the results of our step one goodwill impairment testing indicated that the fair value of the polar and divide reporting unit exceeded its carrying value including goodwill as of december   as a result there was no associated impairment of goodwill in connection with the fourth quarter  triggering event  table of contents the results of our step one goodwill impairment testing indicated that the fair value of the bison midstream reporting unit was below its carrying value including goodwill as of december   as a result we performed step two of the goodwill impairment test to perform step two we first determined the fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the fair value of each reporting units individual assets and liabilities included the determination of discount rate and contributory asset charge utilized in our calculation of the fair value of our contract intangibles expected levels of throughput volume and associated capital expenditures and commodity prices in the first quarter of  we finalized our calculations of the fair values of the identified assets and liabilities in step two of the december   goodwill impairment testing for the bison midstream reporting unit this process confirmed the preliminary goodwill impairment of  million that was recognized as of december    annual impairment evaluation  we performed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of september   using a combination of the income and market approaches we determined that the fair value of the grand river mountaineer midstream and polar and divide reporting units exceeded their carrying value including goodwill because the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value including goodwill there were no associated impairments of goodwill in connection with our  annual goodwill impairment test fourth quarter  goodwill impairments  during the latter part of the fourth quarter of  and the early part of the first quarter of  the declines in forward prices for natural gas ngls and crude oil accelerated significantly as a result the energy sectors public debt and equity market experienced increased volatility particularly for comparable companies operating in the midstream services sector additionally during this period the values of our publicly traded equity and debt instruments decreased as did those of comparable midstream companies due to i the increased market volatility ii the decrease in market values of comparable companies iii the continued trend of falling commodity prices and iv the finalization of our annual financial and operating plans which took into account changes resulting from expected levels of drilling activity we concluded that a triggering event occurred during the fourth quarter of  requiring that we test the goodwill associated with our grand river and polar and divide reporting units our assessment related to mountaineer midstream did not result in an indication that a triggering event had occurred for mountaineer midstream in connection therewith we updated our step one analyses as of december   these updated analyses indicated that the carrying values for grand river and polar and divide exceeded their estimated fair values as a result we then performed step two of the goodwill impairment test for both reporting units to perform step two we first determined the estimated fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the fair value of each reporting units individual assets and liabilities included the determination of discount rate taking into consideration companyspecific risks and contributory asset charge utilized in our contract intangibles expected levels of throughput volume and associated capital expenditures in the first quarter of  we finalized our calculations of the fair values of the identified assets and liabilities in step two of the december   goodwill impairment testing for the grand river and polar and divide reporting units this process confirmed the preliminary goodwill impairments of  million for grand river and  million for polar and divide that were recognized as of december   fair value measurement our impairment determinations in the context of i our annual impairment evaluations and ii our otherthanannual impairment evaluations involved significant assumptions and judgments as discussed above differing assumptions regarding any of these inputs could have a significant effect on the various valuations as such the fair value measurements utilized within these models are classified as nonrecurring level  measurements in the fair value hierarchy because they are not observable from objective sources due to the volatility of the inputs used we cannot predict the likelihood of any future impairment  equity method investments ohio gathering owns operates and is currently developing midstream infrastructure consisting of a

exercised the option to increase its ownership to  the option exercise and made the following payments i  million of capital contribution trueups ii  million of additional capital contributions to maintain its  ownership interest and iii  million of management fee payments that were recognized as capital contributions in its ohio gathering capital accounts concurrent with and subsequent to the option exercise the nonaffiliated owners have retained their respective  ownership interest in ohio gathering the nonaffiliated owners summit investments accounted for its initial ownership interests in ohio gathering under the cost method due to its ownership percentage and because it determined that it was not the primary beneficiary subsequent to the option exercise summit investments accounted for its ownership interests in ohio gathering as equity method investments because it had joint control with the nonaffiliated owners which gave it significant influence this shift from the cost method to the equity method required that summit investments retrospectively reflect its investment in ohio gathering and the associated results of operations as if it had been utilizing the equity method since the inception of its investment summit investments recognized the  million that it paid to blackhawk as an investment in ohio gathering at inception in addition ohio gathering had assigned a value of  million to the option recognized it initially as an asset and concurrently attributed the value of the option to blackhawks capital account upon acquiring blackhawks interest the option was reclassified from blackhawks capital account to summit investments capital account in ohio gatherings records neither of these transactions involved a flow of funds to or from ohio gathering as such they created a basis difference between its recorded investment in equity method investees and that recognized and attributed to summit investments by ohio gathering in accordance with the retrospective recognition triggered by the option exercise in february  summit investments began amortizing these basis differences over the weightedaverage remaining life of the contracts underlying ohio gatherings operations the impact of amortizing these two basis differences resulted in a net decrease to summit investments investment in equity method investees subsequent to the option exercise summit investments continued to make capital contributions to ohio gathering along with receiving distributions such that it maintained its  ownership interest through the  drop down subsequent to the  drop down smlp began making contributions and receiving distributions and will also continue amortizing the two basis differences as noted above in june  an impairment loss was

a monthly quarterly or annual mvc from our customers the amount of the shortfall payment is based on the difference between the actual throughput volume shipped or processed for the applicable period and the mvc for the applicable period multiplied by the applicable gathering or processing fee many of our gas gathering agreements contain provisions that can reduce or delay the cash flows that we expect to receive from our mvcs to the extent that a customers actual throughput volumes are above or below its mvc for the applicable contracted measurement period these provisions include the following • to the extent that a customers throughput volumes are less than its mvc for the applicable period and the customer makes a shortfall payment it may be entitled to an offset in one or more subsequent periods to the extent that its throughput volumes in subsequent periods exceed its mvc for those periods in such a situation we would not receive gathering fees on throughput in excess of that customers mvc depending on the terms of the specific gas gathering agreement to the extent that the customer had made a shortfall payment with respect to one or more preceding measurement periods as applicable • to the extent that a customers throughput volumes exceed its mvc in the applicable contracted measurement period it may be entitled to apply the excess throughput against its aggregate mvc thereby reducing the period for which its annual mvc applies as a result of this mechanism the weightedaverage remaining period for which our mvcs apply will be less than the weightedaverage of the original stated contract terms of our mvcs • to the extent that certain of our customers throughput volumes exceed its mvc for the applicable period there is a crediting mechanism that allows the customer to build a bank of credits that it can utilize in the future to reduce shortfall payments owed in subsequent periods subject to expiration if there is no shortfall in subsequent periods the

the entity are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the entity and  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the entitys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting

section a beneficial ownership reporting compliance section a of the exchange act requires smlps directors and executive officers and persons who own more than  of a registered class of our securities to file with the sec initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of smlps common units and other equity securities based on our records we believe that all directors executive officers and persons who own more than  of our common units have complied with the reporting requirements of section a item  executive compensation this compensation discussion and analysis “cda” provides information regarding the compensation of our named executive officers “neos” as reported in the summary compensation table and other tables in this document in this cda we review the compensation decisions and rationale for those decisions relating to our principal executive officer principal financial officer our next three most highly compensated executive officers the following describes the material components of our executive compensation program for the following individuals who are referred to as the named executive officers or “neos” • steven j newby president and chief executive officer • matthew s harrison executive vice president and chief financial officer • brock m degeyter executive vice president general counsel chief compliance officer and secretary • brad n graves executive vice president and chief commercial officer • leonard w mallett executive vice president and chief operations officer the neos are employees of summit investments and executive officers of our general partner  certain of the neos split their working time between smlps business and their responsibilities for summit investments and its affiliates other than us  under the terms of our partnership agreement our general partner determines the portion of the neos compensation that is allocated to us the compensation committee provides oversight administers and makes decisions regarding our compensation policies and plans compensation philosophy and objectives we seek to provide reasonable and competitive rewards to executives through compensation and benefit programs structured to • attract and retain outstanding talent • drive achievement of shortterm and longterm goals • reward successful execution of objectives • reinforce company culture and leadership competencies • align executives with the interests of our unitholders  table of contents we employ a payforperformance philosophy when designing executive compensation opportunities thus a portion of an executive’s target compensation should be performance based through linkage to the achievement of financial and other measures deemed to be drivers in the creation of unitholder value while the compensation committee does not set a specific target allocation among the elements of total direct compensation a portion of the compensation opportunity available to each of our neos is by design tied to the partnership’s annual and longterm performance compensation of named executive officers the compensation committee establishes the target total direct compensation of our executives and administers other benefit programs the compensation committee engaged bdo usa llp as its independent compensation consultant the compensation consultant provides the compensation committee with data analysis and advice on the structure and level of executive compensation the compensation consultant participates in compensation committee meetings and executive sessions of the compensation committee meetings as requested the compensation consultant may work with our management on various matters for which the compensation committee is responsible however the compensation committee not management directs the activities of the compensation consultant we consider the compensation consultant to be independent of the partnership according to current nyse listing requirements and sec guidance partnership management in consultation with the compensation committee chair and the compensation consultant prepares materials for the compensation committee relevant to matters under consideration by the compensation committee including market data provided by the compensation consultant and recommendations of our chief executive officer the ceo regarding compensation of the other executives the compensation committee works directly with the compensation consultant on our ceo’s compensation as required based on market data which we use as a reference we believe compensation of our neos is reasonably competitive with opportunities available to officers holding similar positions at other comparable midstream companies we seek to set compensation levels for each component of total direct compensation based on our assessment of market practices at or near the median the compensation committee adjusts target compensation for each neo above or below the median taking into consideration experience performance internal equity and other relevant circumstances during the compensation committee’s annual review of executive compensation the compensation consultant provided the compensation committee with an analysis of positions comparable to the neos at peer companies to develop these exhibits information from peer company public filings was compiled including public company proxy statements and annual reports on form k the peer group used for  executive compensation consisted of  publicly traded midstream partnerships and limited liability companies with whom we compete for executive talent the peer group comprised the following companies american midstream partners lp   midcoast energy partners lp boardwalk pipeline partners lp   nustar energy lp crestwood equity partners lp   semgroup corporation dcp midstream lp   southcross energy partners lp enable midstream partners lp   tallgrass energy partners lp enlink midstream partners lp   targa resources corp genesis energy lp     the compensation analysis encompassed the primary components of total direct compensation including annual base salary annual shortterm incentive and longterm incentive awards for the neos of these peer group companies the compensation committee considered the information provided to ascertain whether the compensation of our neos is aligned with our compensation philosophy and competitive with the compensation for executive officers of the peer group companies the compensation committee reviewed the compensation analysis to confirm that our compensation programs were supporting a competitive total compensation approach that emphasizes incentivebased compensation and appropriately rewards achievement of our objectives for  the target total direct

organization and business   effective may   markwest utica emg llc markwest utica entered into the limited liability company agreement the original llc agreement with blackhawk midstream llc blackhawk in order to form ohio gathering company llc the company or ohio gathering the company provides natural gas gathering and compression services in the utica shale region of ohio under the terms of the original llc agreement markwest utica and blackhawk each made initial nominal contributions to the company in exchange for a  and  ownership interest respectively all operational and administrative services are provided through contractual arrangements with affiliates of markwest utica operating company llc markwest utica operating see note  for more information regarding affiliate transactions   after the initial contributions markwest utica was obligated to contribute all of the capital required by the company for the development construction and operation of certain natural gas gathering and compression assets pursued by the company markwest uticas and blackhawks membership interests were adjusted to equal their respective share of the capital contributed therefore as of december   markwest utica owned more than a  interest and blackhawk owned less than a  interest blackhawk also had an option to acquire a  equity interest in ohio gathering the ohio gathering option see note  deferred contract costs  for further discussion   in january  blackhawk sold its interest and the ohio gathering option to summit midstream partners llc summit effective june   summit investment date summit exercised the ohio gathering option and increased its equity ownership summit equity ownership from less than  to approximately  through a net cash investment of         million   in august  markwest utica and summit entered into the third amended and restated limited liability company agreement of ohio gathering company llc the third amended llc agreement which replaced the second amended and restated limited liability company agreement of ohio gathering company llc in accordance with the third amended llc agreement summit has the right but not the obligation to make additional capital contributions subject to certain limitations if summit elects to contribute capital in response to a particular capital call then the aggregate amount of capital that markwest utica is required to contribute pursuant to such capital call will be decreased dollar for dollar by the amount of capital summit elects to contribute if a member fails to contribute any capital to the company that is committed to be contributed or fails to timely wire the trueup amount as defined in the third amended llc agreement such member will be considered in default but will remain fully obligated to contribute such capital to the company the company will be entitled to pursue all remedies available at law or in equity against the defaulting member effective march   summit contributed substantially all of its limited partner interest in the company to summit midstream partners lp smlp summit and smlp are under common control and this contribution did not change their overall ownership in the company therefore activity is presented combined on the accompanying statement of changes in members equity through december   smlp has elected to contribute  of all capital calls and in total markwest utica has contributed  billion and smlp has contributed  million to the company   the business and affairs of the company are overseen by a board of managers which currently consists of three managers designated by markwest utica and two managers designated by smlp the composition of the board of managers could change in accordance with changes in investment balances the board of managers has delegated to markwest utica operating the authority to manage the daytoday operations of the company subject to certain approval rights retained by the board pursuant to a services agreement between the company and markwest utica operating an affiliate of markwest utica operating will provide all employees and services necessary for the daily operations and management of the companys business the company is required to distribute all available cash to the members within  days of the end of each calendar month    significant accounting policies   basis of presentation   the accompanying financial statements of the company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap   use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods estimates affect among other items valuing inventory evaluating impairments of longlived assets establishing estimated useful lives for longlived assets      estimating revenues expense accruals and capital expenditures valuing asset retirement obligations establishing inputs when determining fair value of options evaluating forecasts when determining income tax valuation allowances and determining liabilities if any for environmental and legal contingencies actual results could differ from those estimates   cash and cash equivalents   cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand secured deposits and investments in highly liquid debt instruments with initial maturities of three months or less the company had no cash equivalents at december     trade receivables   trade receivables primarily consist of customer accounts receivable which are recorded at the invoiced amount and  generally do not bear interest pastdue balances over  days and other higher risk amounts are reviewed individually for collectability balances that remain outstanding after reasonable collection efforts have been unsuccessful are written off through a charge to the valuation allowance and a credit to accounts receivable management reviews the allowance quarterly the company did not record a valuation allowance at december     inventories   inventories consist primarily of materials and supplies to be used in operations and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value cost for materials and supplies is determined primarily using the weightedaverage cost method   property and equipment   property and equipment consists primarily of natural gas gathering assets other pipeline assets compressors and related facilities that are recorded at cost expenditures that extend the useful lives of assets are capitalized repairs maintenance and renewals that do not extend the useful lives of assets are expensed as incurred depreciation is provided principally on a straightline method over a period of  to  years with the exception of miscellaneous equipment and vehicles which are depreciated over a period ranging from  to  years   when items of property and equipment are sold or otherwise disposed of any gains or losses are reported in the statement of operations gains on the disposal of property and equipment are recognized when they occur which is generally at the time of closing if a loss on disposal is expected such losses are recognized when the assets are classified as held for sale   asset retirement obligations   an asset retirement obligation aro is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible longlived assets that generally result from the acquisition construction development or normal operation of the asset aros are recorded at fair value in the period in which they are incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made and added to the carrying amount of the associated asset this additional carrying amount is then depreciated over the life of the asset the liability is determined using a credit adjusted riskfree interest rate and increases due to the passage of time based on the time value of money until the obligation is settled the company routinely reviews and reassesses its estimates to determine if adjustments to the value of aros are required the company recognizes a liability of a conditional aro as soon as the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated a conditional aro is defined as an unconditional legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing andor method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity aros have not been recognized for certain assets because the fair value cannot be reasonably estimated since the settlement dates of the obligations are indeterminate such obligations will be recognized in the period when sufficient information becomes available to estimate a range of potential settlement dates in addition to the conditional aros the company may have aros related to certain gathering and compression assets as a result of environmental and other legal requirements the company is not required to perform such work until it permanently ceases operations of the respective assets as the company considers the operational life of these assets to be indeterminable an associated aro cannot be calculated and is not recorded   impairment of longlived assets   the companys policy is to evaluate whether there has been an impairment in the value of longlived assets when certain events indicate that the remaining balance may not be recoverable qualitative and quantitative information is reviewed in order to determine if a triggering event has occurred or if an impairment indicator exists if we determine that a triggering event has occurred we would complete a full impairment analysis if we determine that the carrying value is not recoverable a loss is recorded for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the related asset group management considers the volume of producer customers reserves and future natural gas and natural gas liquids product prices to estimate cash flows the amount of additional producer customer reserves developed by future drilling activity depends in part on expected commodity prices projections of producer customers reserves drilling activity and future commodity prices are inherently subjective and contingent upon a number of variable factors many of which are difficult to forecast any significant variance in any of these assumptions or factors could materially affect future cash flows which could result in the impairment of an asset the company did not record an impairment for the year ended december        for assets identified to be disposed of in the future the carrying value of these assets is compared to the estimated fair value less the cost to sell to determine if impairment is required until the assets are disposed of an estimate of the fair value is redetermined for each reporting period when related events or circumstances change   deferred contract costs   deferred contract costs represent the asset created by the fair value of the ohio gathering option that was recorded as permanent equity this cost is amortized over the term of the arrangement into facility expenses on the accompanying statement of operations as of december   the amortization of deferred contract costs is  for each of the next five years and  thereafter   revenue recognition   the company generates its revenue by providing natural gas gathering and compression services the company receives a fee for the gathering and compression of natural gas the revenue the company earns under these arrangements is related to the volume of natural gas that flows through its facilities and is not directly dependent on commodity prices the companys assessment of each of the revenue recognition criteria as they relate to its revenue producing activities are as follows persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured it is upon completion of services provided that the company meets all four criteria and it is at such time that the company recognizes revenue amounts billed in advance of the period in which the revenue recognition criteria are met are recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying balance sheet   revenue and expense accruals   the company routinely makes accruals based on estimates for both revenues and expenses due to the timing of compiling billing information receiving certain thirdparty information and reconciling the companys records with those of third parties the delayed information from third parties includes among other things actual volumes transported and other operating expenses the company makes accruals to reflect estimates for these items based on its internal records and information from third parties estimated accruals are adjusted when actual information is received from third parties and the companys internal records have been reconciled   income taxes   the company is treated as a partnership for tax purposes under the provisions of the internal revenue code accordingly the accompanying financial statements do not reflect a provision for federal income taxes since the companys results of operations and related credits and deductions will be passed through and taken into account by its members in computing their respective tax liabilities the company is however subject to an income tax at the cadiz ohio jurisdictional level   the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and net operating loss carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect of any tax rate change on deferred taxes is recognized as tax expense benefit from continuing operations in the period that includes the enactment date of the tax rate change realizability of deferred tax assets is assessed and if not more likely than not a valuation allowance is recorded to reflect the deferred tax assets at net realizable value as determined by management all deferred tax balances are classified as longterm in the accompanying balance sheet   environmental costs   environmental expenditures are capitalized if the costs mitigate or prevent future contamination or if the costs improve environmental safety or efficiency of the existing assets the company recognizes remediation costs and penalties when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs can be reasonably estimated the timing of remediation accruals coincides with completion of a feasibility study or the commitment to a formal plan of action remediation liabilities are accrued based on estimates of known environmental exposure   fair value of financial instruments   management believes the carrying amounts of financial instruments including trade receivables affiliate receivables and payables accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of the shortterm maturity of these instruments   accounting standards   recently adopted   in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an accounting standard update requiring management to assess an entitys ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances management is required to assess if there is substantial doubt about an entitys ability to continue as a going concern      within one year after the issuance of the financial statements disclosures are required if conditions give rise to substantial doubt and the type of disclosure is determined based on whether managements plans will be able to alleviate the substantial doubt the change was effective for the first fiscal period ending after december   the adoption of this accounting standard update in  did not have a material impact on the companys disclosures   not yet adopted   in february  the fasb issued an accounting standard update requiring lessees to record virtually all leases on their balance sheets the accounting standard update also requires expanded disclosures to help financial statement users better understand the amount timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases for lessors this amended guidance modifies the classification criteria and the accounting for salestype and direct financing leases the change will be effective on a modified retrospective basis for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted the company is currently evaluating the impact of this on our financial statements and disclosures and accounting policies this evaluation process includes reviewing all forms of leases performing a completeness assessment over the lease population and analyzing the practical expedients in order to determine the best path to implementation the company plans to adopt the standard for the fiscal year ended december     in may  the fasb issued an initial accounting standard update for revenue recognition for contracts with customers the guidance in the accounting standard update states that revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of a good or service recognition of the revenue will involve a multiple step approach including identifying the contract identifying the separate performance obligations determining the transaction price allocating the price to the performance obligations and then recognizing the revenue as the obligations are satisfied additional disclosures will be required to provide adequate information to understand the nature amount timing and uncertainty of reported revenues and revenues expected to be recognized the change will be effective on a retrospective or modified retrospective basis for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those years the company plans to adopt the standard for fiscal year ended december     the company is currently evaluating the impact of the revenue recognition standard on our financial statements and disclosures and accounting policies this evaluation process includes a phased approach the first phase of which includes reviewing a sample of our contracts and transaction types the company is currently in the process of completing this first phase and evaluating the methods of adoption   based on the results of the first phase assessment to date the company has reached tentative conclusions for our primary contract type and does not believe revenue recognition patterns for feebased contracts will change materially the company is currently working to understand the accounting impact on fuel retainage and system loss under the new standard specifically related to the accounting for noncash consideration received in the form of a commodity product as a result of implementation the company does expect certain amounts to be grossed up in revenue related to thirdparty reimbursements and changes in accounting for fuel and deemed system loss the company continues to work through implementation efforts    affiliate transactions   the company has no employees operating maintenance and general and administrative services including insurance are provided to the company under a service agreement with markwest utica operating in addition the company has an office lease agreement with

receivables of  million related to these transactions and the service agreement during  the company capitalized  million related to engineering and construction management services provided under the affiliate service agreement in property and equipment net on the accompanying balance sheet    significant customers and concentration of credit risk   financial instruments that potentially expose the company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables which are generally unsecured at december   three customers each of who accounted for more than  of the companys trade receivables accounted for  of total trade receivables in aggregate   in  one producer customer accounted for  of the companys revenue and a second producer customer accounted for  of the companys revenue   the company maintains cash deposits with a major bank which from timetotime may exceed federally insured limits    property and equipment   property and equipment with associated accumulated depreciation is shown below       december             gas gathering and compression equipment       pipeline right of way      land      construction in progress      property and equipment       less accumulated depreciation      property and equipment net         in conjunction with the acquisition of markwest uticas parent by mplx lp in december  the company changed its estimate of the useful lives of certain gas gathering and compression plant assets the gas gathering plants asset depreciation lives that were previously  years were increased to  years the company made these changes to better reflect the estimated periods during which such assets will remain in service this change had the effect of reducing  depreciation expense increasing income from operations and increasing net income by approximately  million   depreciation expense of  million is included in depreciation and accretion on the statement of operations for the year ended december      asset retirement obligations   the companys assets subject to aros are primarily gasgathering pipelines and compression equipment the company also has land leases that require the company to return the land to its original condition upon termination of the lease the company reviews current laws and regulations governing obligations associated with asset retirements and leases   the following is a reconciliation of the changes in the aro liability for the year ended       december     beginning asset retirement obligations       liabilities incurred      accretion expense

is required in evaluating the companys tax positions during the ordinary course of business there may be transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain however the company did not have any material uncertain tax positions for the year ended december   the state nol carryforwards begin to expire in  the company does not anticipate utilizing the entire nol and has provided a valuation allowance against this deferred tax asset   activity in the companys allowance for deferred tax asset valuation allowance is as follows       december     deferred tax asset valuation allowance       balance at beginning of period       charged to costs and expenses      balance at end of period          commitments and contingencies   environmental matters   the company is subject to federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment these laws generally provide for control of pollutants released into the environment and require responsible parties to undertake remediation of hazardous waste disposal sites penalties may be imposed for noncompliance   in  representatives from the united states environmental protection agency epa and the united states department of justice conducted a raid on a pipeline launcherreceiver site owned by an affiliate of markwest utica which site was utilized for pipeline maintenance operations that markwest utica affiliate continues to discuss with the epa and other jurisdictions alleged omissions associated with permits or related regulatory obligations for its launcherreceiver and compressor station facilities it is possible that in connection with any potential or asserted enforcement action associated with this matter that the markwest utica affiliate will incur material assessments penalties or fines incur material defense costs and expenses be required to modify operations or construction activities which could increase operating costs and capital expenditures or be subject to other obligations or restrictions that could restrict or prohibit their activities any or all of which could adversely affect their results of operations financial position or cash flows due to the similar nature of operations the company is evaluating its potential exposure with respect to the foregoing in connection with these activities at december   accrued liabilities for potential penalties totaled  however the ultimate amount of any potential assessments penalties fines restrictions requirements modifications costs or expenses if any that may be incurred in connection with any potential enforcement action cannot be reasonably estimated or determined at this time   legal   the company is subject to a variety of risks and disputes and is a party to various legal proceedings in the normal course of its business the company maintains insurance policies with coverage and deductibles that it believes are reasonable and prudent however the company cannot assure that the insurance companies will promptly honor their policy obligations or that the coverage      or levels of insurance will be adequate to protect the company from all material expenses related to future claims for property loss or business interruption to the company or for thirdparty claims of personal injury and property damage or that the coverage or levels of insurance it currently has will be available in the future at economical prices while it is not possible to predict the outcome of the legal actions with certainty management is of the opinion that appropriate provisions and accruals for potential losses associated with all legal actions have been made in the financial statements and that none of these actions either individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition liquidity or results of operations   lease and other contractual obligations   the company has noncancellable operating lease agreements for the lease of

markwest see note  for more information regarding affiliate transactions   after the initial nominal contributions in  markwest utica condensate was obligated to contribute all of the capital required by the company markwest utica condensates and blackhawks membership interests were adjusted to equal their respective share of the capital contributed therefore as of december   markwest utica condensate owned more than a  interest and blackhawk owned less than a  interest blackhawk also had an option to acquire a  equity interest in ohio condensate the ohio condensate option see note  deferred contract costs  for further discussion in january  blackhawk sold its interest in the company and the ohio condensate option to summit midstream partners llc summit effective june   summit investment date summit exercised the ohio condensate option and increased its equity ownership from less than  to  through a net cash investment of approximately  million   in august  markwest utica condensate and summit entered into the second amended and restated limited liability company agreement of ohio condensate company llc the amended llc agreement which replaced the original llc agreement in accordance with the amended llc agreement markwest utica condensate is required to fund as needed all capital required by the company summit has the right but not the obligation to make additional capital contributions subject to certain limitations if summit elects to contribute capital in response to a particular capital call then the aggregate amount of capital that markwest utica condensate is required to contribute pursuant to such capital call will be decreased dollar for dollar by the amount of capital that summit elects to contribute if either member fails to contribute any capital to the company that is committed to be contributed such member will be considered in default but will remain fully obligated to contribute such capital to the company the company will be entitled to pursue all remedies available at law or in equity against the defaulting member   in december  markwest utica condensate became a whollyowned subsidiary of markwest liberty the purchase of the partners interest coincided with markwests merger with mplx lp a whollyowned subsidiary of marathon petroleum company marathon   effective march   summit contributed substantially all of its limited partner interest in the company to summit midstream partners lp smlp summit and smlp are under common control and this contribution did not change their overall ownership in the company therefore activity is presented combined on the accompanying statement of changes in members equity through december   smlp elected to contribute  of all capital calls and in total markwest utica condensate has contributed  million and smlp has contributed  million to the company   the business and affairs of the company are overseen by a board of managers currently consisting of three managers designated by markwest utica condensate and two managers designated by smlp the composition of the board of managers could change in accordance with changes in investment balances the board of managers has delegated to markwest utica condensate the authority to manage the daytoday operations of the company subject to certain approval rights retained by the board pursuant to a services agreement between the company and markwest utica condensate an affiliate of markwest utica condensate will provide all employees and services necessary for the daily operations and management of the companys business the company is required to distribute all available cash to the members as determined in accordance with the amended llc agreement within  days of the end of each calendar month    significant accounting policies   basis of presentation   the accompanying financial statements of the company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap      use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods estimates affect among other items evaluating impairments of longlived assets establishing estimated useful lives for longlived assets estimating expense accruals and capital expenditures establishing inputs when determining fair value of options evaluating forecasts when determining income tax valuation allowances and determining liabilities if any for environmental and legal contingencies actual results could differ from those estimates   cash and cash equivalents   cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand secured deposits and investments in highly liquid debt instruments with initial maturities of three months or less the company had no cash equivalents at december     trade receivables   trade receivables primarily consist of customer accounts receivable which are recorded at the invoiced amount and  generally do not bear interest pastdue balances over  days and other higher risk amounts are reviewed individually for collectability balances that remain outstanding after reasonable collection efforts have been unsuccessful are written off through a charge to the valuation allowance and a credit to accounts receivable management reviews the allowance quarterly the company did not record a valuation allowance at december     property plant and equipment   property plant and equipment consists primarily of condensate stabilization facilities other pipeline assets truck and railcar loading equipment and related facilities that are recorded at cost expenditures that extend the useful lives of assets are capitalized repairs maintenance and renewals that do not extend the useful lives of assets are expensed as incurred depreciation is provided on a straightline method over a period of  to  years with the exception of miscellaneous equipment and vehicles which are depreciated over a period of  to  years amortization of leasehold improvements is computed using the straightline method over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the improvements   when items of property and equipment are sold or otherwise disposed of any gains or losses are reported in the statement of operations gains on the disposal of property plant and equipment are recognized when they occur which is generally at the time of closing if a loss on disposal is expected such losses are recognized when the assets are classified as held for sale   assets held under capital leases are recorded at the lower of the net present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset depreciation expense is computed using the straightline method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the period of the related lease   impairment of longlived assets   the companys policy is to evaluate whether there has been an impairment in the value of longlived assets when certain events indicate that the remaining balance may not be recoverable qualitative and quantitative information is reviewed in order to determine if a triggering event has occurred or if an impairment indicator exists if we determine that a triggering event has occurred we would complete a full impairment analysis if we determine that the carrying value is not recoverable a loss is recorded for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the related asset group management considers the volume of producer customers reserves and future condensate and natural gas liquids product prices to estimate cash flows the amount of additional producer customers reserves developed by future drilling activity depends in part on expected commodity prices projections of producer customer reserves drilling activity and future commodity prices are inherently subjective and contingent upon a number of variable factors many of which are difficult to forecast any significant variance in any of these assumptions or factors could materially affect future cash flows which could result in the impairment of an asset   during  forecasts for the company were reduced to align with updated forecasts for customer requirements as a result the company completed a longlived asset impairment analysis in accordance with accounting standards codification asc topic  property plant and equipment  to determine the potential longlived asset impairment charge the fair value of the longlived assets was determined based upon applying the discounted cash flow method which is an income approach and the guideline public company method which is a market approach the discounted cash flow fair value estimate is based on known or knowable information at the interim measurement date the significant assumptions that were used to develop the estimate of the fair value under the discounted cash flow method include managements best estimates of the expected future results using a probability weighted average set of cash flow forecasts and a discount rate of  percent an increase to the discount rate of  basis points would have resulted in an additional charge of  million on the statement of operations fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors as such the fair value of the companys longlived assets represents a level  measurement as a result there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for      purposes of this impairment test will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future during  impairment charges of approximately  million were recorded   for assets identified to be disposed of in the future the carrying value of these assets is compared to the estimated fair value less the cost to sell to determine if impairment is required until the assets are disposed of an estimate of the fair value is redetermined for each reporting period when related events or circumstances change   deferred contract costs   deferred contract costs represent the asset created by the fair value of the ohio condensate option that was recorded as permanent equity this cost was amortized over the term of the arrangement into facility expenses on the statement of operations until june   when the remaining net balance of  was impaired as discussed in impairment of longlived assets above   revenue recognition   the company generates its revenue by providing condensate stabilization and terminalling services the company earns a fee under these arrangements related to the volume of condensate that flows through its facility and is not directly dependent on commodity prices the companys assessment of each of the revenue recognition criteria as they relate to its revenue producing activities are as follows persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured it is upon completion of services provided that the company meets all four criteria and it is at such time that the company recognizes revenue amounts billed in advance of the period in which the revenue recognition criteria are met are recorded as deferred revenue and other longterm liabilities in the accompanying balance sheet   expense accruals   the company routinely makes accruals based on estimates for expenses due to the timing of receiving certain thirdparty information and reconciling the companys records with those of third parties the delayed information from third parties includes among other things volumetric charges and other operating expenses the company makes accruals to reflect estimates for these items based on its internal records and information from third parties estimated accruals are adjusted when actual information is received from third parties and the companys internal records have been reconciled   income taxes   the company is treated as a partnership for tax purposes under the provisions of the internal revenue code accordingly the accompanying financial statements do not reflect a provision for federal income taxes since the companys results of operations and related credits and deductions will be passed through and taken into account by its members in computing their respective tax liabilities the company is however subject to an income tax at the cadiz ohio jurisdictional level   the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and net operating loss carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect of any tax rate change on deferred taxes is recognized as tax expense benefit from continuing operations in the period that includes the enactment date of the tax rate change realizability of deferred tax assets is assessed and if not more likely than not a valuation allowance is recorded to reflect the deferred tax assets at net realizable value as determined by management all deferred tax balances are classified as longterm in the accompanying balance sheet   environmental costs   environmental expenditures are capitalized if the costs mitigate or prevent future contamination or if the costs improve environmental safety or efficiency of the existing assets the company recognizes remediation costs and penalties when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs can be reasonably estimated the timing of remediation accruals coincides with completion of a feasibility study or the commitment to a formal plan of action remediation liabilities are accrued based on estimates of known environmental exposure as of december   the company has recorded  for environmental liabilities   fair value of financial instruments   management believes the carrying amounts of financial instruments including trade receivables other receivables affiliate receivables and payables accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of the shortterm maturity of these instruments      accounting standards   recently adopted   in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an accounting standard update requiring management to assess an entitys ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances management is required to assess if there is substantial doubt about an entitys ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the issuance of the financial statements disclosures are required if conditions give rise to substantial doubt and the type of disclosure is determined based on whether managements plans will be able to alleviate the substantial doubt the change was effective for the fiscal period ending after december   the company adopted this accounting standard update in  and has made the appropriate disclosures in note    not yet adopted   in february  the fasb issued an accounting standard update requiring lessees to record virtually all leases on their balance sheets the accounting standard update also requires expanded disclosures to help financial statement users better understand the amount timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases for lessors this amended guidance modifies the classification criteria and the accounting for salestype and direct financing leases the change will be effective on a modified retrospective basis for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted the company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our financial statements and disclosures capital lease obligations and accounting policies this evaluation process includes reviewing all forms of leases performing a completeness assessment over the lease population and analyzing the practical expedients in order to determine the best path to implementation the company plans to adopt the standard for the fiscal year ended december     in may  the fasb issued an initial accounting standard update for revenue recognition for contracts with customers the guidance in the accounting standard update states that revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of a good or service recognition of the revenue will involve a multiple step approach including identifying the contract identifying the separate performance obligations determining the transaction price allocating the price to the performance obligations and then recognizing the revenue as the obligations are satisfied additional disclosures will be required to provide adequate information to understand the nature amount timing and uncertainty of reported revenues and revenues expected to be recognized the change will be effective on a retrospective or modified retrospective basis for fiscal years beginning after december   the company plans to adopt the standard for fiscal year ended december     the company is currently evaluating the impact of the revenue recognition standard on our financial statements disclosures and accounting policies this evaluation process includes a phased approach the first phase of which includes reviewing a sample of our contracts and transaction types the company is currently in the process of completing this first phase and evaluating the methods of adoption   based on the results of the first phase assessment to date the company has reached tentative conclusions and does not believe revenue recognition patterns for our feebased contracts will change materially as a result of implementation the company does expect certain amounts to be grossed up in revenue related to thirdparty reimbursements the company continues to work through implementation efforts       affiliate transactions   the company has no employees operating maintenance and general and administrative services including insurance are provided to the company under a service agreement with an affiliate of markwest from time to time the company may also sell to or purchase from markwest affiliates assets and inventory at the lesser of average unit cost or fair value the company also provides condensate stabilization and terminalling services to marathon an affiliate as of december  see discussion of merger transaction in note

credit risk   financial instruments that potentially expose the company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of trade and other current receivables which are generally unsecured at december   two customers each of who accounted for more than  of the companys trade receivables accounted for  of total trade receivables in aggregate   in  one affiliated producer customer accounted for  of the companys revenue and one unaffiliated producer customer accounted for  of the companys revenue   the company maintains cash deposits with a major bank which from timetotime may exceed federally insured limits       property plant and equipment   property plant and equipment with associated accumulated depreciation is shown below       december             condensate and

conjunction with the acquisition of markwest utica condensates parent by mplx lp in december  the company changed its estimate of the useful lives of certain condensate and stabilization plant assets the condensate and stabilization plants asset depreciation lives that were previously  years were increased to  years the company made these changes to better reflect the estimated periods during which such assets will remain in service not inclusive of the impairment charge this change had the effect of reducing  depreciation expense decreasing loss from operations and decreasing net loss by approximately  million on an annualized basis   see note  for a discussion of the impairment charge recorded at during the year ended december      commercial agreements   midwest terminal agreement   effective december   the company executed a terminal services agreement the terminal agreement with midwest terminalsutica llc midwest under the agreement the company engaged midwest to construct and operate a condensate terminal the terminal adjacent to the companys condensate stabilization facility the facility the terminal includes holding tanks a truck loadout facility a rail loadout facility and pipelines necessary for the operation of the terminal the terminal agreement continues for an initial term of  years and will automatically renew for successive year terms unless either party elects not to renew by month advance notice   midwest obtained a loan to finance the construction of the terminal the terminal loan the terminal loan is payable within  years and allows the company to settle any default on the terminal loan on behalf of midwest and further permits the company to enter the terminal property and assume its operations upon termination of the terminal agreement in conjunction with the terminal loan midwest executed an interest rate swap the interest swap to fix a portion of the interest paid on the terminal loan ohio condensate agreed to reimburse midwest for midwests expected costs incurred to build out the terminal the capital recovery fee the capital recovery fee is paid monthly over  years and initially could not exceed a total cost of  million midwest will maintain ownership of the terminal the terminal agreement is classified as a capital lease obligations on the accompanying balance sheet   in august  the company and midwest entered into amendment no  to terminal services agreement the second amendment under the second amendment the company engaged midwest to enhance the railroad loadout facility to allow dualuse truck and rail functionality for an additional  million in addition the company increased the capital recovery fee over the remaining term to cover the costs of the railroad loadout modifications   as of december   the assets necessary for the operation of the terminal under the capital lease are  million the terminal commenced operations in february  and recorded accumulated amortization of the leased assets of  for the year ended december   the change in the cost basis of the assets and accumulated amortization is attributable to the impairment charge discussed in note  amortization of assets under capital leases is included in depreciation expense   ohio condensate pays midwest service fees for its operation and maintenance of the terminal the service fees are comprised of two components  an operating expense fee dependent on the average daily volume of product delivered to the terminal and  a per barrel fee service fees of  million were incurred during the year ended december   and are included in facility expenses in the accompanying statement of operations   beginning in  the company is required to reimburse midwest  per year for fifteen years or the life of the lease for rental fees owed under the ground lease on which the terminal resides the company incurred  in  which has been recorded in facility expenses  under the terms of the ground lease which midwest entered into directly with harrison county oh the company can settle midwests breaches and allows the company to operate the terminal upon satisfaction of certain conditions   for the benefit of the facility and the terminal the company constructed and maintains tanks pumps and related components at the facility for fire suppression the cost of the shared portions of the fire suppression systems were paid equally by both midwest and the company midwest reimbursed the company  for  of the upfront construction and installation costs of      the fire suppression system the reimbursements will be deferred and recognized as income over the term of the terminal agreement additionally midwest will reimburse the company  of the ongoing costs incurred by the company to operate and maintain the shared system the company constructed a fuel pipe that is not part of the fire suppression systems during  midwest reimbursed the company for  of the construction costs of  the company has a receivable from midwest of  as of december   related to these agreements which is recorded as other receivables on the accompany balance sheet   in the event of expiration or any termination of the terminal agreement by either midwest or ohio condensate for any reason ohio condensate will have the right but not the obligation to immediately enter and take over operations of the terminal if ohio condensate elects to take over operations of the terminal it must obtain midwests release under the terminal loan either by paying off the terminal loan and interest swap or with the lenders consent assuming or restructuring the terminal loan directly with the lender following the companys pay off or assumption with the lenders consent of the terminal loan and interest swap

remitting either to midwest or the terminal loan lender the entire amount of principal and interest then outstanding on the terminal loan and interest swap obligation   midwest has been identified as a variable interest entity vie because the company leases the terminal from midwest and the lease includes a bargain purchase option the companys involvement with this vie is limited to the terminal agreement management has determined that although the above transactions created a variable interest in midwest the company is not the primary beneficiary and as such the company is not required to consolidate the financial statements of midwest in determining that it is not the primary beneficiary the company considered the fact the company does not have any voting interest does not have the power to direct the activities of midwest that most significantly impact its economic performance and only has the right but not the obligation to exercise its option to pay down the terminal loan   the maximum exposure to loss from this variable interest is limited to the amount of our payments at december   as discussed above the companys variable interest in midwest was  million at

december   markwest utica emg condensate llc markwest utica condensate a partially owned subsidiary of markwest liberty midstream  resources llc which is a whollyowned subsidiary of markwest energy partners lp markwest entered into the limited liability company agreement the original llc agreement with blackhawk midstream llc blackhawk together the members in order to form ohio condensate company llc the company or ohio condensate the company was formed for the purpose of gathering by pipeline stabilization terminalling transportation and storage of wellhead condensate within certain defined areas in the state of ohio operations commenced in february  under the terms of the original llc agreement markwest utica condensate and blackhawk each made initial nominal

obligated to contribute all of the capital required by the company markwest utica condensates and blackhawks membership interests were adjusted to equal their respective share of the capital contributed therefore as of december   markwest utica condensate owned more than a  interest and blackhawk owned less than a  interest blackhawk also had an option to acquire a  equity interest in ohio condensate the ohio condensate option see note  in deferred contract costs for further discussion in january  blackhawk sold its interest in the company and the ohio condensate option to summit midstream partners llc summit effective june   summit investment date summit exercised the ohio condensate option and increased its equity ownership from less than  to  through a net cash investment of approximately  million   in august  markwest utica condensate and summit entered into the second amended and restated limited liability company agreement of ohio condensate company llc the second amended llc agreement which replaced the original llc agreement in accordance with the second amended llc agreement markwest utica condensate is required to fund as needed all capital required by the company summit has the right but not the obligation to make additional capital contributions subject to certain limitations if summit elects to contribute capital in response to a particular capital call then the aggregate amount of capital that markwest utica condensate is required to contribute pursuant to such capital call will be decreased dollar for dollar by the amount of capital that summit elects to contribute through december   summit elected to contribute  of all capital calls and in total markwest utica condensate has contributed  million and summit has contributed  million to the company   if either member fails to contribute any capital to the company that is required to be so contributed such member will be considered in default but will remain fully obligated to contribute such capital to the company the company will be entitled to pursue all remedies available at law or in equity against the defaulting member   the business and affairs of the company are overseen by a board of managers which currently consists of three managers from markwest utica condensate and two managers from summit board managers are determined by investment balances and members will have one board manager for every  interest that it holds in the company ownership is also determined based on investment balances in the company if summit elects to not contribute capital in response to capital calls and its investment percentage decreases such that it is greater than  but less than their current  summit will lose a manager on the board of managers if their investment percentage decreases below  but more than  summit will lose a manager but will have the right to designate a nonvoting observer to the board of managers at any time that they hold less than a  interest summit will lose all managers on the board of managers the company is required to distribute all available cash to the members as determined in accordance with the second amended llc agreement within  days of the end of each calendar month   in december  markwest utica condensate became a whollyowned subsidiary of markwest liberty midstream  resources llc the purchase of the partners interest coincided with markwests merger with mplx lp a whollyowned subsidiary of marathon petroleum company marathon    significant accounting policies   basis of presentation   the accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap      use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period estimates affect among other items evaluating impairments of longlived assets establishing estimated useful lives for longlived assets estimating revenue and expense accruals and capital expenditure accruals establishing inputs when determining fair value of options and in determining liabilities if any for environmental and legal contingencies actual results could differ from those estimates   cash and cash equivalents   the company considers investments in highly liquid financial instruments purchased with a remaining maturity at date of acquisition of  days or less to be cash equivalents such investments would include money market accounts the company had no cash equivalents at december   and    property plant and equipment   property plant and equipment consists primarily of condensate stabilization facilities gathering assets other pipeline assets truck and railcar loading equipment and related facilities that are recorded at historical cost expenditures that extend the useful lives of assets are capitalized routine maintenance and repair costs that do not extend the useful lives of assets are expensed as incurred depreciation is provided on a straightline method over a period of  to  years with the exception of miscellaneous equipment and vehicles which are depreciated over a period of  to  years amortization of leasehold improvements is computed using the straight line method over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the improvements   assets held under capital leases are recorded at the lower of the net present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset at the inception of the lease amortization expense is computed using the straightline method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the period of the related lease   impairment of longlived assets   the companys policy is to evaluate whether there has been an impairment in the value of longlived assets when certain events indicate that the remaining balance may not be recoverable longlived assets are considered impaired when the estimated undiscounted cash flows from such assets are less than the assets carrying value in that event a loss is recognized in the amount that the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the longlived assets fair value is determined using either the income or market approach as appropriate management considers the volume of producer customer reserves behind the asset and future natural gas liquids and natural gas prices to estimate cash flows the amount of additional producer customer reserves developed by future drilling activity depends in part on expected natural gas liquids and natural gas prices projections of producer customer reserves drilling activity and future commodity prices are inherently subjective and contingent upon a number of variable factors many of which are difficult to forecast any significant variance in any of these assumptions or factors could materially affect future cash flows which could result in the impairment of an asset or assets the company did not record any impairments for the years ended december   or    for assets identified to be disposed of in the future the carrying value of these assets is compared to the estimated fair value less the cost to sell to determine if impairment is required until the assets are disposed of an estimate of the fair value is redetermined when related events or circumstances change   deferred contract costs   deferred contract costs represent the asset created by the fair value of the ohio condensate option that was recorded as permanent equity this cost is amortized over the term of the arrangement into facility expenses on the statements of operations   revenue recognition   the company generates its revenue by providing condensate stabilization and terminalling services the company earns a fee or fees under these arrangements related to the volume of condensate that flows through its facility and is not directly dependent on commodity prices the companys assessment of each of the revenue recognition criteria as they relate to its revenue producing activities are as follows persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured it is upon completion of services provided that the company has met all four criteria and it is at such time that the company recognizes revenue amounts billed in advance of the period in which the revenue recognition criteria are not met are recorded as a liability under deferred revenue in the accompanying balance sheets   expense accruals   the company routinely makes accruals based on estimates for expenses due to the timing of receiving certain thirdparty information and reconciling the companys records with those of third parties the delayed information from third parties includes among other things volumetric charges and other operating expenses the company makes accruals to reflect estimates for these      items based on its internal records and information from third parties estimated accruals are adjusted when actual information is received from third parties and the companys internal records have been reconciled   income taxes   the company is treated as a partnership for tax purposes under the provisions of the internal revenue code accordingly the accompanying financial statements do not reflect a provision for federal income taxes since the companys results of operations and related credits and deductions will be passed through and taken into account by its members in computing their respective tax liabilities the company is however subject to an income tax at the cadiz ohio jurisdictional level   the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and net operating loss carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect of any tax rate change on deferred taxes is recognized as tax expense benefit from continuing operations in the period that includes the enactment date of the tax rate change realizability of deferred tax assets is assessed and if not more likely than not a valuation allowance is recorded to reflect the deferred tax assets at net realizable value as determined by management all deferred tax balances are classified as longterm in the accompanying balance sheets   the net deferred tax liability of  at december   resulting from temporary booktax differences is comprised of net operating loss carryforwards for state jurisdictional level tax purposes of  a valuation allowance of  and property plant and equipment of  this net deferred tax liability has been recorded as part of other longterm liabilities in the accompanying balance sheets   significant judgment is required in evaluating the companys tax positions during the ordinary course of business there may be transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain however the company did not have any material uncertain tax positions for the years ended december   or  the state net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in  the company does not anticipate utilizing the entire net operating loss carryforwards and has provided a  valuation allowance against this deferred tax asset   environmental costs   the company records environmental liabilities at their undiscounted amounts when environmental assessments indicate that remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated estimates of the liabilities are based on currently available facts existing technology and presently enacted laws and regulations and include estimates of associated legal costs as of december   and  the company has not recognized any environmental liabilities   fair value of financial instruments   the carrying amounts of financial instruments including trade receivables other receivables affiliate receivables and payables accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of the shortterm maturity of these instruments the fair value of the capital lease approximates carrying value as the lease was amended at the end of    recent accounting pronouncements   in february  the fasb issued an accounting standards update on lease accounting this update requires lessees to put most leases on their balance sheets the new standard also requires new disclosures to help financial statement users better understand the amount timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases the accounting standards update will be effective on a retrospective or modified retrospective basis for annual reporting periods beginning after december   and interim periods within those years with early adoption permitted the company is in the process of determining the impact of the new standard on the financial statements   in november  the fasb issued an accounting standards update to simplify the balance sheet classification of deferred taxes the update requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities along with any related valuation allowance be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet the update does not change the existing requirement that only permits offsetting within a jurisdiction the change is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after december   the guidance may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively with early adoption permitted our adoption of this standard in the fourth quarter of  did not have a material impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows we have elected to apply this standard prospectively therefore prior periods have not been retrospectively adjusted   in august  the fasb issued an accounting standards update requiring management to assess an entitys ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances management will be required to assess if there is substantial doubt about an entitys ability to continue as a going concern for one year after the date that the financial statements are issued disclosures will be required if conditions give rise to substantial doubt and the type of disclosure will be determined based on whether managements plans will be able to alleviate the substantial doubt the accounting standards update will      be effective for the first annual period ending after december   and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter with early application permitted we do not expect application of this standard to have an impact on our financial reporting   in may  the fasb issued an accounting standards update for revenue recognition that is aligned with the international accounting standards boards revenue recognition standard the guidance in the update states that revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of a good or service recognition of the revenue will involve a multiple step approach including identifying the contract identifying the separate performance obligations determining the transaction price allocating the price to the performance obligations and then recognizing the revenue as the obligations are satisfied additional disclosures will be required to provide adequate information to understand the nature amount timing and uncertainty of reported revenues and revenues expected to be recognized the accounting standards update will be effective on a retrospective or modified retrospective basis for annual reporting periods beginning after december   and interim periods within those years with early adoption permitted no earlier than january   the company is in the process of determining the impact of the new standard on the financial statements    affiliate transactions   the company has no employees operating maintenance and general and administrative services including insurance are provided to the company under a service

terminal loan lender the entire amount of principal and interest then outstanding on the terminal loan and interest swap obligation and thereby extinguish the terminal loan however ohio condensates right to extinguish the terminal loan does not entitle ohio condensate to take over operations of the terminal or to acquire title to the terminal or the midwest equipment unless done so in connection with a termination of the terminal agreement   midwest has been identified as a variable interest entity vie because the company leases the terminal from midwest and the lease includes a bargain purchase option the companys involvement with this vie is limited to the terminal agreement management has determined that although the above transactions created a variable interest in midwest the company is not the primary beneficiary and as such the company is not required to consolidate the financial statements of midwest in determining that it is not the primary beneficiary the company considered the fact the company does not have any voting interest does not have the power to direct the activities of midwest that most significantly impact its economic performance and only has the right but not the obligation to exercise its option to pay down the terminal loan   the maximum exposure to loss from this variable interest is limited to the amount of our payments at december   as discussed above the companys variable interest in midwest was  million at december      commitments and contingencies   effective june  the company entered into an agreement with cuoh under this agreement the company is obligated to ship a minimum of  loaded rail carloads of stabilized condensate within a three year period beginning on the date that the first rail carload of stabilized

rail carload below the  minimum the three year minimum commitment period commenced in july  and the company shipped  carloads in the six months ended december   the company deems it probable the volume commitment will be met during the three year period therefore the company has not recorded any liability for this commitment as of december   in addition once the volume commitment is met the company is eligible for reimbursement payments of  per rail car shipped over the life of the agreement but not to exceed  million such reimbursement payments are considered a gain contingency and will not be recognized until collectability is reasonably assured after the volume commitment is met   effective october  the company entered into a fiveyear arrangement that will result in a capital lease for a transformer substation there are no minimum lease payments due until the transformer substation is put into service which is expected in the first quarter of  the substation is not in service as of the date these financial statements were issued therefore the net present value of the required minimum lease payments will be capitalized and an obligation will be recorded in the amount of approximately  million at the inservice date of the transformer substation future annual minimum lease payments under the capital lease are  for  and  for each of the years  through    in the ordinary
