ukessays trusted by students since     todays opening times    bst an over view of the v f corporation marketing essay print reference this apa mla mla harvard vancouver wikipedia published rd march  this essay has been submitted by a student this is not an example of the work written by our professional essay writers the international apparel industry has been inevitably influenced by the global recession that was precipitated by the credit crunch however this situation provided an opportunity to overcome old challenges liu  before the economic crisis began the industry was confronted with being overretailed and oversupplied liu  throughout the supply chain this resulted in inefficiency during the past  months some famous brands were not competitive enough to cope with financial and economic challenges forcing them to halt their operations however this situation has provided chances for an industry consolidation which entails buyers reducing their number of manufacturing suppliers and manufacturers narrowing their customer bases liu  research on consumers shopping habits proved that their focus priorities are price brand and style hence clothing and footwear manufacturers aim at producing wellmade and costfriendly goods burke  some us clothing and footwear brands were fortunate to keep their competitiveness in international market by making their supply chains more efficient and sourcing many of their goods internationally burke  many clothing and footwear businesses started to adopt international production in the early s this occurred because competitive global companies transferred their production from the united states to developing countries to maintain high quality and low prices by  around  percent of footwear products sold in the us market were manufactured outside the us the most current data shows that this number has shot up to  percent until   percent of clothing products originated from foreign and  percent from domestic production according to trade data from  about  percent of outwear sold in the us was made in foreign countries this sector is a buy everywhere sell everywhere industry burke  which forces the involved companies to keep their international competiveness consolidation strategy has proven to be a key to success if it is accompanied by costeffective services and proper human resources management liu  in addition following new legislative agendas and government regulations became important since it could give advantages or disadvantages to the firms in the apparel industry therefore keep searching for educational opportunities and experts in the clothing and footwear industry is important being involved in a trade association gives insights to successfully tide over any kinds of challenges within the industry for instance the american apparel and footwear association aafa keeps its members updated on important issues burke  being creative and thinking ahead allowed some clothing companies to perform extremely well in international markets pleasing ones consumers is facilitated since an efficient supply chain results in higher efficiency through lowered prices in order to stay competitive an apparel company has to constantly ameliorate its supply chain  vfs current international purchasing and production strategy   vfs current strategy uses a mixture of internal manufacturing and international purchasing cut and makecontracts cm historically before it acquired the north face in the late s vf internally manufactured its products in about  factories beginning with the acquisition of the north face this production strategy had started to change as the company acquired more brands the reason for this was that the companys existing manufacturing infrastructure was not well fitted to the lifestyle brands such as the north face vfs plants were mainly focused on jeans and denim products and thus were not able to properly manufacture the goods of the lifestyle brands the company needed to outsource its production to asia to expand into lifestyle brands and international markets this resulted in the closure of many of vfs production sites according to the case material vf produced about  of its products inhouse and outsourced the rest from independent suppliers by  the proportion between inhouse production and purchasing was different across product lines for example  of its jeans were produced internally while outsourcing  of their lifestyle apparel footwear and backpacks pisano  adams  vf has very strong internal manufacturing capabilities no other company has such efficient and reliable production processes the lead time to produce a garment in vfs internal factories is far shorter than the industry average instead of  to  days vfs plants need only  in terms of quality and reliability the defect rates of vfs factories were also below the industry average when it comes to sourcing vf had to build up a network of reliable highquality suppliers by  it had relationships with more than  contractors and  distribution centers pisano  adams  vf provides only shortterm contracts for its suppliers in order to motivate them to keep their prices low if a supplier cannot fulfill vfs expectations anymore the company quickly abandons him and turns to his competitors recently vf has also begun to test a new purchasing approach called the third way which will be covered in section   analysis of the production  purchasing strategy of competitors in the following section sourcingproduction strategies of vfs main competitors will be analyzed most companies tend to either one of the following extremes no internal production and complete outsourcing vs vertically integrated production and only limited purchasing activities see table  table  company vf sara lee liz claiborne zara strategy mixture between internal production international purchasing and third way international purchasing now defunct international purchasing now package sourcing internal production only limited purchasing source own illustration clothing producers like liz claiborne levi strauss and sara lee abandoned their internal manufacturing sites several years ago and began to focus on the marketing of externally produced apparel the main reason behind this was to achieve cost savings by sourcing from markets with low labor cost and to free cash that had been tied up in lowmargin activities surowiecki  outsourcing drastically increases a companys flexibility external suppliers can be switched quite easily when they fail to deliver the promised quality at the agreed prices or at the appointed delivery date or when trade barriers render making business with a supplier of a certain country impossible originally low prices of external suppliers might be reduced even further because the wellknown apparel companies are relatively large whereas their suppliers mostly are small factories with low bargaining power however this approach also has major disadvantages lead times as well as inventories increase and transaction cost does as well since the need for proper coordination is growing suppliers have to be identified and sourcing relationship must be managed the increase in flexibility mentioned above is thus at least partially canceled out moreover a company that relies solely on outsourcing can hardly build up any knowhow in terms of apparel production due to the pressure on the suppliers to keep prices low several problems arise first of all the creation of trust is prevented and communication between the involved parties might be neglected for example three months prior to the relocation of his plant one of vfs suppliers informed the company about his plans due to trade barriers vf was unable to maintain its relationship with this supplier and had to urgently find another one furthermore suppliers wont work exclusively for only one client thus there is high risk of losing knowhow to competitors most suppliers are also forced to keep their margins extremely low as a result they are very likely to become bankrupt during economic downturns or if they lose an important customer in order to reduce cost some suppliers also offend against laws and regulations that protect worker rights or the environment for example it has been recently discovered that a supplier of levi strauss had illegally dumped toxic waste marketinginteractivecom  incidents like this one can have negative effects on the reputation of all involved companies to conclude apparel companies that focus on outsourcing can keep their prices at very low levels but are exposed to higher risks especially concerning supply chain disruptions during the last few years this strategy has become less attractive costs cannot be reduced endlessly as more and more apparel companies purchase from lowcost suppliers outsourcing ceases to be a competitive advantage differences in purchasing prices become smaller companies could be forced to pass the price reductions that outsourcing enables to their customers instead of achieving higher margins due to a lack of data evaluating the outsourcing strategies of clothing companies is quite difficult however it should be noted that sara lee sold its clothing branch only  years after deciding to exclusively rely on outsourcing competitor liz claiborne halted its regular outsourcing efforts in  and adopted the package sourcing approach see section  managerial alternatives in this paper vf uses international purchasing for its lifestyle brands since its internal production facilities are not suited for the manufacturing of those goods this enables cost savings but increases lead time significantly vfs lifestyle brand are very popular among customers low prices are not that important to them instead the availability of those products has to be guaranteed hence long lead times and possible supply chain disruptions are threatening the popularity and success of vfs lifestyle brands the outsourcing approach could be suited for vfs heritage brand goods demand forecasts for those goods are much more reliable than for lifestyle goods therefore long lead times would not be that troublesome besides if using the outsourcing approach vf could achieve price reductions for its heritage products facing intense competition and selling its products for almost double the price that some competitors like faded glory charge vf needs to cut costs in this sector but in case of outsourcing the production of its heritage goods vf would have to give up the internallydeveloped techniques and equipment that enabled its efficient production because due to a lack of trust it cannot trust its suppliers spanish apparel manufacturer and seller zara relies on the second approach results have been good but nevertheless mixed though being wellknown and successful in europe zara has not been able to establish itself on the north american market yet thoneybarletta  hartman  while basic products are outsourced to lowcost suppliers zara manufactures its lifestyle products on its own business week  most internal production is carried out close to the companys headquarters in spain labor is much more expensive in spain than in those asian countries to which many competitors outsource their production furthermore as zara goods have to be transported from spain to the respective stores high transportation costs occur this could be an explanation why zara is struggling on the north american market however since the company is very prosperous in asia zaras approach may nevertheless work well as dutta  explains zaras main advantage is its tremendous amount of flexibility and control zaras lead times are significantly lower than those of comparable companies while other apparel companies often have to discount prices drastically in order to sell all their products before their design gets outdated zara has never had such problems instead of manufacturing high quantities of only a few products zara designs about  different goods per year but produces only small amounts of each if one of those products does not meet the taste of consumers which happens quite often in the apparel industry the economic damage would be low and the product could be replaced rapidly additionally each product is scarce and thus more valuable to customers the drawback of this approach is that economies of scale cannot be achieved at any point in time all in all the company can quickly react to changing customer demands and achieve higher customer satisfaction as a result it sells more of its products and at higher prices thus offsetting the high manufacturing costs also the advantages of completely controlling the facilities in which ones products are manufactured should not be underestimated especially in the apparel industry some lowcost suppliers use sweatshop labor when being made public those conditions can cause a massive loss of reputation not only for the supplier itself but also for its clients due to its internal manufacturing zara is able to avoid those issues cnn  could vf successfully adopt zaras strategy dutta  judges while it may not be possible for another company to exactly duplicate the conditions under which zara grew and flourished we can certainly try and learn from its business experiences its processes and its business structure indeed flexibility is most important in the apparel industry when dealing with external suppliers vf faces high inventory costs and long lead times vfs own plants use elaborated technologies and have low defective rates but those plants are only suited for the production of the heritage goods another major difference between zara and vf is that zara does not do any advertising thus even with high manufacturing costs zara still has lucrative margins in contrast to that since vfs success depends heavily on advertising the company has to keep manufacturing costs as low as possible yet as chris fraser puts it building more plants or vertically integrating suppliers would not be consistent with vfs internal policies and from a capital point of view might not make sense  analysis of the third way the idea behind the third way is to create extremely close longterm supplier relationships that yield significant benefits for both parties the third way is a mixture between internal production and outsourcing and combines the advantages of both approaches vfs main benefits would be lean inventory which would be a sharp contrast to the current excess inventory lower lead times and lower production cost the latter would be achieved in three ways first of all instead of a vf plant a supplier produces the goods thus reducing the labor cost secondly vf would provide the supplier its internallydeveloped techniques therefore making the production process much more efficient this production facility upgrade would also be supported financially by the supplier thirdly vf and the supplier would join forces to procure raw materials as cheap as possible since the supplier would commit himself to producing exclusively for vf the threat of losing knowhow to competitors would vanish in contrast to internal production the supplier would have to manage the work force thus the third way results in lower transaction costs for vf there is also huge potential for shortening the design process of new products pisano  adams  the supplier would face significantly lower risk and uncertainty since he would get longterm contracts and volume forecasts for several years moreover vf would also guarantee to buy back any unused raw materials as the supplier would be remunerated on a cost plus basis he would always be able to meet his roa goals the longterm contracts also reduce the frequency of renegotiations leading to a decline in transaction costs for both parties pisano  adams  despite the mentioned advantages this strategy also has flaws that should not be neglected compared with internal manufacturing vf would be less flexible when using the third way it also requires the supplier to share information about his costs and processes with vf the biggest drawback of the third way is that it cannot be enforced without appropriate knowledgeable human resources pisano  adams  vf either has to transfer its staff to the supplier or hire new local staff in the first case vf would need to find willing employees and have to transfer them to the supplier resulting in searching costs and travelling expenses in the second case talented locals have to be identified and trained leading to searching and training costs those are no major barriers to implementing the third way but they should be taken into account when comparing the profitability of each approach so far vf has gained only limited experience in dealing with third wayrelationships some attempts went well others failed however those failed tries showed another strength of the third way if a supplier cannot be part of a third wayrelationship anymore vf could either return to the regular cutandmake contracts or integrate the suppliers plant into its own operations without having wasted large amounts of money or resources  managerial alternatives managing ones supply chain requires not only a lot of resources but also experience in dealing with suppliers worldwide if a company lacks the necessary resources or competence it can use the socalled package sourcing this involves hiring an external company that manages purchasing activities supplier relationships and the supply chain as a whole in february  liz claiborne one of the biggest competitors of vf brands and li  fung the worlds largest system integrator for apparel agreed on an extensive packaged sourcing contract yun  the advantages of this deal are obvious li  fung gains a profitable customer liz claiborne outsources its procurement activities to a specialized integrator profiting from li  fungs huge network of low cost production facilities furthermore price discounts can be realized due to mass sourcing over the various liz claiborne brands by bundling the apparel orders of the brands synergies in terms of time scheduling and transport costs can be achieved with this foundation of a long term relationship between both partners li  fung can develop deep insider knowledge for the handling of liz claiborne brands thus enhancing the product quality at the first glance this approach seems to be very efficient leading to lower costs and sustaining high quality however this deal also has shortcomings for liz claiborne by concentrating on only one supplier operating the total brand portfolio liz claiborne heavily depends on li  fung this threat is even catalyzed by the fact that li  fung serves many apparel retailers corporate intelligence could get to competitors via li  fung with having so much power over the supply chain of liz claiborne li  fung may think about a backwards integration considering the acquisition of us bag producer van zeeland in  and the marketer wear me apparel llc in  li  fung which sources products for us retailers such as abercrombie  fitch co and kohls corp in recent years has been keen on expanding beyond its core sourcing operations and into highermargin businesses in segments such as retail and brand licensing ng  another not that obvious disadvantage of the deal is brand dilution by synchronizing the sourcing of all brands from one integrator the brands might be equalized by using similar manufacturing sites and the same product developers of li  fung liz claiborne should have a close look at those often indirect shortcomings of such full scale integrations compared to vfs third way sourcing liz claiborne can realize cheaper prices save costs by outsourcing its supply chain competence and thereby only concentrating on their main competence of marketing and selling in comparison to that vf has to invest in relationships with many single suppliers and developing insight knowledge by sending out engineering teams to its suppliers however in contrast to liz claiborne vf still has full and direct power over its suppliers it is also easier for vf to enhance the quality of its products moreover vf has internal production plants that perform very well closing them would not only be inefficient but is also impossible in the near future thus vf could not rely completely on package sourcing bundling demands would only be possible to a smaller extent price reductions might not come true at all additionally vf has build up an internal department that successfully manages its supply chain using package sourcing from now on would render this department useless and the competencies that have been achieved there would vanish thus package sourcing would not be efficient for vf at all  recommendations vfs brand lines can be divided into two segments based on the characteristics and requirements of the production processes heritage brands including wrangler and lee and lifestyle brands such as the north face vans nautica reef kipling eastpak majestic napapiri eagle creek john varvatos and  for all mankind as analyzed in earlier sections each segment has distinctive key success factors for the heritage brands quality and price are the key for success being highly responsive to demand fluctuations is not that important since demand is quite stable and the product design doesnt get old ie the customers will demand the same type of jeans every year for these reasons vfs concern should go along with how they could reduce cost while maintaining the quality of the products therefore vf needs a solution that provides low costs whereas lead times are not that important but should nevertheless be considered too a comparison between the lead times and costs of each approach yields at the third way as the best approach since vf can share its internallydeveloped technologies and processes with its third waysuppliers their production processes will be almost as efficient as those of vf but much cheaper package sourcing or regular outsourcing is no option here however vf could itself consider the construction of new plants in lowcost countries instead of using the third way but this would require a change in the companys policies for lifestyle brands which require extremely quick responses in order to replenish inventory continuously throughout a season it would be best for vf to manufacture these products internally internal production does not only yield at the lowest lead times it is also very likely that vf is able to further improve its production processes leading to even lower lead times and even lower default rates when buying lifestyle products customers care about the design and quality of the goods prices are secondary therefore the fact that internal production is more expensive than the other approaches should not influence the decision at all again package sourcing or regular outsourcing is no option here as we have discussed in our analysis above to conclude as lowcost competitors endanger vfs heritage product lines and the company is not flexible enough to fulfill retailer requirements when it comes to lifestyle products vf is under heavy pressure to adopt new production and sourcing strategies any further cost reduction in regular international purchasing is virtually impossible because of the financial crisis more supplier bankruptcies are to be expected vfs current strategy had been quite successful for many years but cannot secure a competitive edge for the company any longer for the lifestyle product lines vf should replace its regular international purchasing relationships by third way relationships since the suppliers as well as vf have to get used to this new way and this approach will constantly improve vf should embed this change in a process that takes care that the
