those we serve motto since  give light and the people will find their own way scripps is a company where competing truths coexist we are proud of our long and rich history but we stay fixated on the future we are creating digital media brands that complement and support our successful television and radio stations but also some that could compete with and disrupt them we employ accomplished journalists who have earned prestigious industry awards and have authority with audiences but weâre also a band of contrarians who challenge the process and push ourselves to do new things we are obsessed with being right but weâre not afraid to experiment and occasionally to fail we have a conservative financial ethos but we use it to support an opportunistic and at times counterintuitive investing strategy we were birthed by newspapers and we nurtured cable systems and cable networks we loved them all but we set them free we are comfortable with these kinds of disruptive ideas and contradictory facts and that leads to a culture where our thriving broadcast business works side by side with emerging digital brands together these businesses create a financially attractive news and

operate” he saidsymson said scripps will continue to pursue the strategies boehne established in the last several years adding different media platforms to the television stations that account for

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed
