lawyer pe private eq r recruiter vc venture capitalist a note on methodology the midas list seeks to identify individuals who deploy venture capital to create wealth for their investors our ranking formula ignores the original amount invested in a deal as it is often undisclosed instead weighing most heavily the market capitalization of a venturebacked company on the close of its first day of trading or the purchase price in an acquisition a lesser weight is given to the change in value of each investment since going public or being sold ranking also depends on a venture capitalists or lawyers bankers or recruiters length of involvement and influence with a startup companies must have gone public or been acquired after june  to be considered and they must be engaged in information technology or life sciences our results are based on extensive reporting and surveys sent to  professionals including vcs angels lawyers bankers recruiters and limited partners special thanks go to
