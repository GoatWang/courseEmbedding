enercore inc completes merger transaction with enercore power inc enercore inc completes merger transaction with enercore power inc jul    et from enercore inc irvine calif july   prnewswire  enercore inc otcbb encr the company announced today that it completed a merger transaction with enercore power inc fka flex power generation inc that had been disclosed in the companys filings with the securities and exchange commission in april and may  common stock of the combined company will continue to be quoted on the otc bulletin board and the otc market group incs otcqb tier under the symbol encr  in connection with the closing of the merger transaction the company received the  million in equity financing that was a condition to the closing the company designs develops and manufactures gradual oxidizer products and technologies that aim to expand power generation into previously uneconomical markets while at the same time reducing the emissions of gases produced from industrial processes that contribute to air pollution and climate change dr boris maslov enercores president stated we are pleased to be in the public markets and look forward to enhancing the value of our company for all of our stockholders – old and new  all of us at enercore intend to expand our companys business horizons in a meaningful manner  we believe that our gradual oxidation products and technology provides a unique value proposition in that it not only allows for the extraction of energy from previously unusable low energy fuels while at the same time significantly reducing harmful pollutants and creating useful energy products such as heat and electricity dr maslov concluded we believe that our customers can greatly reduce the cost of compliance with air quality regulations by avoiding the chemicals catalysts and complex permitting required by competitive systems the company will be releasing full details of the merger transaction and the related financing on july
