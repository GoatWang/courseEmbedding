watchscheduletopicsabout frontlineshopteacher center sidney taurel is the chairman president and ceo of eli lilly in this interview he talks about alternatives to expanding medicare to include drug coverage the problems with canadas price controls maine and oregons measures for cutting drug costs and the benefits of directtoconsumer advertising this interview was conducted on nov   the price of prescription drugs as a fraction of health care has been rising sharply what are the drivers of this rise pharmaceuticals have come to be used more and more as we have made a lot of progress in pharmaceutical innovation and have come up with new products which prolong life improve the quality of lives improve productivity so it is this increase in demand rather than any price increases which have driven the share that pharmaceuticals represent of total health care costs this being said id like to put that in perspective because pharmaceuticals still today represent only  percent of total health care costs which is the lowest percentage of any developed country in the world as a percentage of gross domestic product we americans spend about  percent of gdp on pharmaceuticals a percentage which is very similar to other countries in the world are you saying youre the victim of your success certainly pharmaceuticals are used more than they were yes very much so i believe that it is actually a good thing for the health care of americans in general that more pharmaceuticals are being used because very often pharmaceuticals will help avoid much more invasive costly and painful types of medical interventions for example we no longer have very many ulcer operations thanks to antiulcer compounds to show another example of costbeneficial treatments the new antipsychotics new generation of products against schizophrenia help avoid hospitalization which today it is estimated that the schizophrenic may cost society up to  a year in treatment costs mostly because there is a lot of hospitalization involved with the use of these newer agents at a fraction of that cost we keep these people not only off the hospital but also many of them are capable of starting again a very productive life part of the problem you face is that consumers are starting to see the price of drugs why would a pharmaceutical product be so expensive the problem is really that even though pharmaceuticals represent only  percent of total health care costs for consumers it appears to be more because their outofpocket expense is higher for consumers outofpocket pharmaceuticals represent about  percent of outofpocket expenses why because we have different insurance systems and different copays different deductibles for pharmaceuticals than we have for the rest of health care that is not logical since pharmaceuticals help avoid hospitalization surgery and so on there actually should be incentives for the usage of pharmaceuticals not disincentives  which these higher copays and deductibles represent so its not fair but since they see it they ask why its so expensive yes first of all let me make a point should all the profits of the pharmaceutical companies be eliminated we would make a dent  and a very temporary dent  of  percent in total health care costs and would not stop the growth of these health care costs those costs increase because populations are aging because we have more and more revenue and therefore more and more access to innovation and because people have more access to information about innovation and therefore demand that innovation the cost of pharmaceuticals is very affected by the cost of research the research into pharmaceutical products is long is expensive and is risky it takes  to  years between the time we develop a concept to the time we have a product on the market we have to start with several tens of thousands of molecules before we get to what is called a lead once we have that lead only one out of  leads or so will get you a molecule which is then going through clinical development and only one product out of  which starts clinical development will make it to the marketplace finally only three products which reach the marketplace out of  will recoup their costs of rd so its a very very very risky business as a result investors expect high returns to compensate for the high risks of this business it appears that this industry is more profitable than any other industry over the last  years  with a  percent return is that true if you look at the  figures the industry as a whole had an  percent return so youre pretty close but within that  percent one company lost money and a couple were below  percent in  we are seeing a significant reduction in those returns because we have patent expirations of a number of products and the expected fruits of the genomics revolution are taking a little longer to arrive that illustrates really the risks of this business it takes a very very long time and a lot of money to bring a product to market   to  years in terms of the development cycle a very very small percentage of the products that we start with make it to the marketplace a very small percentage of them actually recoup their costs the costs have escalated from about  million per molecule  years ago to about  million today as per the latest studies therefore this is a very very highrisk business when you look now at the patent system patents are valid for  years but this starts from the time when the patent issues which is typically the very beginning of the development process once the product is on the market it is protected effectively for a much much shorter period of time which today is like  years maximum so it is a highrisk business a small time to recoup the investment as a result investors demand a higher return are other countries with more restrictive pricing as innovative as the united states in developing new drugs many countries outside the united states have a form of price controls and those price controls have affected tremendously innovation i know particularly the case of france where i lived for eight years thirty years ago because of the quality of its pharmaceutical scientists france was number two in pharmaceutical innovation in the world today after  years of price controls it is number nine all modern economists know that the one predictable outcome of price controls is to reduce the availability of whatever is being supplied in the case of pharmaceutical products what is being curtailed is the production of new innovative medicines weve seen that again not only in france but in japan in italy in spain in canada really most of the pharmaceutical innovation is now concentrated in the united states more than  percent of new drugs are invented and developed in the united states why because we have a free pricing system which allows rewards for innovation to be determined by the marketplace what do you feel about the federal efforts to address the lack of a prescription drug benefit for seniors i think it is very very important that this country adopts a prescription drug benefit plan for seniors and that this prescription drug benefit be integrated in the total medicare system when medicare was developed back in the s pharmaceuticals were a very very small part of the total  maybe  percent or so today it is a larger part with close to  percent of total health care for seniors it is probably even a little bit more than that so its very important that seniors have access to reimbursed pharmaceuticals so in turn that will help them prevent some worse forms and more expensive forms of intervention onethird of seniors do not have any drug benefit at all so its important for us as a nation to address this its very important that the way we address this ensures that there is a free market at play so that the benefits and costs of pharmaceutical products can be assessed first in relation to each other but also in relation to the other forms of intervention again as pharmaceuticals only represent less than  percent of the total health care what you can save through the better use of pharmaceuticals can really be assessed in the  percent of health care which is spent on hospital care or the  percent spent with physicians and so on in principle medicare can do this kind of tradeoff are they very good at it whats happening is that we have a feeforservice system which is not the best environment in which to make those tradeoff analyses when you administer separately hospitalization doctors fees drugs labs and so forth you do not optimize the sum of all of that managed care is trying to do that in the private sector  not always with the best results from a quality standpoint  and this needs to be improved but they have been able to control costs and provide some amount of quality the organizations which have been around for the longest period of time provide typically the best quality they are doing that by focusing on the needs of the individual patient rather than focusing their management on each separate element of the system youre not in favor of expanding medicare to offer a prescription drug benefit … what we think would be the best system would be to reform medicare there was a bipartisan medicare commission that president clinton convened about three or four years ago and which did not get the supermajority that was required on that commission but their proposal was a premium support system whereby medicare beneficiaries would receive an amount of money with which they would buy a health plan from competing health plans the various health plans would be competing on the basis of cost and quality and those plans would include a drug benefit why do you think this would do a better job than expanding medicare it would do a better job for both patients and for the economy by ensuring that the tradeoffs between the use of pharmaceuticals and the use of other forms of intervention  that those analyses are made also by having this based on a system of choice and free market we would continue to reap the benefit of a free market system while at the same time enhancing consumer choice what would you say to maine seniors who question why canadians pay less for pharmaceuticals the answer is very simple canada has price controls and the united states does not the implications of that are twofold for innovative products the prices are generally lower in canada because of these price controls but then when the drug goes off patent then there is no free market in canada and therefore the prices do not come down as quickly as they do in the united states as a result canadians spend  significantly more than americans for generic drugs or for offpatent drugs in total in both countries we spend  percent of gdp on drugs the difference isnt because some people are uninsured wouldnt we use more drugs if we had better access the figures do not show that canadians use more drugs relative to their economy than americans the difference between the two systems is that the very high level of price competition which occurs after a patent expiration in this country forces pharmaceutical companies to constantly innovate lilly for example faced the patent expiration of prozac last year the only way for us to continue to survive and thrive as a company was to come up with new products to make up for this indeed we have now eight new products to be launched over the next couple of years what im saying is that this system really fosters innovation both by rewarding it when the patent is there but also by ensuring that when the patent expires the economic viability of the product goes away completely so that that forces you to continuously come up with new products the canadian system does exactly the opposite as a result there is very little pharmaceutical innovation in canada or for that matter in most european countries that also galls these seniors we pay for the innovation here but the canadians benefit its not fair i like to think that americans benefit first from innovation when you look at the gap that there is because of price controls in access that canadians have to innovation you can see that we first reap the benefits of innovation here as americans why do you allow the canadians to sell it for less we really do not have a choice the canadian provinces … impose a price on the pharmaceutical industry what is our choice there … the only one we have would be to make our products available without reimbursement  that is a possibility which has been used in a few cases  or to not make our products available in the canadian market but there we face two problems one is that the law enables the canadian government to force what is called a compulsory license if we refuse to make a product available in canada the government basically can force us to license another company to do two we also have moral and ethical problems when we come up with a lifesaving product like a drug for sepsis xigris that we launched last year in this country if we do not make them available to patients who are dying around the world we do have obviously some very significant moral and ethical issues with regard to the maine rx program what is the problem of taking  million million seniors and getting them a discount first i understand the issues that governors are facing in trying to combine in a difficult economic environment balanced budgets which by law they have to have with ensuring that their medicaid population particularly receives appropriate treatments i think to deal with it through imposed rebates or other forms of limitations on the use of pharmaceuticals such as the use of prior authorization limiting the choices that physicians can have in terms of which pharmaceutical product to prescribe to their patients  all of that will result in not as good care for patients and not necessarily lower costs the reason is if you do not use the appropriate product you will pay the consequences in terms of more hospitalization and so forth instead we are working with many governors around the country in looking at improving the overall medicaid performance and controlling budgets by attacking not just pharmaceuticals which again is only  percent of the total but the other areas as well things such as the treatment of chronic diseases such as depression diabetes asthma and so forth can be improved tremendously through disease state management programs also through better deployment of information technology you can significantly reduce costs when you look at total health care costs you have something probably in the range of  percent of  trillion which is related to the cost of insurance liability insurance so some kind of tort reform or change in the malpractice laws would go a long way to reducing this this is more than twice what we spend in total on pharmaceuticals there is also another  percent estimated which is due to the cost of administration through better deployment of information technology we can simplify all of that and eliminate a lot of duplications so what we are doing in states like colorado or arkansas right now is to help with disease state management programs to find better solutions more effective solutions but which do not destroy innovation through price controls if maine rx is copied by other states how serious a problem would that be if the maine program was adopted by other states it could have very dire consequences for the pharmaceutical industry because all of the medicaid part of our business which is  percent or  percent of the total market would be significantly affected by price controls but the maine program also leveraged rebates for medicaid beneficiaries to other populations the seniors yes which is an extension if you will of the statedominated rebate system therefore if it were adopted on a national basis that would put more than  percent of the total pharmaceutical market under some form of state control there i have to go back to the examples that we have seen in other countries  what their nationalized health care system does to innovation so in a nutshell it would grow the government part from  percent to  percent yes probably in excess of that because seniors represent about  percent medicaid is about  percent and besides that there are some other programs the va and others so the market would still have private parts but it would be less private correct much less private the industry has been criticized for gaming the patent system to extend patents and keep generics out you feel this industry is treated unequally as regards patents i think some of the criticism of the industry regarding patents is linked to the socalled month stay and the use of several month stays which is provided in the current patent law …the criticism of the industry has come from a perceived abuse of the system by using several month stays and also by socalled late patent listings but i want to give you a little bit of what the facts are since  when the hatchwaxman law passed there have been about  socalled abbreviated ndas which are the generic applications for new products out of those  only in eight cases have we seen multiple month stays also those month stays really occur before the patent expiration they occur during the life of the patent in no case has this resulted in an extension of the patent so you think some things about patents have been exaggerated yes i believe that very very few cases have occurred  eight out of   in the case of eli lilly we have never had more than one month stay in terms of latelisted patent we did have that opportunity in the case of prozac  to license a patent which issued one month before the prozac patent expiration but we decided not to because we felt that this patent was not really a valid one even though there were some pressure from some investors that this would bring lilly some economic benefit in the short term we felt it was not ethically right to do from the business point of view what is it like to lose a patent before you expect it is that pretty serious yes to lose a patent before you expect to is a very traumatic experience for a company especially when your product represents a significant percentage of your sales fortunately in the case of the prozac patent expiration we had done very significant planning and contingency planning beforehand so we were ready based on various potential scenarios of when the patent would expire we are ready with a number of new products to launch to the market shortly after the patent expiration some state governors say the pharmaceutical market is dysfunctional because they dont have the data to make informed choices do you have any sympathy for that view i believe that everything that can be done to make the health care market in general more transparent with more information on quality is very important everything that can be done to move consumers from being patients  in the full sense of the word ie patiently waiting for somebody else to make decisions for them  to being more active consumers of health care products and services by shopping around and ensuring that their capacity to choose is fully exercised if we can move in that direction that will be best for everyone what we have to beware of is systems which are run by states or by the federal government and where you have a commission or bureaucrats who decide that this drug is better than that drug for every patient in the state or in the country that simply does not work the decisionmaking power has to remain in the hands of the treating physician because different patients have different reactions to different products therefore to have a choice of potential products at the disposal of the practicing physician is very very important this being said both the physician and the patient and the payers have to have as much information as is humanly possible to gather on the cost and on the effectiveness of these products with pharmaceuticals most of the information physicians get is from detail people now we have directtoconsumer advertising this information comes from an interested party so theres an issue of credibility research on pharmaceuticals can only be funded by the pharmaceutical industry there are no public funds or private funds of other sources to really do the necessary research what gives physicians confidence in the data that they see coming from research funded by pharmaceutical companies is the names at the bottom of the article who participated in the study the fact that you have ethical review boards which review the protocols of the studies in every institution around the country when those study results are published it is usually in a peerreviewed journal therefore you have an objective expert assessment of the results all of that gives confidence to physicians as they assess those results this being said they will always use their own judgment as to directtotoconsumer advertising first of all id like to put things in perspective i think there has been a criticism of the industry that we are spending more on dtc than we do on the rest of marketing or more importantly on rd in fact in  the total expenses for directtoconsumer advertising was  billion for the whole industry versus  billion on rd i think directtoconsumer advertising has some very important public health benefits one is you can see for the majority of the products which are advertised that they deal with conditions which according to medical experts and the data available are undertreated  diseases such as depression such as diabetes such as hypertension such as high cholesterol all of these areas are today undertreated and directtoconsumer advertising helps educate patients and bring them to the doctors office the most expensive disease is the one which is not diagnosed or treated the other benefit of directtoconsumer advertising from a public health standpoint is that according to surveys of both physicians and patients one out of five approximately says that to see the advertisement helps that patient remember to take his or her medication noncompliance is a very very serious issue if you look at statins for example the products for high cholesterol after two years of treatment more than half the patients do not comply with the treatment they are not taking their medications as prescribed for antidepressants we have seen studies that patients who have been prescribed an antidepressant stop taking it after four months while studies show that longerterm usage results in less relapses and less problems and therefore economic as well as clinical outcome so i see those two benefits coming from directtoconsumer advertising and we have to remember that the doctor always has the last word the doctor is the one who will prescribe or not prescribe product a or b one problem that hmos and states find is that doctors are poorly informed about drugs some states are looking at headtohead comparisons within therapeutic classes isnt this a legitimate exercise in general i think the more information physicians have about the benefits of drugs and their cost the better they are going to be where i object is when this results in saying drug a is the only one that you can prescribe to all your patients if you prescribe drug b you have to get an approval from a bureaucrat that is where the problem arises because if you take the example of mental health products for example mental health affects the whole life of a patient as opposed to some physical ailment and the treatment of mental health involves pharmaceuticals but also … for medical psychiatry care social care if you use the wrong product or if you stop using a given product just because it happens not to be on the formulary which is approved by the state you can set that patient back several months or even years therefore it is very very dangerous to take away from the individual physician the decisionmaking power as to what is best for this or that patient and how the drug being used is integrated with the other forms of health care the idea of formularies is not very controversial health plans do it why is it different if a state does it well typically we see very very few closed formularies what we have is tiered payments where for example if a generic is being used there is no copayment and if product a is being used there is a copayment of so much and product b its a copayment of another level those are techniques which are being used in the private sector but knowing that patients have the choice between plan a and plan b they can decide whether plan a is too restrictive in terms of the choices of products versus plan b in the public sector its different because its not the patients own money exactly so in the public sector whats wrong with the state using its money in the most wise efficient way possible oregon  while lipitor lowers cholesterol there is no evidence it reduces heart attacks so they prefer the other drugs whats wrong with that again i think what formularies in general do is ignore the individual differences between individual patients again different patients react differently to different drugs … physicians should have the final word as to which product should be used based on the needs of each individual patient but make all that information available to physicians rather than have a commission or bureaucrats decide whats good for everyone this would incentivize pharmaceutical companies to do this kind of postmarket research there is absolutely no question that pharmaceutical companies should do everything in their power to understand the benefits and the disadvantages of the drugs that they put on the market a lot of this research occurs before the launch a lot of it needs to occur after the launch as we learn more in practice about those drugs so im totally in favor of pursuing more clinical research if incentives can exist to do that thats fine i dont see what the states are supposed to do if youre against price limitations quality is the only way they can go they have to use an evidencebased approach they dont have any other sources of money all they can do is throw people off medicaid what else would a state governor do i think if i were a state governor i would not focus exclusively on something which represents  percent of my total expenditures i would really look at what are the other things i can do with the other  percent i would also look at the  percent of course but i would try to make sure that whatever i do with that  percent will not hurt the other  percent and what are the many things that can be done with the  percent again simple case management can improve costs and outcome tremendously improvement in malpractice laws can improve the costs tremendously for example we estimate that  percent of all lab tests performed in this country are either duplicative or unnecessary i would deploy information technology better in order to avoid a lot of this paperwork which represents a very high percentage of the total cost id do all of this without putting in danger this very fragile balance that we have in this country  of continuing to foster innovation with pharmaceuticals  which again offer tremendous hope in terms of bringing to patients products which will not only cure and treat diseases for which we have no solution today and also with the advent of the genomics revolution and new technologies in pharmaceutical rd it will enable us to predict and prevent a lot of diseases so we have to keep that very delicate balance between making sure that we spend whats affordable and that we continue to bear the fruit of the medical revolution which is underway some state governors have said why couldnt the pharmaceutical industry be a partner with us in solving what is a real problem why do they have to lobby and block and block why not work together more we are trying very very hard at lilly we have created an organization bg business to government and are working very hard with each of the various states in trying to find solutions which are winwin in the case of colorado we have a pilot program going on with diabetes in the case of arkansas we have also a pilot program i hope that this will spread and that we will help states master their medicaid expenses while not taking measures which can really emasculate innovation in pharmaceuticals is this a critical time for this industry this is a very challenging time for the industry we have on one hand trends of aging populations more information available to people which makes them want access to innovation we have a pharmaceutical and medical biomedical revolution which opens up all kinds of new opportunities for treatments and cures for diseases for which we have no solution today from alzheimers to stroke to cancer to aids and so on on the other hand we have payers both public and private who are concerned about increasing health care costs again i think that looking at health care as an investment an expenditure which brings benefits to society rather than as something which needs to be curtailed is something which will be very important for the future i believe that over the next one or two decades we will see a reversal of the trend towards earlier and earlier retirement i think people will stay active longer maybe not fully active but active nonetheless therefore good health care which has enabled people now to really become very vital and vibrant at age   and   those advances in health care will allow us to have people remain productive longer and that will be good for the growth of our economy is there a limit to the amount of innovation we can have given that we have so many people without access to vaccinations or antibiotics this is a choice that we would have to make as a society obviously but if you talk to any patient with alzheimers or rather their children or dear ones and ask them should we suppress research into alzheimers and not have the hope for that patient to have a cure one day i think the answer would be clear   home  introduction  analysis  interviews  frequently asked questions discussion  battlefield in the states  producers chat tapes  transcripts  press

and diabetes drugs the company also made antibiotics growth hormones antiulcer agents and cardiovascular therapies as well as animalhealth products as ceo of eli lilly beginning in  sidney taurel placed a heavy emphasis on research and development helping the company to establish one of the most promising pipelines in the industry his other primary contributions as ceo were turning eli lilly into a strong business partner and attracting and retaining top executives in the pharmaceutical industry an international executive for a global age born in casablanca morocco taurel lived and worked in the farthest corners of the world he spoke french english sidney taurel apwide world photos  portuguese and spanish and was married to a native of brazil taurel proposed to his wife in heidelberg germany they became officially engaged in casablanca legalized their union in a civil ceremony in columbus ohio and took part in a religious service in paris taurel noted in pharmaceutical executive  home has always been wherever i am living at the moment march   after obtaining his mba in  taurel by then a seasoned world traveler found himself in an unlikely place indiana he told indiana business magazine that he remembered having no particular desire to work in the pharmaceutical industry i came to indianapolis for an interview out of curiosity june   taurel joined the lilly subsidiary eli lilly international corporation in  as a marketing associate and was named marketingplans manager for the brazilian affiliate the following year he held various international sales and marketing positions over a year world tour the highlights of which included helping to engineer turnarounds of lillys operations in brazil and also in europe taurel returned to company headquarters in  as the president of eli lilly international under his watch the international divisions annual sales rose from  million to  billion and international sales increased from  percent of the parent companys overall sales to  percent the talent war taurel expressed an acute awareness of the difficulty of recruiting and retaining the industrys best and brightest he was a proponent of several aggressive humanresources initiatives according to pharmaceutical executive  as president of lilly international taurel started a program to globalize the company and tap all talent wherever it comes from march   the initiative was a success by  half of the senior executives working at lillys corporate headquarters were foreignborn those executives were treated with great reverence—taurel even helped found the international school of indiana in lillys home town so that the children of lilly employees and other members of the community could receive a bilingual education diagnosis unclear for a postprozac company taurel became ceo in july  and chairman on january   despite a track record of consistently profitable performance success in his newest role would not be a foregone conclusion in  patents on prozac which accounted for nearly onethird of lillys  sales would expire taurel estimated that generic versions of the drug would cause prozacs sales to drop by about  percent his strategy for surviving the blow included identifying more promising drugs in lillys labs that could be quickly brought to market and establishing partnerships with other companies regarding the latter approach taurel created an office of alliance management which analyzed best practices in working with partners the team of lilly executives assessed the competition as well as companies outside the industry surveyed prospective partners for their evaluations of lilly and suggested ways to make the company more partner friendly keeping lilly independent noticeably absent from taurels strategy—particularly during the era that saw the unions of pharmacia and pfizer and of sandoz and cibageigy—was the possibility of a merger while noting that no other pharmaceutical company had emerged from a similarly devastating topofthelinedrug expiration without being forced to merge taurel believed that his company would be the exception he told businessweek  we really want to write the book on how to do it differently  the year prozac would expire has brought a sense of urgency to everything were doing may   lillys surviving independently would require rapid innovation taurel was undaunted by the task he set for himself he said in pharmaceutical executive  if you look at all the mergers and acquisitions that have occurred they have been driven by a lack of innovation in the companies—either a big patent expiration or not enough in the pipeline to produce growth that meets investors expectations because we are a very fragmented industry a merger provides an opportunity to rationalize reduce expenses and boost earnings in the short term but so far nobody has shown that you can put two research organizations together and make them more productive march   a strong product pipeline taurels focus on rd and innovation was illustrated by lillys possession of one of the most promising pipelines in the pharmaceutical industry—on which lilly spent more money than did any other such company at one point lilly offered a total of eight new products in a mere twoandahalfyear period in november  the fda approved xigris drotrecogin alfa which was projected to be a  billion blockbuster drug for the treatment of septic infections caused by chemotherapy xigris would be the first biotechnology treatment for the most serious stages of sepsis in  the company launched the first products to spur bone growth in patients with osteoporosis lilly also launched cialis which treated erectile dysfunction and allegedly worked faster than viagra and strattera the first nonstimulant for patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in  lilly got approval for alimta the first product for mesothelioma a rare form of cancer as well as for symbyax a combination of prozac and zyprexa which would be the first product indicated for the treatment of bipolar depression the company was preparing to launch cymbalta an antidepressant and was waiting for approval of the first product to treat stressrelated urinary incontinence taurel remarked in pharmaceutical executive  i want to make sure we continue to invest very strongly in rd and that we maintain a good balance between science and marketing this is one of lillys key strengths that i want to preserve and nurture march   see also entry on eli lilly and company in international directory of company histories  sources for further

taurel september   at  am edt sorry the video for this story has expired but you can still read the transcript below  email susan dentzer let’s go back for a moment to  when prozac comes on the market in the united states what did the company think it had on its hands at that time sidney taurel we thought we had an innovative drug but we did not realize what its potential really would turn out to be we had no idea at the time we did not even have a fulltime psychiatrist on board at eli lilly so things have changed a lot since  susan dentzer you didn’t have a fulltime psychiatrist on board sidney taurel correct susan dentzer and still managed to come up with this drug sidney taurel yes susan dentzer luck laughter susan dentzer dumb luck sidney taurel well we had–we had some excellent scientists in the discovery area and the clinical development was done by a clinical pharmacologist rather than by a psychiatrist and so we learned to–there were some mistakes made at the beginning of the development of the drug in terms of how to best get a drug like this to the market and it took longer than one would have expected the approval by the fda took four years susan dentzer was there a full understanding that as an ssri this really was going to bring a new dimension to the treatment of depression sidney taurel not a strong understanding of that it became very clear once the product hit the market and we started to get all of these wonderful stories from patients whose lives were being completely transformed by prozac susan dentzer and this quick–very quickly became almost a cultural phenomenon sidney taurel uhhuh susan dentzer did you expect that sidney taurel no we did not it went way beyond our expectations i think we–we knew by by the early ’s that we had a fantastic product on our hands it was really revolutionizing the treatment of depression what we tried to do is to also help people understand depression help people seek treatment because in those days only  or  percent of the patients with depression would ever seek treatment and also many general practitioners primary care physicians would treat some of the symptoms of depression the sleeplessness the headaches or what have you without treating the syndrome without making the clear diagnosis so we were very involved as a company to make sure that psychiatrists would talk to their colleagues in general practice to help them understand what the symptoms of depression are we also worked a lot with patient association groups to ensure that they would talk to patients and get people to understand really the nature of this of this illness that is really like a physical illness and not a weakness and that was actually the theme of the campaign that we had with the patient association groups depression is an illness not a weakness and i think all of that contributed to the tremendous impact that that prozac has in destigmatizing depression and i think even beyond that it has had a tremendous impact in destigmatizing mental health in general susan dentzer one executive i believe an executive of lilly was quoted in a business week article as saying “no company has ever survived a patent expiration of this type” in terms of the magnitude of the product and its contribution to profitability and the impact following patent expiration do you think lilly is going to survive this sidney taurel yes i think the second part of that assertion–the statement was “and lilly will be the first one” we believe you know the way we have made history with prozac we will again make history by not only weathering the storm created by the prozac patent expiration but also emerging out of that as the growth pharmaceutical company of this decade i truly believe that between the five products that we launched in the last five years and the ten products that we are expecting to launch in the next three years lilly will be able to come out in  and beyond as the fastest growing company in our industry susan dentzer i’d like to just go over some of the other prozac issues many of which i know have been largely laid to rest but they still remain in people’s minds– obviously less an issue now for this company now that–it’s more an issue now for the generic manufacturers the allegations about overuse of prozac which in fact some people have become quite worried about as internists in general family care providers also became active subscribers of it what is lilly’s sense of whether there was in fact lots of overuse of prozac and lots of prescribing of prozac for people for whom it was inappropriate sidney taurel we don’t have a lot of evidence that there has been a lot of that i think there is certainly some but you can make an even stronger case that a lot of people are still not diagnosed and treated properly for their depression at this stage i think the estimate is about  to  percent of people who have depression are being diagnosed and treated so that leaves another  to  percent of the people who are yet–who are not yet being treated susan dentzer we’ll come back to that in a moment but i want to ask you the allegations that the drug prozac did produce some increase in suicidality among a certain group of patients what is the company’s bottomline belief about that sidney taurel our bottomline belief is that prozac has saved millions of lives suicide is unfortunately a manifestation of depression and no antidepressant works on percent of the patients so there are some patients on whom the product and other antidepressants don’t work and who end up committing suicide but on twothirds of the patients the product works and that avoids a lot of suicides susan dentzer some people have raised a concern about the longterm use of fluoxetine that there–and have pointed out that one of the ironic sort of anomalies of the product now becoming a generic is that nobody really has a vested interest now in terms of a drug company in studying the longterm use and nobody probably has the resources of one of the major manufacturers now to devote to a large clinical trial about longterm use do you think that’s an issue sidney taurel well i think what we are doing is taking all of the learning that we’ve had from all of those years of experience with prozac and applying this as we do more research on improvement and duloxetine is the first product of that susan dentzer but is there adequate knowledge about the longterm use of fluoxetine sidney taurel i believe you have so many thousands of psychiatrists and primary care physicians out there who have had years of experience with a drug so many patients have been on it for many many years that i think we know as much about this product as we know about just about any other product you know in the market susan dentzer and there’s nothing so far to suggest that there’s anything different by virtue of the safety profile of longterm use versus a much shorterrange use sidney taurel not to my knowledge no susan dentzer we saw the poster coming up the stairs and you mentioned also the slogan how does it go “we made history with prozac–“ sidney taurel “–history with prozac let’s do it again” susan dentzer why is it important to have that kind of a slogan now for this company sidney taurel well clearly our organization is facing the biggest challenge in the company’s history when you have a product representing more than  percent of your sales go down fairly precipitously as we can expect in the next  months that creates a major challenge for an organization so it’s very important that a great sense of urgency be created so that everyone in the organization is focused on on delivering results and delivering results for us means growing the five new products that we launched recently and making sure that every product in our pipeline has been launched successfully share on facebook share on twitter share via text are you aware of our
