daptomycin cambridge mass nov  prnewswire  cubist pharmaceuticals inc nasdaq cbst and emisphere technologies inc nasdaq emis today announced a research and development collaboration to utilize emispheres oral drug delivery technology for cubists latestage development product cidecin daptomycin for injection and other lipopeptides this agreement follows successful completion of proofofprinciple feasibility studies using emisphere carrier molecules and daptomycin cidecin is the first in a new class of antibiotics that has demonstrated rapid bactericidal activity against a wide range of grampositive bacteria including strains resistant to current therapies multiple global phase iii edge evaluation of daptomycin in grampositive entities trials are currently underway investigating cidecins efficacy in the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections edgesst communityacquired pneumonia edgecap and complicated urinary tract infection edgeuti cidecin is also involved in two openlabel phase ii studiesone for the treatment of bacteremia and another for the treatment of bacterial infections including endocarditis osteomyelitis complicated uti intraabdominal infection and pneumonia in patients who are resistant refractory or contraindicated rrc to other therapies scott m rocklage phd chairman president and ceo of cubist commented this collaboration is the first of what we hope will be a series of announcements realizing cubists new initiative to expand our antiinfective portfolio initially focusing on oral formulations of our lead molecule daptomycin we are extremely encouraged to have achieved the desired therapeutic effect in an infected animal model we are hopeful that together cubist and emisphere will be able to provide cidecin to the medical community in both oral and iv formulations we are delighted to add cubist to our growing list of biotechnology and pharmaceutical partners said dr michael m goldberg emispheres chairman and chief executive officer due to daptomycins inherent low oral bioavailability we are particularly pleased to have identified carrier molecules capable of facilitating transport of the drug across the intestinal lining we believe the success to date here further demonstrates the robustness of emispheres oral drug delivery technology and we anticipate being able to assist with additional programs utilizing other lipopeptide antibiotics from cubist further the ability to treat infectious disease patients with cidecin on an outpatient basis could be an important contributor to a reduction in healthcare costs under the terms of the agreement emisphere could receive fees research funding and milestone payments totaling  million should a product be successfully commercialized emisphere would also receive a royalty on sales of any product resulting from the collaboration while cubist would be responsible for drug development and would receive exclusive worldwide commercialization rights to any oral products cubist pharmaceuticals is focused on becoming a global leader in the research development and commercialization of novel antimicrobial drugs to combat serious and lifethreatening bacterial and fungal infections cubist is evaluating the safety and efficacy of cidecin daptomycin for injection in the edge evaluation of daptomycin in grampositive
