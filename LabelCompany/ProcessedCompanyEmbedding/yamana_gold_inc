one gleaming gold miner glimmers a lot more than the other scott levine tmfproudmonkey jun   at pm the price of gold has fallen  through june and it may very well continue its retreat following the federal reserves midjune announcement that its raising its benchmark interest rate to a range of  to  by the end of the year with gold mining stocks likely to also fall now is a good time to see where the opportunities lie so lets consider two leading gold miners yamana gold nyseauy and agnico eagle mines nyseaem to see which one offers the more compelling argument for investment a round of introductions headquartered in canada yamana maintains a portfolio of assets strictly located in the americas similarly agnico also has a strong presence in the americas but it also operates overseas one goldproducing mine in finland and several projects in the exploration phase scattered throughout scandinavia image source getty images the most decisive factors though transcend cursory looks at the companies assets so lets compare them on some important metrics to gain better insight company  market cap fy  revenue  fy  earningspper share  fy  operating margin  fy  return on equity  yamana gold  billion  billion     agnico eagle   billion  billion     data source morningstar a brief look suggests agnico eagle is more lustrous but lets see what we find when we dig in further a tale of two miners reporting gold production of  million ounces in fiscal  agnico eagles higher revenue for the year is unsurprising since yamana produced only  million ounces more importantly though is how the companies have fared over the past several years auy revenue annual data by ycharts from two different perspectives agnico eagle appears more desirable unlike yamana  which has reported declining sales  agnico eagle has improved its top line at at a steady clip and it has reported even greater ebitda growth yamana however has reported negative ebitda in each of the past three years the companies margins provide another reason agnico eagle is more attractive although it forecasts allin sustaining costs aisc between  and  per gold ounce for fiscal   higher than the  it reported in fiscal   it wouldnt be surprising if the company performs better as it has beaten its guidance in each of the past three years conversely yamana reported aisc on a coproduct basis of  per gold ounce in fiscal   far worse than its guidance of  in fiscal  it estimates aisc between  and  winner agnico eagle a delicate balancing act though yamana offers a less attractive income statement perhaps its balance sheet will give agnico eagle a run for its money company debttoequity quick ratio yamana   agnico eagle   data sourcemorningstar again agnico eagle shimmers more brightly than yamana this time in terms of liquidity according to its quick ratio agnico eagle retains  times the amount of liquid assets  cash cash equivalents marketable securities and shortterm investments  as it does immediate liabilities suggesting that its better suited than yamana to withstand a fast downturn in the price of gold agnico eagles conservative approach to leverage further illustrates its enviable position relative to yamana whereas agnico eagle reported a net debttoebitda ratio of  at the end of fiscal  according to morningstar yamana ended the same year with  billion in net debt and negative ebitda yamana sought to strengthen its balance sheet in  by divesting noncore assets ernesto pauapique and mercedes attempting to optimize its portfolio yamanas management has identified a longterm goal of achieving a net debttoebitda ratio below  unlike its peer agnico eagle hasnt resorted to divesting its assets in fact it sought to improve its portfolio by acquiring osisko mining in  yamana however doesnt intend to seek acquisitions in the immediate future relying instead on organic growth winner agnico eagle mining the gold to generate the green finally lets compare the companies in terms of cash flow  auy cash from operations annual data by ycharts our look at yamana has revealed some sources of concern but the company deserves credit for its improved operational cash flow  something extremely helpful for the companys future success if it continues growth in its operational cash flow it may be less reliant on assuming more debt in fact it may be able to extend its debtreduction initiative beyond the  million reduction it has reported since the end of  although yamana deserves kudos for its operational cashflow growth agnico eagle wins in terms of free cash flow reporting positive free cash flow in four out of the past five years by the same measure yamana has only reported a positive amount twice much of yamanas capital expenditure relates to the construction of cerro moro which is expected to emerge as a core mine after it commences production in  like yamana agnico eagle is also committed to organic growth of its portfolio illustrated by the development of the meliadine mine this among other projects will result in negative free cash flow over the next two years according to management however it expects to be free cash flow positive again in  in light of agnico eagles  return on invested capital at the end of fiscal  compared with yamanas negative i have more faith in agnico eagles capex spending than that of yamana winner agnico eagle and the winner is which gold miner offers the more compelling argument for investment undoubtedly its agnico eagle although yamanas price tag seems more attractive  it trades at  times trailing sales compared with agnico eagles   its not enough to compensate for the numerous ways in which agnico eagle outshines yamana  scott levine has no position in any stocks mentioned the motley fool has

agnico eagle looks operationally stronger yamana gold is trading cheaper so which one should you buy neha chamaria nehams mar   at pm all that glitters is not gold or so appears to be the case with some gold stocks right now while players across the gold industry have taken a beating in recent months agnico eagle mines nyseaem and yamana gold inc nyseauy have been hit particularly hard theyre down nearly  and  respectively in the past six months compare that to the relative resilience that larger gold miners like barrick gold nyseabx and goldcorp inc nysegg have displayed and youre bound to wonder whether theres trouble brewing at agnico and yamana aem data by ycharts if you ask me i think the big price drops in both stocks offer a great opportunity for precious metal investors but how do agnico and yamana stack up and which one should you buy its a tough match as you shall soon see but one stock looks particularly compelling right now based on three key aspects  aisc agnico leads gold prices aside two other factors drive a gold miners profits production and costs while production can differ considerably depending on the size and scale of a miner costs are where things get really interesting because in a volatile industry like precious metals low costs can prove to be one of the strongest competitive advantages image source getty images gold miners use allin sustaining cost or aisc to measure costs which is a comprehensive metric that includes nearly every element of operating expenses from a cost standpoint agnico had a strong  as it beat its own target and ended the year with aisc of only about  per ounce substantially lower than yamanas  aisc of  an ounce its worth noting though that yamana reports aisc on a coproduct basis or before deducting byproduct metal revenues from production costs agnicos coproduct aisc was  per ounce last year agnico is clearly more cost efficient than yamana but its investment thesis gets even stronger when you stack it against other players in the industry gold miner aisc for   per ounce agnico eagle  yamana gold  barrick gold  goldcorp  newmont mining  data source companies financials  you guessed it right agnico is among the lowestcost producers in the industry today  a status unlikely to change in  given the miners projected fullyear aisc of  an ounce versus yamanas aisc guidance of  an ounce agnico clearly wins this round  cash flows yamana makes the cut do you wonder why most miners suffer losses or barely make profits even when precious metal prices are on the rise i believe net income isnt a great metric metric to judge a miners standing thats because the nature of the mining business is such that miners periodically revalue their reserves based on spot prices which could mean big writedowns when prices are falling as exploration and development of mines becomes unviable thats not to say the mines arent valuable anymore but miners still end up with huge noncash expenditures read writedowns that make their profits look smaller than what they really are remember how barrick sent shockwaves through the industry when it announced writedowns worth  billion early last year now heres the deal barrick ended  with net profit worth only about  million but generated operating and free cash flows worth nearly  billion and  billion respectively the point im trying to drive home is that if you want to see how healthy a gold miner is focus on its cash flows instead of profits here again agnico trumps yamana in terms of growth in cash flows in recent years auy cash from operations ttm data source ycharts let me warn you that agnicos free cash flow could suffer for a year or two as it spends money on developing its meliadine and meadowbank mines in northern canada having recently reversed asset impairments on them agnico expects to start production at both mines by the third quarter of  which should push its total its production to  million ounces by  from about  million of ounces for  in contrast i expect yamanas cash flows to improve going forward as it brings its seventh mine cerro moro on line by early next year yamanas efforts to strengthen its balance sheet  it recently spun off subsidiary brio gold and hasnt ruled out the possibility of selling its stake in brio to raise cash to invest in growth and repay debt  should provide further support its a tight call but i believe yamana wins this round given its immediate cash flow potential  valuation the winner is so far its a tie so the final decision boils down to valuation my favorite valuation metrics are based on cash flow especially when it comes to mining stocks auy price to cfo per share ttm data source ycharts its a clear verdict yamana looks incredibly undervalued on a cash flow basis when you factor in the growth potential in its cash flows in coming years the stock could turn out to be a bigger winner than agnico  neha chamaria has no position in any stocks mentioned the motley

gold inc makes most of its money grab a pickax and dig in to see how yamana gold makes its green scott levine tmfproudmonkey jul   at am as volatility continues to grow thanks to the current political environment many investors are turning their focus to gold consequently now seems like a good time to get to know the industry leaders a little better for example one may assume yamana gold nyseauy earns its keep by dealing in the yellow metal however the company also deals in silver and copper whereas it reported  billion in sales for fiscal  gold sales accounted for  billion   of overall revenue  according to its annual report revenue from copper sales and silver sales were  and  respectively  this is just a glance so lets dig in deeper and learn how prominently the sale of gold plays in the companys portfolio image source getty images perusing the portfolio  of yamanas six goldproducing mines canadian malartic is the companys only operating asset in the great white north but the company certainly doesnt leave it out in the cold the mine  in which yamana holds a  interest and agnico eagle mines nyseaem holds the other   is one of the largest goldproducing mines in canada according to yamanas  annual report canadian malartic was yamanas largest goldproducing mine in fiscal  image source yamana gold and thanks to higher throughput and recovery rate the mine achieved record annual production  gold ounces for context el penon was the companys secondmost productive mine reporting  gold ounces of course how much gold is produced is relative to the expense of digging it out of the ground although management doesnt break out the earnings generated by gold for each mine one can gain some insight into the mines profitability by examining their allin sustaining costs aisc in this regard chapada located in brazil produces the highest margin in fiscal  chapada reported coproduct aisc of  per gold ounce canadian malartic generated the secondhighest margin it reported aisc of  per gold ounce chapadas superior profitability becomes even more apparent from another perspective it reported a total cost of sales per gold ounce sold of  while el penon  next lowest  reported a total cost of sales per gold ounce sold of  lastly we can gain another perspective on how yamana makes its money by extending our perspective beyond just gold taking into account all minerals produced at the mines el penon contributed the most   million  to the companys top line in fiscal  but the bottom line belongs to canadian malartic excluding noncash charges it reported a gross profit of  million a golden horizon just as the yellow stuff contributed the most to the companys earnings in  it will presumably continue to play a prominent role in the years ahead because of decreased production at el penon management expects a yearoveryear decrease in gold production in fiscal  looking farther out though management foresees growth from an estimated  ounces in  to  million ounces in  the companys growth will come primarily from the commencement of gold production at projects that are currently in development  not through acquisitions the project that plays most prominently in this outlook is cerro moro which management believes will emerge as its next cornerstone mine according to managements estimates cerro moro will produce  ounces of gold in  when it begins production moreover management expects the mine to yield gold production of  ounces in  further demonstrating its importance cerro moro is expected to be one of the companys more profitable mines averaging aisc less than  per gold ounce in  and  besides cerro moro yamana has two other projects near completion that will help the company grow its goldproduction suruca is expected to contribute approximately  ounces annually to chapadas gold production when it commences operations in  moreover gold production is expected to increase at canadian malartic when the barnat extension commences operations in  investor takeaway playing supporting roles silver and copper sales pale in comparison with how much money yamana makes from gold although canadian malartic  the companys lone operation in the country  is one of the most prominent players in its portfolio its the companies assets in brazil which contributed the most   of total revenue  in fiscal  because the company is solely relying on organic growth in the near future its important for investors to monitor the development of cerro moro once the project commences operations look for it to achieve managements estimates for gold production in  and  but more importantly confirm that the mines aisc are less than  per ounce for failure to achieve success at cerro more could greatly detract from what management foresees as a lustrous future scott levine has no position in any stocks mentioned the motley fool has no position in any of the stocks mentioned the motley fool has a disclosure policy author scott
