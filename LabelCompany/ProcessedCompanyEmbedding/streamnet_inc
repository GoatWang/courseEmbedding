streamnet what is streamnet technology streamnet technology is a solution from the ground up for real time media streaming and control over internet protocol streamnet was conceived with the notion that the internet provides a means for the consumption and distribution of rich media content to anyone anywhere in fact the streamnet context is that sources may or may not exist within the same premises as the display and speakers instead sources can come and go from a premise they can be only online or they can live in the premise scattered around a physical location or simply streamed in by demand over the ubiquitous broadband connection the underlying technology of streamnet is a fully network connected device in fact streamnet devices look like any other network connected device on a network you can look for their ip address you can browse to them you can even interrogate them like a network device to determine their status on top of this strong base that is provided by the ip network streamnet adds a number of important benefits streamnet distributes uncompressed and compressed audio and video synchronized across any number of multiple zones without any centralized control point or matrix switch additionally streamnet devices selfconfigure on the network and they can manage and assign their own ip addresses advertise their capabilities to other devices on the network and discover the capabilities of any other device on the network this enables easy provisioning and simple maintenance while providing incredible flexibility the control in the streamnet system is completely decentralized the removal of any one device source display speaker or user interface does not impact the system  the other devices simply work to build logical connections between devices in terms of the requirements for audio distribution streamnet was designed from the ground up to address these streamnet connected speaker solutions have been deployed to hundred of synchronous zones of audio in fact the limit on the number of streamnet connected devices on a network has not been reached yet additionally streamnet connected ipcspeakers scale linearly you only buy what you need to

interactions with seniorscons no definite objective and goals you can easily find priorities of today getting reverted back tomorrow no proper development model often leads to rework poor marketing thus no matter how much you work no body will use your product working on weekends without compensation this might have stopped few perks might not be ideal for people with families no

company working here can can result in some wise learning from your mistakescons very callous approach in the way they interview you they actually go to the extent of saying they didnt get time to go through the resume and all that after calling for a ff interview no need to say they are completely unprepared to ask questions and keep repeating blabbering endlessly around their preset questions notions instead of even making a slight attempt to match the requirement with skill sets lack of professionalism almost in every thing interviewers with almost no knowledge pls dont even think of depth or getting overblown by their knowledge sit across you simply beating around the bush interview ran helter skelter directionless just as they insisted they proudly insisted they are a small company with no process i agree no less and its so blatantly evidentyou will return wasting your mind and probably forming a negative perception about all small companiesadvice to managementplease learn to value timecut the crap get to the point the person you are interviewing either fits your requirement or not its as simple as that beating around the bushing is simply wasting timeshare on
