time i would like to turn the conference over to mr getz jim getz good morning and thank you for joining us today we are delighted with tristate capitals performance in the second quarter of  notably on a yearoveryear basis total assets grew organically by  loans grew organically by a record  million or nearly  with strong contributions across all channels even as our loan book nears the  billion mark we cut adverse rated credits for just  million and nonperformers to less than  million deposits grew by more than  as we match our funding needs to support loan growth net interest income grew by a record  million or nearly  noninterest primarily chartwell investment management fees represented  of total revenue total revenue grew by more than  and most importantly earnings per share grew  while these are all highlights from the last three months we do not consider the second quarter to be exceptional for tristate capital given how we execute our highly differentiated growth strategy rather these results are emblematic of how we successfully put our shareholders capital to work in diverse businesses delivering exceptional growth over the long term accordingly we have confidence in a number of milestones targeted in the years ahead for our company we believe tristate capital can and should have a billion dollar market cap in the next  months compared to more than  million today and about  million a year ago in the next  months we intend to grow organically past the milestone of  billion in bank assets we will continue to grow total deposits to fund lending with noninterestbearing deposits beginning to increase in the second half of  we intend to show meaningful noninterestbearing deposit growth in  for  we expect net interest income to increase by more than  over  we intend to complete another highly accretive investment management acquisition in the next  to  months as part of our plan to significantly expand chartwell assets under management for  we believe chartwell revenues will be in line with last years investment management fees as evidenced by our performance this year tristate capital continues to achieve critical mass with our infrastructure resources and capabilities which we have built to support a financial institution with banking and investment management business multiple times larger than we have in place today today we are showing even more of the benefits of our operating leverage illustrated by the  basis point reduction in tristate capital banks efficiency ratio over the last year to  in the second quarter of  right in line with our targeted efficiency ratio range of the midtohigh s on a consolidated basis second quarter noninterest expenses were about  million just  of average assets annualized keep in mind this metric includes the expense of the nonbank business which is a major contributor to our top and bottom lines though not the balance sheet since  our first full calendar year after entering investment management tristate capitals annualized noninterest expense ranged from  to  of average assets this compares very favorably to the  average of bank holding companies with  billion to  billion in assets and many of those peers operate without a nonbank business as meaningful as tristate capitals the banks total assets were  billion at june th  a full  million greater than one year ago and almost double what it was four years ago after our ipo our team is very focused on both growing and diversifying our highquality loan portfolio and our efforts have been highly productive june th total loans of  billion were  million greater than a year ago our quarterly growth was impressive as well adding  million in net loans compared to the prior quarter an increase of some  private banking loans made up  of total loans as of june th with net production of more than  million since march of this year and more than  million since june of  we continue to expect to grow private banking loans by  to  for fullyear  as high net worth clients complete new applications at a record rate in the first six months of this year the number of new client applications is in line with the number completed in the entire year  and we are also well ahead of last years pace these results clearly illustrate the success of our companys unique and highly scalable business model our relationship driven team is connected to a growing national referral network through which we are able to market tristate capital bank in chartwell to even more clients this network of financial intermediaries continues to expand and totals some  firms up from  a year ago as we have demonstrated in the past we are readily able to fund a growth opportunity in both commercial and private banking for the later we believe tristate capital is the premier private bank franchise in the nation today we intend to further strengthen our unique franchise and widen the defensive moat around tristate capitals unique nonpurpose margin lending business we expect to continue the growth of the private banking loans using our strategic funding unrivaled national distribution network proprietary technology expertise and client experience our teams focus on growing regional middle market commercial business also continues to pay off as anticipated healthy commercial and industrial loan originations led to a  million increase in commercial and industrial loans in the second quarter alone taking ci balances to nearly  million at june th an increase of  from a year ago weve established welldefined niche in the middle market lending are increasing becoming a financial service partner of choice for select businesses throughout pennsylvania ohio new jersey and new york increased ma activity and our fourstate footprint also has created disruption that our team has turned into a relationship building opportunity with ci loan growth outpaced commercial rent led real estate lending as planned cre lending will remain a major piece of our middle market business commercial real estate grew by  million to  billion during the second quarter we continue to maintain our focus on inmarket projects with inmarket barrowers asset quality remained exceptionally sound even as we continued to profitably expand our loan portfolio compared to one year prior at june th  adverse rated credits declined  basis points to just  of total loans and totaled only  million nonperforming loans declined  basis points just  of total loans versus the recent average of  for  billion   billion banks nonperforming loans now totaled less than  million and nonperforming assets declined  basis points to just  of total assets versus the recent peer average of  provision expense for the second quarter was  this reflected the periods significant loan growth particularly in ci which requires higher reserve levels in private banking loans net chargeoffs for the second quarter were approximately  or  of average total loans we took a sole ci charge off during the second quarter of the million dollars a majority of which had been previously reserved as i highlighted earlier deposits grew  over the last year and by more than  during the second quarter promptly putting new liquidity to work in our best growing loan book todate we have already seen the funding benefits from our investments in relationship managers capabilities and distribution to expand tristate capitals treasury and liquidity management offerings as mentioned before we expect to see a greater portion of future liquidity growth coming from noninterest bearing deposits and operating account balances initially in the second half of this year but even more meaningfully into  as we work to onboard significant pipeline of new and expanded relationship opportunities that we had been building in the meantime our asset sensitive balance sheet remains well positioned to take advantage of continued interest rate increases at the end of the second quarter  of our loan portfolio and  of our securities portfolio were floating rate the bulk of our loans reset on the first of each month as you have probably seen many times our business model is designed to drive growth in net interest income dollars in the second quarter net interest margin of  was essentially flat compared to the link quarter due to the continuing shift in loan mix and the sourcing of strategic deposit relationships for the quarter net interest income dollars grew more than  to a record  million margin expansion is expected to resume in the upcoming quarter noninterest income which is largely made up chartwell investment management fees was than  million in the recent quarter or approximately  of tristate capitals total revenue while chartwell investment partners revenue was down slightly in the second quarter yearoveryear it was up more than  in the first six months of  verus the first half of last year this reflects our april  acquisition of the killen groups investment management business including the berwyn funds and our success in driving the organic growth of those highperforming products our highly accretive chartwell and killen group acquisitions have been major drivers of this companys earnings power further diversifying our sources of revenue and lowering the risk profile of the company chartwells assets under management were  billion on june th reflecting outflows of  million in the second quarter primarily from small and midcap growth equity products which youll recall we brought under new leadership last year we now have the right growth strategy team in place as demonstrated by their performance right out of the gate in late  and we believe we will soon be able to reverse the net redemptions trend with these products in addition the growth equity products command a significantly higher weighted average fee rate today than they did last year seventy two basis points for chartwells growth strategies in the second quarter  compared to just  basis points early in  this combined with the berwyns strategies acquired last year is a significant contributor to chartwells overall weighted average fee rate climbing to  basis points in the second quarter of  up from  basis points prior to the killen acquisition thats an additional  million in revenue for every billion dollars in assets under management so the new and longstanding accounts chartwell serves today are clearly stronger and more profitable than they were one year ago we are very pleased with how the business is running today chartwells inflows totaled  million in the second quarter driven by a combination of our dedicated sales and marketing efforts our distribution and perhaps most importantly highly credible investment performance against benchmarks and peers ten of  chartwell and berwyn investment disciplines beat their benchmarks on oneyear performance nine of  disciplines beat their benchmarks on threeyear performance and nine of  disciplines beat their benchmarks on fiveyear performance not surprisingly some of our top performing strategies have been some of our most productive on the business development front for example chartwells midcap value fund saw very strong net inflows of  million even as the rest of the industry saw significant outflows from domestic midcap equity strategies in the second quarter chartwells midcap value strategy is a prime beneficiary of the robust retail distribution program we put in place after acquiring a investment management business in  in addition while hybrid strategies across the industry saw billions in net redemptions in the second quarter the morningstar five star rated berwyn income fund strategy buck the trend with only nominal net outflows the conservative allocation strategy is highly attractive to clients looking for berwyn income funds uniquely successful combination of downside protection and upside exposure and as the industry enjoyed healthy gains in the bond funds in the second quarter chartwell short duration bb rated high yield fixed income strategy took full advantage of that momentum to drive net inflows of  million this strategy has been very much in demand among the new and existing accounts these three strategies are prime examples of how chartwell is offering a unique set of investment products with strong track records which are not easily replicated with passive strategies we clearly see tremendous opportunities to grow chartwell both organically and through investment management acquisitions tristate capital is well on its way to building a fortress national private banking franchise a worldclass investment management business and a regional middle market commercial bank of choice we have the tools in place a highly motivated and talented team of professionals who thrive in our relationshipfocused salesdriven culture an unparalleled distribution network and a growing base of highquality clients we remain very confident about our potential for continued success ahead before opening the call to questions and answers i first want to acknowledge an executive appointment we announced yesterday brian fetterolf who many of our shareholders already know was named chief executive officer of tristate capital bank subsidiary he has joined the board of directors of the bank and the holding company brian is a proven leader who managed many areas of our business since he joined our organization eight years ago most recently since becoming president

of the bank brain will be responsible for all aspects of the strategy execution and performance of the subsidiary his leadership experience and commitment to tristate capital will be a great benefit to our company and its shareholders as our company continues to execute its growth strategy that concludes my prepared remarks ill now ask vice chairman and cfo mark sullivan to join me for questions and answers operator please open the line for questions questionandanswer session operator we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions the first question comes from michael perito of kbw please go ahead michael perito hi good morning jim and mark jim getz good morning michael michael perito couple of questions maybe ill start with mark on the margin i appreciate the commentary jim about kind of what you guys are expecting going forward but maybe if we could just dial in on the current quarter from in here what do you guys expect i mean it seems like noninterestbearing deposit growth is expected to pick up which will help the overall kind of cost of deposit in terms of the increase but it looked liked some of the other interestbearing accounts saw some fairly sizable increases quarteroverquarter what are you guys seeing in the marketplace today in terms of pricing on your interestingbearing deposit instruments and what are the expectations of that going forward mark sullivan yes good morning mike mike the asset sensitivity we have can be used to drive margin expansion it could it also be used to secure deposits in a quarter where we want to achieve that type of deposit growth our key focus is keeping the nii strong on a yeartoyear basis our nii is up  and  for the linked quarter having said that looking forward to q we expect margin expansion similar to what you saw in q so we continue to see the increase in net interest income  to  range for the fullyear michael perito okay but i guess as it relates specifically to kind of what youre seeing in the marketplace on some of the pricing on your interestbearing deposits i mean is there increasing demand from some of commercial clients and of some of your other deposittype consumers for higher rate i mean is that something that you guys think youre going to have to continue to battle here or was there something unique in the quarter or do you expect it to kind of be choppy i guess therell be some quarters where its up more than last im just trying to get a sense of what the trajectory of those costs will be mark sullivan yes i mean we feel we addressed that in the current quarter and that well be able to maintain the deposit base with more discipline if you will and as we go into q so we dont expect to see the increase in cost of funds q that we saw in q jim getz this is jim mike what you want to keep in mind is that the asset base of this company has been growing pretty handily over the past many years and as youre well aware this is not the first call that weve had that weve discussed net interest margin and if you look at the history f our net interest margin just look at it quarterly nim compared to same quarter one year prior if you look over has been compressed or flat since the ipo year  just think of that quartertoquarter compressed or flat since the ipo year but if you look at it on a linked quarter basis nim has expanded only six quarters since the ipo for our company yet if you look at the earnings per share the eps has delivered growth in  quarters yearoveryear since the ipo and  of those quarters were double or tripledigit numbers and we believe the eps is the value creation for the shareholder and as you know were investing strongly in the future yet providing highly attractive doubledigit eps growth on a relatively consistent basis and i think what you want to keep in mind here if you even look at the consensus numbers that the analysts have provided us with were looking at a consensus of about a   plus jump this year in eps and over a  jump next year and this management team has not challenged that number so i think you have to put this in perspective as a company and recognize where the focus is now to answer your question very directly we have had very meaningful deposit growth while a lot in the industry have not had that in the near term and much of our deposit growth in the last quarter was back loaded so it did have an impact on the rates that we were paying during the second quarter you didnt see the full impact in the first quarter but that is one of the reasons why we feel very strongly that were going to have a robust third quarter but keep in mind the real focus here is net interest income at the end of the day and our nii over the past year has grown by  and if you look at the entire industry its been singledigit numbers michael perito got it yes and you guys know i appreciate that im just trying to get some color on some of the deposit stuff and then maybe following up my second mark on the expenses maybe a high level question you know the expense front was pretty good in the quarter obviously you guys are a highgrowth company but it does seem like you have a lot of scale in place i mean any thoughts on kind of what you expect over the next  months in terms of the expense run rate mark sullivan yes mike i would say the  similar to last quarters comments about the run rate were really comfortable with the consensus estimate for the year even though the first half has been somewhat favorably impacted but i think  million is a good quarterly run rate for the second half of the year and probably percentage ramp up as we go into  i can address that better later in the year but for the second half of the year i think the run rate of  probably takes us to consensus for the year jim getz and mike we dont want you to think we dont love you we realize this question was on everyones mind so we were prepared to answer it michael perito i was shocked operator the next question comes from matt olney of stephens please go ahead matt olney hi thanks good morning guys jim getz good morning matt olney in the prepared remarks i believe jim you mentioned that  of the loan portfolio was going to be variable so im curious how the execution of the repricing of these loans has been over the last few months whats been the level of pushback within each of your three categories mark sullivan weve had no level of pushback whatsoever i guess by pushback are you meaning that weve seen a decline in what we can get for a loan or the pricing matt olney yes exactly and then i guess specifically in the private banking loans i mean its somewhat of a newer segment over the last several years… mark sullivan actually to be quite honest with you that book of business has been quite stable since inception except theres an aspect of it and i think we may have talked about it before where youre seeing a lot of these large wirehouses groups of their folks are moving to the registered investment advisors and setting up their own shop and the wirehouses have had some advantages of having some offshore facilities they provided their high net worth clients to and weve been responding to our client base as people are transitioning by helping them for a period of time bring those clients over with the idea that the rate would increase at first than them coming over maybe a yearandahalf or so later but youre really looking at this book of business being around  over day libor and if you look at what the yield of it its close to  counting the legacy loans that we have in place the private banking portfolio is about  matt olney got it okay thanks for the color and then as a followup i wanted to ask you about overall capital levels and because of the impressive loan growth weve seen capital ratios move down the last few quarters im curious how much cushion do you think you have on capital what do you view as a concerning capital ratio mark sullivan matt id say its really consistent with the past that the loan growth a lot of it majority being private banking gives us some real elbowroom on capital and with the earnings increase as we go forward really dont see that much pressure on our capital as we go forward its really going to be an acquisition with intangible and asset management acquisition thats going to cause us to look at capital and make a determination but absent an acquisition forward runway well into  matt olney okay thanks mark ill hop back in the queue operator the next question comes from russell gunther of da davidson please go ahead russell gunther hi good morning guys jim getz good morning russell russell gunther appreciate the color on loan growth in the prepared remarks its really nice to see ci really turn the corner here if you could just give us some color where the growth came from both geographically and kind of from a customer sector perspective jim getz it came broadly from all of our locations our five locations we particularly picked up a meaningful amount of business in philadelphia region and as youre probably aware theres been a lot of disruption there with susquehanna and nat penn acquired by bbt so philadelphia has sort of led the charge but everyone fully participated and keep in mind weve been indicating for the past two quarters this would be coming and this is a result of an investment that we made twoandahalf years ago in brining people onboard that were purely focused on direct ci activity and if you really do a deep dive on the ci loans you discover that our average size loan has dropped handily because were doing essentially sole bank deals at this time in some volume russell gunther i appreciate that and then second question unrelated you mentioned expectations for chartwell and appreciate the color on the strategy there i think youre rough guidance calls for a modest pickup in related revenue in the back half of this year but absent an accretive acquisition in that space could you talk a little about what the organic revenue opportunity there would be in  based on some of those strategies you laid out earlier jim getz yes if you  and unfortunately we had the issue from a flow standpoint of november of  loosing the vanguard account on the gross side and our performance as we indicated to everyone was in fact subpar and youve seen the flows coming out of the growth strategy that both the midend and the small cap this year we believe that that is now stabilized we believe the current manager there has done a very credible job since hes been with us since october of last year and he has a very good team backing him up as youre probably aware in this business itd probably take you from the time you recognize your issues till you get it corrected and that disciple itll probably take  months so were well into the first year of the recovery before youre going to see some meaningful uptick but in the interim we couldnt be more pleased with the quality investment performance of the remainder of the franchise i went over the numbers with you were seeing meaningful flows into the mid cap value product weve gotten them on some good platforms were getting a little bit of response also from the institutional clients which you dont normally see and were really carved out a niche product that andy toburen runs at chartwell this shortduration high yield that were consistently seeing good strong as i illustrated in my comments flows into that and we reaffirmed in my comments that we fully expect the company will produce the level of revenue it did in  and keep in mind this is after loosing almost  billion technical difficulty operator operator instructions the next question comes from matt schultheis of boenning  scattergood please go ahead matt schultheis good morning jim getz good morning matt matt schultheis quick question on the tax credit you took in the quarter if you could just add any color of where that came from what that looks like and if we could expect to see that in the future jim getz yes matt good morning the credits if you look at the first quarter we were in the low s we had not secured the credits at that time and couldnt recognize them similar to prior years we had both housing and alternative energy credits that we secured in the second quarter and thats  it was our appetite if you will for this year so the quarter expense was  that was also a pickup from the higher rate through one so a goforward  is the effective rate were looking at this year matt schultheis and could you add any color regarding riskadjusted loan pricing in the ci markets is it matching your expectations is it getting worse as more banks continue to shift from cre into ci so any color you could add there would be appreciated jim getz at the moment matt we havent seen any change whatsoever its consistent with prior quarters so we dont see any movement upward at this point other than obviously libor has changed somewhat so the return is reflected in the nii youre seeing but otherwise were not seeing much pressure at all either way matt schultheis okay thank you operator the next question is from bryce rowe of baird please go ahead bryce rowe thank you jim and mark just wanted to maybe try to get some color around the compared remarks around noninterestbearing growth in the back half noninterestbearing deposit growth in the back half of this year and into  are there any specific goals that you have internally jim getz if you take a look at our balance sheet you are going to see that our noninterest bearing deposits are minuscule they are less than  on the balance sheet and probably in retrospect we should have focused more on treasury management a few years ago and we didnt and so about  months ago we recognized the need to build up a major franchise in this area so in fact we began making commitments and weve spent at this point several million dollars on personnel weve just implemented and put in place in onboarding clients with a very sophisticated updated system in this regard so we fully expect to double our noninterest bearing deposits by the end of next year and move this along very rapidly and this business also brings in lower interestbearing deposit so itll be in the range of about something thats somewhat over  million by the end of next year and we are beginning to see some real progress the average balances in our operating accounts in the second quarter is  we are around  million and today they are pushing on  million so its increase of about  we are dealing with that lower number so the percentages look good but we are really focused on growing that as we grow this franchise and to reduce the expense  the interest expense in a meaningful manner over the next couple of years and this is also one of the best times to be doing this because there is a lot of turmoil in the marketplace around treasury management particularly with the larger banks because they have been flushed with cash the deposits arent as attractive to them any longer thus what they are doing is increasing  converting it from a funding mechanism to noninterest income and raising the fees pretty handedly to the clients and so obviously were focused on the deposits complemented with the noninterest income so we have a real opportunity here we have a strong pipeline and i am just giving you some very practical numbers but  that you can count on but we are confident this is a multibillion dollar business we are going to be involved in bryce rowe great thats helpful jim and wanted to followup to one of mikes questions about interestbearing deposit cost mark just to be clear so in the back half of this year maybe even in the third quarter we shouldnt expect to see much of an increase in terms of funding cost mark sullivan yes i mean i think thats fair there will be an increase but not to the degree that you saw in q bryce rowe right thank you operator the next question is a followup from matt olney of stephens please go ahead matt olney hi thanks just one followup at the investor day a few weeks ago i think you had mentioned a goal of yours was to achieve roe in the fourth quarter of  i just wanted to make sure thats still a reasonable goal in your mind jim getz yes definitely it is matt if you look back a year ago at june   our roe was  this quarter its  up over  basis points so we are still on target to  roe by q matt olney okay thats all from me thanks jim getz thank you operator and the next question is a followup from michael perito of kbw please go ahead michael perito hey thanks guys for taking followup just curious now that weve had this kind of first quarter where the ci portfolio kind of meaningfully expanded just  obviously you saw a nice growth across all three segments i think maybe last quarter jim you had some comments that you expected to see roe growth to not quite be as robust in ci and private banking but just any high level kind of thoughts moving forward about or updated thoughts rather by where you think kind of the loan mix could settle in here for over the three segments over the next  months or so jim getz yes as we have today the private banking there is nothing thats going to catch with that so youre probably looking at that to be at the end of the year it could be as much as  of the loan portfolio up about  from where it is at this point and the reason that i say that mike is that if you look at this company historically private bankings weakest period of time was the first half of the year okay historically since we have been really working on this so we expect to have a more robust second half of the year and to you an illustration of how strongly activity has been if you look at the  take you back to the second quarter of  we processed  applications   applications and so on secured by marketable securities this second quarter we processed    this is by far the strongest first half that weve had and that was just the second quarter numbers   and if you look at  weve done more in the first half of the year than we did in all  applications so thats going to be very strong  i would say just to finish your question were hoping to see ci in the range pushing going into the new year of about  of the loan portfolio and the rest would be in commercial real estate michael perito okay and do you think its fair  i mean i know for the last several years since the ipo its kind of always been the overtime  kind of loan growth cagr target could be little higher could be a little lower it seems like though i mean pretty confidently you guys kind of place you were for the next few years you are going to be a little higher than that do you think thats a fair statement at this point jim getz like i mentioned at the investor day that many of you were at when you put a company together from scratch like we have you are really look out no more than two years and i would say that you are probably looking at us with a  about a  loan growth rate for this year and next year michael perito okay great thanks guys jim getz if not better youre welcome operator there are no additional questions at this time this concludes our questionandanswer session i would like to turn the conference back over to mr getz for closing remarks jim getz thank

questionandanswer session please note this event is being recorded at this time i would like to turn the conference over to mr getz jim getz good morning and thank you for joining us the third quarter of  was an outstanding quarter and our best yet as a public company robust earnings growth reflected new record levels of net interest income fees and total revenue these positives continue to reflect our expanding commercial banking private banking and asset management businesses which are firing on all cylinders giving the company exceptional loan growth even better deposit growth and healthy assets under management growth this was all achieved while maintaining excellent credit quality making about  million in additional riskbased capital available to the bank and executing on our asset management acquisition strategy let me begin with a few specific highlights from the third quarter the results again showcased tristate capital’s unique risk profile and diversified financial services business model with a proven ability to consistently generate robust earnings through sustainable revenue growth we consistently increased net interest income dollars through strategic loan and deposit growth with a strong risk adjusted return that outpaces margin compression quarterend loans surpassed  billion for the first time ever totaling  billion at september  loans grew by  million or more than  over the last  months and by  billion since our  ipo exceptional organic growth in quality loans is something we’ve achieved in a low rate environment really since our bank’s inception in  in private banking loan balances grew more than  over the last year to  billion despite volatile equity markets over the last  months our private banking channel lending makes up half of all loans and demonstrates the effectiveness of our financial services distribution capability which we continue to expand at an exceptional rate our national referral network of financial intermediaries is up to  firms from  at the end of the second quarter which provides us with access to tens of thousands of independent financial advisors who can refer and recommend our financial products to our clients in addition one of our established relationships had very favorable implications for tristate capital bank’s regulatory capital position at the end of the third quarter basel iii rules recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of certain nonpurpose margin loans secured with financial collateral that is priced daily of over collateralized and liquid in the third quarter of  we completed the onboarding of loans from an established referral network member on to our proprietary system which provides daily pricing this financial intermediary is one of the nation’s largest independent broker dealers with about  million of its client private banking loans within tristate capital at quarter end the net effect is at about  million of additional regulatory capital was made available to the bank on september  accordingly our bank subsidiary’s total riskbased capital ratio increased by  basis points in the third quarter from  to  our other important lending channel regional middlemarket commercial banking delivered a strong quarter as well at september  commercial balances totaled  billion up some  from one year prior commercial real estate loans which crossed  billion mark for the first time at quarter end increased  from one year prior this growth is a product of high quality opportunities we see in the geographic markets served by tristate capital’s five regional offices the investments we’ve made to capitalize on them by growing those offices with highly experienced people and some disruption we see as a result of larger bank consolidation in those areas owner occupied commercial real estate also continues to represent more than  of our commercial real estate portfolio along side private banking commercial real estate and direct commercial loans are an important part of our  longterm annual loan growth goal to which we remain fully committed in commercial industrial lending we saw  million in payoffs and pay downs over the last  months as we continue to mange adjustments to the balance sheet payoffs and pay downs were partially offset by  million in new commercial and industrial loan originations over the last  months we continue to anticipate positive growth in our portfolio of direct ci business in the quarters ahead in fact in the most recent period we generated  million of new originations our highest this year versus  million of payoffs and paydowns as strong as our loan growth was in the last three months it was fully funded by deposits for the third consecutive quarter deposits increased by  in the third quarter and  from year ago following our investments in bankers whose mandate is specifically to gather low cost relationship driven institutional deposits through superior service industry knowledge and product sophistication asset quality also remains a strong focus at tristate capital bank a product of our credit management discipline and our strategy for driving significant portion of loan growth for marketable securities backed lending adverse rated credits declined meaningfully over the last year representing just  of total loans at the end of the third quarter  down from  one year prior our  credit to provision expense in the three months ending september  reflects declining adverse rated credits and net recoveries offset by increases specific reserves on nonperforming loans at the same our allowance for loan losses grew seven basis points during the third quarter to  of total loans nonperforming loans represented just  of total loans at the end of the third quarter down from  one year prior tristate capital’s nonperforming loans to loans is also a  basis points below the recent average for our peer index which was  for  billion to  billion asset banks our nonperforming assets at the end of the third quarter represented  of total assets unchanged from one year prior and significantly below the recent period index average of  the nonperforming asset balance did increase during the third quarter so i wanted to provide some additional details on npas for you this morning during the third quarter we received clear title to property which was placed on outperforming loans status back in  and had been charged down in  to  million the property which consist of eight parcels have been tied up in litigation for the past eight years three of the parcels had been sold by tristate capital for a total of  million and the proceeds were placed in escrow until the litigation was settled upon the favorable core resolution the escrow cash was released and applied against the loan balance the remaining five parcels were placed in oreo at a current net appraisal value of  million in the last two weeks of september while very favorable outcome was obtained it does result in a slight increase in our npas as a  million decrease in nonperforming loans as affectively been replaced with a  million increase in nonperforming assets the escrow parcels were sold above their price announced and we are confident the parcels representing  million will be sold at or above their price announced over the next  months to  months the balance of npas reflects  million of nonperforming loans of which there are six only one of the six is not paying as agreed it is an unsecured consumer loan in the books for less than  the remaining five representing  of nonperforming loans are making payments as agreed turning to chartwell investment partners our primary sources of fee income pushed noninterest income to  of total revenue in the third quarter investment management fees grew some  to more than  million in the third quarter of  compared to  million in the same period last year chartwell’s assets under management grew by nearly  to  billion over the last year with inflows and market appreciation offsetting the outflows that have been felt by the entire industry this year today as many of you in this call know well we have experienced  billion of organic growth since the chartwell acquisition in march of  the weighted average fee rate was  basis points at the end of the quarter and chartwell’s annualized revenue run rate exceeded  million up nearly  from oneyear prior and our investment management business contributed  million to net earnings in the third quarter of this year an increase of  from the third quarter of  chartwell’s established newly acquired investment strategies continue to deliver highly credible performance during the third quarter as well of chartwell’s  investment disciplines including the small and midcap value strategies launched in  ten beat their benchmarks in yeartodate performance seven beat their benchmarks on threeyear performance and eight beat their benchmarks on fiveyear performance one additional note on killen and our third quarter results as you can see from yesterdays news release we reduced previously accrued contingent earnout expenses associated with the killen transaction by some  million as we shared with you on our july conference call killen experienced significant outflows in the  months leading up to deal closing we were able to neutralize and reverse this trend by deploying our distribution and sales capabilities to probably market its proven investment strategies particularly in the fivestar rated berwyn income fund while we stop the run off the growth by  will likely not materialize the degree that we anticipated accordingly we reduced our run rate ebitda estimate which results in a  million reversal of our accrual we are also very excited about the investment management transaction we announced yesterday bringing top tech talent and critical mass in fixed income to chartwell we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire a team of six fixed income investment professionals in philadelphia and about  billion of institutional clients’ assets under management from aberdeen asset management as with our last acquisition we intend to put our powerful financial services distribution network to work with these investment professionals and their domestic fixed income strategies importantly this transaction further leverages the scalable infrastructure and administrative personnel we already have in place at chartwell today we expect to close by the first quarter of  under the terms of agreement no upfront consideration will be paid that may repeat no upfront consideration will be paid the purchase price is payable in the first quarter of  at  times revenue on actual client assets under management at the end of next year as with our last acquisition this structure protects tristate capital from any interim declining assets under management we will pay a multiple of  times run rate revenue based on assets under management as of december   that’s equivalent to about  times ebitda the value of the all cash transaction is expected to be in the range of  million to  million and we believe it compares favorably to our prior two acquisitions in this space not to mention the investment management industry multiples in general an outline of this transaction is available on our website we have known to senior managers to this fixed income team for many years and have followed their performance very closely we believe this is an accretive transaction that will benefit to all parties bringing chartwell outstanding taxable fixed income talent along with client assets and we expect to provide our newest team members with the resources and properly structured incentives that need to thrive – they need to thrive and take their business for the next level before we turn it over to questions i wanted to touch on our share repurchase program if you recall at the beginning of this year we initiated a  million program and today we’ve repurchased  shares for approximately  million at an average cost of  per share much of this balance was used for an options cancellation program which we eliminated significant overhanging on the shares fully vested options are more than one million shares granted to employees in  with the  exercise price were cancel at an average rate of  for a total of  million even with the appreciation of tristate capital shares in recent months we continue to believe that our stock remains undervalued relative to our financial performance and prospects reflecting our commitment to return value to stockholders at our regular october meeting on tuesday the board of directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing up to another  million our confidence in tristate capital’s performance and prospects continues to be reflected in our high level of insider ownership which exceeds  all of our directors have meaningful ownership positions in tristate capital stock and all of our executive officers maintain personal seven figure investments in the company closely aligned our interest with those of all our shareholders as successful as we have been to date we believe we are only beginning to realize tristate capital’s full potential as we execute our growth strategy with continued discipline and bigger that concludes my prepared remarks now i’ll ask vice chairman and chief financial officer mark sullivan as well as chartwell managing partner and chief executive officer tim riddle to join me for questions and answers operator please open the line questionandanswer session operator we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions the first question comes from michael perito of kbw please go ahead michael perito good morning jim getz good morning mike michael perito a couple questions maybe starting on the margin for mark can you maybe talk a little bit about it seems like the loan yields are getting a bit closer to where the perceivable trough might be obviously as the private banking piece grows but can you give us some color on what you guys see there and also just remind us if we do see maybe a  basis point move in the fed at year end what kind of benefit you would perceive on the netinterest income mark sullivan sure thanks mike good point and the nim it did decrease seven bips in this quarter there is a couple of observations on that on a oneyear basis the nim is down  basis points at the same time our net interest income was up  so looking at the two factors that impact nim the yield on a loan portfolio it continues as you indicated continues to have pressure because of the outside growth of the private banking portfolio the portfolio has never lost a dollar and is zero riskweighted in terms of the cost of funds on a goforward basis we do expect to see the results of our investment in our treasury management platform both the people and technology and increase deposit gathering focus jim mentioned the last three quarters deposit growth has exceeded loan growth in both at extremely beneficial rates so we may see some improvement in q but it’s really in the first half of  that the results will have an impact in terms of if we had another fed increase in december similar to december of  a  basis increase would have a very positive impact on us and if you recall the spread initially the big impact is in the first quarter and by the second’s quarter it begins to dissipate as the pressure on cost of funds but we earned about  attributable to the increase in the first quarter  additional nii with the increased loan base and so forth that should be closer to a  million for q michael perito okay thanks for that color mark and then maybe from a second question on the aberdeen transaction so obviously the considerations are going to be paid at the end of next year but in terms of the impact on capital that will hit in the first quarter correct in terms of the intangibles and the impact on capital and maybe also comment jim on just obviously you freed up some regulatory capital in the quarter but maybe in terms of your capital outlook have you had any thoughts on adding anything to the capital stack as we get out and the growth continues into  and  mark sullivan yes mike this is mark in terms of the capital and so forth the fee raised are about  right now and tangible book value we would expect that with the delusion coming on in q that by the earnings that we have in q and q that we backed to where it is today another factor when you are looking at the impacted delusion on an acquisition like this in a bank acquisition typically in fact maybe  of the purchase price and goodwill and goodwill and intangibles well as and we are looking for that to be paid back in five years or less and in asset management acquisition virtually  of the purchase price it is in goodwill and intangibles and we’d expect to recover that in our case in under five years  of the purchase price under five years on a gaap basis and under four years on a cash basis so we are not overly concerned about the shortterm impact of the dilution on tangible book value t ratios and our capital ratios continue to growth between the earnings and as jim had mentioned the increase in  million in loans were  riskweighted and now our zero riskweighted michael perito okay thanks guys mark sullivan thank you operator the next question comes from matt olney of stephens please go ahead matt olney hi thanks good morning guys jim getz good morning matt matt olney jim youve indicated that the drag on loans in the last few years has been ci it sounds like ci drag is stabilizing im curious what this inflection point means for the future loan growth are we are going to see better loan growth than weve seen over the last few years or could it just be a more balanced type of mix of future loan growth jim getz i think you’re going to see a combination of the both because it’s taken us now a couple of years to stabilize this and now we’re moving forward and i think you’re going to begin to see that proven out in the fourth quarter as you are aware with continually reinforced the  growth yet if you go over the numbers we’ve been close to  to  growth in loan outstandings and that’s what ci has been a drag so we’re very optimistic moving forward here and feel very confident in the future quarters with reference to the growth that we’re going to experience in the loan portfolio now to be ultimately positively impacted by the ci activity matt olney and then as a followup jim the private banking loan growth was a very strong in the third quarter anything specific you attribute this to and any update in the overall level of competition for this niche product jim getz well a couple of things that i would indicate to you is that we’ve had relatively over the past couple of months we’ve had a relatively stable market and when you have that you have a lot of financial advisors that will in that environment consider moving from one organization to another and many of them are moving out of the larger wire houses like the morgan stanley’s the merrill lynch’s and setting up their own shops and groups and these are top producers that have a lot of confidence in their ability to build business and so they’re going to a lot of the registered investment advisors that we’re working with and their best clients have loans and those loans have to be paid off at goldman and morgan stanley and merrill and so we’re seeing a lot of acap ph transactions occurring in the marketplace that are building a lot of froth in that business so it’s not just the standard book of businesses that we have from the trust companies in the regional brokerage firms there’s a lot of movement activity from one firm to another that we’re benefiting from matt olney and jim the second part of that was about the overall competition for that niche product jim getz it’s a nonexistent i hate to be that direct but there isn’t any type of competition of any formidable nation that we’re coming across matt olney thank you operator operator instructions the next question comes from john moran of macquarie please go ahead john moran hey good morning guys jim getz good morning tim riddle hey john john moran of course ive got my two on private bank loans also how many more of those do you have left that could qualify for favorable treatment under basil iii jim getz that you could see some additional capital coming in john moran exactly yes jim getz not enough but what i mean by that is what happens the reason is occurred and if you remember several quarters ago we alluded to this we’re very dependent on conversions with the it group at the broker dealer or the trust company or the advisor and we need their cooperation so these folks had been doing business with us for a little over  months and we were monitoring this but it wasn’t on our system and if it’s not on our system we don’t treat it accordingly so right now this was the only major party that had been accumulating over time at this point john moran got you so substantially all of them are now qualified under basel iii jim getz i wish i could tell you we had a surprise every quarter but that won’t be the case john moran okay got it mark sullivan i think that john and followup on mike’s questions too is the in terms of the capital ratios and the favorable impact here and so forth as we took out there is no need to raise capital anytime in the foreseeable future we stay well above wellcapitalized and the only caveat on that obviously if we did a major acquisition on the asset management side that would obviously change things john moran okay understood and then just as a followup on the pb side of things the pricing on that product i think last time we caught up was libor plus   has that held steady and do see anything changing there mark sullivan yes that’s remained relatively constant between  and  and just so the answered the asked the question to give everybody a sense of what we are seeing in the market in general with commercial real estate it’s running around two to three over libor and a commercial industrial running around two to  and  now obviously the portfolios themselves are yielding higher because they have some legacy loans like the ci portfolio is around  over libor and the commercial real estate portfolios around  and private banking is around little over  over libor john moran great thanks i have a got a couple more but i will jump back in thanks mark sullivan okay thank you operator the next question is from bryce rowe of baird please go ahead bryce rowe thanks good morning congratulations on the asset management deal it looks really nice jim getz good morning bryce thank you bryce rowe youre welcome jim i just had one followup to comments in the press release about the specific reserve added onto nonperforming loans can you tell me potentially what that added specific reserve was in terms of dollars jim getz yes i certainly can there were two loans and one loan was a manufacturer of a highlyengineered products used in liquid and gas separation processes serving a wide range of markets including chemical power generation waste oil and gas and our exposure in that loan is a little over – or i’d say actually about  million and the reserve to specific reserve increase was  and the other one was a designer marketer branded niche products for exercise equipment and travel accessories and gift markets and that is an exposure of about  million and we put  million against that and essentially what we did is on the real estate recovery that i alluded to we just moved that over and kept it within the loan loss reserve so it offset it bryce rowe thats helpful thats all i had thank you jim getz great thanks bryce operator your next question comes from matt schultise of benning please go ahead matt schultise hi good morning jim getz good morning matt matt schultise a couple of small questions with regard to your buying out of the options effectively does that affect your share count going forward for diluted eps mark sullivan it reduces on the fully diluted count it reduces it and the same time with the increase in the stock price in the past couple of months that puts more into play on the both vested and unvested and restricted shares so it’s coming out about a wash matt schultise okay thank you mark sullivan it’s fully diluted around  million to  million matt schultise okay and with regard to the five parcels that you mentioned earlier that are now in oreo can you share with us the general geography of those jim getz general geography in the midatlantic states were specific ohio matt schultise okay thank you mark sullivan and keep in mind that we put that – we’ve been working out that loan since  as we put it on in  and we really stayed with it and it was written down and everything and it went through all kinds of litigation and it was just two weeks ago that we got titled to it but in the interim we came up with a creative idea over the past couple years of selling off the parcels and keeping them on in escrow during the litigation and that’s what caused the cash and now we have moved it all over to oreo and thats why the increase in oreo matt schultise understood thank you mark sullivan sure operator the next question is a followup from matt olney of stephens please go ahead matt olney hey thanks just want to go back to the asset manager and ask about the flows i think there have been pretty good over – through most of this year but the flows did reverse course in q anything you can point to on the third quarter and then whats the outlook there tim riddle matt this is tim riddle we had had tremendous fortune in terms of not only new business but also net flows we had a couple of client losses in the third quarter they did in the third quarter we’ve known about them for a while but again we think those will certainly be offset by some of our fortune in being able to continue to distribute not only on the retail side but also on the institutional side we believe weve got a lot of open field ahead of us in some very strong products with good prospects in terms of their performance mark sullivan keep in mind what i alluded to in the script earlier that since march of  weve had organic growth of  billion as of  so it is fairly substantial in a market where most people have been experiencing net redemptions but we’re not happy about what happened in the quarter but in reality if you look at a longer perspective other than the quarter has been pretty positive tim riddle yes matt just one more item on that remember that’s the institutional business is very lumpy and we’ve had tremendous amount of luck longterm and good fortune and a lot of that is obviously based upon performance but it is also the quality of our institutional marketing efforts now being paired with an equally high quality retail effort so again on the institutional side it will be a little lumpy but we certainly have some things we believe that are in the queue and we would expect to see continued growth on the institutional side and perhaps even a bit of a surprise in the fourth quarter as well matt olney i understood thanks for that and also wanted to ask mark about the operating expenses i think that it was a little bit higher than we expected a few months ago and then you can point to in the third quarter and then what’s the outlook for operating expenses from here mark sullivan good point matt there were elevated cost in that quarter professional fees fdic insurance and incentive comp were a little higher incentive comp was the third quarter loan growth  million annualized thats over  million so we had to adjust based on loan growth on the incentive comp matt olney and mark any thoughts about the operating expenses from here mark sullivan i think you will see them pretty much in line with q perhaps slight increase but not to the degree – remember killen was only in the mix for two months in q and has the full three months in q so thats part of the elevation so when you go from q to q you wont see the increase that you saw q to q matt olney and then mark you have the amount of the swap fee income recognized in the third quarter mark sullivan yes the swap fees were just under a million  something thousand and that was on to q on to q and just under a million in q so about  million yeartodate compared to  million all of  and the fourth quarter pipeline continues on pace as well matt olney thank you operator the next question is a followup from john moran of macquarie please go ahead john moran hey thanks so if im doing the math right on the aberdeen assets at looks like the fee rate on those is kind of just under  basis point wondering if you could give us a split of what’s institutional versus retail there and where you think you might be able to drive that kind of as you get distribution sort of ramped up tim riddle absolutely john this is tim riddle john you are right the fee on the total aberdeen book is just under  basis points and that represents a  institutional business and we would expect john that any growth at least in the short term and any new business prospects there would be on the institutional side and longerterm we would see some potential on the retail side as well john moran okay got it and then tim and jim and mark i guess too just if you could refresh us in terms of what you guys might be looking to add in terms of product capability on the asset management side i think taxfree is still a whole and then international if there’s anything else that you guys are kind of hoped around for mark sullivan yes john the one hope and clear right in our face is the taxfree and time and i continue to pursue that aggressively and we’ve been to a lot of parties but we have nothing near term that we can indicate to you but it’s really necessary and that will pretty well fill it out we do have an interest in international that’s going to be a more of a longerterm perspective but i would say that once we make a tax exempt situation come about that in fact we will be pretty well done from the acquisition standpoint we have just have to get everything acclimated and begin to see consequential organic growth that we expect we will but it’s – we now have critical mass that’s a  billion company at this point it was  billion when we acquired it john moran yes and it has been a good string of deals here thanks very much mark sullivan thank you operator this concludes our questionandanswer session i would like to turn the conference back over to mr getz for any closing remarks jim getz thank you
