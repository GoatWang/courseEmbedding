applicationsthis application claims priority to and the benefit of us provisional application no  filed aug   which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entiretyfield of the present disclosureaspects of the present disclosure relate generally to systems and methods of analyzing tags associated with a sequence of images presented to a user to guide a user to a current interestbackgroundthere exist a multitude of applications both internetbased applications and smartphonetabletbased applications that make recommendations for users based on analyzing a users history a users history can include or reflect for example choices the user previously made based on the users preferences although a users preferences can be constant as a whole over a long period of time the generality of the preferences allow for a users current specific preference to be less defined for example users preferences with respect to food are fairly constant a user may prefer for example italian food and chinese food a history of the users food preferences captures this general information and may allow applications to provide a generalized recommendation for what a user may want now or in the future however a users current preferences can be more granular than what can be captured by recommendation systems that rely on analyzing a users history to make a current recommendation at a specific moment in time when the user may be craving something in particular thus the granularity of a users current specific preference also allows for specific current interests than cannot accurately be predicted based on a users history alone for example with respect to food a user can experience cravings—where a user desires a specific type of food among all of the types of food that the user normally enjoys therefore current applications do not help a user determine what the users current interest is despite the applications having access to the users history moreover although the user may know that he or she wants something the particular object of the users interest may be unknown even to the user until one of the users senses is inspired or provoked further thinking by the user of what the users current interest is alone may not help the user in defining his or her current interestaccording to aspects of the present disclosure a system and computerimplemented method

embodiment in many different forms there is shown in the drawings and will herein be described in detail example implementations of the inventions and concepts herein with the understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered as an exemplification of the principles of the inventions and concepts and is not intended to limit the broad aspect of the disclosed implementations to the examples illustrated for purposes of the present detailed description the singular includes the plural and vice versa unless specifically disclaimed the words “and” and “or” shall be both conjunctive and disjunctive the word “all” means “any and all” the word “any” means “any and all” and the word “including” means “including without limitation”a software module can refer to computerreadable object code that executes a software subroutine or program which corresponds to instructions executed by any microprocessor or microprocessing device to perform described functions acts or steps any of the methods or algorithms or functions described herein can include nontransitory machine or computerreadable instructions for execution by a an electronic processor b an electronic controller andor c any other suitable electronic processing device any algorithm software module software component software program routine subroutine or software application or method disclosed herein can be embodied as a computer program product having one or more nontransitory tangible medium or media such as for example a flash memory a cdrom a floppy disk a hard drive a digital versatile disk dvd or other electronic memory devices but persons of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that the entire algorithm andor parts thereof could alternatively be executed by a device other than an electronic controller andor embodied in firmware or dedicated hardware in a wellknown manner eg it may be implemented by an application specific integrated circuit asic a programmable logic device pld a field programmable logic device fpld discrete logic etcas discussed above there currently exist recommendation systems that are unable to account for a users current ie contemporaneous interest or preference based on the breadth of the users interest despite for example the recommendation systems having access to information regarding the users history the granularity of a users current preference relative to for example a users historical preferences with respect to the subject matter relating to the preference prohibits current recommendation systems from being able to estimate or present the users current interest at the moment in time the user may be craving something at best current recommendation systems merely provide a onetime guess regarding the users current preference moreover within the realm of food in particular current applications exist that provide information regarding broad categories of food that are available within the users current location however the amount of information provided by such applications may amount to information overload the information overload does not allow a user to determine a specific food dish in which the user is currently interested what is needed inter alia is a guided iterative searching solution that repeatedly and dynamically adjusts searching criteria in response to humanmachine inputs made by the user to arrive at a recommendation that will satisfy the users contemporaneous craving at the conclusion of the search session in this way both human and machine are necessary partners in this search strategy only the human can using his or her subjective senses ascertain from an image how a user feels about what is presented in the image however to satisfy an immediate craving the machine is needed to help the human user arrive at a recommendation quickly within less than a minute or so the internet cellular data and wireless technology and smartphones have given users instant access and visibility to a myriad of options but in some respects this access and visibility is as much a blessing as it is a curse with so many choices and options readily available a new programmed machine is needed to help users find relevant information quickly to satisfy needs that are fleeting and must be satisfied quicklyaccordingly aspects of the present disclosure provide for systems and methods of analyzing tags associated with a sequence of images presented to a user to guide a user to a current interest the systems and methods allow for the presentation of a sequence of images to the user each image represents a physical object that the user can obtain through a physical entity that provides the physical object in the realm of food for example the physical object can represent a food dish and the physical entity can represent a restaurant or store or food establishment eg market grocery store etc that offers the food dish a food dish as used herein includes any edible item or combination of edible items that can be consumed eg eaten or drunk by animals including drinks such as bubble tea milkshakes or cocktails each image within the sequence is associated with a set of tags that describe the physical object based on a users preference for each tag a new image is presented to generate the sequence of images the new image is selected based on the set of tags associated with the image that describe the physical object represented by the image and how the set of tags for the new image relate to the set of tags for the previous image based on the preference of the previous image the sequence of presenting images to the user that represent physical objects continues to guide the user into determining a physical object that satisfies or describes the users current interest once the user is presented with an image that represents a physical tangible object that the user is currently interested in eg craving the systems and methods allow for the user to select the image eg a digital photograph to be presented information on how to obtain eg consume items depicted in the physical image in the realm of food as a human interest for example the user can be directed to an internet web site of a physical entity such as a restaurant or other food establishment that serves or offers food at which the user can purchase the dish of food and optionally consume at the food establishment according to some embodiments the user can be directed to an electronic user interface of a software application independent from the web site of the restaurant at which the user can purchase the dish of food to provide additional convenience to the process of obtaining the food dishfig  is a functional block diagram of a system  according to an aspect of the present disclosure

applications a b of the one or more computers a b from the database  either directly or through the server  accordingly based on a clientserver arrangement of the system  with the computers a b as the clients and the server  as the server the database  stores the information used for analyzing tags associated with a sequence of images presented to a user to guide a user to a current interest the server  performs the functionality of the algorithms described herein including serving the information from the database  to the clients eg computers a b the computers a b present the information to the user and receive the inputs from the users which are then presented to the server  for processing however the functionality disclosed herein with respect to the disclosed algorithms can be divided among the components of the system  differently than as explicitly disclosed without departing from the present disclosure for example all of the functionality disclosed herein can be embodied in one or more of the computers a b such as the computers a b being arranged as a distributed network depending on the capability of the computers a b as one facet of the information the database  electronically stores the electronic images within a data store of images the images can be of various file formats and image types by way of example the file formats can include jpeg tagged image file format tiff portable network graphics png etc the image types can include digital photographs digital drawings icons etc as discussed above the images stored on the database  represent a physical object that may be of interest to the user eg the user may be craving accordingly the images visually convey information to the user so that the user understands the physical objects that the images represent the system  can initially include a set number of images the set number of the images can be defined by the administrator of the system  as described below the system  also allows for users to add additional images to the system  for example users can upload images from the one or more computers a b to add additional images to the database  as the users interact with the system  and the users upload images to the system  the number of images increases for example the images can be digital photographs of food including drinks the users who upload them have ordered or seen at restaurants they have visitedfor each image the database  stores information regarding the physical object that the image represents the physical object can be any physical tangible object that is representable by an image by way of example and without limitation the physical objects can be food dishes consumer goods such as clothing automobiles etc physical locations such as vacation spots museums sports venues etc for purposes of convenience the present disclosure is related primarily to food dishes as the physical objects however as understood by one of ordinary skill in the art the disclosure is not limited to physical objects that are only food dishes rather each physical object can be any physical object represented by an image such that a user can identify the physical object when presented the imagethe database  also stores electronic tags primary tags are used within the system  to describe andor characterize the physical object that is represented by an image the primary tags can include single words or several words linked together as a tag that describe or characterize the physical object overall or that describe or characterize subcomponents or subaspects eg attributes of the physical object accordingly for each image the image is associated with a set of tags that describe or characterize the physical object the database  stores all of the tags within a pool of tags which is the totality of tags that can be associated with an image to describe a characteristic andor a quality of the physical object that is represented by the image the primary tags can be any type of descriptor of the physical object represented by the image with respect to the physical objects being food dishes the tags can describe general aspects of the food dishes such as for example an ethnicity or a cuisine of the food dish such as african american argentinian etc which meal of the day the food dish generally applies to such as breakfast brunch lunch dinner supper snack dessert latenight etc the tags can also be adjectives that describe the food dishes such as for example cheesy crunchy hot cold spicy etc the tags can also identify the food or ingredients generally that constitute the food dish such as for example vegetables meats fruits breads etc the tags can also identify the food or ingredients more specifically that constitute the food dish such as for example identifying the specific fruit such as apples apricots etc the specific meat such as beef poultry fish pork etc the specific vegetable such as broccoli asparagus lettuce carrots etc the tags can also identify the specific food dish as a whole such as for example spaghetti with vodka sauce fettuccine stroganoff leg of lamb etc or constituent subdishes eg “sides” within the food dish such as for example sausage eggs pancakes french toast etc that are all within the food dish of a large breakfast with various constituentsthe tags can be objective subjective or semisubjective or tangential regarding how the tags describe or characterize the physical object that is associated with the image the examples of primary tags provided above are objective tags that directly describe the physical objects the tags may additionally include tags that are at least partially subjective andor tangentially describe the physical objects with respect to food dishes as the physical objects for purposes of example subjective or semisubjective tags may include for example tasty mouthwatering delicious healthy hearty etc such subjective or semisubjective tags may apply to the food dish for one user but not necessarily all users tangential tags may describe aspects of the physical object only when correlated with other information such other information may only be known or apply to a subset of users that interact with the system  by way of example such tags may be terms currently trending in social media such as hashtags on twitter® that apply to only a subgroup of users that are following the current social media trends such tags include for example hipster yolo geny genx etc independent of the context of the tag these tangential tags do not necessarily apply to a physical object however patterns may develop that allow certain tangential tags to be understood as referring to a quality or characteristic of a physical objectlike the images the system  initially begins with a certain number of tags however the group of tags can be dynamic and evolve as the users interact with the system  for example additional tags can be added to the pool of tags as users upload new images of physical objects to the system  and describe the physical objects based on new tags that the users create the users can create additional tags to describe or characterize the physical object that is associated with the image that the users uploaded each image is associated with one or more of the tags from among the group of tags as a set of tags for the image the association can be based on an administrator of the system  associating the tags with the images alternatively or in addition the association can be based on users of the system  associating the tags with the images andor creating new tags the association based on the users can be manual such as the users manually selecting a tag to associate with an image alternatively or in addition the association can be automatic such as the system  automatically determining tags that apply to images based on the images being associated with multiple tags as a set of tags the database  also stores information pertaining to specific sets of tags a specific combination of tags is a set of tags a single set of tags can describe multiple different images based on the generality of each tag and an image being associated with any number of tags the database  may include a data structure such as a table to track the various sets of tags based on the various associations between tags and images within the database the database  also stores and tracks associations between elements of the system  such as between tags between sets of tags between images and tags andor sets of tags between users and the elements etc the system  can associate a tag with an image based on the image already being associated with another tag and both of the tags including an association by way of example with respect to food dishes as physical objects an image may represent a chinese food dish that includes rice the image may already be associated with the tag chinese but not be associated with the tag rice based on an association developed by the system  tracking usage of the tag “chinese” with the tag “rice” in addition to for example other users liking other images that are tagged with both the tag “chinese” and the tag “rice” the system  can automatically determine to associate the tag rice with the image based on the image being associated with the tag chinese the association can develop as the number of images that represent different physical objects increases within the database  or as more users interact with the tags and with the images for example as more users upload images to the system  the users may associate both of the tags chinese and rice to the newly uploaded images the system  tracks the continued association of the tag chinese with the tag rice and logs the association within the database the tags may be divided into two overall categories such as primary tags and secondary tags primary tags are defined by an administrator of the system  the primary tags include tags that directly describe or characterize the physical object the system  at least initially includes primary tags the system  can also initially include secondary tags the secondary tags are defined by the administrator of the system  andor by users of the system  the secondary tags may identify the same characteristic andor quality as the primary tags or the secondary tags may identify different characteristics andor qualities as the primary tags secondary tags may directly describe or characterize the physical object such as with primary tags in addition secondary tags may subjectively describe or characterize the physical objects or may tangentially describe or characterize the physical objects as described aboveeach image is associated with at least one primary tag but can be associated with any number of primary tags and secondary tags some images may be associated with only one primary tag for example an image may represent the physical object bread and the only tag associated with the image may be the tag bread some images may be associated with many different tags such as an image that represents the physical object of french toast which can include the tags bread breakfast egg sweet etcthe systems and methods of analyzing tags associated with a sequence of images presented to a user to guide a user to a current interest relies on a plurality of tags that is associated with a user being processed based on a previous set of tags of an image and a preference for that image from the user accordingly the database  may store or the server  may dynamically generate a plurality of tags that are a subset of all of the tags eg pool of tags that are stored on the database  the plurality of tags includes not only the tags but also the sets of tags that correspond to the images that are covered by one or more of the tags as will be described in greater detail below the plurality of tags may be tags that apply or are relevant to a user such as tags within the pool of tags that match tags associated with a users profile as the user is presented with images and provides preferences in response to the images the plurality of tags evolves as certain tags are removed or not considered andor certain sets of tags are removed or not considered from the plurality of tagsthe database  also stores user profiles generally the user profiles include information that is used for the interacting with the system  such information can include certain tags indicated by the user to include with the users profile images physical objects andor entities for which the user has indicated a positive or a negative preference independent of or dependent of the user interacting with images presented to the user during a session of analyzing tags associated with a sequence of images presented to a user to guide a user to a current interest with respect to food dishes for the physical objects the information can include tags and images that apply to food dishes that the user prefers eg likes and food dishes that the user does not prefer eg dislikes the user can indicate such preferences through a manual selection of the tags alternatively or in addition such preferences can be learned by the system  during the users interaction with the system  over a period of time such as through an implicit selection of the tags as preferred tags through the user indicating over time a preference for the tags the preference can be indicated according to a yesno schema such as the user does or does not like a tag an image andor a physical object alternatively the preference can be indicated according to a weighted schema such as a degree to which the user does or does not like a tag image andor physical object the profile information can include any other additional information associated with a user such as the users name address gender age ethnicity religion etc the system  tracks such additional information to mine trends across the users for tags images andor physical objects for example the system  tracks users interactions within the system  to develop a user history the user history tracks interactions between the user and the system  and allows the user to review the previous interactions by way of example the user history can include information pertaining to the users preference to specific images that were previously presented to the useraccording to some embodiments and with respect to food dishes as the physical objects specifically the user profiles can include dietary restrictions such as for example glutenfree vegan vegetarian religious observations eg no pork or shellfish or kosherhalal only nut allergies etc the database  can include dietary information to automatically translate the entered dietary restrictions into negative preferences for certain tags images andor physical objects to which the dietary restrictions apply so that restricted food dishes are not presented to the user the dietary information can be linked to the users profile so that the user can view the dietary information used by the system as discussed above the physical objects represent objects that are offered by various entities the database  includes information with respect to the location of the entity associated with the physical object andor the image that represents the physical object by way of example the physical object can represent a food dish and the physical entity represents the restaurant or store eg market grocery store etc that offers the food dish the database  includes information with respect to the location of the restaurant or store in addition to the location the database  can also include entity profiles according to some embodiments the entity profiles can be organized according to a subscriptionbased system entities that are subscribed to the system  can include specific information within their profiles that entities who are not subscribed cannot with respect to food dishes such information can include food dishes offered by the entity such as images of food dishes that the entities created and uploaded into the system  in addition to the menu any current specialspromotionsdiscounts offered etc according to some embodiments user interactions with the system  will allow for the users to confirm the information presented in the entity profiles the entity profiles can also include images to showcase the entitys physical objects additional links leading to their websites or social media applications eg facebook® twitter® etcthe entity profiles allow users to browse the entities and click on a suggested or profiled entity leading the user to the entitys profile as part of the abovedescribed associations the system  collects and shares visitor frequency with entities when users are redirected to the entities websites following selection of images associated with physical objects that are associated with the entities according to some embodiments the entity profiles will include a direct purchasing interface for users thereby obviating the need for users to seek third party companies to order or consume physical objects associated with the entityfig a is a flowchart of a computerimplemented method or algorithm a of analyzing tags associated with a sequence of images presented to a user to guide a user to a current interest using aspects of the present disclosure including the one or more computers a b the server  and the database  the computerimplemented method or algorithm a may be executed within a computer a the server  the database  or across multiple platforms such as on the computer a and the server  in regard of the latter arrangement an application a executed by the computer a eg clientside application may perform the computerimplemented method or algorithm a in conjunction with an application executed on the server  eg serverside application according to a clientserver relationship the computerimplemented method or algorithm a begins with a user initiating a session of the computerimplemented method or algorithm a as will be described in greater detail below the session of the computerimplemented method or algorithm a begins with determining a plurality of tags that are associated with the user and that will be processed to determine subsequent images to present to the user to generate a sequence of images during a session of the computerimplemented method or algorithm a the plurality of tags also determines the plurality of images from which the images that are presented to the user are selected from thus according to some embodiments the computerimplemented method or algorithm a processes only a subset of the tags and the images stored in the database  based on the user that initiated the session of the computerimplemented method or algorithm a the computerimplemented method or algorithm a begins with one of the images from among the plurality of images being presented to the user such as through the display device a of the computer a  as described above the image represents a physical object and is associated with a set of tags each of tag of the set of tag describes the physical object that is represented by the presented image thus the user is presented with an image and the user is able to recognize the physical object represented by the imageas will be also described below along with the image one or more user interface elements or objects can be optionally presented on the display device a of the computer a to allow the user to indicate a preference or inclinationdisinclination for the physical object that is represented by the image the user interface elements may vary depending on the functionalitycapability of the computer device a the user interface device a andor the display device a alternatively the display device a may not present graphical user interface elements although it could specifically for the user indicating the preference for the physical object rather or additionally for example it may be implicit what action the user should take to indicate the preference such as by swiping left on or near the image or anywhere on the display device a to indicate a negative preference eg dislike and swiping right on or near the image or anywhere on the display device a to indicate a positive preference eg like or vice versa to be clear the present disclosure also contemplates displaying graphical ui elements eg like and dislike virtual buttons displayed on the display device  for selection using a user interface device  and recognizing gestures eg swiping made by a user relative to a user interface device  or one or the otherupon the image being presented eg displayed on the display device  to the user the computerimplemented method or algorithm a receives an input from the user indicating a preference for the physical object represented by the image  the preference may be like or an inclination toward the object eg positive or dislike or disinclination against the object eg negative alternatively the preference may be like eg positive dislike eg negative or neither like nor dislike eg neutral a neutral preference may indicate that the user cannot tell whether he or she likes or dislikes the physical object represented by the image alternatively the preference may be scaled such as a range of  to  to indicate the degree that the user likes eg  to  or dislikes eg  to  the physical object represented by the imagethe computerimplemented method or algorithm a then processes the plurality of tags based on the preference indicated by the user  processing of tags refers to the manipulation or treatment of the tags drawn from the pool of tags by the computer  or server  during a session the plurality of tags that is processed is the tags that are selected from the pool of tags stored within the database  the processing includes determining a next set of tags based on the preference the user provided in response to the previous image and the set of tags that are associated with the previous image based on the preference the set of tags from the previous image determine how the plurality of tags is processed to determine the next set of tags by way of example if the preference that the user indicated to a previous image is positive negative or neutral the plurality of tags are processed eg treated differently based on the set of tags of the previous image in response to the preference for the physical object represented by the previous image being negative the processing of the plurality of tags includes removing tags from the plurality of tags that correspond to the tags from the set of tags of the previous image the tags are removed from the plurality of tags that are processed to determine the next set of tags at each iteration of the computerimplemented method or algorithm a for the remainder of the session so that an image is not presented to the user for the remainder of the session that includes the particular tags although the tags are described throughout as being removed from the plurality of tags removal includes removing the tags from the plurality of tags and also includes leaving the tags within the plurality of tags but not considering the tags for example the tags can remain within the plurality of tags but the tags can be marked as for example removed such that the tags are not considered during the processing of the plurality of tagsas discussed above the tags can be categorized generally as primary tags and secondary tags an image can be associated with both primary tags and secondary tags according to some embodiments the tags that are associated with an image and that are removed from the plurality of tags in response to a negative preference are only the primary tags from the set of tags associated with the image that received a negative preference alternatively both the primary tags and the secondary tags from the set of tags associated with an image that received a negative preference are removed from the plurality of tags in response to a negative preference alternatively whether only primary tags or both primary tags and secondary tags are removed from the plurality of tags may be determined based on the number that have been presented to the user for example if the image is one of the first n images presented to the user where n is   or  only the primary tags associated with the image are removed from the plurality of tags in response to an input by the user indicating a negative preference however if the image is a later image presented to the user such as the sixth seventh or eighth image both the primary tags and the secondary tags that are associated with the image are removed from the plurality of tags for subsequent images that are presented to a user after the user has indicated a positive preference to at least one previous image only those tags that are associated with the newly presented image and that are new relative to the previously presented set of tags are the tags that are removed from the plurality of tags whether they are only primary tags or both primary and secondary tagsin addition to removing tags eg negative tags that are associated with an image that the user provides a negative preference for the computerimplemented method or algorithm a may also remove tags that are associated with the negative tags from the plurality of tags eg associated tags as discussed above in addition to the tags being stored in the database  the database also stores associations between tags for example certain tags may be associated with other tags based on trends in the physical objects represented by the images such as the tag labeled “chinese” being more associated with the tag labeled “rice” than the tag labeled “burger” accordingly in response to a negative preference the computerimplemented method or algorithm a may determine associated tags that satisfy a threshold association with the negative tags the threshold for the association may be based on any number of factors or metrics such as the number of times two tags are associated with the same image the number of times a user indicates a certain preference eg like or dislike for an image and the tags that are associated with the image etc for example the association may be based on the number of times two tags are associated with an image when the image is indicated by a user as having a positive preference however the threshold for determining the association may vary without departing from the spirit and scope of the present disclosurein response to the preference for the physical object represented by the image being positive or favorable the processing of the plurality of tags includes determining additional tags to add to the tags from the set of tags associated with the image the additional tags further narrow down the current interest of the user by building upon the tags associated with the previous image for which the user provided a positive preferenceto determine the one or more additional tags the computerimplemented method or algorithm a processes the plurality of tags to determine the tags that have an association with the positive tags by way of example if the tags associated with the previous image include the tags meat and lunch the computerimplemented method or algorithm a processes the plurality of tags to determine tags that are associated with meat and bun such as the tags hamburger or hot dog rather than for example the tag cereal similar to above the threshold for the association may be based on any number of factors or metrics such as the number of times two tags are associated with the same image the number of times a user indicates a certain preference like or dislike for an image and the tags that are associated with the image etc however the threshold for determining the association may vary without departing from the spirit and scope of the present disclosureupon determining tags that satisfy a threshold association with one or more tags from the set of tags that are associated with an image that the user indicated a positive preference for the computerimplemented method or algorithm a determines a next set of tags based on the next set of tags including at least one tag of the tags having the threshold association thus if several tags are determined as having a threshold association with one or more tags that are associated with an image that the user indicated a positive preference for one or more of those tags are selected and the next set of tags includes the one or more tags of those tags and the previous tags of the previous image if more than one tag exists that satisfies the threshold association with a tag from the previous set of tags the selection of which of the one or more tags to add to generate the next set of tags can vary the selection can be random such that for example one or more tags from a total of four tags are selected to be included in the next set of tags alternatively the selection can be based on a weighting of the tags the weighting can be determined based on one or more factors andor metrics according to one metric the weighting can be based on which tag has the highest association with one tag more than one tag or all of the tags of the set of tags associated with the previous image that the user indicated a positive preference for the association can be relative to all tags within the group or pool of tags all tags that are relevant to the particular user eg that the user indicated a preference for or all tags within the same category of tags such as meal type of food etc however the weighting can be based on any type of metric or schema such as based on a profile of the user physical objects associated with the tags having a threshold association locations corresponding to the physical objects associated with the tags having a threshold association entities corresponding to the physical objects associated with the tags having a threshold association or a combination thereof once the weighting of the tags is determined the one or more tags that are added to the set of tags associated with the previous image are selected such that the selected tags are the tags with the highest weightingas discussed above the tags can be categorized generally as primary tags and secondary tags an image can be associated with both primary tags and secondary tags according to some embodiments only tags within the plurality of tags that are primary tags are processed to determine additional primary tags to add to the previous set of tags alternatively all tags within the plurality of tags eg primary and secondary are processed to determine the additional tags to be added to the previous set of tags whether only primary tags are both primary tags and secondary tags are processed to determine additional tags to add to the set of tags associated with the previous image can be determined based on the number of images within a sequence that already have been presented to a user for example if the image is one of the first n images presented to the user where n is    or  only the primary tags within the plurality of tags are processed to determine an additional tag to add to the previous set of tags however if the image is a later image presented to the user such as the sixth seventh or eighth image within a session both primary tags and secondary tags are processed to determine additional tags to add to the previous set of tagsas discussed above the preference that a user can indicate in response to being presented an image representing an object can be a positive preference or a negative preference additionally the preference can be a neutral preference in response to the preference indicated for an image being a neutral preference the set of tags eg combination of tags that are associated with the image are logged and no set of tags eg combination of tags that include only that set of tags is subsequently presented to the user for the remainder of the session therefore no image that is associated with a set of tags that includes only that set is presented to the user for the remainder of the session alternatively in response to the preference being a neutral preference the set of tags that are associated with the image are logged and no set of tags that include that set of tags in addition to any other tags is subsequently presented to the user for the remainder of the session accordingly in response to a neutral preference the computerimplemented method or algorithm a processes the plurality of tags and determines the next set of tags based on the next set of tags not including the one set of tags corresponding to the image either alone or alternatively in any combination with additional tags for a remainder of the session thus sets of tags are logged that are associated with a neutral preference to narrow the possible next sets of tags and therefore images that can be presented to the userin addition according to some embodiments and similar to the discussion above with respect to a negative preference the sets of tags that can be excluded from the possible next set of tags can include sets of tags that include tags that satisfy a threshold association with one or more tags within the set of tags associated with a neutral preferenceupon determining the set of tags based on the preference and the set of tags for the previous image the computerimplemented method or algorithm a determines the next image to present to the user  the next image is an image from a plurality of images that is associated with the next set of tags multiple images can be associated with the same set of tags accordingly the computerimplemented method or algorithm a the selects a single image from the images that share the same set of tags the criteria of the selection of the image can vary the selection can be random such that a random image is selected from the images that share the same set of tags alternatively the selection may be based on a process or metric as discussed above the database  stores information pertaining to how many times the user has interacted with a specific tag andor a specific image the process or metric can include analyzing the number of interactions between the user and the images that share the same set of tags and selecting the image that has the highest number of interactions the image with the highest number of interactions may offer a high likelihood that the user has a current interest in the physical object represented by the image alternatively the process can include selecting the image that has the lowest number of interactions with the user the interactions can include any interaction such as any time the user was presented the image and regardless of the preference the user provided in response to the image alternatively the interactions can be limited to only interactions where the user provided a specific preference such as a positive preference a negative preference or a neutral preference alternatively the process or metric may be based on the entity that is associated with the physical object that is represented by the image images that are associated with entities that have subscribed to the system  may be weighted higher than images that are associated with entities that have not subscribed to the system  thus an image may be presented to a user among multiple images that are associated with the same set of tags if the image is associated with a subscribing entitythe computerimplemented method or algorithm a generates a sequence of images based on repeating the above process of at least presenting the image to the user and awaiting an input from the user regarding whether the user has a positive or negative or neutral preference for the physical object represented by the next image  the session of the computerimplemented method or algorithm a continues each time the user provides a preference for the currently presented image and determines the next set of tags and the next image to present based on the preference for the previous image and the set of tags associated with the previous image the user providing the preferences narrows down the physical object that the user is currently interested in based on the set of tags associated with the images presented to the user that represent the various possible physical objects the computerimplemented method or algorithm a continues within a session as long as the user continues to provide inputs corresponding to the users preferences to physical objects represented by images thus according to some embodiments the computerimplemented method or algorithm a continues indefinitely or at least until the number of images andor tags are exhausted during the session based on the processing discussed above during the session tags and sets of tags are removed based on negative or neutral responses as described above thus a session can end in the event that there are no more tags andor images to present to a user alternatively a single session of presenting a sequence of images can last until a predetermined number of images have been presented or displayed to the user or until a predetermined number of inputs have been received from the user for example a session of presenting images can last for  images if the user has not yet determined a physical object that the user is currently interested in after the th image the session ends and the computerimplemented method or algorithm a restarts a new session restarting a new session of the computerimplemented method or algorithm a resets the removed tags the sets of tags that were neutralized or both from the previous session for example all of the plurality of tags and sets of tags that were initially available at the beginning of the computerimplemented method or algorithm a are again available from which to determine new sets of tags and new images to present to the user alternatively the session of the computerimplemented method or algorithm a ends once the user selects an image that represents a physical object that the user is interested in as described in more detail belowfig b is a flowchart of a computerimplemented method or algorithm b of determining from among the entire pool of tags and the entire pool images the plurality of tags and the plurality of images that are relevant for the user for a particular session and that are processed and analyzed for determining images to present to the user using aspects of the present disclosure including the computer a the server  and the database  the computerimplemented method or algorithm b can be a separate algorithm for purpose of implementation within the system  than the computerimplemented method or algorithm a alternatively the computerimplemented method or algorithm b can be an extension or subroutine of the computerimplemented method or algorithm a the computerimplemented method or algorithm b selects the plurality of tags that are processed for determining the next set of tags discussed above in the computerimplemented method or algorithm a and from which an initial image is presented from among the pool of tags within the database   the plurality of tags is selected based on the plurality of tags matching one or more tags associated with a profile of the user thus tags that are relevant to a user according to the tags matching tags that are within the users profile are selected to be within the plurality of tags that are processed as discussed above in the computerimplemented method or algorithm a the tags that are selected are tags that have an exact match with tags within a users profile alternatively the tags that are selected are tags that have an exact match or that satisfy a threshold association with tags within the users profile the association can be based on any association described herein such as the tags typically being associated with the same image based on trends of images and tags within the database  the tags that are selected from among the pool of tags can be only primary tags or the tags can be both primary tags and secondary tags in some examples primary and secondary tags have an equal weight but in other examples a primary tag can have a higher weight compared to a secondary tagthe computerimplemented method or algorithm b also determines a location associated with the user the computer a that is executing the application to perform the computerimplemented method or algorithm b or a combination thereof  the location associated with the computer a can be determined automatically based on various functionality of the computer a such as a gps global positioning system receiver within the computer a alternatively the location associated with the user and the computer a can be determined based on the user manually entering a location within the computer a the location manually entered by the user can be a current location or a different location such as a location that a user plans on being at during a certain timebased on the plurality of tags that are selected from the pool of tags and the location of the user andor the computer a the computerimplemented method or algorithm b selects images from among the pool of images  the images are selected based on the images being associated with at least one tag of the plurality of tags that are selected from the pool of tags further the images are selected based on each image being associated with the location of the user andor the computer a the images are selected based on the location because as discussed above the location corresponds to the location of availability of the physical object that is represented by the image based on the computerimplemented method or algorithm b the processing of the tags and the selection of the images within the computerimplemented method or algorithm a is limited to the tags that are relevant to the user and to the images that represent physical objects that are local to a specific location eg current geographic location of user andor computer a or plannedexpected location of the user andor computer athe first image presented during a session of the computerimplemented method or algorithm a is an image within the pool of images by way of example the first image is randomly selected from among the plurality of images as a first image of the sequence of images alternatively the first image can be an image from among the plurality of images that is associated with a high number of interactions with the user either through direct interactions between the user and the image such as the user indicating a preference in response to being presented an image or through interactions between one or more tags associated with the image and the user alternatively the first image presented to the user within a session of the computerimplemented method or algorithm a can be based on a search of the user for a specific tag physical object or entity that provides the physical object for example with respect to food the user can elect to begin a session of the computerimplemented method or algorithm a and enter the name of the physical object they seek such as chinese chicken salad in response the computerimplemented method or algorithm a searches for images within the database  containing one or more tags describing or characterizing chinese chicken salad enabling the user to search their geographic area for restaurantsvendors bearing that food item at the same time this functionality encourages restaurants eg entities associated with premium accounts to upload images of their food dishes thereby making their food dishes searchable within the system  for all potential users within their local areafig c is a flowchart of a computerimplemented method or algorithm c of determining andor updating associations between elements within the system  using aspects of the present disclosure including the computer a the server  and the database  the computerimplemented method or algorithm c can be a separate algorithm for purpose of implementation within the system  than the computerimplemented method or algorithm a and b alternatively the computerimplemented method or algorithm c can be an extension or a subroutine of the computerimplemented method or algorithm a during a session of generating a sequence of images by the computerimplemented method or algorithm a the computerimplemented method or algorithm c logs the inputs from the user as interactions  the inputs are logged as interactions with the tags the sets of tags the images the physical objects andor the entities associated with the physical objects for which the inputs apply when a user provides an input of a preference associated with an image the input is logged as applying to the image the physical object represented by the image one or more tags associated with the image andor the entity associated with the physical object the input can be logged relative to only the user or the input can be logged across all usersthe logging of the inputs allows the computerimplemented method or algorithm c to modify associations between the various informational elements within the system   for example the logging allows the computerimplemented method or algorithm c to modify associations tags between sets of tags andor between an image and a tag andor a set of tags based on the interactions the associations can be modified relative to the user making the inputs or the associations can be applied to all users accordingly the associations discussed and used with the computerimplemented method or algorithms a and b are dynamic and constantly evolving based on the continued user inputsfig  is a diagram of a flow  illustrating the processing of a plurality of tags that are relevant to a user over the course of a session of the computerimplemented method or algorithm a the flow begins with a set of tags  the set of tags  is associated with an image that is presented to the user at the computer a through execution of the application a specifically the display device a displays the image that is associated with the set of tags  as shown the set of tags  includes primary tags a and secondary tags b the tags can be any of the abovedescribed tags however for purposes of convenience the tags are represented by alphabetical characters thus the primary tags a of the tag  include the tags a b and c and the secondary tags b of the tag  include the tags d and ein response to the presentation of the image associated with the set of tags  the user indicates for example a preference for the physical object represented by the image as described above the preference may be indicated through the user interface device a for purposes of explanation the preference is represented by the arrow a in fig  specifically the arrow a represents a preference for the image associated with the set of tags  that is negativebased on the negative preference the computerimplemented method or algorithm a processes the plurality of tags to determine a next set of tags and a next image that is associated with the next set of tags the set of tags  represents the next set of tags determined by the computerimplemented method or algorithm a and an image that is associated with the set of tags  the set of tags  includes the primary tags a f g and h and the secondary tags b i and j because the user provided a negative preference in response to the physical object represented by the image that was associated with the set of tags  the set of tags  does not include any of the primary tags a specifically the primary tags a of a b and c were removed from the plurality of tags that are processed to determine the next set of tags for the remainder of the session of the computerimplemented method or algorithm a similar to above in response to the presentation of the image associated with the set of tags  the user indicates a preference for the physical object represented by the image for purposes of explanation the preference is represented by the arrow a in fig  specifically the arrow a represents a preference for the image associated with the set of tags  that is positivebased on the positive preference the computerimplemented method or algorithm a processes the plurality of tags to determine a next set of tags and a next image that is associated with the next set of tags the set of tags  represents the next set of tags determined by the computerimplemented method or algorithm a and an image that is associated with the set of tags  because the user indicated a positive preference to the previous physical object represented by the image associated with the set of tags  the set of tags  includes the primary tags a f g h and k which are the primary tags a and the additional primary tag k that is the computerimplemented method or algorithm a builds upon the set of tags  based on the positive preference of the user by determining a set of tags that includes the previous primary tags and an additional primary tag or more and the corresponding image that the set of tags is associated withthe set of tags  also includes the secondary tags b d e and i despite the user indicating a negative preference for the set of tags  which included the secondary tag d the secondary tag d can be used again in a subsequent set of tags because the tag is a secondary tag alternatively the secondary tags may also be removed from the plurality of tags that are processed for the remainder of the session to determine a next set of tags instead of only the primary tagsin response to the presentation of the image associated with the set of tags  the user indicates a preference for the physical object represented by the image for ease of explanation the preference is represented by the arrow b in fig  specifically the arrow b represents a preference for the image associated with the set of tags  that is negativebased on the negative preference the computerimplemented method or algorithm a processes the plurality of tags to determine a next set of tags and a next image that is associated with the next set of tags the set of tags  represents the next set of tags determined by the computerimplemented method or algorithm a and an image that is associated with the set of tags  the set of tags  includes the primary tags a f g h and l and the secondary tags b m n and o because the user provided a negative preference in response to the physical object represented by the image that was associated with the set of tags  the set of tags  does not include the primary tag that was added between the set of tags  eg last positive preference and the set of tags  ie primary tag k that is the negative preference in response to the set of tags  is attributed to the addition of the primary tag k thus the primary tag k is removed from the plurality of tags for the remainder of the session such that no subsequent set of tags can include the primary tag k the set of tags  also includes the secondary tags b m n and oin response to the presentation of the image associated with the set of tags  the user indicates a preference for the physical object represented by the image for purposes of explanation the preference is represented by the arrow a in fig  specifically the arrow a represents a preference for the image associated with the set of tags  that is neutralbased on the neutral preference the computerimplemented method or algorithm a processes the plurality of tags to determine a next set of tags and a next image that is associated with the next set of tags the set of tags  represents the next set of tags determined by the computerimplemented method or algorithm a and an image that is associated with the next set of tags  the set of tags  includes the primary tags a f g h and p and the secondary tags b d e and o because the user provided a neutral preference in response to the physical object represented by the image that was associated with the set of tags  the set of tags  does not include the primary tag that was added between the set of tags  eg last positive preference and the set of tags  ie primary tag l that is the neutral preference in response to the set of tags  is attributed to the entire set of primary tags a including the primary tag k and the primary tags f g and h thus the set of primary tags a is removed from the plurality of tags that are processed in the sense that the exact same set of primary tags a can never be presented to the user again however the primary tag l is not removed from the plurality of tags for the remainder of the session such that subsequent sets of tags can include the primary tag l as long as the set of tags is not the exact set of primary tag a the set of tags  also includes the secondary tags b d e and oin response to the presentation of the image associated with the set of tags  the user indicates a preference for the physical object represented by the image for purposes of explanation the preference is represented by the arrow b in fig  specifically the arrow b represents a preference for the image associated with the set of tags  that is positivebased on the positive preference the computerimplemented method or algorithm a processes the plurality of tags to determine a next set of tags and a next image that is associated with the next set of tags the set of tags  represents the next set of tags determined by the computerimplemented method or algorithm a and an image that is associated with the set of tags  because the user indicated a positive preference to the previous physical object represented by the image associated with the set of tags  the set of tags  includes the primary tags a f g h p q and r which are the primary tags a and the additional primary tags q and r that is as described above the computerimplemented method or algorithm a builds upon the positive preference of the user by determining a set of tags that includes the previous primary tags and one or more additional primary tags and the corresponding image that the set of tag is associated withthe flow  continues until the user selects a physical object that is represented by a currently presented image which corresponds to the last image that is presented within the above sequence of images is a physical object that the user would like to obtain alternatively the flow  continues until the session is ended and restarted for the reasons discussed above in each case when a session of the computerimplemented method or algorithm a is started or restarted the plurality of tags and images that are processed are reset such that the tags and sets of tags that were removed from the plurality of tags are inserted back into the plurality of tags for processingthe following figures use any of the aspects described above in connection with the foregoing figs  these figures and accompanying description lay out some of the foundational aspects of the present disclosure which the following figures show as mere exemplars of the many implementations contemplated by the present disclosurefigs ag illustrate user interfaces uis ag respectively that are presented on a computer device a as part of an application a executed on the computer device a for analyzing tags associated with a sequence of images presented to a user to guide a user to a current interest referring to fig a when starting a session of the computerimplemented method or algorithm images appear one at a time and users interact with the images to populate a dynamic sequence of images according to the various configurations of the system  the images are pushed by the server  from the database  to the application a on the computer a alternatively the images may be retrieved from the database  by the application a either directly or through the server  alternatively the images may be contained within the application a on the computer a fig a illustrates the main ui a of the computerimplemented method or algorithm a as shown the ui a includes an image a the image a represents a physical object in the specific example of fig a the image a is a digital photograph of loaves of bread which represents the physical object of bread and could have been taken by someone perusing a store or restaurant serving these loaves of bread and posted to an online social media networking service for example below the image a are user interface elements a and b specifically the user interface elements a and b allow a user to enter inputs associated with the image a and the corresponding physical object represented by the image for the user to provide a preference for the physical object represented by the image a for example the user interface element a is an icon of an x which corresponds to a negative preference and the user interface element b is an icon of a checkmark which corresponds to a positive preference the ui a also includes a main toolbar  that allows the user to navigate within the application a within the main toolbar  are icons corresponding to functions of the application a including a feed icon a a restaurants icon b a crave search icon c and a my profile icon d the crave search icon a initiates a session of the computerimplemented process or algorithm a that begins the process or algorithm for analyzing tags associated with a sequence of images presented to a user to present a current interest of the user thus prior to the ui a being presented in the display device a or the computer a the user for example selected the crave search icon c fig b shows a subsequent user interface after the ui a specifically upon the user selecting one of the user interface elements a or b the ui a transitions to ui b ui b includes a new image b like image a the image b represents a physical object in the specific example of fig b the image b is a digital photograph of beef stirfry which represents the physical object of a food dish of beef stirfry by way of example the user may have selected the user element a to indicate that the user has a negative preference eg dislike for the physical object of bread represented by the image a in response the computerimplemented method or algorithm a determined a next set of tags that does not include tags from the previous set of tags associated with the image a and determined an image eg image b that is associated with the next set of tags to present to the user accordingly the image b of the beef stirfry does not have the same primary tags as the primary tags associated with the image a of the loaves of breadfig c shows a subsequent user interface after the ui b the ui c of fig c may be after several rounds of the computerimplemented method or algorithm a selecting next sets of tags and images associated with the next sets of tags and receiving inputs from the user indicating preferences for the physical objects represented by the images by way of explanation the ui c may be presented after an n number of images were previously presented thus the ui c includes a new image c like images a and b the image c represents a physical object in the specific example of fig c the image b is a digital photograph of sushi which represents the physical object of a dish of sushifig d shows a detailed view ui d associated with the image c in fig cby way of example the ui c transitions to the ui d by the user selecting the image c in the ui c the ui d includes the same image c in fig c in addition the ui d includes user interface elements a and a user interface element a corresponds to a title or caption associated with the image c the title or caption of the user interface element a is a text string that describes the physical object that is represented by the image c by way of example where the image c shows sushi the user interface element a includes the caption california sushi roll user interface element a lists the tags that are associated with the image c the user interface element a allows a user to directly see the tags that are associated with the image c and therefore also associated with the physical object that is represented by the image c by way of example the user interface element a includes the tags sushi roll raw japanese vegetable and coldfig e shows a ui e that includes a recommendation for a restaurant based on the currently presented image d which is presented based on the computerimplemented process or algorithm a for example the user may have indicated a negative preference or dislike in response to being presented the image c based on reverting back to the tags that were last associated with a positive response for example b the computerimplemented process or algorithm a may have determined the image d as the next image to present to the user similar to the ui d the ui e includes a detailed view associated with the currently presented image d as shown the image d shows a digital photograph of pork chops which is indicated by the user interface element b specifically the user interface element b shows the caption of pork chops with ripieno the ui e further includes the user interface element b which provides the tags that are associated with the image d as shown the tags include herbs wok breadcrumbs pork chops and dinner further the ui e includes the user interface element  the user interface element  provides an indication of a number entities within the area for example defined by the location of the user the computer a or both that offer the physical object that is associated with the image a specific to the illustrated example the user interface element  indicates the number of restaurants within the location of the user that offer the food dish that is represented by the image d as shown there are  restaurants within a threshold location of the user that offer the food dish of pork chops with ripieno that is associated with the image d the user interface element  may be presented to the user within the ui e in response to the user providing an indication that the user is interested in obtaining the physical object associated with the image d such an indication can be provided according to various methods such as the user double tapping or selecting the image d in response the application a presents the user interface element  within the ui e thus once a user is guided to a physical object that the user is interested in such as craving in the case of a food dish the computerimplemented process or algorithm a allows the user to obtain information on entities that offer the physical object in this case the entities are the  restaurants in response to the user selecting the user interface element  the application a causes a transition between the ui e and the ui f fig f shows the ui f which includes a list of recommended entities that offer the physical object that the user indicated as being interested in obtaining additional information in the ui f includes a list of entities ag specifically restaurants that offer the physical object associated with the image d from the ui f the user is able to choose a specific entity from the list of entities ag upon selecting an entity such as the first entity associated with the first user interface element a the application a causes a transition between the ui f to the ui g fig g shows a ui g that provides information regarding a specific entity that offers the physical object associated with the image d in the case of a restaurant the ui g includes an image  of the exterior of the restaurant below the image  the ui g includes the name of the restaurant and the address of the restaurant the ui g also includes a user interface element  the user interface element  can be associated with a hyperlink to a website that is associated with the restaurant alternatively the user interface element  may direct the user to a landing site within the application for restaurant the landing site for the restaurant may provide information regarding the restaurant such as the information that is contained with the restaurant profile stored within the database  according to some embodiments the landing site for the restaurant may allow a user to purchase the food dish through the application a rather than being directed to an internet web site from which the user can purchase the food dishfig h shows a ui h for a user to upload and associate an image of a physical object into the system  such as stored within the database  of the system  the ui h includes an area  to display the image that will be associated with the physical object the image can be obtained according to various methods such as a camera integrated within the computer a such as in the case of a smartphone or by linking to an image on the internet or saved in a memory device of the computer a similar to the ui f the ui h also includes a user interface element  that allows a user to insert a title or a caption for the image the ui h also includes a user interface element  to associate the image within the area  with one or more tags that describe the physical object represented by the image the ui h also includes a user interface element  to associate a location with the image and the physical object the location can either be determined automatically such as through components andor modules within the computer a eg global positioning system receivers or can be manually entered by the userfig i illustrates the ui i as the user enters information within the user interface elements  and  for example the user may be uploading an image of a food dish the food dish may specifically be beef stirfry the user may have selected the tags hot wok and chinese to describe the food dish eg physical object represented by the image to select the tags and enter the caption the ui i includes a virtual keyboard  however the user can enter the text according to various other user interface devices once the user has completed entering the information the image is uploaded to the database  fig j shows the ui j that includes the user interface element  which indicates a successful upload of the image and the associated information such as the tags the caption and the locationfigs k and l show user interfaces associated with a user viewing aspects of the users profile specifically fig k shows ui k associated with a user profile including the tags that the user is associated with based on the user interface element  as shown the user profile indicates that the user is associated with the tags talian asian burger joints romantic delivery music healthy food fresh among other tags the tags are associated with the user by the user manually selecting certain tags from all of the tags that are stored in the database  that the user has a positive preference for eg likes alternatively the tags are associated with the user implicitly by the users interaction with the tags over time such as the user having the habit of selecting images andor physical objects that the user prefers that are associated with the tags in the user interface element  the ui k also includes images eg digital photographs that the user has provided a positive preference for eg liked during interaction with the application a fig l includes the ui  that shows at least some additional aspects of the users profile for example the ui  includes user interface elements  and  the user interface element  includes social media information regarding the user such as an icon of the user the users location eg city and state and how many users the user is following and are following the user the user interface element  includes images that the user has uploaded into the system  such as through the flow illustrated in figs hj the ui  can include other information within the system  not just the information specifically referenced herein with respect to figs al for example the ui  can include a feature for users called the top  which highlights the top rated images andor physical objects associated with the images at any given moment the top  images can be out of all of the images stored within the database  all of the images within the database  that are relevant to the user based on the images being associated with tags that the user has liked or all of the images of physical objects that are offered within a predefined area surrounding the users current location the images representing the physical objects with the most positive preferences will be featured on the top  which provides users the incentive to upload physical objects eg such as food dishes that are their favorite physical objects for example this will encourage users to share their best meals in the hopes of being in the top  the top  list allows users to gain attention in the social media realm the applications a b allow users to attract more followers as well as support for example their favorite restaurants eg entities the top  lists will also be active allowing user to select an image within the top  list to be taken to a page associated with a profile of the entity that offers the physical object represented by the imagewhile this disclosure is susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms specific embodiments or implementations have been shown by way of example in
