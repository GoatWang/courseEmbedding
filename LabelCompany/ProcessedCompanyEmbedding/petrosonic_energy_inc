upgrade heavy oil economically and in an environmentally friendly manner petrosonics patented sonoprocesstm does just that it uses clean tech sonic energy to deasphalt heavy oil at a much smaller scale lower capital and operating costs than conventional upgraders and at lower costs than blending operations that use diluent to transport the heavy crude via pipelines sonoprocesstm eliminates the use of diluent for heavy oil producers thus reducing their production costs considerably and it can decongest the pipeline capacity by rd by replacing diluent the processing capacity of the

technology through a reputable independent engineering firm the company also has recently developed a proprietary solution that enables the sonoprocess to use lpgpropane as solvents which are widely
