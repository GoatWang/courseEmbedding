insurance group ltd  south main street hanover new hampshire  tel  fax  email infowhitemountainscom c what is the companys basic operating philosophy white mountains focuses on four business principles that really havent changed much since our ipo in  simply stated these principles are underwriting comes first an insurance enterprise must respect the fundamentals of insurance there must be a realistic expectation of underwriting profit on all business written and a demonstrated fulfillment of that expectation over time with focused attention to the loss ratio and to all the professional insurance disciplines of pricing underwriting and claims management maintain a disciplined balance sheet the first concern here is that insurance liabilities must always be fully recognized loss reserves and expense reserves must be solid before any other aspect of the business can be solid pricing marketing and underwriting all depend on informed judgment of ultimate loss costs and that can be managed effectively only with a disciplined balance sheet invest for total return historical insurance accounting has tended to hide unrealized gains and losses in the investment portfolio and over reward reported investment income interest and dividends regardless of the accounting the group must invest for the best growth in value over time in addition to investing our bond portfolio for total aftertax return that will mean prudent investment in equities consistent with leverage and insurance risk considerations think like owners thinking like owners has a value all its own there are other stakeholders in a business enterprise and doing good work requires more than this quarters profit but thinking like an owner embraces all that without losing the touchstone of a capitalist enterprise d what are the companys performance goals the companys goal is to become a premier group of property and casualty insurance and reinsurance underwriters which with prudent operating and financial leverage produces for its owners a longterm return equal to  basis points over the tenyear treasury after corporate tax each member of the group will be well managed in its own right and each underwritingdriven using its own strategy white mountains functions as an intelligent owner and capital provider and allocator e what is the companys overall strategy jack byrne our former chairman has often said we have never made a strategic purchase … maybe we will someday we often sell to strategic buyers our problem is we really dont have much of a strategy other than to increase intrinsic business value per share f what emphasis does the company place on growth growth is a concept that is often introduced by business consultants in the companys experience chasing market share has produced the biggest disasters in the insurance business equally risky is rewarding executives on premium growth the company focuses on its profitability rather than growth and has often profited from the fine opportunities that arise as a result of a competitors quest for growth quick links find the exact info you need quickly select below insider transactions  sec filings
