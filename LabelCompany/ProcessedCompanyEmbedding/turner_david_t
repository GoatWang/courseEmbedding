pinkbike  login from the top david turner by r cunningham images colin meagherdavid turners life revolves around two wheels twentyfive years ago turner was racing both motorcycles and mountain bikes when another guy with the same last name paul turner introduced suspension forks to the bicycle world dave turner was one of the lucky few who were given those early prototypes for competition testing it was an ahha moment for the young crosscountry racer who knew that the instant popularity of suspension forks would inevitably lead to fullsuspension mountain bikes dave immediately set out to learn as much as he could about rear suspension and how it might be adapted to suit the needs of finicky mountain bike riders turner was lucky to fall in with the sharpest suspension designer of the moment and shortly afterwards founded his namesake bicycle company and went into business with a revolutionary aluminum dualsuspension xc trail bike design that would remain best in class for many years david turners career as a bike maker and designer spans the entire timeline of the dualsuspension revolution only a few among us can make that claim so it was an honor to sit down with the man and swap stories about the tech side of the sport past and present how long have you been making mountain bikesthe first bike i designed was  when pinkbike visited you saw a red painted steel bike prototype that had a strut style shock bolted behind the seat tube that design never saw production and was built in  how did you get started i had been working for amp research after quitting racer life and was not really getting along with the boss as a former mountain bike racer i was not really used to working with others and working for a boss who did not share my opinions on what a bike should ride like was not good for my future so after another heated discussion down the road i wentturner made his first prototype in  it was not put into production in favor of his rockerlink design which remains the predominant rear suspension to this day  david turner photo what was your inspirationi was a racer first and there i experienced the suspension revolution first hand starting with rockshox and manitou showing up at events with prototypes several of us were racing and testing those early forks i knew that rear suspension must surely follow and as one of the first frontsuspension racerstest riders i couldimagine what was possible if rear suspension could be added to the mountain bike i kept thinking about rear suspension and how it could be done in the winter i was racing district  hare and hounds on my yz when i noted that the atk brand had notably better suspension than all the other motorcycles i was passing so i checked out the rear suspension which was very different than anything at the time or since and realized i should talk to the owner of the company about bicycle suspension in talking with horst leitner the engineer of the atk he shared an idea of a pivot location that would create enough antisquat so that the bicycle would bob less while pedaling but still remain active under hard pedaling and brake loads horst leitner far left and the atk crew similar to present dh designs the atk used guide rollers to keep chain tension from acting upon the suspension – amp research image tell us about your first designthe first production bike had a massive  millimeters of rearwheel travel and geometry that was not a whole lot different than the crosscountry bikes of the era what set it apart from the amp bikes was that i had pushed the antisquat characteristics further than horst as i was very much still pedaling in anger and wanted a tighter feel under power the whole structure of the bike was designed to resist flex as well with big pivot shafts good bushing overlap square tubes in the rear end for lateral control and compared to so many frames at the time the main frame tubes were bigger i will be the first to admit that compared to current bikes the early burner was by no means stiff but at the time there were so so many hunks of junk that i think my bike stood outthe burner with its horstlink type suspension was turners first production model it became a blueprint for many successors in the budding mountain bike industry what was the landscape like when you founded turner bikes it was still the frontier of a new sport and business segment it seemed that there was a massive number of mtb business’ that were selling everything from tiny anodized alloy bolts to linkage forks imaginations were running wild and the excitement of a new sport as well as the possibility of breaking into a new business created a rush of people and ideas companies were popping up right and left and many were creating product that was in many cases were truly the first in modern history what were your largest challenges during those early times the production getting the money to pay for the materials labor and services required to build a batch of frames—taking the product from the design phase and through to production unlike most early frame makers you contracted out your designs from the beginning how did you come to that decision i was not skilled enough at fabrication to align with my vision of the best bike i wanted to sell a bike with workmanship that was far greater than my proto level scabbing could create and i really wanted my frames to be awesome not just stick the tubes together as so many welders could i designed really cool machined parts and had a machine shop make those parts and i had really skilled welders put the frames together i sought out the specialists for each of the steps and parts to get what i thought at the time was the best product do you believe that bicycle manufacturing will ever return to the usa i wish a lot of manufacturing would come back not just bicycles but more of the bigvolume products most citizens use it is hard to believe it will happen with so many of us concerned with instant gratification and spending vast amounts of time seeking out the lowest possible price in any given product segment one problem is that with the low cost of imports over the last few decades we have grown accustomed to getting a tremendous amount of perceived cool or volume for our money overcoming this will be a massive challenge getting the wants of the buyer aligned with a retail price closer to current import pricing i think that the only way to compete with offshore labor costs is with new technology our labor will always be higher so we have to engineer machines and cutting edge technology and processes to be competitive when i use the word manufacturing i am seeing factories building thousands of bikes a month this would make a dent in the number of imports we do have some well run highvolume fab shops in the usa with incredible quality and great people but these are not factories and they are not going to make a dent in our yearly bicycle imports if riders would start supporting them more we could start making progress toward higher volumes it seemed like the larger established brands fell behind the dualsuspension development curve for a sizable portion of those early years what is your take on that the big companies employ smart managers why knock yourself out with new designs and updates and tooling every few months or even every year when the little guys are doing it for you things were changing so fast in the early era of mountain bikes and then again during the full suspension phase that i think it was better for them to take a conservative approach to development i believe some companies let the smaller brands feel out the market direction and then they would follow with the massive dealer networks the larger companies had it’s not like they weren’t selling bikes they just weren’t selling the cutting edge or the best bikesthe prototype rfx turner abandoned the horstlink suspension system that he founded his brand with to avoid being harassed by patent holders his choice to go with dave weagles dwlink would prove to be the better decision when the er took root it seems like it spurred a decade of rampant development including the component industry’s newstandardeveryweek club how did that affect smaller builders like turner bikes we have seen some of the big companies go from moderately misguided and largely crap advancements in the early days to creating smoke where there was no fire most of the big companies are now creating micro changes some proprietary some as new standards all for nominal performance gains but with maximal marketing opportunities the managers now realize that in order to create big marketing opportunities you have to have something to feed the public from one year to the next i think it is actually cost effective at their massive size to just drag and drop a few millimeters here or there order up some new bits from the parts and accessory companies then spend the next  months telling everyone their new bike is insane and to get a new one or your next ride will suck and that is hard on all the smaller companies as we do not have the economies of scale to effectively amortize as many tooling changes don’t get me wrong todays bikes are the best ever but many of those changes have done nothing to actually improve our ride and have been created primarily for a marketing opportunity or cost savings  to the great pain in the ass not only for me but for the hundreds of thousands of riders trying to keep their bikes working for a reasonable amount of time do you foresee a point where there will be no standardization at all when larger bike makers build bikes to their own specs like the automotive industry does when beyond tires and some cockpit items there will be no crossover components between brands you mean like the original schwinn honestly i am surprised that we have not seen a much more massive application of proprietary dimensions and designs from the companies that in a hundred different ways already make everything but the drivetrain brakes and dampers i think it will be a fantastic way to make sure customers keep returning to their brands’ shops as they will be the only place with the special service tools factory training and of course proprietary parts to keep that sucker working as higherend sales transition to increasingly complicated motor bikes over the next several years this will be that much easier its not like you can pull a honda motor today and drop it into a yamaha or a nissan parts into a toyota right why should one be able to drop a bosch motor into a chassis originally designed around a brose carbon fiber threatened to be the barrier wall between wellmoneyed large brands that could ante up for the technology and smaller brands that were relegated to lessexpensive aluminum production apparently that did not transpire just my guess but i think the number of full carbon bikes from niche brands on the trails is higher than most of the large brands i am constantly watching the brandsmodels of the bikes wherever i ride and the highercost builds seem to favor the smaller brands none of the big brands are making anything better than most of the smaller companies products different sure overpriced absolutely it makes no sense when the economies of scale are taken into consideration looking at spec sheets the smaller brands are usually a better buy as well that might be one of the reasons they are popular with the more experienced riders who can wade thru the downgraded hidden parts specs of highvolume producers once mountain bikers start looking at higher performance options the smaller brands make their short list so in most cases a rider can get classleading performance and something unique when they buy a bike from a niche brand  and have something not associated with entry level bikes from the big companies think about it from  to  many of the big companies bikes are made to look similar but when one shows up to the trail head with a really nice bike from one of the several small brands there is no way it will be confused with a big brands lowprice option made to look like their team bikesthe flux carbon  david turner photo today if you asked where dualsuspension trail bikes came from most everyone would claim that they evolved from downhill designs but that wasn’t the case was it no it has always been about trail bikes yes the bikes we ride today are partly influenced by features of a dh bike  most notably the bar and stems but if trail bikes truly descended from dh bikes we would not even bother to ride them up fact is most bikes today are still in the pedalbike lineage morphing along as trail design and riders interaction with the terrain changes you are one of the better riders i know but none of us can hang with a national level or world cup dh racer how did you make the transition from making trail bikes to building wellregarded downhill designswhen i was designing the dhr my thinking wasn’t only world cup level but building the best bike i could for most downhill racers i got as much info as i could from the highest level athletes i knew or sponsored of course but in the end i knew that most of the dhrs would be customer owned as we never had the money to buy our way onto a highlevel team so i really wanted to make a great bike for the weekend warrior i think it can be also be attributed to my ability to interpret the desires of racers and transfer those to a bike design to better understand their world i walked every national downhill course on race day at every venue in north america  watching how bikes worked and how different level riders rode helped put me in their game when getting the postrace feedback from athletes for a couple seasons i also raced ageclass expert for fun and total immersion i learned a lot standing in lift lines and start paddockstwo dhr downhill frames on turners wall of fame the original singlepivotswingarm version right beside the mostrecent dwlink chassis interest in downhill bikes seemed to gain strength during the freeride movement and then spike as gravity parks opened worldwide now the focus seems to have shifted to venues like the rampage fest and world cup dh how relevant are downhill bikes to the sport at large they are just as relevant as f or nascar to the cars we all drive in other words minor the world cup rampage crankworx etc are not about building bikes for participants but creating advertainment materials so from a business standpoint dh bikes are very relevant by hiring world cup level riders companies hope to impress upon the viewing audience that their bikes are great but the truth is riders at that level can race frozen dog shit and kick ass and many do it’s all about marketing win on sunday sell on monday how if at all does the long travel enduro bike play into that equation very different the enduro bike is just a more comfortable capable and ultimately enjoyable way for most of us to ride a bicycle in the dirt and that is who most of us are  mountain bikersrfx v was the first design from turner tailored for enduro racing is there a difference between an enduro bike and a longtravel trail bike it might be splitting hairs but yes errr no uh maybe at this time enduro is generally associated with racing therefore an enduro bike should be properly outfitted to race tires and rims are the biggest difference between someone pedaling against the clock and one having a fun day with your buds after that all these bikes are shopped for and built with the individual riders opinion of the optimal blend of up and downhill performance based on their own budget fitness terrain and of course trends kinda like the different ways to say car so many words describe what is basically the same kind of vehicle i don’t own an enduro bike i have a millimetertravel trail bike haha theoretically if there were no negative effects on the bike’s pedaling performance would there be a limit where suspension travel would become detrimental to a good performing trail bike yes i think so that’s weight as long as we are talking performance bicycles weight is always going to be a factor adding a bunch of travel will end up making the weight higher and that will always affect someone pedaling up a hill the longer the travel the heavier everything will need to be more travel ultimately means more downhill speed so heavier frame and fork for sure but especially rims and tires longer fork travel means more fork leg length so we would need bigger diameter thicker legs so instead of the svelte  to pound bikes we have access to today we would end up well over  pounds and no matter how efficient the linkage or suspension is heavier is still harder to move uphill budget builds would skyrocket that weight to backbreaking numbers without belaboring the wheelsize debate what did you learn most from building mountain bikes with all three current diameters that there is no perfect size wheel for everyone and that somewhere along the way the tire and rim makers should have gone to a beadseat diameter based labeling system instead of the stupid system we have for example calling a bike  or sixfiftybee that wheel size could really have an effective diameter range of less than  inches up to  inches with the same bsd what improvements do you think are most critical to the mountain bike at presentbrakes of all the leaps the mountain bike has gone through since the days you wielded a torch i say disc brakes second would be tires modern tires are sooo much better than back in the old days if you had to build the one bike that you would have to ride for the rest of your life what would it be like the short answer is not electric powered a fully rigid titanium single speed with  x  wheels—massively long top tube mm wide bar and a quiet hub nothing to do on it but change tires and grips and head into the dirt you have been along for the ride almost from the inception of the mountain bike and certainly through its most important development stages in your experience what is most promising about our sport and what do you regret most promising that our insatiable appetites will continue to push virtually every part of the sport and bikes for little or for great for better or for worse the sport will keep changing seeing those changes for a bike addict is constant entertainmentregret that i did not buy stock in amazon… this is not an easy career choice looking back what motivated you most to make mountain bikes and what drives you to continue today first i really knew i could do a better bike than what was available there was so much crap on the market in the early ‘s and i had this clarity of vision that i could design a great bike i think that’s what it takes to go into business for oneself—a belief so strong that one will go to unreasonable lengths and sacrifices to compete i am a bike geek first and foremost so being in the business is the pinnacle of bicycle immersion i would rather ride a bike than any other past time i would do it wearing lycra or baggies flats or clips with or without a shifter or a helmet—it’s all good the act of pedaling is still the coolest thing—step on pedals and go places tweet add to favorites must read this week must watch brandon semenuk  raw  v

them up so bad every one had to be recalled luckily i got my hand on a re worked one its perfectohi personally got to test out that frame on the left or one of its prototype brothers stoked to see it

head tubes on that first batch how did sapa go from producing every single dhr and as far as i know never having a head tube failure to then pumping out their most highly anticipated turner to date and and as i was told so its third hand info the first  dhrs off the line cracking the head tube the first ride what went down for something so polar opposite to occur never understood reply   bizutch jul   at   scotttherider also its been a while but for some reason i remember someone trying to come in maybe former sapa employees and trying to somehow fill the void building us bikes in the same town or facility for some of the same bike companies reply   scotttherider jul   at   bizutch i left in  shortly after we started welding out the third iterations of the dhr with the round tubes instead of the square tubes that still had the link driven single point design i was there when our guy that was over quality and shipping broke off and took some of our better help i left solely because of false promises on advancement and compensation sapa had great employees but was not great to their employees it was a good learning experience and great stepping stone reply   furman jul

that f reference i really cant watch road sports and then when you watch the tour de france youre still looking at a nice scenery f racing is on an isolated asphalt track without jumps and a gravel pit for a scenery and then the technology currently there is a driver from my country the netherlands competing i dont really follow the racing but the only news reports im getting is him moaning about his car breaking down his dad used to race too what i do remember about him is that they illegally messed with the refueling equipment to be able to refuel faster spilled and set the car alight he survived but couldnt finish the race so thats f technology stuff that with even that many technicians around doesnt even survive a couple of hours racing i dont want any of that techology near my bike or car sure aerospace technology i dont mind having that trickle down into my gear they want performance too but never skim on decent reliability and safety f tech with reliability so low that you never get to know about the performance gtfo reply   kabrap jul   at   vinay i think the f reference was more geared along the lines of car companies dont make f cars to sell f cars one of the main reasons they do it is to strengthen their brand image sure some technology trickles its way down to commercial cars but a big portion of f is to promote and sell the brand this applies to downhill ski racing and downhill mountain biking the same fis ski racing isnt primarily done to sell fislevel skis but to promote the brand behind the skis same for downhill bike racing and downhill bikes reply   russthedog jul   at   kabrap whilst i do think that dh is largely the f of mtb i dont think f cars is a good analogy for dh bikes most of us ride the bikes the wc dhers ride for a start kramz  the impression i got is he isnt into racing that much all good he can be into whatever it doesnt surprise me considering he gets no business or benefit out of it since hes not in it business guys will always promote what supports them so i wouldnt read too much into it its just like his opinion mana final thought  if any trail bike descended as well as a dh bike it would be super rad

most frames and components the world cup uses are not exactly the commercial bikes available to us while the commercial bikes we buy are totally inspired and based on the world cup there are often tweaks made sram black box fox rad lighterthinner aluminums special rocker links carbon layups etc that are not commercially available almost never is a commercial bike  what is used on the world cupbut the main point turner was making is that downhill bikes are a very small fraction of a companys overall turnover companies participate in world cup racing not to mainly sell downhill bikes but to promote and sell the brand selling downhill bikes is secondary promoting the brand is primary reply   russthedog jul   at   kabrap theres an article on dirt mag worth a read theyre more stock than youmight think agree re reasons to participate for sure reply   incubus jul   at   dgww like what audi wont put a single dollar into an f racing program because they feel that the technologies developed in f offer little to no benefit to their consumer cars as vinay mentioned much of what is developed for an f race car is intended to last the short duration of a single race lms racing on the other hand is a whole different story reply   takeiteasyridehard jul   at   russthedog f may not be a good analogy for resorts or wherever you live aparently but for the large majority of

incubus jul   at   usmc im not saying that motorsports racing doesnt result in trickledown technology to road cars im just saying that if you look at the different types of racing f in particular contributes very little this is especially true today as road cars inch closer to maximum fuel efficiency even from an aerodynamics perspective how much can open wheeled f shapes help a typical five passenger vehicle whereas nascar at least uses bodies that somewhat mimic the shape of road cars lms think  hours of le mans has a very high rate of trickle down tech those cars need to be fuel efficient need to be durable need to be able to illuminate a roadway etc reply   mrgonzo jul   at   it does filter down look at just one example shimano xtr has features that filter down to the

bikes reply   zhendo jul   at   his point on pricing from big brands is absolutely accurate its what has created a window for companies like yt canyon etc in the north american market trek and specialized have by far the largest brand reach but they overprice the shit out of their bikes economies of scale are very real especially with carbon frames where volume is key to pay off the costs of tooling rather than promoting proprietary suspension products and other features the big boys will have to come to grips with realistic product margins in an industry where small companies are cranking out bikes that are as good or better reply   bman jul   at   are you asking the bike companies themselves to take the hit or the bike shops workingrunning a shop offon for  years i can tell you that the shops have very low margins on the majority of products sold especially compared to other traditional retail industries reply   zhendo jul   at   bman i worked in a shop at one point and was shocked by how low the margins are  i would never suggest that shops take the hit i think the companies are the ones that need to get real and take the hitexample a trek slash  frameset is  on their website for the frame and shock for being a massive brand that can crank out a lot of frames every year in volume thats pretty outrageous meanwhile smaller companies are coming in with frames that are much cheaper and still not selling direct reply   chasejj jul   at   bman but hey specialized needs to have free espresso and snacks in their museum someones gotta paythats why i wont get anymore carbon bikes all taiwanchina made and extremely limited and conservative on sizing which inihibits real innovations in geometry oh and they dont really ride any better that i can tell and ive owned the best of them sold them all aluminumsteelti can still be made here in small batches by artisans in the us think about it turner has moved production overseas not because he wanted to or for more money but to simply survive in this marketplace i truly hope they can somehow figure out bringing at least some models back to us production reply   carym jul   at   to me shops have two problems the first is an unwillingness to give up on unprofitable high end bikes they are great at entry level and getting people into the sport and consumers unwilling to pay for expertise it is far more efficient for consumers to buy bikes direct from manufactures but they nead to learn and shops need to reinforce that it is okay to go to an lbs and pay for setup and repairs that experience and knowledge has value i am no different than the next guy i mail order and save where i can but when i need a part in a hurry i gladly pay my lbs retail for the convience and speed reply   waterbear jul

alliance of stores with collective bargaining power reply   bman jul   at   waterbear not sure about that im sure many corporate stores have volume discounts reply   bustacrimes jul   at   hah love this put up a turner interview and there is damn near universal praise and genuine love for the brand put up an ellesworth and note the difference its nice that the pb forum sees the difference between genuine bike people and business people we could do with more turners and less bs reply   nonk jul   at   david is one of the best guys in the industry hes also the best rider of anyone who owns a bike company thats why his bikes are so dialed buying his bikes doesnt support marketing advertising or trends just david developing really good bikes and his wife crushing it hard ive been seeing all of these new school cross country bikes out and theyre only about  years behind the czar which is still the best of that crop mine is aging and the only thing ive ridden that i would replace it with is another czar climbs like a scalded cat and descends like a bike with way more travel i routinely crush my buddies on enduro bikes with it on techy downhills the new rfx bucks a few trends but is more fun in most places for most riders because of that really fun when it gets tight and flicky and chunky thats the one i take to moab once it cools off a bit reply   waterbear jul   at   david turner may now be my favorite person in the bicycle industry and i threw my lot in with the canfield brosthere are a few guys that ride turners around here one whose been riding turners for over a decade they have a very good reputation over all reply   brahma jul   at   i bought my first turner a  rfx in late  i still have the bike and in fact rode it last night i have upgraded it through the years and it still works flawlessly i turned many people on to the bikes as well including aquaholic who became a bit of a defacto test rider for dave for many years until he went back to jetskiing at one point i had four turners a  flux then a  five spot that i built up for my son when he was  i still have a  burner that i loaned to a friend for his son to ride all great bikes the rfx has been transformed into a  bike with mm wide rims and  tires its great for when i take kitesurfing trips to baja to ride around the loamy trails and get me to and from the launch point i always had great customer service from dave i remember when i ordered the rfx i was talking to dave on the phone he asked me what trails i was going to be riding and i was debating to go with rim brakes or disc brakes which was still a question at that time when i mentioned telonix he replied you need to put disc brakes on that bike or youre going to be blasting down telonix so fast youll end up on laguna canyon road without them ill never forget that comment i of course went with the discs and never looked back take a look at my photos if you want to look at some of these iconic bikes reply   loaded jul   at   the dude is a legend ill probably get hated for the idea but he should sell out like gary fisher and go design bikes for one of the big brands times are changing and in order to compete in this marking driven industry deep pockets are needed if your reading this dave please go start designing bikes for one of the big guys get a fat salary ins benefits and a sweet k i would love to buy a modern day turner even if its made in a big brand factory reply   scottmartin jul   at   totally different psychology if you could spend your life just messing around with bikes wouldnt you want to there are people like dave tom teesdale frank the welder etc who do quite nicely as independents with a type of freedom theyd never have inside the giantspeck machine reply   loaded jul   at   scottmartin you cant play around with things forever and expect to keep paying the bills unfortunately life expenses get in the way and having a nice retirement nest egg makes the later years of life much sweeter the idea is save enough money so you can just fck around and have fun when you get older not saying this is the only way but its the plan that lets you sleep good at night for most reply

weeks ago and asked dt about a new dh bike not happening too expensive to make at his standards he did say if he ever made another dh bike itll be single speed something cheaper and more affordable

dream bike though a fully rigid titanium single speed with  x  wheels—massively long top tube mm wide bar and a quiet hub both because he was one of the first to see the benefits of suspension and also because his bikes have always gone with a shorter reach which is something that i prefer guess hes just riding different trails these days reply   iamamodel jul   at   great article thank you id

thats carbon vs alloy reply   fiatpolski jul   at   probably those expensive carbon rims but im puzzled too reply   homerjm jul   at   i think enduro racers need a beefier tiredouble carcass or very reinforced and foam inserts to prevent a flat most people runs on regular  tires tubeless and alloy rimslucky people run on fancy carbon rims  flat while racing and your are donego home and think for the next race if i get a flat i look for a good place to rest a little bit while and repair it whit no worry at all reply   sonofbovril jul   at   i think its a case of needing stronger rims  more protective tires for racing because the guys are going faster and hitting things harder not to mention how a puncture can be detrimental to their race against the clock reply   rootminus jul   at   id have thought the opposite to the commenters above racers will want to have to haul less weight around admittedly not at a total sacrifice to durability whereas your average weekend joe park basher is probably going to want the shiny carbon rims to last as long as resonably possible despite the cased jumps and rocky line choices they inevitably put them through reply   vinay jul   at   i guess the weekend warrior just wants something that lasts and doesnt care about something thats marginally faster whereas the racer needs to go fast and is willing to invest in that and may even go as far as compromise some durability so if a tire is worn in two weeks thats good enough for the racers but thats going to put off the regular rider reply   wrcdh jul   at   i love it when pastor dave preaches

grapes hes always bagging on larger companies but hed be running one of those larger companies if things would have worked out for himand him complaining about other companies marketing after trying to convince everyone tnt was just as good as horst especially when he turned around and paid someone else for their suspension technology soon after that is hypocritical wheres his innovation reply   stiingya jul   at   chasejj thats business big or small its always a risk vs reward question forecasting consumer trends for all everyone bitches about anything new in mountain bikes as a conglomerate we still vote with their wallets for all the new stuff every timethe dw burner was conservative the market for an aluminum dw rfx was ready and willing they held off to go carbon and by the time they got the bike to market the geometry was already out of date because the market had shifted reply   jollyxroger jul   at   chasejj  i believe some companies let the smaller brands feel out the market direction and then they would follow with the massive dealer networks the larger companies had it’s not like they weren’t selling bikes they just weren’t selling the cutting edge or the best bikesso

make it or break it like pole and zerode each in their field are doing reply   bmack jul   at   for a guy who greatly built his companys reputation on his dh bike he sure is disenchanted with them to dismiss downhill as mearly a marketing ploy and no more relevant than an f car is to disregard a significant user base as well as a respected and loved form of ridingracing none of us here will ever own an f car but many of us have or have had a downhill bike to dismiss them like that makes me think that turner is more concerned with marketing to the deep pocketed masses than recognizing the awesome diversity in this sport and how it all has a place on the mountain reply   chasejj jul   at   pretty sure dts his point was that dh bikes dont sell in big numbers but are mainly driving brand awarenessmarketing which if you look at sales numbers are a fact not a denigrating on dh bikes at all reply   scottmartin jul   at   keep in mind that the dh bikes that made the brand were under  of rear travel most people wouldnt even call that xc now unless it was  those first burners and stingers made everyone who rode them all mountain riders which is what made them famous put a normal rider on a modern dh bike he aint headed to the trails thats for sureif you want to cry marketing ploy the original dhr is your target any niche is a marketing ploy but its when the product transcends its market to find a more universal acclaim and usage that the phrase classic comes into use for instance did the turner rail begat slopestyle reply   carym jul   at   downhill bikes just dont sell in large numbers i was talking to a bike shop near northstar last weekend and he told me they dont even stock them anymore because sales came to a stop with enduro bikes taking over that market reply

turners life revolves around two wheels twentyfive years ago turner was racing both motorcycles and mountain bikes when another guy with the same last name paul turner introduced suspension forks to the bicycle world dave turner was one of the lucky few who were given those early prototypes for competition testing it was an ahha moment for the young crosscountry racer who knew that the instant popularity of suspension forks would inevitably lead to fullsuspension mountain bikes dave immediately set out to learn as much as he could about rear suspension and how it might be adapted to suit the needs of finicky mountain bike riders turner was lucky to fall in with the sharpest suspension designer of the moment and shortly afterwards founded his namesake bicycle company and went into business with a revolutionary aluminum dualsuspension xc trail bike design that would remain best in class for many years david turners career as a bike maker and designer spans the entire timeline of the dualsuspension revolution only a few among us can make that claim so it was an honor to sit down with the man and swap stories about the tech side of the sport past and present how long have you been making mountain bikesthe first bike i designed was  when pinkbike visited you saw a red painted steel bike prototype that had a strut style shock bolted behind the seat tube that design never saw production and was built in  how did you get started i had been working for amp research after quitting racer life and was not really getting along with the boss as a former mountain bike racer i was not really used to working with others and working for a boss who did not share my opinions on what a bike should ride like was not good for my future so after another heated discussion down the road i wentturner made his first prototype in  it was not put into production in favor of his rockerlink design which remains the predominant rear suspension to this day  david turner photo what was your inspirationi was a racer first and there i experienced the suspension revolution first hand starting with rockshox and manitou showing up at events with prototypes several of us were racing and testing those early forks i knew that rear suspension must surely follow and as one of the first frontsuspension racerstest riders i couldimagine what was possible if rear suspension could be added to the mountain bike i kept thinking about rear suspension and how it could be done in the winter i was racing district  hare and hounds on my yz when i noted that the atk brand had notably better suspension than all the other motorcycles i was passing so i checked out the rear suspension which was very different than anything at the time or since and realized i should talk to the owner of the company about bicycle suspension in talking with horst leitner the engineer of the atk he shared an idea of a pivot location that would create enough antisquat so that the bicycle would bob less while pedaling but still remain active under hard pedaling and brake loads horst leitner far left and the atk crew similar to present dh designs the atk used guide rollers to keep chain tension from acting upon the suspension – amp research image tell us about your first designthe first production bike had a massive  millimeters of rearwheel travel and geometry that was not a whole lot different than the crosscountry bikes of the era what set it apart from the amp bikes was that i had pushed the antisquat characteristics further than horst as i was very much still pedaling in anger and wanted a tighter feel under power the whole structure of the bike was designed to resist flex as well with big pivot shafts good bushing overlap square tubes in the rear end for lateral control and compared to so many frames at the time the main frame tubes were bigger i will be the first to admit that compared to current bikes the early burner was by no means stiff but at the time there were so so many hunks of junk that i think my bike stood outthe burner with its horstlink type suspension was turners first production model it became a blueprint for many successors in the budding mountain bike industry what was the landscape like when you founded turner bikes it was still the frontier of a new sport and business segment it seemed that there was a massive number of mtb business’ that were selling everything from tiny anodized alloy bolts to linkage forks imaginations were running wild and the excitement of a new sport as well as the possibility of breaking into a new business created a rush of people and ideas companies were popping up right and left and many were creating product that was in many cases were truly the first in modern history what were your largest challenges during those early times the production getting the money to pay for the materials labor and services required to build a batch of frames—taking the product from the design phase and through to production unlike most early frame makers you contracted out your designs from the beginning how did you come to that decision i was not skilled enough at fabrication to align with my vision of the best bike i wanted to sell a bike with workmanship that was far greater than my proto level scabbing could create and i really wanted my frames to be awesome not just stick the tubes together as so many welders could i designed really cool machined parts and had a machine shop make those parts and i had really skilled welders put the frames together i sought out the specialists for each of the steps and parts to get what i thought at the time was the best product do you believe that bicycle manufacturing will ever return to the usa i wish a lot of manufacturing would come back not just bicycles but more of the bigvolume products most citizens use it is hard to believe it will happen with so many of us concerned with instant gratification and spending vast amounts of time seeking out the lowest possible price in any given product segment one problem is that with the low cost of imports over the last few decades we have grown accustomed to getting a tremendous amount of perceived cool or volume for our money overcoming this will be a massive challenge getting the wants of the buyer aligned with a retail price closer to current import pricing i think that the only way to compete with offshore labor costs is with new technology our labor will always be higher so we have to engineer machines and cutting edge technology and processes to be competitive when i use the word manufacturing i am seeing factories building thousands of bikes a month this would make a dent in the number of imports we do have some well run highvolume fab shops in the usa with incredible quality and great people but these are not factories and they are not going to make a dent in our yearly bicycle imports if riders would start supporting them more we could start making progress toward higher volumes it seemed like the larger established brands fell behind the dualsuspension development curve for a sizable portion of those early years what is your take on that the big companies employ smart managers why knock yourself out with new designs and updates and tooling every few months or even every year when the little guys are doing it for you things were changing so fast in the early era of mountain bikes and then again during the full suspension phase that i think it was better for them to take a conservative approach to development i believe some companies let the smaller brands feel out the market direction and then they would follow with the massive dealer networks the larger companies had it’s not like they weren’t selling bikes they just weren’t selling the cutting edge or the best bikesthe prototype rfx turner abandoned the horstlink suspension system that he founded his brand with to avoid being harassed by patent holders his choice to go with dave weagles dwlink would prove to be the better decision when the er took root it seems like it spurred a decade of rampant development including the component industry’s newstandardeveryweek club how did that affect smaller builders like turner bikes we have seen some of the big companies go from moderately misguided and largely crap advancements in the early days to creating smoke where there was no fire most of the big companies are now creating micro changes some proprietary some as new standards all for nominal performance gains but with maximal marketing opportunities the managers now realize that in order to create big marketing opportunities you have to have something to feed the public from one year to the next i think it is actually cost effective at their massive size to just drag and drop a few millimeters here or there order up some new bits from the parts and accessory companies then spend the next  months telling everyone their new bike is insane and to get a new one or your next ride will suck and that is hard on all the smaller companies as we do not have the economies of scale to effectively amortize as many tooling changes don’t get me wrong todays bikes are the best ever but many of those changes have done nothing to actually improve our ride and have been created primarily for a marketing opportunity or cost savings  to the great pain in the ass not only for me but for the hundreds of thousands of riders trying to keep their bikes working for a reasonable amount of time do you foresee a point where there will be no standardization at all when larger bike makers build bikes to their own specs like the automotive industry does when beyond tires and some cockpit items there will be no crossover components between brands you mean like the original schwinn honestly i am surprised that we have not seen a much more massive application of proprietary dimensions and designs from the companies that in a hundred different ways already make everything but the drivetrain brakes and dampers i think it will be a fantastic way to make sure customers keep returning to their brands’ shops as they will be the only place with the special service tools factory training and of course proprietary parts to keep that sucker working as higherend sales transition to increasingly complicated motor bikes over the next several years this will be that much easier its not like you can pull a honda motor today and drop it into a yamaha or a nissan parts into a toyota right why should one be able to drop a bosch motor into a chassis originally designed around a brose carbon fiber threatened to be the barrier wall between wellmoneyed large brands that could ante up for the technology and smaller brands that were relegated to lessexpensive aluminum production apparently that did not transpire just my guess but i think the number of full carbon bikes from niche brands on the trails is higher than most of the large brands i am constantly watching the brandsmodels of the bikes wherever i ride and the highercost builds seem to favor the smaller brands none of the big brands are making anything better than most of the smaller companies products different sure overpriced absolutely it makes no sense when the economies of scale are taken into consideration looking at spec sheets the smaller brands are usually a better buy as well that might be one of the reasons they are popular with the more experienced riders who can wade thru the downgraded hidden parts specs of highvolume producers once mountain bikers start looking at higher performance options the smaller brands make their short list so in most cases a rider can get classleading performance and something unique when they buy a bike from a niche brand  and have something not associated with entry level bikes from the big companies think about it from  to  many of the big companies bikes are made to look similar but when one shows up to the trail head with a really nice bike from one of the several small brands there is no way it will be confused with a big brands lowprice option made to look like their team bikesthe flux carbon  david turner photo today if you asked where dualsuspension trail bikes came from most everyone would claim that they evolved from downhill designs but that wasn’t the case was it no it has always been about trail bikes yes the bikes we ride today are partly influenced by features of a dh bike  most notably the bar and stems but if trail bikes truly descended from dh bikes we would not even bother to ride them up fact is most bikes today are still in the pedalbike lineage morphing along as trail design and riders interaction with the terrain changes you are one of the better riders i know but none of us can hang with a national level or world cup dh racer how did you make the transition from making trail bikes to building wellregarded downhill designswhen i was designing the dhr my thinking wasn’t only world cup level but building the best bike i could for most downhill racers i got as much info as i could from the highest level athletes i knew or sponsored of course but in the end i knew that most of the dhrs would be customer owned as we never had the money to buy our way onto a highlevel team so i really wanted to make a great bike for the weekend warrior i think it can be also be attributed to my ability to interpret the desires of racers and transfer those to a bike design to better understand their world i walked every national downhill course on race day at every venue in north america  watching how bikes worked and how different level riders rode helped put me in their game when getting the postrace feedback from athletes for a couple seasons i also raced ageclass expert for fun and total immersion i learned a lot standing in lift lines and start paddockstwo dhr downhill frames on turners wall of fame the original singlepivotswingarm version right beside the mostrecent dwlink chassis interest in downhill bikes seemed to gain strength during the freeride movement and then spike as gravity parks opened worldwide now the focus seems to have shifted to venues like the rampage fest and world cup dh how relevant are downhill bikes to the sport at large they are just as relevant as f or nascar to the cars we all drive in other words minor the world cup rampage crankworx etc are not about building bikes for participants but creating advertainment materials so from a business standpoint dh bikes are very relevant by hiring world cup level riders companies hope to impress upon the viewing audience that their bikes are great but the truth is riders at that level can race frozen dog shit and kick ass and many do it’s all about marketing win on sunday sell on monday how if at all does the long travel enduro bike play into that equation very different the enduro bike is just a more comfortable capable and ultimately enjoyable way for most of us to ride a bicycle in the dirt and that is who most of us are  mountain bikersrfx v was the first design from turner tailored for enduro racing is there a difference between an enduro bike and a longtravel trail bike it might be splitting hairs but yes errr no uh maybe at this time enduro is generally associated with racing therefore an enduro bike should be properly outfitted to race tires and rims are the biggest difference between someone pedaling against the clock and one having a fun day with your buds after that all these bikes are shopped for and built with the individual riders opinion of the optimal blend of up and downhill performance based on their own budget fitness terrain and of course trends kinda like the different ways to say car so many words describe what is basically the same kind of vehicle i don’t own an enduro bike i have a millimetertravel trail bike haha theoretically if there were no negative effects on the bike’s pedaling performance would there be a limit where suspension travel would become detrimental to a good performing trail bike yes i think so that’s weight as long as we are talking performance bicycles weight is always going to be a factor adding a bunch of travel will end up making the weight higher and that will always affect someone pedaling up a hill the longer the travel the heavier everything will need to be more travel ultimately means more downhill speed so heavier frame and fork for sure but especially rims and tires longer fork travel means more fork leg length so we would need bigger diameter thicker legs so instead of the svelte  to pound bikes we have access to today we would end up well over  pounds and no matter how efficient the linkage or suspension is heavier is still harder to move uphill budget builds would skyrocket that weight to backbreaking numbers without belaboring the wheelsize debate what did you learn most from building mountain bikes with all three current diameters that there is no perfect size wheel for everyone and that somewhere along the way the tire and rim makers should have gone to a beadseat diameter based labeling system instead of the stupid system we have for example calling a bike  or sixfiftybee that wheel size could really have an effective diameter range of less than  inches up to  inches with the same bsd what improvements do you think are most critical to the mountain bike at presentbrakes of all the leaps the mountain bike has gone through since the days you wielded a torch i say disc brakes second would be tires modern tires are sooo much better than back in the old days if you had to build the one bike that you would have to ride for the rest of your life what would it be like the short answer is not electric powered a fully rigid titanium single speed with  x  wheels—massively long top tube mm wide bar and a quiet hub nothing to do on it but change tires and grips and head into the dirt you have been along for the ride almost from the inception of the mountain bike and certainly through its most important development stages in your experience what is most promising about our sport and what do you regret most promising that our insatiable appetites will continue to push virtually every part of the sport and bikes for little or for great for better or for worse the sport will keep changing seeing those changes for a bike addict is constant entertainmentregret that i did not buy stock in amazon… this is not an easy career choice looking back what motivated you most to make mountain bikes and what drives you to continue today first i really knew i could do a better bike than what was available there was so much crap on the market in the early ‘s and i had this clarity of vision that i could design a great bike i think that’s what it takes to go into business for oneself—a belief so strong that one will go to unreasonable lengths and sacrifices to compete i am a bike geek first and foremost so being in the business is the pinnacle of bicycle immersion i would rather ride a bike than any other past time i would do it wearing lycra or baggies flats or clips with or without a shifter or a helmet—it’s all good the act of pedaling is still the coolest thing—step on pedals and go places tweet add to favorites must read this week must watch brandon semenuk  raw  v  views commencal supreme sx  mm allmountain bike with hpp

new products year in year out market competition with heaps of dumb or great ideas and standards then selling these over priced products to those who will buy is what allows the industry to fund itself keeping it real is what killed snowboardings market share bros who just wanna ride cant support an superfluous industry reply   wakidesigns jul   at   gdnorm theres still more money in

rfx rode that frame for  years without issue and without being outdated or outclassed over that time i watched many companies release frames with misaligned pivots  crooked frames poor quality or worse then fight with their customers over corrections and warranties i own two turners now people use the term fanboy like its an insult dt runs his business in a way that creates that loyalty reply   bizutch jul   at   spent  minutes on the phone with him  days ago ive owned     dhrs currently own dwlink for  packim only on my rd set of bidding for the  pack since owning it sapa the frame makers at the time ruined the rep of the  dhr by making the head tubes horribly wrong the bikes were pre sold out of this world and they screwed them up so bad every one had to be recalled luckily i got my hand on a re worked one its perfectohi personally got to test out that frame on the left or one of its prototype brothers stoked to see it and have the memories come rushing backanywayif you want to order direct to consumer turner is the only way to go reply   scotttherider jul   at   bizutch i worked for sapa from  and ended up buying and building a dhr i had welded i later rode a high line for

of gems and tips about bike setups reply   bizutch jul   at   scotttherider really so what exactly is the reason for what happened with the head tubes on that first batch how did sapa go from producing every single dhr and as far as i know never having a head tube failure to then pumping out their most highly anticipated turner to date and and as i was told so its third hand info the first  dhrs off the line cracking the head tube the first ride what went down for something so polar opposite to occur never understood reply   bizutch jul   at   scotttherider also its been a while but for some reason i remember someone trying to come in maybe former sapa employees and trying to somehow fill the void building us bikes in the same town or facility for some of the same bike companies reply   scotttherider jul   at   bizutch i left in  shortly after we started welding out the third iterations of the dhr with the round tubes instead of the square tubes that still had the link driven single point design i was there when our guy that was over quality and shipping broke off and took some of our better help i left solely because of false promises on advancement and compensation sapa

in one toques and beanies are like a nice hug for your head if your bald of course i live in the mountains in bc so its a bit different here than in socal but given the rationality of his interview im

at that level can race frozen dog shit and kick ass and many do it’s all about marketing win on sunday sell on mondaythis made me kind of disenchanted with bicycle design you always hope or at least i do that theres some sort of progress being made by perfecting say suspension linkage or design or materials or bearings or hubs kind of like how automobile manufacturers say weve taken what we learned from formula  and integrated it but apparently theyre probably all just talking out their ass reply   kramz jul   at   nice bike wwwturnerbikescomwpcontentuploadsrfxblkturquoisexjpg even that dual suspension from  was way ahead of its time reply   vinay jul   at  below threshold show comment  i never got that f reference i really cant watch road sports and then when you watch the tour de france youre still looking at a nice scenery f racing is on an isolated asphalt track without jumps and a gravel pit for a scenery and then the technology currently there is a driver from my country the netherlands competing i dont really follow the racing but the only news reports im getting is him moaning about his car breaking down his dad used to race too what i do remember about him is that they illegally messed with the refueling equipment to be able to refuel faster spilled and set the car alight he survived but couldnt finish the race so thats f technology stuff that with even that many technicians around doesnt even survive a couple of hours racing i dont want any of that techology near my bike or car sure aerospace technology i dont mind having that trickle down into my gear they want performance too but never skim on decent reliability and safety f tech with reliability so low that you never get to know about the performance gtfo reply   kabrap jul   at   vinay i think the f reference was more geared along the lines of car companies dont make f cars to sell f cars one of the main reasons they do it is to strengthen their brand image sure some technology trickles its way down to commercial cars but a big portion of f is to promote and sell the brand this applies to downhill ski racing and downhill mountain biking the same fis ski racing isnt primarily done to sell fislevel skis but to promote the brand behind the skis same for downhill bike racing and downhill bikes reply   russthedog jul   at   kabrap whilst i do think that dh is largely the f of mtb i dont think f cars is a good analogy for dh bikes most of us ride the bikes the wc dhers ride for a start kramz  the impression i got is he isnt into racing that much all good he can be into whatever it doesnt surprise me considering he gets no business or benefit out of it since hes not in it business guys will always promote what supports them so i wouldnt read too much into it its just like his opinion mana final thought  if any trail bike descended as well as a dh bike it would be super rad reply   newenglandrocks jul   at  below threshold show comment  in racing its about the rider not the bike if it was about the bike all the mens dh wc qualifiers and finals would be dominated by ers reply   dgww jul   at   vinay many critical advancements in consumer automobiles have come from f reply   kabrap jul   at   russthedog obviously true that we can buy a dh bike but not an f car but most frames and components the world cup uses are not exactly the commercial bikes available to us while the commercial bikes we buy are totally inspired and based on the world cup there are often tweaks made sram black box fox rad lighterthinner aluminums special rocker links carbon layups etc that are not commercially available almost never is a commercial bike  what is used on the world cupbut the main point turner was making is that downhill bikes are a very small fraction of a companys overall turnover companies participate in world cup racing not to mainly sell downhill bikes but to promote and sell the brand selling downhill bikes is secondary promoting the brand is primary reply   russthedog jul   at   kabrap theres an article on dirt mag worth a read theyre more stock than youmight think agree re reasons to participate for sure reply   incubus jul   at   dgww like what audi wont put a single dollar into an f racing program because they feel that the technologies developed in f offer little to no benefit to their consumer cars as vinay mentioned much of what is developed for an f race car is intended to last the short duration of a single race lms racing on the other hand is a whole different story reply   takeiteasyridehard jul   at   russthedog f may not be a good analogy for resorts or wherever you live aparently but for the large majority of shopswhich dont even stock a single dh bike dh bikes might as well be f they dont stock them because its such a small portion of the market excluding very few select areas dont get me wrong id love to live in dh bike candyland but i live in wheelchair accessible dirt sidewalk imba land reply   usmc jul   at   incubus autohowstuffworkscomunderthehoodtrendsinnovationstopcartechfromracinghtm wwwpopularmechanicscomcarstechnologyaracinginnovationsrealengineeringhere a couple of websites that offer information on what has trickled down from racing to the everyday modern vehicle reply   incubus jul   at   usmc im not saying that motorsports racing doesnt result in trickledown technology to road cars im just saying that if you look at the different types of racing f in particular contributes very little this is especially true today as road cars inch closer to maximum fuel efficiency even from an aerodynamics perspective how much can open wheeled f shapes help a typical five passenger vehicle whereas nascar at least uses bodies that somewhat mimic the shape of road cars lms think  hours of le mans has a very high rate of trickle down tech those cars need to be fuel efficient need to be durable need to be able to illuminate a roadway etc reply   mrgonzo jul   at   it does filter down look at just one example shimano xtr has features that filter down to the cheaper stuff or like in this article the concept of full suspension started with pro level xc racing and now its the norm reply   waterbear

russthedog jul   at   waterbear confirmation bias is real isnt it reply   russthedog jul   at   takeiteasyridehard i live in australia theres probably three bike parks in the whole country its about km wide theres not many parks so the likelihood of living in one is pretty much zeromost shops here will show off a flagship dh bike at least i cam see if youlive somewhere completely flat itd be a waste of time still doesnt reduce their desire factor though reply   incubus jul   at   russthedog there is nothing more stock than i might think thats the equivalent of saying that the tdfis more similar to my cycling commute than i might think reply   usmc jul   at   incubus the popular mechanics article is solely based on f reply   russthedog jul   at   incubus que reply   waterbear jul   at   russthedog i think that confirmation bias implies that im evaluating evidence in this case im just sharing my cynicism with a more optimistic sort of commenter reply   incubus jul   at   russthedog my bad i misread your reply to kabrap where you said that there are many similarities between commercially available dh bikes and that of a sponsored pros bike while your reference to the dirt rag article shouldve clued me in to what you were referring to when i replied i was under the impression that you were comparing f cars to consumer cars reply   johan jul   at   nice to hear someone on

to keep up with the gearing changes all are x big cassettes now turner customer service is amazing i cannot tell you how many times i have phoned the shop and got dave answering the phone and he will

absolutely eating up the tech keep making good bikes reply   zhendo jul   at   his point on pricing from big brands is absolutely accurate its what has created a window for companies like yt canyon etc in the north american market trek and specialized have by far the largest brand reach but they overprice the shit out of their bikes economies of scale are very real especially with carbon frames where volume is key to pay off the costs of tooling rather than promoting proprietary suspension products and other features the big boys will have to come to grips with realistic product margins in an industry where small companies are cranking out bikes that are as good or better reply   bman jul   at   are you asking the bike companies themselves to take the hit or the bike shops workingrunning a shop offon for  years i can tell you that the shops have very low margins on the majority of products sold especially compared to other traditional retail industries reply   zhendo jul   at   bman i worked in a shop at one point and was shocked by how low the margins are  i would never suggest that shops take the hit i think the companies are the ones that need to get real and take the hitexample a trek slash  frameset is  on their website for the frame and shock for being a massive brand that can crank out a lot of frames every year in volume thats pretty outrageous meanwhile smaller companies are coming in with frames that are much cheaper and still not selling direct reply   chasejj jul   at   bman but hey specialized needs to have free espresso and snacks in their museum someones gotta paythats why i wont get anymore carbon bikes all taiwanchina made and extremely limited and conservative on sizing which inihibits real innovations in geometry oh and they dont really ride any better that i can tell and ive owned the best of them sold them all aluminumsteelti can still be made here in small batches by artisans in the us think about it turner has moved production overseas not because he wanted to or for more money but to simply survive in this marketplace i truly hope they can somehow figure out bringing at least some models back to us production reply   carym jul   at   to me shops have two problems the first is an unwillingness to give up on unprofitable high end bikes they are great at entry level and getting people into the sport and consumers unwilling to pay for expertise it is far more efficient for consumers to buy bikes direct from manufactures but they nead to learn and shops need to reinforce that it is okay to go to an lbs and pay for setup and repairs that experience and knowledge has value i am no different than the next guy i mail order and save where i can but when i need a part in a hurry i gladly pay my lbs retail for the convience and speed reply   waterbear jul   at   bman just out of curiosity have bike shops considered organizing in some way if you want to twist the arm of your suppliers youre going to need numbers i figure something like imba only an alliance of stores with collective bargaining power reply   bman jul   at   waterbear not sure about that im sure many corporate stores have volume discounts reply   bustacrimes jul   at   hah love this put up a turner interview and there is damn near universal praise and genuine love for the brand put up an ellesworth and note the difference its nice that the pb forum sees the difference between genuine bike people and business people we could do with more turners and less bs reply   nonk jul   at   david is one of the best guys in the industry hes also the best rider of anyone who owns a bike company thats why his bikes are so dialed buying his bikes doesnt support marketing advertising or trends just david developing really good bikes and his wife crushing it hard ive been seeing all of these new school cross country bikes out and theyre only about  years behind the czar which is still the best of that crop mine is aging and the only thing ive ridden that i would replace it with is another czar climbs like a scalded cat and descends like a bike with way more travel i routinely crush my buddies on enduro bikes with it on techy downhills the new rfx bucks a few trends but is more fun in most places for most riders because of that really fun when it gets tight and flicky and chunky thats the one i take to moab once it cools off a bit reply   waterbear jul   at   david turner may now be my favorite person in the bicycle industry and i threw my lot in with the canfield brosthere are a few guys that ride turners around here one whose been riding turners for over a decade they have a very good reputation over all reply   brahma jul   at   i bought my first turner a  rfx in late  i still have the bike and in fact rode it last night i have upgraded it through the years and it still works flawlessly i turned many people on to the bikes as well including aquaholic who became a bit of a defacto test rider for dave for many years until he went back to jetskiing at one point i had four turners a  flux then a  five spot that i built up for my son when he was  i still have a  burner that i loaned to a friend for his son to ride all great bikes the rfx has been transformed into a  bike with mm wide rims and  tires its great for when i take kitesurfing trips to baja to ride around the loamy trails and get me to and from the launch point i always had great customer service from dave i remember when i ordered the rfx i was talking to dave on the phone he asked me what trails i was going to be riding and i was debating to go with rim brakes or disc brakes which was still a question at that time when i mentioned telonix he replied you need to put disc brakes on that bike or youre going to be blasting down telonix so fast youll end up on laguna canyon road without them ill never forget that comment i of course went with the discs and never looked back take a look at my photos if you want to look at some of these iconic bikes reply   loaded jul   at   the dude is a legend ill probably get hated for the idea but he should sell out like gary fisher and go design bikes for one of the big brands times are changing and in order to compete in this marking driven industry deep pockets are needed if your reading this dave please go start designing bikes for one of the big guys get a fat salary ins benefits and a sweet k i would love to buy a modern day turner even if its made in a big brand factory reply   scottmartin jul   at   totally different psychology if you could spend your life just messing around with bikes wouldnt you want to there are people like dave tom teesdale frank the welder etc who do quite nicely as independents with a type of freedom theyd never have inside the giantspeck machine reply   loaded jul   at   scottmartin you cant play around with things forever and expect to keep paying the bills unfortunately life expenses get in the way and having a nice retirement nest egg makes the later years of life much sweeter the idea is save enough money so you can just fck around and have fun when you get older not saying this is the only way but its the plan that lets you sleep good at night for most reply   noisette jul   at   what are you on about youre loaded reply   loaded jul   at   noisette loaded as in not sober reply   corinthian plus jul   at

best bike i have owned it was just indestructible would love to see a new dhr pleeeeease dave make one reply   ther jul   at   so many signs from the universe that i should buy a new rfx reply   microfiz jul   at   the orange dwlinked dhr is not the production and the last current frame i think it was the prototype before they drew up the final production frame unless thats a new er dhr coming out lol reply   bizutch jul   at   yup proto good to keep one for a week and rip around on one of them it was heavy and overbuilt for testing if you could look up close and compare to stock the rear swingarm is burlier than stock and the linkage is thick blocky and far fromproduction i loved it though reply   mickmotor jul   at   my first real mountain bike was a anodised gold turner nitrous just like the one hanging on his wall  bikes later and im ditching my full suspension carbon scott spark and putting the finishing touches to a turner  spot i rescued reply   stevet jul   at   another happy  rfx owner here spent my first proper job pay cheque on that thing its the most expensive bike related purchase i ever made £ for an aluminium frame yet the most valuefor money ride it for  years until i have to say that im confused by daves dream bike though a fully rigid titanium single speed with  x  wheels—massively long top tube mm wide bar and a quiet hub both because he was one of the first to see the benefits of suspension and also because his bikes have always gone with a shorter reach which is something that i prefer guess hes just riding different trails these days reply   iamamodel jul   at   great article thank you id like to hear more of the back in the day stories reply   iceage jul   at   turner bikes rule dave is the man thanks for many great years of mtn riding bro reply   lonelydwarfproductions jul   at   a fully rigid titanium single speed with  x  wheels—massively long top tube mm wide bar and a quiet hubso can turner go ahead and make this bike sounds basically perfect reply   carym jul   at   i harrased dave about a hardtail at sea otter i pointed out that even though he said no hardtails years ago because the company is turner suspension bicycles he already did a cross bike i still have my fingers crossed reply   tremeer jul   at   damn it now i want a single speed titanium hardtail reply   zutroy jul   at   carym and the cx bike is sweeeeeet reply   jollyxroger jul   at   when i read that line the question instantly popped what exactly is stopping him from making one at least for himself only reply   georgevorobyov jul   at   by hiring world cup level riders companies hope to impress upon the viewing audience that their bikes are great but the truth is riders at that level can race frozen dog shit and kick ass and many do the truth reply   bigd jul   at   if you want to see what american mountain bike manufacturing can be though its currently on a small scale check out guerrilla gravity what a fantastic company and what great bikes my trail pistol is amazing the spec is competitive with many larger companies the frame is sublime reply   codeblue jul   at   purchased one of the first sultans he produced and for the time it made a er fs rideable when he produced the dw sultan in a great trail bike was borndt was a true innovatoras far as ers are concerned he is behind the times the new breed of trail bikes are just outstanding and turner isnt making onesad reply   fufreddie jul   at   i cant believe  was  years ago already reply   panzer jul   at   i know right i remember those days like it was yesterday reply   scottmartin jul   at   must be something in the name turner between both paul and dave weve got six frames and four forksbutnone of that dw nonsense for me thanks reply   gtill jul   at   dont forget gary turner gt bikes reply   scottmartin jul   at   gtill criminy youre right sgotta be the name reply   phile jul   at   im curiouswhats the difference between enduro racer wheels  tires and weekend warrior wheels  tires for wheels i imagine thats carbon vs alloy reply   fiatpolski jul   at   probably those expensive carbon rims but im puzzled too reply   homerjm jul   at   i think enduro racers need a beefier tiredouble carcass or very reinforced and foam inserts to prevent a flat most people runs on regular  tires tubeless and alloy rimslucky people run on fancy carbon rims  flat while racing and your are donego home and think for the next race if i get a flat i look for a good place to rest a little bit while and repair it whit no worry at all reply   sonofbovril jul   at   i think its a case of needing stronger rims  more protective tires for racing because the guys are going faster and hitting things harder not to mention how a puncture can be detrimental to their race against the clock reply   rootminus jul   at   id have thought the opposite to the commenters above racers will want to have to haul less weight around admittedly not at a total sacrifice to durability whereas your average weekend joe park basher is probably going to want the shiny carbon rims to last as long as resonably possible despite the cased jumps and rocky line choices they inevitably put them through reply   vinay jul   at   i guess the weekend warrior just wants something that lasts and doesnt care about something thats marginally faster whereas the racer needs to go fast and is willing to invest in that and may even go as far as compromise some durability so if a tire is worn in two weeks thats good enough for the racers but thats going to put off the regular rider reply   wrcdh jul   at   i love it when pastor dave preaches his sermons strewn with truth prophecy and retrospective clarity reply   mtbakerpow jul   at   i still compare new dh bikes to my  dhr reply   insanebiker jul   at   i had an  dhr and upgraded to a  dhr significant imporvment over something i did not think could get any better if only the pack was lighter i would still have only turner bikes these guys kick ass reply   skiordie jul   at   they should have worked in a mention of gary turner seemingly a common surname in our industry reply   iggzdaloc jul   at   youre the man dave nothin rides like a turner reply   upchuckyeager jul   at   dt is awesome i wish i had hung on to my old  burner from  lovely machine reply   elliott jul   at   am i the only turner owner that felt let down when they shifted to carbon the welds on my  spot were perfect reply   skid jul   at   i would still like a square tube dhr every once in a while i think about finding one to try some offset shock bushings and slacker headset cups reply   gemma jul   at   shoulda bought a turner reply   benpea jul   at   all i want to know is what happened to the beautiful pack prototype from a few years back now that was a sexy piece of bike reply   zgroove jul   at   still riding my  turner spot very capable still reply   calebtnorman jul   at   those bikes are real head turners reply   jrocksdh jul   at   my old square tube dhr was so good reply   bikethis jul   at   thanks for everything dave reply   leethal jul   at   could build new rear ends for the dhr and make it new wheel size compatible reply   ther jul   at   which came first the torker logo or the turner logo reply   raybao jul   at   yo dave  ill sell you some of my amzn stock for a new rfx deal reply   hollowing jul   at   i always imagined sam hill riding and winning on a dw link turner dhr sunday reply   mirasol jul   at   soooo when do i get to purchase the new and improved dhr reply   ark jul   at   hi dave blast from the past reply   gnarcasm jul   at   bikes with machine soul reply   tolyho jul   at   og reply   trekone jul   at   needs to invest in marketing its a must or he will only be around for a few more years reply   pinkyscar jul   at   what you just read above including the comments  brand marketing reply   diegob plus jul   at   great bikes reply   lccomz jul   at   did dave really imply that someone should purchase one of his bikes to improve their image and up their trailhead credibility reply   lccomz jul   at   i was surprised to read his thoughts about peoples images when they pull up to trailheads reply below threshold threads are hidden   odinson jul   at   turner bikes are still a thing huh who knew reply   polarflux jul   at   yeah and they are really really good who knew reply   waterbear jul   at   its an american maker small brand but the bikes have a solid reputation very durable pedal well remain plush reply   tunnelvision jul   at   he sounds jaded he cant afford the new standards the big players are releasing the new standards arent all bs marketing scams its evolution evolve or die reply   chasejj jul   at   but a small company needs a huge infusion of cash to gear up for the carbon molds in each size you have to be very conservative go to long on the tt and run the super long  slack geo and it doesnt sell youre screwed and holding k in obsolete molds and wasted months of travel to shitty countries you dontt want to go to to survive not an easy businessthe cost of playing the game has skyrocketed and it sucks for the small makers reply   stiingya jul   at  below threshold show comment  yea kinda seems like sour grapes hes always bagging on larger companies but hed be running one of those larger companies if things would have worked out for himand him complaining about other companies marketing after trying to convince everyone tnt was just as good as horst especially when he turned around and paid someone else for their suspension technology soon after that is hypocritical wheres his innovation reply   stiingya jul   at   chasejj thats business big or small its always a risk vs reward question forecasting consumer trends for all everyone bitches about anything new in mountain bikes as a conglomerate we still vote with their wallets for all the new stuff every timethe dw burner was conservative the market for an aluminum dw rfx was ready and willing they held off to go carbon and by the time they got the bike to market the geometry was already out of date because the market had shifted reply   jollyxroger jul   at   chasejj  i believe some companies let the smaller brands feel out the market direction and then they would follow with the massive dealer networks the larger companies had it’s not like they weren’t selling bikes they just weren’t selling the cutting edge or the best bikesso dt devised a strategy of becoming more conservative than the big guys fact is if you are small you cannot be more conservative than the big names in the business you are forced to take greater risks make it or break it like pole and zerode each in their field are doing reply   bmack jul   at   for a guy who greatly built his companys reputation on his dh bike he sure is disenchanted with them to dismiss downhill as mearly a marketing ploy and no more relevant than an f car is to disregard a significant user base as well as a respected and loved form of ridingracing none of us here will ever own an f car but many of us have or have had a downhill bike to dismiss them like that makes me think that turner is more concerned with marketing to the deep pocketed masses than recognizing the awesome diversity in this sport and how it all has a place on the mountain reply   chasejj jul   at   pretty sure dts his point was that dh bikes dont sell in big numbers but are mainly driving brand awarenessmarketing which if you look at sales numbers are a fact not a denigrating on dh bikes at all reply   scottmartin jul   at   keep in mind that the dh bikes that made the brand were under  of rear travel most people wouldnt even call that xc now unless it was  those first burners and stingers made everyone who rode them all mountain riders which is what made them famous put a normal rider on a modern dh bike he aint headed to the trails thats for sureif you want to cry marketing ploy the original dhr is your target any niche is a marketing ploy but its when the product transcends its market to find a more universal acclaim and usage that the phrase classic comes into use for instance did the turner rail begat slopestyle reply   carym jul   at   downhill bikes just dont sell in large numbers i was talking to a bike shop near northstar last weekend and he told me they dont even stock them anymore because sales came to a stop with enduro bikes taking over that market reply post a comment login or sign up about us contacts faq terms of use privacy policy sign up advertise advertising cool
