socks posted   pm et email  print  by jayne odonnell usa today new york  the founders of littlemissmatched dont know what happens to perfectly good socks that disappear in the wash but the mystery of the missing socks led them into a business venture that started small and is growing fast arielle eckstut jason dorf and jonah staw started selling packs of three or seven mismatched socks in  after eckstut and staw came up with the idea as a solution to lost socks each sock is different although the colors or patterns may coordinate the three thirtysomethings are unlikely partners eckstut is an artsy west coast literary agent staw is an intense branding and marketing guy dorf is a slightly conservative new york garmentindustry veteran but they clicked because their expertise complements each others so well and because as fast as they can come up with ideas staw sets a strategy and timetable to turn them into reality thats helped littlemissmatched quickly turn a cute trend in footwear into something with more legs in just three years the companys product line has grown to include gloves and mittens three of course swimwear bedding pajamas and — soon — books and games that tell young girls its ok to be a little out of step the company motto nothing matches but anything goes littlemissmatched which expects  million in sales this year targets girls ages  to  although it also sells to boys and girls of all ages and adult women the products are sold in more than  specialty stores about  department stores including nordstrom and dillards and at littlemissmatchedcom the socks cost  for a threepack  for seven pajamas for example range from  for babies to  for adults in september littlemissmatched opened its own department in the fao schwarz store here in manhattan david niggli president of fao schwarz says littlemissmatched has the same breadth of possibilities for expansion as the american girl doll brand but maybe for an artsier clientele what we loved about it is that its really about using your imagination niggli says we thought it was a terrific concept kinda sorta and alota the founders mirror the three types of customers described on the companys packaging kinda sorta and alota dorf who has been wearing the companys socks since a retail buyer asked him why he wasnt is only a kinda mismatcher he likes to keep his polka dots with other similarly colored polka dots says eckstut to say hes mismatching is stretching it staw is a sorta mismatcher who will wear different shades and patterns but only within the same color family eckstut at least compared with her partners is an alota who will splash two shades of pink with green polka dots on one foot and a pink and green sock with black stripes on the other in his  business book small is the new big seth godin cites littlemisssmatched as an example of a great business idea that traditional sock companies might have been leery of trying and others might think wasnt serious enough realize how turning socks into a remarkable collectible is both obvious and satisfying and likely to succeed he wrote godin wears the companys socks whenever he makes a speech it reminds me and the people who notice my socks that everything is fashion he says theyve taken a commodity that keeps you from getting blisters and turned it into a fashion statement seeing the potential dorf  knew the fashion industry long before he knew staw and eckstut his father was in the garment industry — noel dorf coowned a company that made hanes underwear among other apparel and dorf and his brothers have owned a sleepwear company goodnight family since  some of the stylish pajamas and nightgowns called chuckie goodnight are sold at target hes the only one of three partners with children three girls under age  most of the time jonah and i are thinking about the products its in our own heads says eckstut dorf just has to be in his house seeing the girls wearing the socks and the pajamas eckstut  says she was an offbeat trendsetter as a child until the crush of conformity sent her to the polo and benetton racks when she was in her teens she wants the companys young customers to exercise her early freedom of expression by the time i got to high school i was more reticent to be funky than when i was in this age group eckstut says of the target audience part of the reason i so wanted to focus on this age group is that it is such an exciting and tender time before the pure teenage years staw  was working as a business innovation consultant for a company called frog design with clients including target and daimlerchrysler when he met eckstut through his mother jane staw a writing coach had a client represented by eckstut who has been a book agent for  years jane staw also introduced eckstut and his son to dorf jane staws own book agent — and college roommate — is dorfs aunt eckstut and jonah staw told dorf their idea and he decided in about two seconds that it was a winner the three negotiated a licensing deal with a sock manufacturer who gave them  for the rights to their concept and brand a year later the partners decided not to renew the contract after one more try at licensing they became their own sock manufacturers earlier this year the  served as seed money for the young company bolstering small investments from the founders families and friends the three are only gradually giving up their day jobs staw was the first to make a clean break in september  when he left frog design eckstut is an agentatlarge for the levine greenberg literary agency dorf is still president of goodnight family where he oversees the licensing business but he spends much of his time working in the littlemissmatched office in mamaroneck ny after  years of being an entrepreneur ive learned how to be efficient and get a lot done at once he says eckstut the companys creative director in the rare instances when titles are used has unyielding passion especially for color this company may be about mismatching but not when it comes to the individual colors in the comforters leggings or other products she will pore over colors for hours to ensure the green in the stripes matches the green in the polka dots no one wants to deal with us on colors laughs dorf eckstut says theres a method to her matching its about coordinated mismatching — not to be a clown broadening the brand eckstut the author of three books including putting your passion into print is writing the littlemissmatched books she says the twobook deal is a big step in the evolution of the brand the idea is to inspire creativity and provide an alternative to music and apparel that promotes the sexualizing of girls one book will be part of a boxed set of goods on how to throw a pajama party the other is a series of quizzes to help young girls discover who they really are and why its ok to be that person there is a kind of freshness and originality to everything that theyre doing which is visually so appealing says susan bolotin editor in chief of workman publishing which will publish the books when she first saw pictures of girls wearing the socks bolotin felt there was a kind of nongoofy innocence that just lifted the spirits bolotin says littlemissmatcheds potential is enormous in publishing but as a consumer and mother of a yearold daughter who wears littlemissmatched socks she thinks the brands broader possibilities are also almost limitless she cites the care they bring to everything they do they are young and they are moving very quickly but they are not giving up that attention to detail

tough times comment share tweet stumble email last updated nov    am est the idea began as a joke a few friends amusing themselves one night in  by dreaming up ever more hopeless startup strategies but something about the crazy notion stuck with jonah staw long after the chuckles had subsided lying awake a few nights later staw saw more than a lonely sock in search of a mate he saw a character — “littlemissmatched” — who granted girls permission to express themselves width  littlemissmatched founder jonah staw fortunately staw had learned to trust his own instincts on branding he had tested those instincts as director of corporate development at frog design an innovative web shop in san francisco while working on creative strategies for companies such as target and daimlerchrysler now as staw contemplated his own vision of mismatched socks his gut kind of took over “i knew it was a good idea because you can’t not smile when you hear about it” says staw now  the cofounder and ceo of littlemissmatched inc “i knew that if there’s an emotional reaction it’s a good concept” that was back in  a year later the first littlemissmatched merchandise appeared at linens ‘n things and nordstroms across the country a pack of six mismatched socks for eight dollars the company’s web site hrefhttpwwwlittlemissmatchedcomlittlemissmatchedcom launched a few months after the socks the next year littlemissmatched was offering pajamas pencil pouches books bedding flipflops furniture — and of course socks — in boutiques and specialty stores among them fao schwartz by christmas  the products were in more than  macy’s stores nationwide and retail sales hit  million for the year a  percent increase over the year before never mind the great recession littlemissmatched fans parade down new yorks fifth avenue the first of four permanent littlemissmatched stores opened in may  in new york’s grand central terminal that was followed a month later by outlets in downtown disney in anaheim and myrtle beach sc when the company opened its store on new york’s fifth avenue in august of this year some  fans — median age  going on  — paraded down america’s favorite shopping street in gloriously mismatched attire so what can you learn from an offbeat retailer born in a latenight bull session staw says a lot depended on faith in the fundamental concept he encouraged potential partners to dream with him “we’ve always pretended we’re bigger than we are” says staw “we were always trying to present the brand in the best possible light and allow future partners to imagine where littlemissmatched could go rather than where it was at the moment” inside the littlemissmatched store the brand vision was staw’s guiding light as the mismatched socks caught on the company forged ahead with new products emphasizing a kind of measured individuality allowing each girl to stand out but not too much all the company’s products — from the stocks to the flipflops to the bedding — are designed to be fun but not aggressively different the patterns don’t match but they kind of do too and they provide nearly endless opportunity to customize there are  possible design combinations associated with one littlemissmatched bed so a girl can redecorate her room every day without repeating for more than a year staw stuck with the vision even when outside marketing experts questioned whether it could really be pushed as far as he wanted they wondered whether littlemissmatched wouldn’t be better off concentrating on socks they wondered whether the customer could be defined a bit more conventionally after all the nonconformist might be a pretty tough customer to target “i said no” staw recalls “we’re about inspiring emotion we’re selling creativity fun and we are reinventing categories” the next challenge was the more daunting how to get the message — and the merchandise — to the masses where staw had favored simplicity and daring in the branding scheme he leaned toward complexity in marketing and distribution the result is that littlemissmatched today has a presence in five different markets ecommerce independent retailers more than  nationwide established chains macy’s and jcpenney licensing and the littlemissmatched retail stores “all of our revenue channels are equal” says staw the varied distribution efforts benefit from a cohesive marketing program with heavy emphasis on word of mouth or word of web or both littlemissmatched is active on hrefhttpwwwmyspacecomlittlemissmatchedsocksmyspace hrefhttptwittercomlittlemissmatchtwitter and hrefhttpwwwfacebookcomlittlemissmatchedfacebook but supplements those networking efforts with real live promotional stunts notably ice cream carts festooned with socks and banners that read “matching is overrated” when a new store opens the company distributes lost sock posters the posters direct customers to a web site hrefhttpwwwmissmatchedfuncomlostmysockhtmllostmysockcom where they get a coupon for free socks that can be redeemed only at the new littlemissmatched store staw’s marketing strategy gets an aplus from hrefhttpwwwbnetcomhtmldavid bell an associate professor of marketing at wharton “first and foremost it’s a cute brand that flips the conventional on its head he says “it’s quirky and unconventional in a fun way and it’s highly differentiating” bell applauds the distribution strategy as well he believes that a variety of distribution channels can complement each other and that companies are unwise to rely heavily on just one “the way people buy products on the internet interacts with their physical location” bell suggests stores work great in cities where the sheer variety of retail outlets ensures that the target customer will have access to the merchandise “but if you live in bakersfield california where you have fewer offline options then a web site is more valuable” bell believes that brickandmortar stores help communicate cultural values as well “it’s why hrefhttpquestmeansbusinessblogscnncomwhyisapplesosuccessfulapple has stores they’re selling a whole experience and lifestyle and having a physical retail presence is a big deal” littlemissmatched was a startup that did a lot of things right from bell’s point of view be true to your brand differentiate your product then stick with the brand know your customer know exactly what the customer wants to buy in the case of littlemissmatched different but not too different and make sure your marketing and design efforts connect with those values when it comes to distribution be careful about putting all your eggs in one basket recognize that you may need to reach customer a with strategy a and customer b with strategy b and finally never get complacent “customers love our brand but in this economy mom will only spend so much” staw says “major retailers are marking down their prices our biggest challenge is figuring out the right product mix” of course that’s a challenge for anyone these days judging by his track record though staw should be more than a match for it more on bnet new key to success in online retail geography how mobile apps are

that is based on innovative and creative mixing and mismatching littlemissmatched launched in  with a collection of mismatched socks sold in odd numbers to encourage gi culture by tim leberecht july    pm pdt bluewater jonah staw cofounder and ceo of littlemissmatched headsup a lifestyle brand that is based on innovative and creative mixing and mismatching littlemissmatched launched in  with a collection of mismatched socks sold in odd numbers to encourage girls of all ages to express themselves the nothing matches but anything goes philosophy knocked peoples socks off and sales jumped from  million to  million in just three years today the littlemissmatched product line includes everything from socks winterwear and sleepwear to books bedding and furniture for mismatched mavens of all ages littlemissmatched products range in retail price from  to  and are available at specialty boutiques and department stores nationwide the company recently announced  million in private equity funding expanded distribution a new flagship store in manhattan and a series of new products how do you define innovation innovation is such a broad term i was recently on a mckinsey panel discussing innovation and we opened by going around the room there were more than  chief strategy officers from major us corporations the moderator asked what was the most innovative product and  of the audience said the ipod i said the postit note why it is so simple its obvious it has become a fixture on the physical american desktop it is useful it invented a new categorybefore there were note cards stationary thumb tacks and more now we have the postit innovations are simple elegant solutions that make things better better doesnt necessarily mean more efficientit could be more fun easier to use beautiful you get the point what are the most important areas of innovation in your organization my company is  based on innovation we created a company that was founded on the premise of selling threepacks of nonmatching socks talk about a challenge  we were completely changing the way people got dressed each morning we set out to tell the world that it was okay to not match your socks and as such you should buy them in a novel way our socks are uniquely paired to look great together what we discovered is that our socks are something that are simply fun they are so fun that people what to tell their friends about them our customers lift their pant legs and say hey check out my socks this is certainly innovation in the world of socks our challenge is to translate this innovation into other product categories so that our brand is cohesive at littlemissmatched we believe that simple product innovations make our success people will talk about our products if we give them unique products that are easy to talk about we have furniture that you can draw all over with a dry erase pen why have you ever done that before we have bedding that flips and switches to make  combos in one bed set for us innovation is key to our long term success the good news is that every product category in the world can be missmatchified bostoncom what is your most successful innovation how did you find it it depends on how we define success i personally love our furniture maybe that is because i flew to china to help finalize its development it was a brutally challenging trip so i am enamored with the end result if we look at units sold our socks win the award if we look at dollarssku sold then our bedding wins each of these innovations were found by breaking conventional norms to bring a true value proposition to our customer imagine a world where now one bed in a bag we sell gives you  combos when all of our competition only gives you one option when we are at our best we subvert the marketplacein other words we dont talk about thread count we talk about combos what this means is that we dont actually have competition why because of our version of innovation which innovation failure did you learn the most from and why i dont ever believe in failure i believe in learnings our first sock package almost disintegrated in your hand but it was a totally unique packageit failed functionally but it led us to where we are now we are only four years old as a company so each step we take is a learning success never happens spontaneously as they say practice makes perfect what lessons can you pass on to others from how your organization has changed to make itself more innovation driven the kind of people who are innovation seekers are what i call yes to no people they are the type that says hey that is a really great idea but i think it would be even better if they are expansive thinkers they are not the type that says nope that idea wont work because xy or z we have worked as hard as we can to hire yes to no people we want everyone to have an open mind but ultimately we want them to be filterscurators at the right time so that they can make the hard decisions that will grow our business if i can pass one lesson on it is to hire yestono people in your opinion what are the biggest barriers and challenges that stand in the way of organizations becoming more innovative we are a small company with a short history our historical benchmarks are not relevant yet because we are rapidly growing i think the biggest barriers are companies that say they want to be innovative but they dont truly plan for innovation they look at their historical benchmarks instead of forward at the possibilities at the mckinsey panel i described earlier a chief strategy officer from a fortune  company said  of our new products are now required to be driven by innovation i asked is the company setting aside  of your time to develop innovation of course the answer was no innovation doesnt just happen organizations must understand that they must change culturally and structurally to enable innovative thinking ultimately i believe the executive office suite must also be populated by innovative thinkers or innovation doesnt have a chance of success beyond your organization who do you admire for risktaking innovation and what do you think makes them successful i admire everyone trying to think differently there are so many people innovating there isnt just one person to name i think ultimately innovators are successful because of their passion for success remember steve jobs failed his first time at apple and was fired by the board a good idea isnt the key to success it is execution timing market conditions and a whole lot more what innovation are you still waiting for if i had a list i would be working on those innovations instead of what i am doing at littlemissmatched with all seriousness i am very focused on building a brand based on creativity and
