adaptation and survival often go hand in hand true some companies such as cocacola nyseko can figure out one thing do it extremely well and enjoy success for decade after decade for other major companies though continued prosperity has come from management teams willing to see a different future for the company and unafraid of making large scale changes to the enterprise for related reading also take a look at behind the big brands tutorial economic indicators to know  dupontdupont nysedd is a great starting point when talking about companies that have adapted over time now known as one of the worlds largest chemical companies dupont got its start in gunpowder dupont was so successful in gunpowder in fact that the company supplied something like half of the unions needs during the civil war from its origins in explosives dupont ultimately added other businesses like lacquers and synthetic rubber before inventing the first polyesters nylon teflon and the first phenothiazine insecticide along the way the company continued to pioneer new plastics and synthetics but also products in fields like crop science seeds and fertilizers healthcare electronics and nutrition in many cases dupont has been the first in the field to develop a new compound or product and the company continues to support a rare commitment to rd for a company of its size and age  hewlettpackardfrom its legendary start in a garage in palo alto hewlettpackard nysehpq has changed a lot over the years starting off with audio oscillators the company quickly expanded into a range of electronic test equipment products like voltmeters oscilloscopes wave analyzers and so on it wasnt really until the s and s that hp started to look more like the hp of today the test equipment business was spun off with agilent nysea in  at that point the company added products like computers and calculators before expanding in the s s and s into printers storage services and so on  nokiareaders may argue that dupont has always been a chemical company gunpowder and explosives are chemicals after all and hewlettpackard has always been an electronics firm fair enough but what of nokia nysenok known now as the worlds largest cell phone maker nokia started off as a pulpandpaper company in the mids before expanding into power generation around  nokia ultimately added operations in fields like rubber and telephone equipment and cables through a merger in the s even more diversification followed bringing the company into markets like televisions computers plastics and so on as time went on though the company increasingly saw better opportunities in telephony electronics and radio products and ultimately combined these into mobile communications once the company realized the potential of its mobile communications products it began to divest and sell those other operations and nokia became what it is today  a company focused on telecommunications technology tutorial the greatest investors  berkshire hathawaythere is a lot of writing about warren buffett that characterizes him as stubborn and inflexible but that does not match the record of his stewardship at berkshire hathaway nysebrka after merging his several investment partnerships into one in  mr buffett began accumulating the stock of textile firm berkshire hathaway while buffett did try to make a go of it in the textile business he also began to expand his investments into other fields like insurance as he realized the prospects in textiles were not as rosy as he once thought through the s and into the s buffett continued to accumulate more and more insurance operations under the berkshire umbrella as well as investment positions in other companies like washington post and cocacola berkshire hathaway has maintained a position in the apparel industry but has also expanded significantly into fields like building products retailing logistics utilities and railroads to learn more about buffett see rules that warren buffett lives by  appleask someone about what they think of when they think of apple nasdaqaapl and the answer may well say a lot about that persons age anyone born before  probably still thinks reflexively of apple as a computer company  one of the pioneers of personal computers and the inventor of the stillpopular mac brand if apple had just remained a computer company though it is uncertain that the company would still even be in business it took only about a year to develop the ipod but its launch radically changed the company building on the success of this portable media player apple then effectively created the touchscreen smartphone industry before then moving on to make the tablet computer concept a real product and an actual success once just a computer company apple is now a consumer electronics giant and whatever apples next move will be nobody is expecting it to be in the traditional computer space the bottom lineadapt or die may seem like a harsh directive for corporate managers but there does seem to be a certain necessity to constantly move forward and adapt to new market opportunities whats more even decades of success are no guarantee that the future will work out  witness the bankruptcies of companies like woolworth bethlehem steel and panam adaptive companies give themselves and their shareholders multiple shots on goal if dupont had never moved past gunpowder or berkshire hathaway has stayed focused on textiles neither would be what they are today use the investopedia stock simulator to trade the stocks mentioned in this stock

conglomerate is the combination of two or more corporations engaged in entirely different businesses that fall under one corporate group usually involving a parent company and many subsidiaries often a conglomerate is a multiindustry company conglomerates are often large and multinational conglomerates were popular in the s due to a combination of low interest rates and a repeating bearbull market which allowed the conglomerates to buy companies in leveraged buyouts sometimes at temporarily deflated values famous examples from the s include lingtemcovought itt corporation litton industries textron teledyne because of low interest on the loans the overall return on investment of the conglomerate appeared to grow also the conglomerate had a better ability to borrow in the money market or capital market than the smaller firm at their community bankcitation needed for many years this was enough to make the companys stock price rise as companies were often valued largely on their return on investment the aggressive nature of the conglomerators themselves was enough to make many investors who saw a powerful and seemingly unstoppable force in business buy their stock high stock prices allowed them to raise more loans based on the value of their stock and thereby buy even more companies this led to a chain reaction which allowed them to grow very rapidly however all of this growth was somewhat illusory and when interest rates rose to offset inflation conglomerate profits fell investors noticed that the companies inside the conglomerate were growing no faster than before they were purchased whereas the rationale for buying a company was that synergies would provide efficiency by the late s they were shunned by the market and a major selloff of their shares ensued to keep the companies going many conglomerates were forced to shed the industries they had recently purchased and by the mids most had been reduced to shells the conglomerate fad was subsequently replaced by newer ideas like focusing on a companys core competency in other cases conglomerates are formed for genuine interests of diversification rather than manipulation of paper return on investment companies with this orientation would only make acquisitions or start new branches in other sectors when they believed this would increase profitability or stability by sharing risks flush with cash during the s general electric also moved into financing and financial services which in  accounted for about  of the companys net earnings ge formerly owned a minority interest in nbcuniversal which owns the nbc television network and several other cable networks in some ways ge is the opposite of the typical s conglomerate in that the company was not highly leveraged and when interest rates went up they were able to turn this to their advantage it was often less expensive to lease from ge than buy new equipment using loans united technologies has also proven to be a successful conglomerate with the spread of mutual funds especially index funds since  investors could more easily obtain diversification by owning a small slice of many companies in a fund rather than owning shares in a conglomerate another example of a successful conglomerate is warren buffetts berkshire hathaway a holding company which used surplus capital from its insurance subsidiaries to invest in a variety of

firms are eager to avoid costly backlogs to align manufacturing capacities with growing demand and to ensure raw materials from new suppliers meanwhile supply chains are accelerated costly air freight is accepted and large batches are produced because goods will be sold at some stage in contrast during difficult times firms must address shrinking customer orders face increasing competition and see decreasing margins accordingly priorities for supply chains differ significantly firms must focus on cutting costs reducing capacities consolidating suppliers and freeing up cash by taking out inventory difficult times frequently relate to an individual firm’s situation these could include poor top management decisions cost pressures from a new competitor or demand being hit by poor customer service however difficult times are also frequently caused by changing economic climates during the financial crisis that started five years ago an unforeseen contraction in demand across numerous industries challenged supply chains globally beyond anything observed in the past as the economy continued to drift downward a significant turning point occurred on september   when lehman brothers the fourth largest us investment bank at that time declared bankruptcy the collapse of lehman brothers sent a shockwave through the financial world and triggered an unprecedented decline in the global economy in particular the manufacturing sector suffered severe consequences as a result of the recession industries such as machinery metals and transportation equipment observed drops in customer orders by up to  percent within a single year see exhibit  many companies struggled to survive and entire supply chains were threatened with collapse those firms that survived the financial crisis reacted swiftly and decisively often they leveraged innovative approaches to safeguard their internal and external supply chains amid the challenging business climate today many firms continue to deal with individual challenges similarly the economic situation in many parts of the world has become unstable for those reasons innovative approaches for managing supply chains in a downturn could become as important now as they were just five years ago based on a series of interviews with executives from numerous firms affected in the financial crisis we identified five action areas supply chain executives should be familiar with supply chain actions in difficult times management actions in difficult times are well known and are typically in line with classic turnaround approaches these actions include engaging in significant cost reduction including overhead costs introducing zerobased budgets establishing war rooms and redefining footprints and networks however it is also crucial to understand the tradeoffs between myopic and sustainable actions in addition it is key to plan for the inevitable and prepare the supply chain to deal with tough times for example when a midsized third tier automotive supplier in southern germany was confronted with significant demand reductions the company reacted quickly the supplier closed one production site shifted production volumes to lowcost countries and furloughed employees to adjust to the decrease in volume unfortunately the specific knowledge that was required to establish new production lines was not transferred moreover the company went through a lean manufacturing program setting inventory holding cost at a high level of  percent which was excessive for its low to medium valuedense products although all of the crisis measures were appropriate applying the measures in parallel placed the company under severe pressure causing the firm to deplete its cash stores near to the point of bankruptcy in a supply chain context the five action areas that are illustrated in exhibit  are essential to cope with any type of crisis situation—individual as well as economic first supply chain managers should gain a clear understanding of potential demand scenarios as demand should be the basis of all supply chain planning second firms should safeguard their supplies to avoid any critical bottlenecks as suppliers go out of business third firms must accelerate all efforts to create flexible and breathing supply chains that can cope with all types of variability fourth managers should carefully reduce inventories to free up cash that is essential for turnaround actions finally firms should also consider the light at the end of the tunnel and should begin to position themselves for the inevitable upswing based on our experience all five action areas must be considered in parallel which will cause exceptional challenges for supply chain managers while also dealing with all types of operational glitches accordingly we believe that firms should begin to prepare as early as possible for difficult times ahead in the end they will not only benefit in the crisis but actions are also beneficial to the business from a longterm perspective understanding true demand one key lesson from the financial crisis was that numerous firms underestimated the severity of the declines in demand which reached  percent in some firms because forecasting demand is the starting point of all planning ie capacity planning supply planning and production planning it is crucial to understand true demand indeed any significant over or underreaction could trigger a disaster accordingly successful companies have pursued three key actions to improve their understanding of demand i identifying reliable demand information ii communicating with customers and iii developing demand scenarios identify reliable demand information for most firms the visibility of true customer demand was close to zero at the beginning of the crisis many found it challenging to identify reliable demand information in addition to high levels of economic uncertainty opportunistic competitor actions to fill capacities induced additional uncertainty even longstanding orders were subject to cancellation as a result of collapsing customer demand for example a scandinavian heavy equipment manufacturer lost nearly all previously booked orders from russia because of limited credit availability of these customers for this reason successful firms establish a process to monitor the probability of order cancellations that is similar to the processes for monitoring the probability for winning orders frequently companies began to realize that leveraging information from the overopportunistic sales force did not provide any transparency as sales personnel were still handcuffed to their budget thinking when challenged to explain their sales forecasts personnel often expressed concerns that capacity could be reduced too sharply and that longer lead times would alienate customers successful firms rapidly moved away from initial budgets and targets by implementing a new zerobased budgeting process communicate frequently with customers numerous companies also established more frequent communication with customers and placed more emphasis on shortterm forecasts when the symptoms of recession began to emerge one automotive supplier reduced the firm’s forecast horizon and sales personnel increased chatter with customers however communication through established channels between sales and procurement departments often did not provide sufficient visibility as the information flow was slow within the customer organization procurement departments themselves frequently had no visibility regarding procurement volumes in the upcoming weeks and months accordingly increased direct communication began to occur among planning departments while contract details were coordinated between sales and procurement departments some companies also began to further integrate planning systems and established edi to obtain realtime updates on planned volumes another example of effective communication is a vertically integrated chemical company based in germany that produces goods for all stages of the chemical value chain by sharing demand information on all types of fine and base chemicals internally managers established a reasonable picture of the market demand for different products several months in advance prepare multiple demand scenarios because of limited visibility a single forecast for a product line was often difficult to obtain therefore successful companies began to prepare multiple demand scenarios and to plan their actions within these scenarios such scenarios included consideration of the following questionsis the worst case that demand decreases by more than  percent what is the outcome if all of our customers in france close their plants for three months what are the aggregated inventories of all european customers and would these customers need to divest all of their stocks how long can we employ our workers given the current order book and the lack of new demand top companies have endeavored to answer these types of questions and have typically aggregated them into a few scenarios several companies have even developed more advanced economic models to analyze the effects of early indicators on the world economy and to develop scenarios and action steps accordingly monitoring and safeguarding supply the suddenness and severity of the recession forced many firms to the brink of bankruptcy while sales and demand reached alltime lows sourcing departments faced an entirely new challenge—the risk of losing suppliers and entire supply chains due to bankruptcy accordingly successful firms exerted significant efforts to safeguard their supply typically they implemented an advanced supplier risk management system that included three actions i identifying supplier criticality ii monitoring supplier health and lead times and iii ensuring the survival of critical suppliers identify supplier criticality although most firms have established a regular risk assessment and management process these processes typically focus on physical supply chain disruptions such as natural disasters or strikes the risk of losing suppliers next door is often neglected therefore supplier criticality needed to be reevaluated based on the risk of supplier insolvency which critical parts and how much volume do we obtain from a supplier which alternative suppliers are certified what volumes can these alternative suppliers provide who owns the tools and forms often secondtier suppliers and subcontractors also contributed to the problem particularly in the automotive industry for this reason firms that had prepared supply chain mapping scenarios could now more easily identify the potential effects of supplier defaults monitor supplier health and lead times once supplier criticality was identified firms were required to monitor supplier health and lead times to monitor supplier health successful firms leveraged all types of internal and external sources such as buyers’ information on the speed at which suppliers were committing to orders or requesting earlier payments information from plant visits regarding utilization and newspaperindustry discussions on sellandleaseback deals or the loss of key people to understand the “real” situation of the supplier additionally many firms carefully reviewed the quarterly financial statements of their suppliers in any scenario the monitoring of suppliers must be carefully coordinated including the identification of lead persons who collect all information in addition to supplier health successful firms also carefully reviewed supplier lead times low order intake often had an inverse effect on lead times because suppliers reduced their capacities to stretch their order books over longer periods therefore firms needed to proactively align with suppliers with respect to new delivery schedules ensure the survival of critical suppliers communicating frequently with suppliers and being a “good” customer is often beneficial for firms during more comfortable financial times paying invoices on time rather than stretching payment terms can ensure a preferred customer rating that allows additional favors in the future nevertheless several companies have been forced to ensure the survival of critical suppliers in instances where no alternative suppliers for critical goods were yet available firms supported suppliers by pooling spending or taking inventory ownership from suppliers to ease their financial burdens particularly in small oligopoly supply markets firms have tended to prefer supporting a struggling supplier rather than coping with an even more concentrated supply base in the future in extreme cases firms also attempted to actively reshape their supply base according to their strategic objectives for example one automotive oem defined its preferred supplier landscape for a certain category and actively reallocated sourcing spending to the preferred suppliers thereby destabilizing outoffavor suppliers and rendering them easy acquisition targets creating flexible breathing supply chains when demand plunged in the financial crisis numerous firms grappled with overcapacity and struggled to rightsize their operations in the short term these challenges were often inevitable because network design and footprint decisions had been carefully planned and implemented over the course of several years for a very specific demand scenario for the future we suggest managers proactively address demand uncertainty and create supply chains that are flexible to a wider range of demand we use the term breathing supply chains for setups that can efficiently provide output at different quantities breathing supply chains are also a means to deal with fluctuations in more regular operations we find that successful companies pursued three key actions to implement them i understanding the effects of demand fluctuations ii converting fixed costs into variable costs and iii defining smart contracts understand effects of demand fluctuation one key task in defining supply chains is to match capacity with demand accordingly it is crucial to obtain a fair understanding of the effects of demand fluctuations firms must identify which actions should be selected based on the prepared demand scenarios and must embed the breathing supply chain thinking into their supply chain strategies by asking questions such as how do we provide the most flexibility regarding any changes in demand for each demand scenario a firm must identify preferable actions that holistically consider the effects of selling closing or idling manufacturing assets as well as any potential insourcing or outsourcing effects on a more operational basis situations are frequently complicated by increased mrp complexity in lowdemand situations as a result of coupled production minimum batch sizes and order quantities convert fixed costs into variable costs ultimately it is crucial to convert fixed costs into variable costs to compensate for lower production levels by diminishing marginal costs firms have often closed or idled assets with lower productivity while carefully considering the incremental costs of moving production to other plants one alternative for reducing fixed costs involves increasing the utilization of “fixed” assets and labor by insourcing whereas outsourcing has become a common practice for addressing bottlenecks and reducing costs in normal economic conditions many firms have focused on insourcing during the financial crisis for example for firms in the machinery sector insourcing standard manufacturing processes such as milling welding or assembly operations appears to be rather simple through insourcing firms were able to increase worker and asset utilization even when internal productivity was lower however firms must minimize insourcing costs by crosstraining workers maintaining the required tools and developing smart contracts that avoid penalties define smart contracts the definition of smart contracts with suppliers plays a crucial role in creating breathing supply chains many firms closed longterm contracts with suppliers to benefit from discounts however once locked in volume or price reductions often depend entirely on the good will of suppliers successful companies have considered fluctuations in demand when defining their contracts for example one dutch chemical company had an annual contract with a provider of tank capacity beginning on january  the firm received a volume discount based on the tank capacity signed for the year however company officials realized that the firm would need to pay for unused tanks or would fail to receive volume discounts if capacity requirements deviated from the plan in midyear therefore the firm opted for a smart contract design rather than renting all tank capacity on january  the firm now begins its annual rents on a rolling basis throughout the year eg certain capacity on january  certain capacity on february  rather than receiving a volume discount on the capacity signed at the same time the discount is now based on the capacity rented at a given time the firm can easily discontinue the rent for the tank with the next expiring contract to adjust capacity while continuing to receive highvolume discounts for the remaining tanks rented the example highlights the importance of considering your options before any crisis arises to ensure flexibility in tough times aligning inventories to free up cash reducing inventories while meeting servicelevel requirements has always been a key challenge for supply chain managers however the limited availability of credit during the financial crisis triggered a skyrocketing interest in optimizing inventories as firms were required to free up significant amounts of cash on short notice the situation became even more challenging as a result of unfavorable inventory dynamics a significant reduction in sales slowed the outflow of goods to customers customers were consuming their usual inventories at a lower rate and additionally reduced their safety stock levels to a lower level thus triggering a multiplier effect accordingly supplier production plummeted and firms could only gradually consume their raw material stocks as a result many firms observed the characteristic inventory hump see exhibit  inventories hit the roof across industries in  and increased by up to  percent within six months until the trajectory reversed our interviews with successful inventory managers highlight three practices that enabled managers to avoid or at least to balance the inventory hump i avoiding surplus inventory intake ii aligning inventory policies and iii managing service offerings avoid surplus inventory intake although inventory managers have few options to increase the sales that trigger the outflow of goods it is essential to halt the inflow of surplus goods that will require a long time to turn we found that successful firms reacted firmly to the decrease in demand and implemented a moratorium on material orders to avoid any intake of surplus goods similar to a travel ban firms reviewed all material orders against their demand scenarios and scrutinized their supplier contracts for cancellation opportunities even if contracts did not allow for order cancellations firms often successfully negotiated with suppliers to extend volume commitments over longer periods of time several companies also managed to sell raw materials to other manufacturers that in turn benefited from favorable prices align inventory policies the significant change in demand required numerous firms to review and align their inventory policies frequently order quantities were reviewed and reduced for example one leading european automotive supplier changed the typical order size for a certain category from full truckload to half truckload in an effort to minimize cycle inventory likewise firms reduced their batch quantities in accordance with the new demand reality which required more frequent changeovers however surplus personnel were available at virtually no incremental cost further an increasing number of firms implemented analytical safety stock targets to avoid or reduce safety stocks and aligned their processes based on the management of slow moving items streamline service offerings finally successful firms streamlined their service offerings to customers based on their valueadd one wellknown tradeoff in inventory management relates to the service level that is offered to customers higher servicelevel targets require greater safety stock inventory during the crisis successful firms reduced their service levels to move from a fullservice to a costefficient setup in one case a supplier to the furniture industry reduced service levels from  percent to  percent unless products were in heavy competition provided significant valueadd or customers were willing to pay a premium for higher service level furthermore firms aligned their make to stockmake to order mtsmto mix to eliminate inventories particularly for skus that were sold to a single customer only however this approach required careful communication with customers as they were required to plan and order these nowmto items further in advance after the crisis many companies relaxed their strict standards on the service offering while successful firms introduced new processes to carefully evaluate which items to really serve from stock preparing for the upswing as the financial crisis began to ease in  numerous managers were caught by surprise by the sudden economic upturn for example the demand plan of one transportation equipment company suggested a slow return to precrisis demand levels over the course of six years nevertheless in less than two years demand bumped back to the previous dizzying heights likewise many firms were still in the rightsizing mode and realized the challenges of moving from full reverse to full steam ahead as production capacities had been reduced and talent had been released however farsighted firms were prepared for the upturn and managed to gain significant market share by meeting customer demand while competitors struggled we have identified three practices that enabled firms to successfully meet the increased demand at the end of the crisis i retaining and developing talent ii preparing longterm projects and iii providing upside capacity retain and develop talent although the length of the crisis was unclear to most managers many successful firms realized the utmost importance of retaining and developing talent throughout the recession because manufacturing processes in many countries have become more complex in recent decades the importance of expertise has similarly skyrocketed although firms had to lay off workers while adjusting their capacity talent retention was crucial for the eventual upturn many firms reduced employee work hours to ensure that the given order book provided sufficient cover to retain key personnel another successful example is germany’s chemical and automotive industry in which many firms leveraged governmentsupported parttime work to avoid layoffs  million employees were operating under parttime government support in may  compared to  million in may  the ability to retain talent enabled the firms to rebound as the economy began to recover prepare longterm initiatives many firms realized that the downturn could also be viewed as an opportunity to prepare longterm initiatives as long as no significant investments were involved in the boom years before the financial crisis many firms did not have the resources necessary to carefully review their supply chains as skilled experts were struggling to maintain pace with business expansion however the sudden downturn halted further expansions and provided firms with breathing space to focus on longterm initiatives for example one consumer packaged goods manufacturer reevaluated its manufacturing footprint using the newly available project management capacities that were implemented as investments became available at the end of the downturn provide upside capacity when planning for business in the financial crisis many firms did not consider the need to provide upside capacity although suppliers were frequently required to retain some capacity on standby to prepare for sudden demand increases many firms did not sufficiently prepare for this scenario and were surprised by labor and asset shortages one example of upside capacity is provided by a chemical company that needed to employ temporary workers during the upturn by paying a temporary employment agency a small standby fee for the preferred provision of personnel the firm was able to select the temporary workers first when the economy began to recover accordingly the firm was able to take on the temporary workers who had previously been working in the firm thus minimizing the rampup time other examples include firms that were able to secure capacity early at key suppliers because they sensed the upcoming increase in demand rather quickly being agile many firms suffered seriously or closed their business during the financial crisis they did not reduce capacity as rapidly as demand plummeted they lost critical suppliers and thus could not fill customer demand they nearly went bankrupt because of high inventory levels and a lack of cash they did not have the talent or the capacity to fill soaring demand and therefore lost market share were these outcomes purely the result of misfortune in some cases misfortune was perhaps to blame however we believe that the financial crisis harshly revealed the weak points in many firms’ supply chains based on our experience we highlighted five key areas that many firms did not sufficiently address these five key areas are not necessarily crisisrelated in fact successful companies do not require significant changes because these firms already address these topics however firms that do not consistently consider these key areas are much more vulnerable in downturns what does this finding mean for the next crisis—economic or on an individual firm level first firms must always be carefully scanning for major changes in its specific market conditions or in the overall economic climate managers must ensure demand transparency establish early warning mechanisms using internal and external data and reconcile with other functions as well as suppliers and customers to accomplish these goals managers must establish the relevant processes in addition firms must constantly challenge and test their abilities to adapt to major changes in demand and supply one valuable tool is an agility assessment of the supply chain to determine whether a firm is truly prepared for an inevitable downturn numerous firms have already embedded semiannual or annual agility assessments into their routine risk management processes in this context alternative demand scenarios are outlined and supply chain adaptations and contingency plans may be developed overall we believe that firms should continuously improve their agility which is a means of ensuring success in any economic situation fewer stockpiles are accumulated when stateoftheart inventory management policies are implemented capacity can be adjusted quickly when contracts with suppliers are designed intelligently and supplier bankruptcies can be handled easily when alternative sources are constantly identified for firms that have not yet become sufficiently adaptable in this regard now is the proper time to begin working on the measures recommended here—in other words before the next crisis end notes  peels r udenio m fransoo j c wolfs m  hendrikx t  responding to the lehman wave sales forecasting and supply
