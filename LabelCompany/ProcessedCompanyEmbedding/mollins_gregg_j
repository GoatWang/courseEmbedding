president general counsel  corporate secretary historyedit reliance steel  aluminum company was founded in los angeles on february   by thomas j neilan originally named reliance steel products company the business made and sold steel reinforcing bars rebar for the construction industry in  the name was shortened to reliance steel company in  reliance steel also began manufacturing products of aluminum and magnesium as william t gimbel neilans nephew who joined the company as a trainee in  later told metal service news we started out in  with the dirty old downinthegutter carbon steel but that became a world commodity so we decided that we wanted to upgrade into something that had a little bit more pizzazz and we picked aluminum and magnesium gimbel who started as a warehouse man succeeded neilan in  as president of the company a year after its name was changed to reliance steel  aluminum company under gimbel reliance began its longrunning territorial expansion naming a resident sales agent in phoenix in  two years later reliance acquired a small phoenixbased competitor the effron steel company with the purchase of another competitor the westates steel company in santa clara reliance steel expanded into northern california in  in  reliance continued its growth through acquisition by purchasing the drake steel supply company which operated metals service centers in fresno and san diego california with the purchase reliance also acquired the services of joe d crider who had joined drake in  as a billing clerk and worked his way up to fresno sales manager after several years as manager of reliance steels los angeles division crider was named executive vicepresident in  teaming up with gimbel to form what metal service news would later call perhaps the best known management team in the service center industry in  reliance extended its reach into texas by acquiring metals service centers in dallas and san antonio from delta metals inc two years later the company bought out another los angeles competitor the catalina steel company its fifth acquisition in ten years by then reliance steel had also established supracote a coilcoating division in cucamonga california it became a separate subsidiary in  and was sold to a management group in  reliance steel acquired southern equipment  supply company san diegos oldest metals service center in  and immediately launched a  million project to double the size of the san diego facility two years later the rapidly growing company announced a  million expansion in los angeles reliance steel also wanted to strengthen its position in texas and after attempting to acquire a houston business temporarily abandoned its acquisition philosophy and opened a new metals service center in houston in  gimbel told metal service news we had spent probably two years trying to buy out somebody but at the time there was a big boom there and everyone felt the streets of houston were paved with gold we just could never make a deal to buy someone so we started our own company reliance closed the houston center in  due to a slump in the oil industry in  supracote coilcoating subsidiary is sold to management reliance ventured into the eastern part of the united states for the first time in  when it acquired the purchased steel products company in atlanta the move never panned out however and reliance sold the center in  gimbel told metal center news we learned a lesson in atlanta if were going to go further east that probably means the chicago area and you dont move into chicago on a shoestring after more than three decades of operating fullservice metals service centers reliance opened its first specialty store in  forming the tube service company in santa fe springs california the subsidiary specialized in tubular products a second tube service opened three years later in milpitas california in  reliance also acquired bralco metals in pico rivera california which specialized in brass aluminum and copper to manage its aluminum magnesium and stainless steel products reliance created a nonferrous metals division reliance metalcenter in  in  after  years as a closely held operation reliance issued its first public stock at the time the company had about  stockholders most of them employees or relatives of founder thomas j neilan reliance had previously considered and rejected going public several times in  gimbel told metal service news wed go and talk to the brokers but unfortunately anything with the name steel in it didnt get them very excited in its prospectus reliance also signaled its intention to continue growth through acquisitions stating traditionally metals service centers have been small familyowned businesses that lack the diversity of experience and successful operating techniques of reliance and thus have and may in the future become candidates for acquisition or consolidation crider who became chairman in early  succeeding gimbel who remained on the board of directors as chairman emeritus said in interviews that he expected reliance steel to continue growing through acquisitions industry analysts expected reliance to focus its expansion on the strengthening midwest market a secondary public offering in november  raised  million to fuel further acquisitions a  million private placement followed a year later company president david hannah succeeded joe d crider as ceo in february  crider remained chairman chairman emeritus william t gimbel had died in december  the companys valex unit dominated the us market for electropolished stainless steel tubing and fittings used to build semiconductor plants expanding overseas in  valex opened a distribution center in france and formed a manufacturing joint venture in korea valex shut down its phoenix distribution site in  rsac management corp was formed as a holding company in  the corporation also performed administrative and management tasks for the metals service centers reliance ended the decade with sales of nearly  billion a year the us government imposed tariffs on imported steel in early  this made the price of hotrolled carbon steel rise and reliances shares fall observed the los angeles business journal the tariffs were lifted in december  after complaints by us automakers subsidiary ami metals inc opened a european business in january  based in gosselies belgium ami metals europe sprl focused on the aerospace industry ami closed its atlanta area facility during the year while opening a new on in st louis acquisitions historyedit reliance grew from a single metalsprocessing center in los angeles into a major corporation by acquiring dozens of competitors in an interview with an industry publication in  joe d crider then president and chief operating officer explained you can pay the bill for higher market share through price cutting or through paying goodwill to buy a competitor in cutting prices you often trash the marketplace so over time the latter route is usually the less expensive as long as you buy at a reasonable price in  effron steel is acquired in  northern californias westates steel is acquired in  drake steel supply is acquired in  texas metals service centers are bought from delta metals inc in  catalina steel is acquired in  southern equipment  supply metals service center is acquired and expanded in  bralco metals is acquired in  reliance also acquired foucar ray  simon a specialty tube distributor in hayward california with a branch in portland oregon the hayward center was eventually merged into the reliance center in santa clara the portland operation foundered and then closed in  gimbel told metal service news the acquisition had been a mistake foucar was probably the second oldest service center in california with a good reputation theyd done well over the years but i guess theyd gotten rigor mortis we thought that we could change all that we tried and tried to change it and it didnt work so we had to admit defeat and close up the place in  reliance purchased the cda service center in salt lake city utah from spokanebased cda steel service center the company then acquired circle metals in carson california in  and tricon steel  aluminum in fremont california and arnold engineering in fullerton california in  arnold engineering was renamed arnold technologies inc and relocated to anaheim in  reliance acquired ducommum metals in phoenix and los angeles the lafayette metal service corp in long beach california and the assets of the livermore california metals service center from capitol metals company the company also acquired the valex corporation in ventura california which made stainless steel components for electronic and pharmaceutical applications the dallasfort worth russell steel division of the van pelt corp and the morris steel  aluminum company in albuquerque new mexico in  reliance also acquired the los angeles sheet  steel division from earle m jorgensen company over the next two years it acquired the assets of albuquerque new mexicobased smith pipe  steel and the los angeles and phoenix operations of lusk metals other acquisitions in the s included affiliated metals an aluminum and stainless steel specialty center in salt lake city utah and the wichita kansas operations of national steel service center inc which stocked aluminum plate sheet and coil for the aerospace industry the national steel acquisition marked reliance steels first foray into the midwest in  reliance acquired a  interest in american steel llc for  million this shareholding was raised to  percent in may  in  the company acquired vmi corporation an yearold nonferrous metals service center in albuquerque new mexico and ccc steel inc which operated carbonsteel service centers in los angeles and salt lake city reliance also announced the acquisition of the siskin steel  supply company inc with metals service centers in
