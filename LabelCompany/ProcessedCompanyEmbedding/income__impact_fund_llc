payments when due  investments in securities below investment grade credit quality are predominantly speculative and subject to greater volatility and risk of default  unrated securities are evaluated by fund managers using industry data and their own analysis processes that may be similar to that of a nationally recognized rating agency however such internal ratings are not equivalent to a national agency credit rating counterparty credit risk may arise if counterparties fail to meet their obligations should the fund hold any derivative instruments for either investment exposure or
