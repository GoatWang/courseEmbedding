source morningstar® the style box reveals a funds investment style for credit quality of the bonds owned morningstar combines credit rating information provided by the fund companies only using ratings assigned by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization  nrsro with an average default rate calculation to come up with a weightedaverage credit quality the weightedaverage credit quality is currently a letter that roughly corresponds to the scale used by a leading nrsro funds with a low credit quality style box placement are those whose weightedaverage credit quality is less than bbb medium are those less than aa but greater or equal to bbb and high are those of aa or higher when classifying a bond portfolio morningstar first maps the nrsro credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates as determined by morningstars analysis of actual historical default rates morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average default rate for the entire bond fund finally morningstar maps this average default rate to its corresponding credit rating along a convex curve for interestrate sensitivity morningstar obtains from fund companies the average effective duration generally morningstar classifies a fixedincome funds interestrate sensitivity based on effective duration of the morningstar core bond index mcbi which is currently three years the classification of limited will be assigned to those funds whose average effective duration is between  to  of mcbis average effective duration average effective duration

sales charges placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance the top  of funds in each category receive  stars the next  receive  stars the next  receive  stars the

capital announces closure of cairn subordinated financials fund after posting returns of   cairn capital  cairn capital announces closure of cairn subordinated financials fund after posting returns of  cairn capital limited announces the closure of cairn subordinated financials fund after just over two years having notched returns of  all the proceeds have been returned to investors – two thirds of whom have chosen to reinvest in other cairn capital products the redemption of all the shares by cairn global funds plc in the fund took place on st december  at the recommendation of cairn capital in accordance with the articles of association of cairn global funds plc the fund generated a net return of  from launch in october  to st december  an annualised return of  the annualised weekly volatility for the life of the fund was  demonstrating very attractive riskreturn characteristics the fund outperformed the average of the € and £ jp morgan subordinated security indices susi by  from inception to close “we have managed dedicated legacy subordinated financials mandates since  and launched the fund in october  at the height of the systemic crisis when we saw deep value even though others were exiting performance beat our expectations and we no longer believe the strategy can continue to produce these types of returns” said philippe kellerhals senior portfolio manager “the opportunity set in subordinated financials is narrower now and better suited to higher conviction more focussed positioning or as part of a broader credit strategy” andrew jackson chief investment officer added “investors in the fund have enjoyed strong returns and now that the value to support a dedicated fund has passed we feel it is appropriate to return investors’ capital subordinated financials continues to be a very active asset class for cairn capital but more effectively pursued as part of broader mandates we are particularly pleased that to date  of the capital previously in dedicated subordinated financials strategies has subsequently been or is expected to be reinvested with cairn capital primarily in broader multi credit asset class strategies” concurrent with the redemption of the fund cairn capital has returned or reallocated capital in all dedicated legacy subordinated financials mandates managed by it these segregated mandates having been in operation since mid have generated returns in excess of  in total in excess of £ million of investor capital has been returned or reallocated cairn capital sees attractive value in only a limited number of subordinated financials bonds on both an absolute and relative basis which no longer supports a thematic long biased fund instead cairn capital feels that those narrower opportunities can be better exploited in a broader corporate high yield and crossover strategy which can extract alpha from the remaining opportunities in subordinated financials as well as in other nonfinancial sectors about cairn capital cairn capital is a londonbased credit asset management and advisory firm established in  it provides a fullservice credit asset management advisory and securities restructuring platform with a particular but not exclusive focus on the european credit markets its discretionary assets under management as at  november  were  billion about the subordinated financials fund the fund was launched to exploit the significant price dislocation of legacy subordinated debt issued by financial institutions following heightened sovereign debt concerns and the perceived poor capital and liquidity position of european banks at the time of the fund’s launch cairn capital strongly believed that legacy subordinated debt in particular would benefit from i a reduction in the elevated risk premia over time ii improved fundamentals as the capital layer below these instruments would be supplemented and iii favourable supplydemand characteristics as these instruments would be unlikely to form a significant part of the evolving capital base driven by changes in regulatory regime and would therefore be retired calledtenderedexchanged this investment thesis supported a thematic dedicated longbiased fund from the outset the fund was expected to have a limited lifetime targeting a return of at least  over the first year and annualised double digit returns thereafter returns were fuelled as strong central bank liquidity support reduced sovereign concerns and banks taking positive steps to strengthen capital ratios and reduce leverage all contributed to lower risk premia and pushed up the prices of legacy subordinated debt the strong price action was fuelled by liability management exercises which proved to be a popular tool to accelerate the recapitalisation process and the more recent guidance from the eba to disallow stepup t to count as t capital in the future capital base the deep value that cairn capital identified at the time of the fund’s launch affording the opportunity to generate significant alpha in a market characterised by distress and volatility has been extracted in a shorter time period than originally envisaged the opportunistic nature of the strategy and finite timescale for its execution was however clearly identified at inception this document is issued by cairn capital limited which is authorised and regulated by the financial conduct
