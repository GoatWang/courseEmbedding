archives may  meta log in imi  materials  metal nitrides home  materials  metal nitrides metal oxides metal nitrides chalcogenides alloys imi discoveries metal nitrides refractory metal nitride films are widely used in applications requiring materials with good conductivity and resistant to high temperatures and oxidizing ambients these films are used for electrodes in devices such as capacitors and transistors and as an adhesion  barrier layer for interconnects in semiconductor chips the properties that make them useful are low resistivity uohmcm high melting points c oxidation resistance and limited reactivity with  either oxides or metals such as al and cu the most widely used metal nitride film is tin followed by tan and mon these films have been deposited at imi either by reactive physical vapor deposition pvd  where a metal target is sputtered in an arn mixture or by atomic layer deopistion ald where metal containing precursors react with nh cyclebycycle to build up the film one atomic layer at a time choosing a deposition depends on the specific application pvd can be done at relatively low temperatures and allows for the tuning of the properties based on the substrate temperature arn ratio deposition pressure etc ald  requires much higher deposition temperatures above c and  is used when the films have to be deposited on nanoscale high aspect ratio structures each application determines the important properties of the metal nitride studied imi performs exhaustive characterization for every film in order to tune the films to specific applications crystal orientation and texture is determined by xray diffraction xrd the exact stoichiometry is determined by xray fluorescence xrf and xray photoelectron spectroscopy xps the density  of the films is measured by xray reflectivity xrr in addition to the sheet resistance of the film the work function provides an important electrical parameter for many device applications this function affects the barrier height to oxides and semiconductors which in turn controls the  threshold voltages for transistors and leakage in  mos and mim capacitors the barrier height can be affected by other phenomena at the interface such as surface states and dipoles imi’ s engineers use internal photoemission ipe to measure the actual barrier height the following examples illustrate how imi optimizes metal nitride films for different semiconductor technology applications dram nitride films are used as the bottom and top electrodes in capacitors with highk oxides as the main dielectric the high aspect ratio of the capacitors require nitride films to be deposited by ald the dielectric constant of the oxide which is critical for achieving high capacitance can be impacted by the underlying electrode the  crystal texture of the bottom electrode can enhance the formation of oxide phases that have a high dielectric constant in order to reduce leakage the  electrode material must have a high barrier height relative to the oxide therefore ipe measurements are critical in optimizing the deposition and processing of the  nitride films another factor contributing to leakage is oxygen vacancies in the dielectric which can be created by the nitride reducing the oxides both during  deposition and post deposition anneals imi models simulate the measured iv curves to infer the defect density and distribution in the dielectric layer this allows the electrode material  and process to be optimized logic transistors advanced mos transistors including finfets use highk oxides such as hfo in conjunction with metal gates these metal gates consist of a thin layer of metal nitride usually tin around nm thick followed by a metal with higher conductivity such as w  or al the performance of the transistor is determined by the  effective work function of the nitride layer leakage and reliability are affected by interaction with the metal oxide controlling the stoichiometry of the tin including the level of o incorporated in it greatly influences the  effective gate oxide thickness eot in a gatelast sequence currently used  logic processes the gate stack including the tin layer has to be deposited in a trench with high aspect ratio making ald the preferred deposition method imi’s expertise in ald combined with the ability to simulate the material properties interactions and defect generation enable us to help customers optimize their gate stacks interconnects stateoftheart semiconductor processes use cu based interconnects deposited into trenches and etched into a dielectric like sio cu ions can easily diffuse through the sio  causing shorts and transistor failures encapsulating the cu lines with barrier materials prevents this phenomenon the three sides of the trench have to be lined with a very  thin metal nitride layer  blocking the diffusion of cu the metal nitride has to possess low resistivity to allow cu to form a continuous film with the right crystal orientation and to not react with the cu during subsequent process steps the preferred metal nitride is tan which is typically deposited using pvd however as line widths shrink pvd is being replaced by ald as the above examples illustrate the deposition and properties of nitride films require finetuning for  different applications taking into consideration not only the overall process integration constraints but also the impact on the circuits’ electrical properties imi  materials  metal oxides home  materials  metal oxides metal oxides metal nitrides chalcogenides alloys imi discoveries metal oxides thin film binary and ternary oxides are a major component of many electronic devices the specific properties required of the film are determined by the specific applications which determine the material  eg sio  hfo or tio and the method of deposition physical vapor deposition pvd or atomic layer deposition ald some of the more important material properties for electronic applications are composition dielectric constant refractive index bandgap breakdown field and leakage  many of these properties are affected by the phase and microstructure of the film as well as point defects such as vacancies and interstitials the phase of the film includes whether it is amorphous or crystalline if crystalline the phase is the lattice structure which may be cubic  tetragonal orthorhombic etc  under microstructure it is important to know whether the film is single crystalline or polycrystalline if it is crystalline the grain size and preferred orientation of the grains are determined for many devices it is also important to know properties of interfaces such as the barrier height between a metal electrode and the oxide conductionvalence band edges characterizing the oxide’s material properties requires a wide range of metrology techniques xray fluorescence xrf  energy dispersive xray spectroscopy eds and xray photoelectron spectroscopy xps are used for composition xray diffraction xrd and transmission electron microscopy tem provide valuable information on the structure refractive index can be measured using ellipsometry bandgaps can be determined from wavelength dependent ellipsometry or absorption using spectrophotometers dielectric constants and leakage need electrical measurements on capacitor stacks barrier heights can be determined using internal photoemission ipe on the same stacks by combining the ability to deposit different types of oxides and simultaneously measuring various material properties it is possible to identify relationships between properties that can be used to select a particular material for a specific application an example in the figure below shows the breakdown electrical field strength of nm ald deposited films ranging from alo to tio plotted against the measured static dielectric constant the breakdown strength ebd decreases with dielectric constant κ and our measurements indicate that it is accurately described by the relation ebd   κ based on this relationship in an application where the capacitor is used as an energy storage device and the maximum voltage is not a constraint sio films are the best candidate on the other hand if voltages are low as in advanced node dram and logic materials with higher dielectric constants such as zro and hfo are the best solution imi has investigated many different oxides we illustrate further imi capabilities by focusing on work done on transition metal oxides for different applications with particular emphasis on  the use of hafnium oxide and zirconium oxides in semiconductor technology dram the key material requirements for the dielectric for dram include a high dielectric constant with a low leakage at thicknesses less than nm since the capacitor structures have nm dimensions but large aspect ratios  or more the only deposition technique is ald imi has investigated zro based films and optimized them for successive generations of dram a wide range of ald precursors to provide optimum performance and manufacturability were investigated  for future nodes the stringent leakage requirements require a deeper understanding of the leakage mechanisms key parameters are the barrier height between the metal electrode and the dielectric as well as the density of defects ipe was utilized to directly measure the barrier height combined with simulation of the leakage due to vacancies this allows optimization of the overall capacitor stack and anneal process the effect of dopants and thin interfacial layers are being investigated as part of our ongoing research resistive ram reram the cells for this type of future nvm utilize the unique properties of metal oxides that have undergone a soft electrical breakdown called “forming”  the resistance of the cell can be toggled between a high resistance state and a low resistance state by applying a positive or negative pulse respectively imi evaluated  a wide variety of  metal oxides and was the first to show that a hfo film of the right composition  has  all the desired  characteristics needed  for future nvm cells in combination with appropriate electrodes the cells can be programmed at low power and show good endurance and retention simulation of the defect kinetics during forming and programming also allowed the optimization of the electrical operation in an actual memory array ferroelectric ram thin films composed of mixtures of hfozro have been shown to have excellent ferroelectric properties they retain bulk polarization after the application of a critical electric field and the direction of the polarization can be switched by reversing the field by varying the exact composition of the two components it is possible to tune the exact properties of the film pure hfo films are paraelectric  while pure zro  are antiferroelectric by choosing the right electrodes both bottom and top composition and annealing conditions recordsetting polarization numbers were achieved these films can be used in a nvm cell either as a capacitor in series with a switching transistor or as part of the gate stack in a single transistor this allows for much smaller cell sizes than the current commercial feram cells which use much thicker pzt oxides logic transistors by incorporating transition metal oxides with high dielectric constants such as hfo as the gate oxide of mos transistors it is possible to aggressively shrink the feature size of the transistors while controlling the gate leakage in order to meet the stringent requirements of performance reproducibility and reliability the properties of the hfo has to be finely tuned a deep understanding of the defects generated in the films during deposition and post processing and interaction with the metal gate is critical with current finfets step coverage on high aspect fins is also very important and ald is the preferred method of deposition imi has done intensive work on ald processes including assessment of different precursors to develop a suite of characterization techniques to fully evaluate the films by combining experimental ipe results leakage data and threshold voltage measurements with simulations of defect density the optimum conditions for transistor performance can be determined while different applications may ostensibly use the same metal oxide the specific needs require tailoring of the properties this is done at imi by rapid design of design of experiments  guided by  sophisticated material and device simulations and an
