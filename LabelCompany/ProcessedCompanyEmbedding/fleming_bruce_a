pages  oped contributor the academies’ march toward mediocrity by bruce flemingmay   continue reading the main story share this page continue reading the main story annapolis mdthe idea of a football star receiving lenient treatment after testing positive for drug use would raise no eyebrows at most colleges but the united states naval academy “holds itself to a higher standard” as its administrators are fond of saying according to policy set by the chief of naval operations adm gary roughead himself a former commandant of midshipmen at the academy we have a “zero tolerance” policy for drug useyet according to navy times a running back was allowed to remain at annapolis this term because the administration accepted his claim that he smoked a cigar that he didn’t know contained marijuana he was later kicked off the team for a different infraction and has now left the academythe incident brings to light an unpleasant truth the naval academy where i have been a professor for  years has lost its way the same is true of the other service academies they are a net loss to the taxpayers who finance them as well as a huge disappointment to their students who come expecting reality to match reputation they need to be fixed or abolishedthe service academies are holdovers from the th century when they were virtually the only avenue for producing an officer corps for the nation’s military and when such topdown institutions were taken for granted but the world has changed which the academies don’t seem to have noticed or to have drawn any conclusions from advertisement continue reading the main story with the rise after world war ii of the reserve officer training corps programs at universities around the country the academies now produce  percent or less of the officers in each service at an average cost to taxpayers of nearly half a million dollars per student more than four times what an rotctrained officer costs continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story the institutions are set on doing things their own way yet i know of nobody in the navy or other services who would argue that graduates of annapolis or west point are as a group better than those who become officers through other programs a student can go to a civilian school like vanderbilt major in art history which we don’t offer have the usual college social experience and nightlife which we forbid be commissioned through rotc — and apparently be just as good an officer as a naval academy productinstead of better officers the academies produce burnedout midshipmen and cadets they come to us thinking they’ve entered a military camelot and find a maze of petty rules with no visible future application these rules are applied inconsistently by the administration and tend to change when a new superintendent is appointed every few years the students quickly see through assurances that “people die if you do x” like “leave mold on your shower curtain” a favorite claim of one recent administrator we’re a military disneyland beloved by tourists but disillusioning to the young people who came hoping to make a differencein my experience the students who find this most demoralizing are those who have already served as marines and sailors usually more than  percent of each incoming class who know how the fleet works and realize that what we do on the militarytraining side of things is largely makework academics too are compromised by the huge time commitment these exercises require yes we still produce some rhodes marshall and truman scholars but mediocrity is the norm photo credit brian stauffer meanwhile the academy’s former pursuit of excellence seems to have been pushed aside by the allconsuming desire to beat notre dame at football as navy did last year to keep our teams in the top divisions of the national collegiate athletic association we fill officercandidate slots with students who have been recruited primarily for their skills at bigtime sports that means we reject candidates with much higher predictors of military success and yes athletic skills that are more pertinent to military service in favor of players who according to many midshipmen who speak candidly to me often have little commitment to the military itselfit’s no surprise that recruited athletes have been at the center of recent scandals including a linebacker who was convicted of indecent assault on a female midshipman in  and a quarterback who was accused of rape and dismissed from the academy for sexual misconduct in  sports stars are flattered on campus avoid many of the onerous duties other midshipmen must perform and know they’re not going to be thrown out instead of zero tolerance we now push for zero attrition we “remediate” honor code offensesanother program that is placing strain on the academies is an unofficial affirmativeaction preference in admissions while we can debate the merits of universities making diversity a priority in deciding which students to admit how can one defend the use of race as a factor at taxpayerfinanced academies — especially those whose purpose is to defend the constitution yet as i can confirm from the years i spent on the admissions board in  and ’ and from my conversations with more recent board members if an applicant identifies himself or herself as nonwhite the bar for qualification immediately drops newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify youre not a robot by clicking the box invalid email address please reenter you

some in the administration have justified the admissions policies on the ground that it “takes all kinds” to be officers but that’s not really what the academies recruit they don’t give preference to accomplished cellists or people from religious minorities or cerebral zen typeswe’ve even given lessqualified students a backdoor into annapolis — the naval academy preparatory school our remedial institution in newport ri for admitted students who are not prepared to enter the academy itself and if students struggle academically when they get to the academy our goal is to get them to graduate at whatever cost thus we now offer plenty of lowtrack and remedial courses and students who fail can often just retake classes until they pass we have control over their summers and their schedules and can simply drag them through with tutoring advertisement continue reading the main story i’ve taught lowtrack english classes the pace is slower and the papers shorter than in my usual seminars but the students who complete them get the same credit when i’ve complained about this some administrators and midshipmen have argued that academics are irrelevant to being an officer anyway really thinking and articulating are irrelevant to being an officerthe picture i have drawn of the academy is not what most americans imagine when they come to a parade and see all those cleancut young men and women standing in nice rows with their chests out as they will at next week’s graduation ceremony some may argue that our abandonment of merit as a criterion for officer status is simply the direction the military overall has taken — the stress of fighting two wars has lowered the bar for enlistment and rotc standards have also declined but i’d like to think we could do betterwe have two choices one is to shut down annapolis west point and the other academies and to rely on rotc to provide officers or we can embrace the level of excellence we once had and have largely abandoned this means a single set of high standards for all students in admissions discipline and academics if that means downgrading our football team to division iii so be itwe also need a renaissance in our culture we need to get our students on board with the program by explaining our goals and asking for feedback from cadets graduates and the armed forces at large now we’re just frustrating the students and misleading taxpayerschange won’t happen from within the shortterm academy administrations want to keep the hype flowing and tend to lack the bigpicture thinking necessary to seeing the institution objectively rather secretary of defense robert gates and other civilians need to mount a full reconception of the academies deciding what do we do that’s wrong what’s irrelevant and what deserves to be saved otherwise my most promising students will continue to tell me “sir this place shows you what not to do” continue reading the main story we’re interested in your feedback on this
