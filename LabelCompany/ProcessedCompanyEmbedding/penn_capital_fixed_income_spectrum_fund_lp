prices of bonds adjust to a rise in interest rates the share price may decline investments in foreign securities involve special risks including currency fluctuations economic instability and political developments investments in emerging market countries involve heightened risks related to the same factors in addition to those associated with these markets’ smaller size lesser liquidity and lack of established legal political business and social frameworks to support securities markets such investments could experience significant price volatility in any given year high yields reflect the higher credit risk associated with these lowerrated securities and in some cases the lower market prices for these instruments interest rate movements may affect the share price and yield

portfolio may fall or fail to rise over extended periods of time for a variety of reasons including general financial market conditions and factors related to a specific issuer industry or sector these and other factors may also lead to increased volatility and reduced liquidity in the funds portfolio holdings growth stocks may be more susceptible to earnings disappointments and value stocks may fail to rebound these risks are generally greater or small and midsize companies the fund will be more susceptible to these risks than other funds because it may concentrate its investments in a limited number of issuers and currently focuses its investments in particular sectors because the fund currently invests significantly in the communications services and healthcare sectors the fund may perform poorly as a result of adverse developments affecting those companies or sectors the fund may focus its investments in other sectors in the future in which case it would be exposed to risks relating to those sectors the value of international investments traded in foreign currencies may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates international investments particularly investments in emerging markets may carry risks associated with potentially less stable economies or governments such as the risk of seizure by a foreign government the imposition of currency or other restrictions or high levels of inflation or deflation and may be or become illiquid the funds investments in leveraged companies and the funds nondiversified status which means the fund may invest a greater percentage of its assets in fewer issuers than a diversified fund and the funds use of short selling can increase the risks of investing in the fund the risks associated with bond investments include interest rate risk which means the prices of the funds investments are likely to fall if interest rates rise bond investments are also subject to credit risk which is the risk that the issuers of the bond may default on payment of interest or principal interestrate risk is generally greater for longerterm bonds and credit risk is generally greater for belowinvestmentgrade bonds which may be considered speculative mortgage and other assetbacked investments carry the risk that they may increase in value less when interest rates decline and decline in value more when interest rates rise we may have to invest the proceeds from prepaid investments including mortgage and assetbacked investments in other investments with less attractive terms and yields our use of derivatives may increase the risks of investing in the fund by increasing investment exposure which may be considered leverage or in the case of many overthecounter instruments because of the potential failure of the other party to the instrument to meet its obligations you can lose money by investing in the fund microsoft personalized ad preferences to opt out of personalized ads in this browser your browser history
