visconti ceo diversityinc  november   diversityinc ceo luke visconti recently interviewed thomas f zenty iii ceo of the clevelandbased hospital system university hospitals is one of the  diversityinc top  hospital systems zenty discussed the dramatic impact of the affordable care act and how the hospital’s diversity efforts in the workplace and the community are helping it survive read this article and other ceo interviews in our digital issue and sign up for diversityinc magazine zenty spoke on this topic at diversityinc’s event last month diversitymanagement best practices from the best of the best click here for video of his talk luke visconti what is the intersection of solid diversitymanagement initiatives and the reduction of healthcare disparities thomas f zenty iii many studies have shown that there is a direct correlation between people of diverse backgrounds being willing to seek care and knowing that people who look like them will actually be providing that care so the intersection between diversity and disparities is rather significant we want to make certain that we’re doing everything that we can to make sure that people of color will be able to work in our organization hold positions of leadership—caregivers clinicians and support staff—in order to make people of all backgrounds colors and faiths feel comfortable coming to university hospitals to receive the worldclass care that we provide visconti how is diversity and inclusion a competitive differentiator for a hospital zenty there is no better way to gain the pulse of what’s happening in the communities that we serve than by having people who live and work in those communities actively engaged with us at every level from an employee perspective it’s critically important that we have people of diverse backgrounds who will bring skills talents perspective in order to help us to do a better job as we look to achieve our mission we think it’s critically important for diversity to be well represented across our entire health system at every level be it gender religion race color in fact we’ve recently reached out to the amish community because one of our hospitals has a very large amish population and we realized that we did not have a member of our board who was of amish descent as a result we added a new amish board member to our hospital and he’s brought a lot in terms of a better understanding of the amish community and the healthcare needs of that community the point is we need to look into the community to better understand who are the communities that we serve who best represents those individuals within those communities that we serve and how can we engage them at every level either as employees as members of the board as leadershipcouncil members and we want to make sure that we’re engaging everyone in the communities that we serve visconti you’re very personally involved in the community why zenty it’s critically important for an organization of our size in a community of this size as the secondlargest private employer in northeast ohio to make certain that we’re going to be focused on diversity at every level within the communities that we serve our organizational values include excellence diversity integrity compassion and teamwork and diversity is one of the key components of the cornerstones of the work that we do every day in taking care of our patients and meeting our mission as the leader of this organization it’s critically important for us to be actively engaged in community activities to make certain that we’re not only aware of what’s happening in the community but play a leadership role in advocating on behalf of many different agenda items one of the key ones though is in the area of diversity in northeast ohio visconti university hospitals has a  on the corporate equality index the human rights campaign’s index of equality for lgbt people why is that important to you zenty the lgbt community is very important to us for all the other reasons that i stated in all the other populations that we serve they’re very much a part of our community we want to make certain that they’re recognized and represented they have actually recognized us for our work in this regard which we’re very pleased about visconti your chief diversity officer reports directly to you you also have handson interaction with people who are responsible for delivering results in diversity management how important are these two things zenty it’s critically important that the chief diversity officer reports to the chief executive officer donnie perkins is our chief diversity officer and does an excellent job in the role however it’s also important to note that we have a very close working relationship with elliott kellman who is our chief human resources officer because so much of what we do in workforce planning and workforce development is structured around the importance of diversity at every level in our organization in our organization we selected the top  people from within our health system to be part of an educationandtraining program in conjunction with case western reserve school of business we’ve engaged  physicians and  nonphysicians who were at senior levels in our organization who we feel have the potential to grow and develop in the years to come within university hospitals’ health system they were selected on the basis of their accomplishment they were selected on the basis of diversity they were selected on the basis of their ability to grow and develop within our organization it’s an month program but we’ve seen great success thus far one of those individuals has already been promoted to a new senior position that was recently created in our organization but at the other end of the spectrum we’re also concerned that we don’t have enough people of color in our management ranks so we put together a mentorship program which will include people at the senior administrative level who will choose people who have promotional capability within our organization who will be working with each of us to make sure that they will be given the opportunity to grow and develop within our organization in both nonmanagement as well as in management roles so that we can encourage more people of color to get actively engaged as supervisors managers directors vice presidents visconti how are you holding your senior team accountable for diversityandinclusion results zenty our senior team is very actively engaged with donnie’s leadership in making certain that we are focused on diversity at every level within our organization looking at the healthcare needs of the people who we serve making certain that our employees are given equal opportunity for promotion and growth within our health system making certain that people who are in middle management have opportunities to grow into seniormanagement roles and making certain that we are focused on doing everything that we can to prepare the next generation of leader who will be people of color and of diverse backgrounds likewise it’s important to mention that our board has been focused on diversity over the past many years and i’m pleased to report that the council on economic inclusion has awarded us for two years in a row recognition for the diversity of our board if we receive it a third year in a row we’ll go into the hall of fame and we’re hoping that that will be achieved this actually starts at the top beginning with our board and then filters throughout our entire organization visconti what do you see as the greatest challenge facing university hospitals and how does diversity and inclusion factor into the solution zenty the greatest challenge will be how to address the changes that we’ll be facing under healthcare reform one of the key things that we will focus on in the area of diversity is to make certain that the  million more americans who will now have access to healthcare insurance that didn’t have it before that they will be well represented both within the communities that we serve as well as well represented in the patient populations that we care for we have a number of very strong specialty clinics that will focus on the needs of specific elements within our population but we want to make certain that as we see this influx of new patients arriving we clearly understand what their needs will be—which is more than just episodic acutecare needs but the continuum of care of services that we’ll be able to provide to them in the years to come visconti i found university hospitals’ website to be exemplary in its ability to communicate your mission your values how diversity ties into all of this your corporate citizenship your engagement with the community why is it so important to communicate this zenty university hospitals really wants to be a leader in the area of diversity we’ve been in existence since  we’ve been a very active and vibrant

smart business magazine linkedin facebook twitter google youtube rss search for cleveland outcomes not inputs  thomas f zenty iii leads university hospitals toward a new model for health care delivery by  pm edt february   it was  years ago this month that thomas f zenty iii took over as ceo of university hospitals since then he’s stemmed the bleeding from a row of financial losses and turned the operation around while he’s quite proud of that achievement — for his team and himself — it’s not the only accomplishment that makes him beam with pride it has to do with people “from a leadership standpoint one of the things i am proudest of is that many of the people who preceded me are still here today” he says “so many times you come into an organization and there has to be wholesale massive management changes we didn’t do that here in fact virtually everyone who was here prior to my arrival is still here today “i didn’t think we really needed to focus on that and i think history proves us right” but that’s not to say the health care industry hasn’t — and isn’t — going through major changes “we are going through some major transformational changes but the work that we do hasn’t really changed our focus on the patients our mission all the things that we need to do to make certain that people receive worldclass care in our industry and in our organization” just as the assembly line changed the automotive industry forever the health care industry is at a crossroads change in fact may well be the health care industry’s middle name zenty doesn’t fear change he racked up experience prior to arriving at uh with leadership roles at health systems in california arizona new jersey and connecticut while some ceos can’t deal with the pain change brings the reluctance to “get with the program” is often fueled by fear of the unknown it’s the product of wellestablished habits and it’s a conviction that things will get back to old familiar ways — that the ceo will be seen as a sagacious knight in shining armor ready to break those concepts zenty felt confident that the health care being delivered at university hospitals was not the problem coming in the door he knew there were four things that he needed to identify as major areas to concentrate on not surprisingly change had to occur in each area — quality efficiency transparency and focus “there were a lot of business elements that had to be addressed but the mission the vision and the clinical capabilities that we had were second to none” zenty says here’s a look at how zenty leads his team to be unthreatened by change at the  billion health system with more than  employees and physicians   assess who is delivering the quality getting a clear picture of any problem is the first step in finding out what changes need to be made the analysis doesn’t need a lengthy study and while all ceos obviously don’t have the same executive microscope to examine personnel there are some universal techniques to use “i think there is a fair amount of instinct that goes along with leadership style and whether or not there is a fit both with the organization and with how leaders really should comport themselves” zenty says “i look for content i want to make sure people are content rich i found a lot of very very intellectually gifted people with a strong understanding of the industry — people very committed to the organization and that was abundantly clear all along” the workforce assessment took zenty  days during which he had indepth meetings with all the senior staff he adopted the concept that uh needed to make certain its business acumen matched its clinical acumen and could deliver the quality for which it was known “we have an extraordinary team of people we have an extraordinary organization in terms of our commitment to the communities that we serve “i knew we had the right people” he says “but it wasn’t so certain that we were properly cast in our roles “there will always be fabulous physicians and outstanding nurses and other clinicians and caregivers what we are really going to have to reorder is the way that we think about how we take care of patients” zenty and his team began to draw up a comprehensive plan to address these and other issues   take quality and efficiency measures the words quality and efficiency often appear in the same sentence when describing how to align people and systems to deliver a continuous stream of value to the customer and eliminate waste and inefficiencies at the same time sometimes that means transformational change the health care industry in general is undergoing such a change away from a volume to a value equation zenty says that viewpoint has been growing in acceptance and uh in  decided to launch a fiveyear plan called vision  made up of multiple components to affect the necessary changes “it’s no longer being paid for each thing that we do but rather being rewarded for outcomes — not just for inputs” zenty says “vision  included a focus on quality it included some new buildings serviceoffering sites” he says “we now have about  ambulatory sites and a number of hospitals depending upon how you count them we have a broad distributed network now of physicians in an eightcounty region we have great relationships with about  private practice doctors and on the main campus we have about  faculty members” what it all translates to is that uh started with one concept of vision  as a major institutional construction project but it resulted in having a whole new way of doing business “we thought ‘what are the components that go along with making vision  a true communitybased project’” zenty says “how are we going to engage community members as part of our overall decisionmaking process and engage them in meaningful ways that they have not been engaged before” to accomplish its vision  goals to make the local region economically better while growing the uh footprint the organization turned to its commitment to community responsibility “not only did we create vision  for the needs of the communities that we serve but during the course of it we focused on things like the quality of care that we provide” zenty says “quality was our no  priority like investing in the communities by doing a project labor agreement evidenced by our commitment to local spend female business spend minority business spend — we set these goals out early in the process of vision  and we set them without the need to do so “at the time they were sort of ceiling goals but now they are foundation goals in addition if you look at what we did with our project labor agreement that has now become the foundation for other major projects that have taken place in northeast ohio” as a result the community as a whole has become the most important stakeholder “vision  was a pointintime issue meaning that we knew we had to position our organization with a broader footprint bigger geography with several areas of focus and we created our strategy you stay with the four themes — quality efficiency transparency and focus — and we were rather relentless on how we approached what we needed to do in those regards” zenty says “vision  was the product of so many people that nothing pleases me more than when everyone took credit for making it happen and that to me is what leadership is all about it’s about shared ownership shared responsibility shared accomplishment — and shared recognition”   ensure transparency no matter what kind of entity you manage an integral component of your brand is trust one of the most effective ways to build that trust is often through transparency this is especially the case when your organization is facing a crossroads for uh it realized some time ago that the hospital industry in terms of the laws of supply and demand was moving from an environment of supplyinduced demand to demandinduced supply “these are the same words rejiggered but fundamentally changing the way we as an industry need to think about this” zenty says “we have  hospitals in the united states all having to rethink how we are going to be delivering the best quality care we can in the future” this creates a priority in matters such as pricing it is more important than ever for patients to be able to compare the cost of medical treatments “transparency — transparency around copays transparencies around deductibles transparency around expected outcomes — things that we have all been focused upon here for the past seven or eight years will be expected and frankly demanded by the consumers” he says among those demands is the rate of “product recalls” — or in the health care industry rates of readmission “at university hospitals we don’t have a problem with readmission rates because we do well in this particular category” zenty says “for example we had a fairly large population of sickle cell anemia patients with high rates of readmission we found ways to focus on activities that ameliorate that need to be readmitted instead being taken care of either in an ambulatory environment or better at home “it’s like the old management dictum what gets measured gets managed” hospitals are all examining readmission rates as an industry in far more detail than before “we are finding many solutions to problems that have a relatively straightforward solution that we didn’t think about before because we automatically got paid for readmissions but that is no longer the case “so when we think about the financial benefits where detriments that go along with health care today things like wrong site surgeries high readmission rates — we need to be focused on what we are doing with patients and their families as an industry not what we are doing to patients and their families” zenty says “we need to make sure that we are taking care of the entire needs of patients”   getting — and staying in — focus if your goal is to deliver quality efficiently and transparently many businesses find the fundamental solution is to become a valuesdriven organization “valuesdriven leadership teams have enormous leverage opportunities that we need to make certain we continue to focus on in the future” zenty says “for example when we put vision  together that wasn’t one person’s thought process the idea of having a single individual who has all the right answers is an outmoded paradigm” uh espouses the values of excellence diversity integrity compassion and teamwork “in each of those we have shown extraordinary progress” he says noting the many awards the health system has achieved for excellence a diverse workforce ethical operation compassionate care and teamwork at every level “when you are a valuesdriven organization and you measure your performance in the values of quality efficiency transparency and focus it makes an enormous difference in your success” he says strategic planning meetings on a regular basis can keep the organization on track “we have quarterly strategic planning meetings where we talk through what we think is going to be happening in health care in whatever defined period of time that we select” zenty says “so for example our strategic plan is a threetofive year view then we create annual operating plans in which each of our entities has annual operating performance goals required “we involve a lot of people in our strategic planning process it is very iterative we do it internally we don’t have outside experts who are preparing our strategic plan for us we do it all through our strategic planning office “what matters is having an engaged group of people who are all pulling in the same direction these are missiondriven people who believe in the organization that they work for — people who believe in what we are and what we do” ● how to reach university hospitals   or wwwuhhospitalsorg   takeaways find out who can deliver qualitymake transparency a priorityteams with a sharp focus

learn about commitment you learn to be selfsufficient you learn that you have to work your way out of problems because there aren’t many people around to ask for help and you learn that you have to be very thoughtful about everything that you do in an environment like that because it is hazardous — it’s hard work you also learn to figure out how to fix things do things that you might not otherwise do you grow up quickly i was driving a truck when i was  years old a tractor and all those things it forces you to become selfsufficient and to be your own mechanic there was always something breaking on the farm whether it was a baling machine conveyor belts milking machines whatever it was it was a good education  who do you admire in business two books that i read rather consistently transcend business and they are focused more on leadership one is called “the art of war” by sun tzu and it was written around  bc the other is “the prince” by machiavelli i read each of those books from time to time to transcend the issue of business but really i read for the great discussions about leadership so for example one of sun tzu’s famous quotes is “imagine what i could do if i could do all that i can” that’s very impressive when you think about it he talks about the importance of taking care of people he talks about when to advance and when not to advance about the circumstance under which you make decisions and about the importance of business intelligence “the prince” of course was written in a different time and place but nonetheless there are always some interesting lessons to be learned from reading it in terms of business peter drucker probably would be the singular person i would note because he is the father of modern american business but i have admiration for so many other people as well who are successful in the business world  what is the best business advice you ever received my first mentor was someone in whom i had great admiration this was right after i came out of graduate school her point was basically something that sun tzu said “strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory and tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat” in effect that is what she said to me she said focus on the strategy but don’t lose sight of the tactics be strategic in everything you do but don’t overlook the details that to me was terrific business advice she also said to surround yourself with the best people that you can find it’s the only way you are going to leverage yourself to success  what is your definition of business success success in business to me arises when you are able to accomplish your mission and accomplish your vision in a valuesdriven environment in which people matter most that’s my simplest definition the good news is that our mission statement is very easy to remember and repeat “to heal to teach and to discover” we work on this every day and that’s why our values are so important to us  facebook
