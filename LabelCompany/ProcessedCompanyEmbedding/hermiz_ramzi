the call today we will review our strong second quarter performance update you on our ongoing transformation to one of the leading lightweighting technology providers in the automotive industry and provide longer term projection for our financial performance as weve communicated over the past several quarters we are making significant progress developing and deploying technologies that provide environmental and safety benefits to the mobility market our progress is realized in our deepening relationships with our customers our growing new business awards and our increasing profitability all of which are driving our strong performance and business transformation our second quarter results are solid we continued our positive momentum with respect to profitability achieving our highest ebitda margin in the past  quarters and setting the company record in ebitda dollars considering certain onetime adjustments our adjusted ebitda was even better at  million these are results we are very proud of our gross margin for the second quarter improved  basis points and adjusted ebitda margin improved  basis points compared to the prior year quarter importantly we improved gross profit by  or  million and slightly lower revenue again our focus is to grow with customers and products that align with our strategy of providing technologies that improve the health and safety of the environment and enhance the performance of our customers vehicles all the while improving the financial performance at shiloh im pleased with the progress on these key metrics and even more encouraged by the opportunities ahead of shiloh as we remain in the forefront of the secular shift to lightweight our technology and product portfolio are becoming clear differentiators for our customers our transformation from a process company to a product and technology focused company here is delivery planned results and driving our reviewed value proposition to mobility market when engaged early in the product development process we are able to provide the greatest solutions to our partners as an example we were recently awarded the production contract for chassis and suspension components on the new vehicle model we have been in codevelopment with our customer for over a year resulting in the  reduction in part complexity and a  weight reduction over the base design we achieved these results utilizing our advanced modeling and design techniques as well as our proprietary fintech ph manufacturing approach we were able to lightweight steel aluminum and even eliminate carbon fiber components with our system approach our innovative solutions and manufacturing expertise can make chassis body structure interior and proportional products truly lightweight in addition these solutions reduce vehicle assembly complexity help oems reduce their tooling investments reduce the overall cost of vehicle and ultimately increase fuel economy this is how we lightweight without comprise this is how we lightweight with benefits this quarter we booked new business with an estimated light contract value of  million a  increase compared to  million booked in the year ago quarter which contributes nicely to our robust pipeline of new business awards these recent awards were in europe and north american with leading global oems such as general motors honda scania and volvo as well as with our tier  partners we consider the strong evidence that our business development strategy and improved execution are creating value as we build on a  billion of new business contract awards since the start of  these high value awards are expected to further improve our product mix and our profitability as we place lower margin commodity business these awards also provide the foundation for our longerterm expectations for business performance in addition to our improved product offering we expect that our competitive position will help us meet longer term expectations our technology and solutions are in demand our ability to solve challenging problems is recognized and our commitment to customer satisfaction is appreciated these attributes are creating new global opportunities and enhancing our leading positions in amongst other areas laser welded door inners in north america and magnesium cross car beams and instrument panel structures in europe we are also expanding our production capabilities the construction of our newest facility in china is progressing very well start production targeted in early  our new magnesium plant in tennessee is impressive with the stateoftheart process technology that will enhance our lightweighting ability as we bring online magnesium capabilities to north america over the next  months our strong and growing product portfolio coupled with our competitive advantages continue to position shiloh to benefit from the industry production and lightweighting trend across the globe with that i’ll turn it over to jay who will walk you through the financial results in more detail jay potter thank you ramzi sales for the second quarter of fiscal  were  million on a constant currency basis sales were  million compared to  million in the second quarter of fiscal  we are encouraged by our overall topline results which are in line with planned production schedule and include the impact from extended shutdown and product changeovers of certain oem as they realign inventory on dealer lot during the quarter we offset revenue decline of  million from a contract change and removed material ownership and scrap metal market pricing mix ph  million from currency exchange and  million from production wind down of dodge dart chrysler  with the balance including the impact of the extended shutdowns and product changeovers previously noted adjusting for these items revenues were essentially flat compared with the prior year regionally europe continued to be a strong market as we grew our sales by more than  compared to the market of which production declined by  our outperformance was driven by launches of our new business awards with leading european oems for product such as magnesium crosscarbons beams and ip structures gross profit increased by  to  million compared with  million in the second quarter of fiscal  gross margin expanded by  basis points to  compared to  a year ago benefitting from the favorable product mix and operational efficiencies we are encouraged by achieving this level of yearoveryear improvement and we remain focused on our goal of expanding our overall gross margin to the lowteens net income of  million was  per share for the second quarter of  was similar to the year ago period on lower revenue adjusted eps improved to  in the second quarter of  compared to  in the year ago quarter for the second quarter of  ebitda was  million compared to  million in the year ago quarter ebitda margin improved by  basis points to  versus  in the second quarter of  driven by our improving operating performance adjusted ebitda was  million and improved  compared to the prior year adjusted ebitda margin was  a  basis point improvement from  in the year ago quarter adjusted ebitda includes certain onetime items including professional fees and loss on asset sales related to unprofitable parts being subset ph as of april   cash and cash equivalents were  million total debt was  million a reduction of  million versus the prior year yeartodate we have generated solid operating cash flows of  million as a result of our strong earnings and focused efforts to improve working capital we are pleased with our ability to generate cash and deploy that capital efficiently our strong cash generation has driven the reduction of longterm debt by  million since year end as a result of these improved metrics our leverage ratio was  times on an adjusted ebitda basis for the trailing  months compared to  times a year ago we expect to see our leverage ratio continue to improve to below  times over time as our newer profitable awards launch our efforts to improve operational efficiency allowed us to free up capacity and bring more of our key products and technologies to market while also optimizing capital expenditure requirement our investment in capex of  million for the quarter and  million for the first half of the year support our backlog of new business award we anticipate total capex of approximately  million for the year as i mentioned earlier we are managing the subsetting of some lower margin program while this business may represent a shortterm revenue decline it frees up capacity to take on new programs with higher profitability this effort will continue to help maximize our longterm return on investment our q will provide additional details on our financial statements with that ill now turn the call back to ramzi for commenting on our outlook and some summary remarks ramzi hermiz thank you jay our results for the second quarter of  and for the past several quarters demonstrate the progress of our strategic transformation we are confident in our ability to deliver improved profitability and longterm growth we anticipate further improvement as we continue to induce higher value added and technology driven products and as the new business awards from the past few years generates more profitable revenue streams as we look forward we will continue to provide leading technologies that enhance healthier and safer mobility remain focused on enhancing our profitability pursue operational efficiencies focusing on the highest return uses for our assets work to improve our leverage and proactively manage our portfolio to phase out business that is generating suboptimal returns taking those factors into account and our performance for the first half of the year we are introducing guidance for the full fiscal year  we anticipate adjusted ebitda to be in the range of  million to  million this represents growth  to  compared to our adjust ebitda of  million in  and adjusted ebitda margin expansion to approximately  to  this assumes a modest revenue decline on yearoveryear basis as we prioritize margins over revenue growth as we look forward over the next three to five years we anticipate the adjusted ebitda margin reaching the low doubledigits we continue to expect annual capital expenditures to be approximately  to  of revenue to wrap up our strategy to transform shiloh is working we are building upon the excellent progress we made in  with continued momentum through the first half of  i’m excited about the accomplishment the team has made in enhancing our product offerings strengthening of relationships with our customers and of course improving our probability shiloh is well positioned to succeed operator with that we are now ready to go to qa questionandanswer session operator thank you we will now be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from the line of alan weber with robotti  company advisors please proceed with your question alan weber first can you talk about your product are they primarily  regarding on the light vehicle are they more on the passenger cars or more towards the suvs or crossover something like that and light truck ramzi hermiz our mix is pretty balanced between cuv suv trucks and cars so weve been focusing on how to balance that portfolio as well as driving our customer diversification so where few years ago we would have been more concentrated to a few customers in lets say the top  where we are today lets say  customers represent   approximately  so what you see weve been working on a mix change is not only our diversity among customers our diversity among platforms as well as electrical vehicles and trucks and cars so again a fairly structural diversification strategy alan weber okay and then as you talk about the backlog i think little bit maybe not confused but when do you expect cash to start showing higher revenues quarteroverquarter yearoveryear or like that ramzi hermiz excellent question when you look at our transformation one of the things we keep on focusing on is the higher technology product and you hear us talk subsettings from other progress in the commodity business so while youre looking at revenue lets say flat or little bit flat quarteroverquarter yearoveryear there is a lot of transformation in that mix and thats really where were focused on is that more profitable revenue not just focused on revenue but how do we drive profitable revenue growth so as you saw this quarter over  basis points improvements in margin relatively flat revenue actually slightly down revenue and just generating not only a stronger percentage but generating greater dollars so it is  we have focus on it now more directly to your question of when we see that revenue growth we see the balance of this year ill say relatively flat compared to the prior year with a lot of new launches still ongoing with more profitability being generated and we will see their transformation over a period of time but it is a focused approach various product technologies are growing very rapidly while again were trying to subset some commodity really commodity business that really wasnt driving the best usage of our assets so part of this process is if you have a piece of equipment thats generating x dollars of revenue at a single digit margin that same piece of equipment would be more product strategy approach more technology added to the product that same asset can generate a greater return and thats really how were trying to manage both our capital return on capital as well as the right revenue mix alan weber okay great thank you i guess with that there were at some point some of the lower margin business kind of is gone and then revenue growth i mean actually multiple speakers it will have to work okay ramzi hermiz sure alan weber i think my last question was you when you gave the guidance if i look quickly at the second half of the year versus what your guidance is it’s almost the ebitda is relatively flat at the lower end of your guidance and i was wondering why given the first quarter wasn’t as strong why second half shouldn’t be somewhat stronger than last years second half jay potter from a second half to second half there is significant improvement when we look at where we ended second half of  keep in mind we do have a fair amount of seasonality in our business so as you look at quarter three in our sector and how our quarter three calendar works you have a lot of plant shutdowns or holidays we have fewer work days in that second half so those have an impact in that transition but with that forecast against a prior year the map does show a strong second half performance and a strong second half mix alan weber but i guess if you look at  if i’m doing it right last year you had something million of ebitda and so you had roughly  million of ebitda in the second half of last year and that’s would be kind of flattish with the low end of your guidance ramzi hermiz you are correct look at the adjusted ebitda for  and then when you look at where were from an actual ebitda what you’re seeing is a lot of those things that we were indiscernible are being converted into ongoing quality improving earnings and even if you look at the first half versus the second half on what would be a slower typically a lower revenue on second half compared to our first half were actually generating greater dollars so when you look at those numbers you want to see  you would see a fairly strong improvement on halfoverhalf and yearoveryear alan weber okay great thank you very much thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of george gaspar who is a private investor please proceed with your question george gaspar i’d like ask you about the china startup that you’re indicating is going to be early  of the new components that you in signed in the quarter you indicated i believe it was  million of new bookings how much can you relate that to what might be performed out of the new china plant at this point in time how many companies auto manufacturers do you intend to be doing business with over there ramzi hermiz when you look at the products that we are targeting for china out of the new manufacturing plants its targeted around our aluminum die casting products primarily focused on transmission components the powertrain he propulsion components and their business is being launched at global scale so the programs that are being launched in that facility are also programs that we produced or will be launching here in the us and actually have begun production in the us and in that technology and that product will be launched globally with our oems so thats the foundation on programs that are being put in that facility and those are programs that again are multiregional type of technology wins were going to focus that joint venture primarily as we launch with our global customers and using that facility to meet global demand producing in china for china that is shilohs strategy were not doing a lot of exporting of these products from region to region so it is designed around global platform wins when you look at new business targets that we are going after again the global oems focused primarily on global programs of the  million that were launched awarded contracts this quarter very little was targeted for the facility in china if those programs were more european and north american one thought ph programs multiple speakers but the facility in china im sorry just to add a little bit more the facility in china clearly had prior quarter wins and those awards are for future launches george gaspar okay and if you could just indicate the complexity of the china operation in terms of potential size square footage wise versus lets say what youve recently accomplished in tennessee and versus other average plants i assume youre starting out on a smaller scale there but what  can you give some thoughts on how much square footage is going to be involved in the operation there versus some of your other facilities like youve done there in tennessee ramzi hermiz its similar in scale and how theyre been built is whether theyre expandable like the floor plant signed is one that we can add so we do want to  we don’t want to overbuild and ill say precommit too many dollars in scale of a large building thats half empty for example but the square footage the technical processes really how we would look at it is the capability of the new facility and the ability to expand the facility and this what were putting in china is stateoftheart it is in in itself while i cant make comments on how impressive our tennessee  clarksville tennessee magnesium facility is coming along what were doing in china is an equivalent in that and again leading technology full process capability beginning to end on the type of production so the facility is one complete and production done within the facility as well as expandable george gaspar okay and then a question on your commentary on that  million of new business and from the questions that the previous questioner asked you can you detail what part of that new parts ordering is suv related to previous percentages that would be related to suvs can you break that up ramzi hermiz yeah we don’t bring that down to that level of detail  george gaspar okay ramzi hermiz detail on program but let me give you some color to that for you george when you look at the current mix of our business and what  where our customers are launching new programs the oems in themselves are targeting more of their growth into the crossover and suv and truck market at least here in the us and so we are very well aligned with that growth and to anticipate with leading technologies in that sector we also have a  and part of what you saw in europe in our significant ill say over performance to the market in those programs we are very  we were built around ph many of the premier vehicles and so your higher line of vehicles and so again they’re introducing our newer technology more lightweighting type of technology to meet global standards so as we design and target our portfolio wins we are looking to maintain a strong mix of diversity of customers as well as vehicle types not trying to pick on what’s going to be the longterm winter but we do see what are the global trends that are happening around the world and leveraging those just like we have a growing business on the electrical vehicle side and while we are targeting those oems one of the say easiest ways to improve  expand battery range is by taking weight out of the vehicle so as we look at the ability of our product strategy to move oems forward and to help them meet their global requirements the lightweighting approach is – is the macro trend that is going to be around for a while george gaspar okay you’ve mentioned this macro trend changes and you mentioned transmission components this is relatively a newer area for you is it not and how expandable do you anticipate that moving into that area ramzi hermiz from a lightweighting standpoint as they add we do see growth opportunities and both on the axle side as well as on the transmission or propulsion side and oems add more speed through transmission to improve vehicle efficiency to improve mileage per gallon is theyre adding weight to the transmission so part of our strategy is helping them as they add speed or gears we help to take weight out to keep them let’s say neutral so we see this as an opportunity for the foreseeable future but again our strategies they were a strong balance of that mix we are in body we are in chassis and steering were in propulsion we are in the interior side so we are in parts of the segment of our different segments of the vehicle that are growing at different speed and rates but having a good mix of them all technical difficulty george gaspar okay and just information from here youve really made some dramatic improvement in our outlook over the past couple of years in terms of expanding your coverage within the auto market and truck market and could i strongly recommend that you start stepping out to investment conferences and it would be wonderful if you could possibly speak at the ideas conference in chicago in august because of the fact that your midwest headquartered so im  but anyway im just throwing that out there i think its time that shiloh starts moving out to spread the word on how well youre doing and i hope that you will consider that thank you ramzi hermiz well thanks george first of all thank you for the complement the team the whole shiloh team has been working hard to again and grow improve our business and really strengthening that for the longterm performance and clearly well take your thoughts and evaluate what opportunities exists and be it from chicago i never miss the opportunity to get back there so well  its something well look at for sure george gaspar thank you kindly ramzi hermiz alright thank you george operator thank you there are no further questions at this time i would like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks im sorry we have one more question our next question is from luis mozer with indiscernible investors please proceed with your question unidentified analyst i just wanted to  i have a difficulty trying to understand how to translate ebitda to the eps diluted shares from continuing operations can you do that for me in other words you report nongaap can you give me a similar projection on nongaap based on your ebitda projection jay potter the guidance was  the guidance that were providing is really just focused on the adjusted ebitda were not providing guidance on eps unidentified analyst okay is there any reason for that jay potter we just came out with guidance this is actually our first time in really the customers history weve actually provided ebitda or adjustability ph or any type of guidance at this point were focused on where we are on the adjusted ebitda where we are on  where were going to go with that and were going to evaluate what other opportunities  as we go forward how we want to present that overtime but right now it just focused on adjusted ebitda unidentified analyst okay thanks operator thank you and our next question is a follow up from george gaspar whos a private investor please proceed with your question george gaspar just one additional please can you talk a little bit about growth in rd in the michigan area i know that youve tried to set up your own rd center can you give us any color on how thats coming along relative to where you were on that say one or two years three years ago ramzi hermiz actually george thats where were having the call today its in our tech center in clinton ph michigan the tech center is progressing very nicely when we look at the success that weve had i would attribute a lot of that success to the team thats based on here both from an engineering technology side and our research team and as well as our sales and program management teams they are working well with our customers the longterm development the program that weve talked about on that type of collaboration is happening here and also not forgetting a lot of what we would also do in our other facilities in ohio or everywhere our tech center in europe and expanding in china it’s that global collaboration that is driving success again as our many of our customers  most of our customers are global customers we need to supply them with regional support but also we leverage our hour clock where we can do work and meet with the customer run modeling over the night to in asia or in europe to answer the question following morning back in the states or europe or where it might be so were really pleased with what the team is doing so if you look at the strength of the team from where we were a few years ago to where we are today it is night and day extremely pleased with what’s happening overall within all our tech centers it’s really the transformation indiscernible where we more of a build to print type of company more of that commodity product to alans earlier question you see us now as a technology provider customers pulling us in early to help them with their development to help them show how we can improve the  their systems and take out overall weight of a vehicle so it’s not about what is the comparison of part number x to x but how do we take that system redefine the system to drive down total reduction in weight and improve product performance george gaspar okay and about that opportunity that’s coming about in the rd center you’re making  i assume you’re making some pretty significant advancements in compression equipment that you utilize in the components remanufacturing ramzi hermiz when we focus on our end product we spend a lot of times talking about the conversion or the movement from a processing company selling more products actually the way to look at it is we have extremely highquality staff process technology and we have a lot of that and it is what differentiates us and has differentiated us in the past what we are adding to that capability is not only going after and maintaining our strong process technologies but also adding specific and targeted products focus so it’s the combination of having a product strategy with a strong foundation and process capability and that is how we are able to when we say we lightweight aluminum where somebody could have an aluminum component and we can take  as we spoke about couple of quarters ago product that we took  pounds out of an aluminum part technical difficulty of our process capability and our equipment capability the examples i used this quarter were we replaced on a vehicle parts that were steel parts that were aluminum and even parts that were already carbon fiber many people speak about the lightweight capabilities of carbon fiber and it is lightweight and we are able to  but it mates to another part and that part mates to another part and when we look at the system with our fintech technology we are able to eliminate a number of components and so where you may have had three or four components to make an assembly we replaced it with one and that one part was in total lighter than what was there before in many cases more cost competitive then what was there before so again it’s that how do we lightweight without comprising how do we lightweight with adding benefits george gaspar thank you for that that is very very significant appreciate your comments on that thank you operator thank you this concludes our question and answer session i would like turn the call back over to management for closing remark ramzi hermiz thank you operator again quarter  was very solid we had a great quarter the performance of the team and the performance and the relationships with our
