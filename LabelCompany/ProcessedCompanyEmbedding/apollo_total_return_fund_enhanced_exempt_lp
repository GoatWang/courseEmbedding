is no guarantee of future results diversification does not guarantee investment returns and does not eliminate the risk of loss bonds are subject to interest rate risks bond prices generally fall when interest rates rise the price of equity securities may rise or fall because of changes in the broad market or changes in a companys financial condition sometimes rapidly or unpredictably equity securities are subject to stock market risk meaning that stock prices in general may decline over short or extended periods of time international investing involves a greater degree of risk and increased volatility changes in currency exchange rates and differences in accounting and taxation policies outside the us can raise or lower returns also some overseas markets may not be as politically and economically stable as the united states and other nations investments in emerging markets can be more volatile real estate investments may be subject to a higher degree of market risk because of concentration in a specific industry sector or geographical sector real estate investments may be subject to risks including but not limited to declines in the value of real estate risks related to general and economic conditions changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trust and defaults by borrower investments in commodities may have greater volatility than investments in traditional securities particularly if the instruments involve leverage the value of commoditylinked derivative instruments may be affected by changes in overall market movements commodity index volatility changes in interest rates or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity such as drought floods weather livestock disease embargoes tariffs and international economic political and regulatory developments use of leveraged commoditylinked derivatives creates an opportunity for increased return but at the same time creates the possibility for greater loss derivatives may be riskier than other types of investments because they may be more sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions than other types of investments and could result in losses

interest rate risks bond prices generally fall when interest rates rise the price of equity securities may rise or fall because of changes in the broad market or changes in a companys financial condition sometimes rapidly or unpredictably equity securities are subject to stock market risk meaning that stock prices in general may decline over short or extended periods of time international investing involves a greater degree of risk and increased volatility changes in currency exchange rates and differences in accounting and taxation policies outside the us can raise or lower returns also some overseas markets may not be as politically and economically stable as the united states and other nations investments in emerging markets can be more volatile real estate investments may be subject to a higher degree of market risk because of concentration in a specific industry sector or geographical sector real estate investments may be subject to risks including but not limited to declines in the value of real estate risks related to general and economic conditions changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trust and defaults by borrower investments in commodities may have greater volatility than investments in traditional securities particularly if the instruments involve leverage the value of commoditylinked derivative instruments may be affected by changes in overall market movements commodity index volatility changes in interest rates or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity such as drought floods weather livestock disease embargoes tariffs and international economic political and regulatory developments use of leveraged commoditylinked derivatives creates an opportunity for increased return but at the same time creates the possibility for greater loss derivatives may be riskier than other types of investments because they may be more sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions than other types of investments and could result in losses that significantly exceed the original investment the use of derivatives may not be successful resulting in investment losses and the cost of such strategies may reduce investment returns there is no guarantee that the use of long and short positions will succeed in limiting an investors exposure to domestic stock market movements capitalization sector swings
