interim clinical data from starbeam study of lentid™ drug product in cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy jun   bluebird bio inc announced topline interim data from the initial cohort of  patients in the ongoing phase  starbeam study ald evaluating lentid™ investigational gene therapy in boys under  years old with cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy cald as of june    patients with cald have completed  years of followup postlentid treatment with   remaining free of major functional disabilities mfds the primary endpoint of the trial this exceeds the predefined interim efficacy benchmark for the study of mfdfree survival of  derived from the literature and based on clinical data from an earlier observational study describing that natural history of cald and outcomes from allogeneic hsct in the starbeam study the safety profile of lentid was consistent with myeloablative conditioning no patients treated with lentid had graft versus host disease gvhd and there was no graft rejection or clonal dominance in december  bluebird bio announced that the starbeam study had been expanded to treat eight additional patients at sites in europe and the us and the study is currently enrolling the additional patients the expansion of the study is intended to enable the first manufacture of lentid in europe the subsequent treatment of subjects in europe and to bolster the overall clinical data package for potential future regulatory filings in the united states and europe the starbeam study is assessing the efficacy and safety of an investigational gene therapy in boys up to  years of age with cald it involves transplantation with a patient’s own stem cells which are modified to contain functional copies of the abcd gene this gene addition should result in the production of functional adrenoleukodystrophy protein aldp a protein critical for the breakdown of very long chain fatty acids vlcfas buildup of vlcfas in the central nervous system contributes to neurodegeneration in cald subjects enrolled in the study are eligible for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant hsct but with no matched sibling donor confirmed earlystage active cald as indicated by gadolinium

presented by mark walters md ucsf benioff childrens hospital oakland california in an oral session on sunday june  at the european hematology association eha annual meeting in madrid spain northstar is first study to utilize improved lentiglobin drug product manufacturing process to increase the drug product vector copy number and percent of cells transduced the first patient treated in this study exemplifies the promise of gene therapy discontinuing blood transfusions approximately a month after treatment and achieving a normal level of total hemoglobin production at six months posttreatment these early results suggest that the improved manufacturing process results in consistently higher drug product vector copy numbers vcn and lentiviral vector positive lvv cells which is correlated with higher production of hba and ultimately may address known patienttopatient variability the northstar study is an ongoing openlabel singledose international multicenter phase  study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lentiglobin drug product for the treatment of patients with tdt and nongenotypes as of june   drug product had been manufactured for six patients the
