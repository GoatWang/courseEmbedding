search go take five with calvin h knowlton september   calvin knowlton bscpharm mdiv phd is the founder and ceo of tabula rasa healthcare based in moorestown at tabula rasa healthcare you focus on ways to use technology to improve health care particularly in the area of medication risk mitigation how big a problem is this  the elephant in the room in pharmacy is adverse drug events cms and the cdc have data showing that adverse drug events lead to more than  deaths each year the problem worsens as people many of them elderly take five six ten or even  medications a day and often these medications have been prescribed by more than one physician the risk for complications can be high  we have to solve this problem so what does tabula rasa do for these patients  we have proprietary technologyenabled products and services for medication management and risk adjustment  many pharmacists today use software that is decades old the pharmacist can check for interactions only between one drug and one other drug at trhc we can analyze how multiple drugs work together and how together they can cause problems we can assess multimedication prescribing we can also use an individual’s genetic profile for insight into how he or she would metabolize certain medications what are the adverse reactions you are looking for we may look at the combined sedative effect or the combined dryness effect sometimes the patient will complain about dry mouth and the doctor may prescribe another medication to combat dryness without examining how the patient’s prescriptions may contribute to the problem medications that contribute to dryness may have serious health consequences for patients impacting cognitive ability and often contributing to falls and hospitalizations  we try to get to the root of medicationrelated problems and work as advisors to the prescribers you also can create genomic profiles for patients how does that help in combating adverse drug events when the body takes in a medication it is like a poison the body must water solubilize or make watersoluble the drug with the highest affinity for a gene will be water solubilized first and the other medications will circulate around the body perhaps creating an unintentional overdose something as simple as changing the time of day a person takes a particular medication can make a big difference or maybe you can switch to another class of medication that does not use that particular enzyme it is all very complex in most cases our platform will assume a patient has a normal gene profile in the highest risk patients however a cheek swab test will show us their specific dna as it relates to drug metabolism this dna test allows us to assess medication activation and metabolism at a much more precise level we have teams of scientists clinical pharmacists and software developers working on how to uncover and then mitigate the risk the focus in health care today is often on improving care while also reducing costs is that the case with tabula rasa  yes absolutely sometimes we can reduce how many medications the patient is taking but we also can reduce costs by improving care for the patient often there is no quarterback overseeing a patient’s entire medication regimen the gastroenterologist may not want to change a medication prescribed by a psychiatrist say or by a neurologist we know that by applying a novel sciencebased approach to the medicationuse process we can help reduce er visits falls and hospitalizations a patient with better care costs less we think in several years that our software will be in every pharmacy school in the nation what we are doing is part of the migration toward patient centricity in health care × carekinesis » calvin h knowlton bscpharm mdiv phd
