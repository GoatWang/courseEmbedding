expensive than it looksoct   about hostess brands twnk investor gator alternative energy industrials longshort equity special situationssummarythe gores holdings inc grsh acquisition of hostess is complicated and deserves a close look at the mechanicscorrecting for a set of cherrypicked comparable companies moves the reference valuation range down from x ebitda to between x ebitda and x ebitdaincluding in the purchase price a tax savings sharing obligation estimated at m and a highly probably  earn out adds x ebitda to the acquisition price of hostessafter these adjustments hostess appears to be valued at or above the top end of the comparable trading range at the current grhs price of  per sharenote while the current price of grsh is  the company uses a reference price of  in its most recent september investor presentation i use  per share from here on to maintain consistency across comparisons introduction as far as most special purpose acquisition company spac transactions go the hostess acquisition by gores holdings grsh looks like a winner a proven brand a proven management team staying onboard after the sale and an easytounderstand story all suggest good things to come for those considering a long position the transaction mechanics are complicated though so a further look at the purchase of hostess by gores holdings makes sense as a matter of diligence and in particular to verify the sponsors claim on page  of the most recent investor presentation that gores acquisition of hostess will occur at a meaningful discount to peers tevebitda trading levels transaction mechanics before i could drill down on valuation i wanted to understand better both a the net impact of the changes in common stock and warrants arising from the transaction and b the cash and noncash sources and uses required to complete the transaction an initial look through the supporting information in the investor presentation and press releases left me frustrated while there was a lot of good information contained therein i found it necessary to comb through the various merger filings to put together what i consider a complete look fully diluted ownership the presentation includes some essential information on capitalization but it is far from complete the dilutive impact of over m warrants is not accounted for and the sources and uses are not adequately detailed pulling together information from the companys periodic filings as well as the transaction filings allows for a more complete picture the presentation does a good job of providing the detailed shareholdings for the sponsors and seller posttransaction indicating that metropolous will own a very incentivizing  gores will retain  and original spac shareholders will retain  down from  but those ownership levels do not take into account potential impact from the exercise of the warrants and other dilutive events the table above takes into account the potential dilution from the m outstanding warrants exercisable for onehalf share each issued to the public and in connection with the private placement exercise of the warrants would take public shareholder ownership down nearly  from  to  its also worth noting the potential dilutive impact from another m shares to be issued if certain earn out targets are achieved is excluded from the table above sources and uses required to complete the transaction the pro forma valuation and sources and uses are also lacking some detail that would be very helpful to prospective investors in particular i was curious as to the delevering amount it turns out that embedded in that number is m of target cash that is hinted at but not clearly accounted for in the presentation again going through the filings we can fill in some of those essential details now that weve supplemented the investor presentation with some essential details from the filings on the mechanics of the transaction such as shareholding pre and post transaction and the specific cash and noncash sources and uses its time to dig a little deeper on valuation valuation hostess is an iconic brand with an emotional connection to us consumers however it seems most of the companys products twinkies cupcakes extended shelf life bread are on the very wrong side of a powerful secular trend toward fresh local healthy and organic eating hostess products will certainly maintain an esteemed place within the indulgent snacks category but once the accelerated growth from the companys reintroduction to the marketplace wears off this year i am skeptical of longterm growth due to secular trends and general competition within the food category as such buying hostess at a discount to peers as the investor presentation claims it is being offered is all the more important page  of the investor presentation shows a group of seven midcap food companies that seem to anchor the relative valuation and shows a median eve ebitda multiple of x versus the presented hostess multiple of x trading comps looking at the seven specific midcap trading comps selected by the company to justify the valuation versus the broader fifty or so diversified food companies of which they are a subset reveals a cherrypicked data set the seven companies chosen by the company to support the valuation are highlighted in yellow you can see that while hostess represented by the box of twinkies is in the bottom  by market cap at an estimated b the companyselected comps are all substantially larger with six of the seven being in the top half for market cap many of the companychosen comps are broader and more diversified than hostess one comp mccormick is really in a different business altogether  spices the impact of the cherry picking is made clear in the table below it resulted in a much higher multiple for the comparable group since i dont have access to the forward ebitda estimates used by the company in preparing the presentation i used trailing ebitda multiples for this exercise this is reasonable in light of the steady growth of the sector and the higher accuracy from historical versus projected data since were comparing the relative difference between big and small companies whether we use historical or projected ebitda does not matter because of the steady state nature of the industry as the top part of the table below shows the comparable multiple decreases significantly when a more appropriate group of comparables is chosen the seven larger more diversified and sometimes altogether different comparable companies chosen by the company have a median market cap of b and a median evttm ebitda multiple x choosing a more appropriate comp group for hostess which is anticipated to have a b market cap when it debuts according to the companys assumed price of  per share in the presentation reduces the comp group multiple to x ebitda for all fifty food companies including the largest one or x ebitda for a more appropriate comp group with market caps between m and b or x ebitda when an even more appropriate comp group with market caps between m and b is chosen its worth pausing here to note again that the presentation in using the seven chosen midcap food companies shows a median multiple of x not the x i show above thats because whereas i use trailing ebitda the presentation uses a more opaque estimated forward ebitda the critical point is that the relative difference in multiples between the large and small food companies is meaningful and completely changes the nature of the comparison this would hold true whether trailing or forward numbers are used since the industry is characterized by mature steady growth hostess valuation there is a bit of work to be done on the hostess multiple too in looking at the hostess multiple i choose to use the companys  estimated ebitda instead of the trailing ebitda as i have for the comps why  represents the first year of steady state operations for hostess after significant transformative changes and its subsequent reintroduction to the marketplace although it would help my argument to use a lower trailing ebitda number using forward ebitda is actually a better applestoapples comparison versus the comp group as the data at the bottom of the previous table shows doing so results in a x evebitda multiple for hostess assuming as the company has done in its own presentation a share price of  for grsh however the presentation valuation excludes the obligation arising from a binding tax savings sharing agreement with the seller while the exact amount of the obligation is unknown the accountants estimate the liability at over m in the merger filings given the profitability of hostess it seems highly probable such payments will be made in addition to the tax savings sharing obligation the sellers are entitled to m additional shares via earn outs the first of these based on a  ebitda target of m also seems highly probable adding the additional cost of both of these obligations in moves the multiple from x to x note that excludes the additional  and  earnouts conclusion while the purchase of hostess by gores holdings has several positive aspects to it a closer look at the numbers reveals it appears to be coming to market at no discount whereas at a grhs price per share of  hostess will be valued at an evebitda multiple of between x and x an appropriate set of food comps is currently trading at a multiple of between x and x ebitda given that operational improvements will be difficult to obtain after the excellent restructuring work of the prior owners and that the companys products likely face a stiff growth headwind from secular trends the apparent lack of discount to trading peers is a
