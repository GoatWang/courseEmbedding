the application for a nonprovisional patent no proceeds from this offering will be paid to our sole officer and director in the form of commissions salary or other compensation we are currently unaware of anyone manufacturing marketing supplying or selling any product similar to our deluxe fishing rod holder our limited research on the internet did not result in the identification of any companies currently manufacturing andor supplying a fishingrod holder similar to the one we have designed and intend to market and sell there are several companies that make and sell fishing rod holders including fishing rod holders designed specifically for ice fishing however deluxe has not yet identified a fishing rod holder currently being manufactured andor sold by anyone else that will help set the hook into the fish’s mouth and trigger an alarm bell notifying the angler that a fish has been hooked our limited research has led us to believe that there are no products currently being offered similar to our proposed product although we have not identified a product similar to our design our research has been limited and there could be a similar product of which we are currently unaware being marketed andor sold we have not obtained any empirical evidence detailing the competitive market in the us and canada for a rodholder such as the one we have designed and we cannot determine competitive factors with any degree of certainty we plan on working with a supplier who already manufactures fishing products we do not at this time have any agreements or contracts with a supplier or company that provides such products while we do not have empirical evidence to support our contentions our limited research has led us to believe that competitive conditions are favorable according to statistics by statistacom there appears to be correlations between wildliferelated recreational expenditures in the us in   and  in the billion us dollars by category in   billion was spent on wildlife watching  billion was spent on fishing and  billion was spent on hunting in   billion was spent on wildlife watching  billion was spent on fishing and  billion was spent on hunting in   billion was spent on wildlife watching  billion was spent on fishing and  billion was spent on hunting in all three categories from  to  there is  increase in total sales in the same categories from  to  there is  increase in total sales although fishing sales dropped in  to  billion from  billion in  total sales of hunting increased to  billion from where it had dropped to in  it is estimated that  million americans or  of the population participated in wildliferelated recreation in  it was an increase is  million participants since  although we do not have empirical data to support it deluxe considers there to be similarities and possible correlations between hunting and fishing those involved in wildliferelated recreation spent  billion on gear trips licenses tags and land leasing more than  million people fished in  they spent  billion on trips equipment licenses and other items an average of  per angler statistics gathered by the american fishing association estimates that the ice fishing market exceeded  million in  an increase of nearly  over  our data is not suggesting that the increase in total sales from  to  are new anglers however it may suggest a relationship with dollars spent in other wildliferelated recreational categories we believe deluxe can be among the first companies to introduce such products into our target market areas although we have not discovered that anyone that produces similar products there is no guarantee that deluxe will find success or be a product that will be able to compete effectively we believe we have an unproven product with no clear or definite understanding of the competitive factors an investment in deluxe is extremely risky there are no immediate or imminent threats to the supply or prices of related materials due to shortages or other factors that we are aware of at this time to our knowledge at this time there are no government regulations in the united states or canada that would prohibit or negatively affect deluxe from importing or exporting our products into or out of those countries to our knowledge at this time there are no importexport regulations or controls imposed by any of the potential countries from which our products could originate that would prevent us from obtaining our products or shipping our products to the us or canada the company currently has no employees and has no plans to hire any employees during its first year of operation deluxe intends to use contracted services to conduct all aspects of its business company description we were incorporated in the state of nevada as dd’s deluxe rod holder inc on september   deluxe has developed a prototype fishingrod holder for use primarily by icefisherman on january   the company filed a provisional patent application with the united states patent and trademark office “uspto” a provisional patent application is valid for twelve  months from its date of filing unless extended a “nonprovisional” patent application can be filed at any time during the  month period following the filing of the provisional application a “nonprovisional” patent application may still be filed within two  months of the expiration of the provisional application upon leave of the uspto prior to the expiration of the provisional patent application deluxe plans to file a nonprovisional application for a utility patent and thereafter market the prototype to sporting goods and angling wholesalers as well as retailers and the general public in the united states and canada in order to obtain a nonprovisional utility patent we intend to retain the services of a law firm or other third party service provider who specializes in preparing and filing of patent applications with the united states patent and trademark office deluxe does not have any agreements with any companies suppliers or manufacturers nor does it have any agreements with customers to purchase any products from the company the nonprovisional patent application is commonly known as a “utility” patent application filing this application establishes the filing date and begins the united states patent and trademark office uspto’s patent review process which can take  months or more to complete the nonprovisional or “utility” patent for an invention is the grant of a property right to the inventor issued by the united states patent and trademark office moreover an invention can be considered property giving the inventor an exclusive right to license it while retaining ownership or selling it outright the nonprovisional patent excludes others from making using or selling the patented invention having a nonprovisional patent creates licensing opportunities conversely the provisional patent application establishes the filing date but does not start the uspto review process and therefore offers limited protections to the company and its product relative to the nonprovisional or “utility” patent application the provisional patent application provides a limited when compared to a nonprovisional application measure of protection for  months from the filing date and expires unless you file a utility patent application extension before the  months are up the provisional application establishes a priority date so anyone conceiving the same invention later will not be able to obtain a patent as long as the originator files a full nonprovisional patent application within one year of filing the provisional version the provisional patent is much more simplified a written description of the invention is required but claims and drawings are not a provisional patent application allows us to use the “patent pending” designation for our proposed product and upon filing the nonprovisional “utility” patent application we will be allowed to relate back the filing date for the “utility” patent application to the date we filed the nonprovisional patent application the granting of a “utility” patent will provide us with the full protection of united states and international patent laws with respect to our proposed product although the company has not to date retained the services of any patent assistance service provider our president anticipates doing so in the near future  dd’s deluxe rod holder inc unit   a –  worobetz place saskatoon sk sl r telephone

business purpose of the company is to sell through its website deluxerodholdercom a fishing rod holder primarily for use the sport of ice fishing  the company has selected december  as its fiscal year end   note   significant accounting policies   basis of presentation   this summary of significant accounting policies is presented to assist in understanding the financial statements the financial statements and notes are representations of the company’s management which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity these financial statements and related notes are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states   in the opinion of management the accompanying unaudited interim balance sheets and statements of operations and cash flows contain all adjustments consisting of normal recurring items necessary to present fairly in all material respects the financial position of the company as of september   and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the three and nine months ended september   and  the operating and financial results for the company for the three and nine months ended september   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending december     going concern   as shown in the accompanying financial statements the company has incurred operating losses since inception  as of september   the company has no financial resources with which to achieve its objectives and obtain profitability and positive cash flows  as shown in the accompanying balance sheets and statements of operations the company has an accumulated deficit of  and the companys working capital is a negative   achievement of the companys objectives will be dependent upon the ability to obtain additional financing and generate revenue from current and planned business operations and control costs  the company is in the development stage and has generated no operating income the company plans to fund its future operations by joint venturing or obtaining additional financing from investors andor lenders  however there is no assurance that the company will be able to achieve these objectives therefore substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern exists  the financial statements do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability of recorded assets nor the implications of associated bankruptcy costs should the company be unable to continue as a going concern   use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period significant areas requiring the use of management assumptions and estimates relate to valuation of deferred tax  actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions and could have a material effect on the company’s reported financial position and results of operations   new accounting pronouncement   in august  the fasb issued asu no —presentation of financial statements—going concern the guidance requires an entity’s management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events considered in the aggregate that raise substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued or within one year after the date that the financial statements are        dd’s deluxe rod holder inc notes to financial statements september         available to be issued when applicable if conditions or events exist that

expenses all costs incurred in connection with the startup and organization of the company   fair value measurements   asc topic  fair value measurements asc  requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value  asc  establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value  a financial instruments categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement  asc  prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value   level   level  applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities   level   level  applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quote prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical assets in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions less active markets or modelderived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data   level   level  applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities   at september   the company had no assets or liabilities accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis   loss per share   basic earnings per share eps is computed as net income loss available to common stockholders divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period   diluted eps reflects the potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through stock options and warrants  the company has no potentially dilutive securities such as options warrants or convertible debt currently issued and outstanding  consequently basic and diluted earnings per share are the same as shown in the statement of operations

commission the “sec” particularly the company’s s registration statement as amended originally filed on may   and in the future its annual reports on form k reports on form q and current reports on form k corporate background dd’s deluxe rod holder inc “deluxe” or the “company” is a nevada corporation formed on september    the company intends to build its business by developing marketing and selling a fishing rod holder for use primarily by icefisherman  on january   the company filed a provisional patent application with the united states patent and trademark office “uspto”  the company’s original provisional patent application was scheduled to expire on january    on january   the company filed a new provisional patent            application with the uspto  on february   the company converted the provisional patent application into a nonprovisional by filing a nonprovisional patent application uspto  the company anticipates the entire process to acquire a nonprovisional utility patent will take between  months current operations   the company is a developmental stage company  the company has conducted limited operations and have had no operating revenues  we have never declared bankruptcy been in receivership or involved in any legal action or proceedings  since incorporating we have not made any significant purchases or sales of assets nor have we been involved in any mergers acquisitions or consolidations   deluxe is building a business as a developer and seller of a fishing rod holder for use primarily for ice fishing  although the fishing rod holder can be used on almost any solid relatively flat surface such as a dock during nonwinter months our primary target market is ice anglers  what we refer to as a fishing rod holder includes a platform base connected to a tube that holds the rod a split key ring affixed to an eye bolt a bent metal mechanism which we have described as the “fishingrodeyeletcatch” an optional alarm bell and a coarselythreaded screw which enables the enduser to stabilize the unit andor affix the base of the unit to ice wood foam metal and a range of other hard surfaces  when a fish is hooked the fishingrodeyeletcatch releases from the flexed rod allowing the stored elastic energy in the flexed rod to expend visually alerting the fisherman  the rodholder will include a small metal bell and fisherman will have the option to attach it to the rod which will further alert the angler when a fish is hooked and the rod is released from the eyeletcatch  the eyeletcatch is a bendable metal rod which allows the fisherman to adjust the sensitivity of the catch system a decrease in the angle of the eyeletcatch makes the system more sensitive and an increase in the angle of the eyeletcatch makes it less sensitive  a more sensitive eyeletcatch will make it easier for small fish to disengage the eyeletcatch and a less sensitive eyeletcatch will make it more difficult to disengage the fishing rod enabling only larger fish to do so   believing the design of our product is eligible for a utility patent we have filed a nonprovisional patent application with the uspto  the company selffiled the nonprovisional patent application via the uspto’s online electronic filing system  the filing date february   establishes the “date” of invention and if a utility patent is ultimately issued precludes any opposing claims to the invention subsequent to that date  the uspto will respond to the company by either notifying the company that its application is incomplete or the application will be assigned internally within the uspto to undergo the examination process  if the application is incomplete the uspto will provide the company with a list of deficiencies and the company will be given an opportunity to correct those deficiencies  once the application is complete and assigned to an examiner the examiner will make an initial determination as to whether our proposed product is eligible for the issuance of a utility patent  if the examiner initially determines that our proposed product is not eligible to receive a utility patent the examiner will issue a determination to that effect and explain to the company the bases for the examiner’s determination  the company will then have an opportunity to amend its application andor respond to the examiner’s bases for its determination  if the examiner determines that our proposed product is eligible for patent protection then the examiner will issue a notice of allowance which will contain further instructions to complete the process to issue the utility patent covering our proposed product  if we are successful in obtaining a utility patent for our proposed product that patent will grant us certain rights regarding the proposed product including but not necessarily limited to the rights to for a period of at least twenty  years exclude others from making using selling offering for sale importing or otherwise utilizing our proposed product without our specific consent  the company expects it will take at least  months to obtain a nonprovisional utility patent for our proposed product     during the next twelve  months the company will work toward identifying and engaging a manufacturer to produce our product and also identifying one or more sporting goods andor angling equipment wholesaler andor retailers with which to place our product for sale to the general public  we will not make any agreements with wholesalers retailers or manufacturers until we have achieved success in obtaining a nonprovisional utility patent for our proposed product  we will likely not place any orders with a manufacturer unless and until we have received advance orders of our product from wholesalers andor retailers  we currently do not have any agreements with a manufacturer or with any wholesalers or product retailers  we foresee delivering product to retailers andor wholesalers within the next twentyfour  months            upon and only if the company obtains a nonprovisional “utility” patent for its proposed product and after we have sourced a manufacturer to make our proposed product we will begin marketing our proposed product to wholesalers retailers and the general public  our marketing plan will include online search optimization utilization of a company website production and dissemination of hard copy and electronic promotional materials and direct marketing efforts to retailers and wholesalers and trade show attendees   we likely will not place any orders to manufacture our proposed product until we receive advanced sales orders from wholesalers andor retailers  at this time it is impossible to effectively market our product and to know how l
