of the selling security holders the motion picture industry is intensely competitive competition comes from companies within the same business and companies in other entertainment media that create alternative forms of entertainment the industry is currently evolving in such a way that certain multinational multimedia firms will be able to dominate this space because of their control over key film magazine and television content as well as key network and cable outlets these organizations have numerous competitive advantages such as the ability to acquire financing for their projects and to make favorable arrangements for the distribution of completed films all of our competitors will likely be organizations of substantially larger size and capacity with far greater financial and personnel resources and longer operating histories and may be better able to acquire properties personnel and financing and enter into more favorable distribution agreements our success will depend on public taste which is both unpredictable and susceptible to rapid change as an independent film production company we most likely will not have the backing of a major studio for production and distribution support consequently we may not be able to complete a motion picture in order to be competitive we intend to create independent motion pictures that may appeal to a wide range of public taste both in the united states and abroad moreover by producing our films in canada we believe that we will be able to significantly reduce production costs and thereby offer our films to distributors at competitive pricing investors must be aware that at this time we have not produced any film and may not ever be successful in doing so in the future company description we were incorporated in the state of california as a forprofit company on september   and established a fiscal year end of december  we are a development stage enterprise on september   our incorporator adopted our bylaws and appointed our sole director we were formed to develop produce and distribute lowbudget independent feature films and exploit other entertainment opportunities which may include the licensing and selling of intellectual properties  we are a development stage enterprise that was formed to develop and produce lowbudget feature length motion pictures and other entertainment related projects we also intend to acquire scripts and the rights to projects we have had limited operations and have limited financial resources we have not yet begun any entertainment projects our auditors indicated in their report on our financial statements the “report” that “the company’s lack of business operations and continuing losses raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern” our operations to date have been devoted primarily to startup and development activities which include  formation of the company  development of our business plan  evaluating various entertainment properties  research on marketing channelsstrategies for our entertainment properties and the industry  secured our website domain wwwthunderclapinccom and developed our initial online website and  research on books and ideas that we may develop into film projects in  we plan to focus our business operations on the development and production of commercial featurelength lowbudget motion pictures having budgets of up to  million dollars we plan to utilize our website to solicit projects from writers directors producers and agents we anticipate promoting these film properties by assembling a business plan for presentation to prospective investors and financiers consisting of the screenplay a budget shooting schedule production board and identification of recognizable actors or directors for the film we also intend to have discussions with various film distributors to determine what our best options are for the distribution of a completed project we plan to offer grants of our stock or options to acquire our stock in order to secure screenplays treatments actors’ participation and directors’ participation in our films a treatment is a written sketch outlining the plot characters and action for a screenplay but not including certain elements of a finished screenplay such as camera directions and dialogue there can be no assurance that writers actors andor directors in exchange for their participation in a film will ever consider our stock in exchange for their screenplays or services any such grants of stock may involve substantial dilution to our existing shareholders we currently do not have sufficient capital to independently finance our own film projects we intend to rely on outside sources of financing for all film production activities our ability to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow is dependent upon our ability to produce commercially successful motion picture films in order to succeed we must develop or acquire screenplays appropriate for production and distribution we intend to rely on our chairman’s and presidents access to and relationships with creative talent including writers actors and directors to find suitable existing screenplays we also intend to market our website to the film industry to solicit screenplays for our consideration there can be no guarantee or assurance that our chairman or president andor our website will enable us to attract and produce commercially viable screenplays into films that will result in future profits to us we plan to profit from this business activity by exclusively owning all right title and interest in and to the screenplay and any film derived from it and also capitalizing on other marketing opportunities associated with these properties including but not limited to the publishing and promotion of associated music the incorporation of original songs on sound tracks for subsequent use in promotion sound track albums storytelling records and the licensing of merchandising rights motion picture revenue is derived from the worldwide licensing of a film to several distinct markets each having its own distribution network and potential for profit the selection of the distributor for each of our feature films will depend upon a number of factors our most basic criterion is whether the distributor has the ability to secure bookings for the exhibition of the film on satisfactory terms we will consider whether when and in what amount the distributor will make advances to us we will also consider the amount and manner of computing distribution fees and the extent to which the distributor will guarantee certain print advertising and promotional expenditures no assurance can be given that our films if produced will be distributed and if distributed will return the investment or make a profit to achieve the goal of producing profitable lowbudget feature films we plan to be selective in our choice of screenplays that we decide to produce exercise a high degree of control over the cost of production and work with potential distributors on a viable and costeffective distribution and marketing plan for our films the production of feature films does not require the ownership of expensive equipment we believe that all the necessary equipment needed to engage in every aspect of the film production process can be rented or borrowed for the period in which it is needed we believe that many production companies follow this operating procedure and we plan to rent or borrow the needed equipment in our anticipated film productions since september   our inception to march   we have not generated any revenues and have a net loss of  we anticipate generating revenues within the first twelve months after we have secured separate financing for our first film project we believe that we have sufficient working capital to continue our operations for the next  months without the need to seek additional financing our selling security holders are offering for sale  shares of common stock at an offering price of  per share we currently have two officers and a sole director these individuals allocate time and personal resources to us on a parttime basis and devote approximately  hours per week to us one of our shareholders who is neither an officer or director and who owns less than  of
