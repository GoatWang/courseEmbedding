mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf

with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed

shareholder letter issued today and the slides accompanying this presentation which are available on our investor relations website at investorssolarcitycom with that finally behind us i would like to introduce solarcitys ceo mr lyndon rive lyndon r rive  chief executive officer  director thanks aaron today were not going to go through the presentation id rather spend time answering questions before getting to the questions let me just provide you with a quick summary for the quarter guidance we came in nicely above our guidance we installed  megawatts our bookings increased  over last quarter you will see a large increase in cash and loans we now are roughly  of our bookings is cash and loans were expecting that to increase significantly in q cash and loans actually improve the cash generation of the business dramatically our customer acquisition costs came down  we expect the customer acquisition costs to reduce further in q were also seeing an increase in the value of our solar systems that we are installing as you may recall in january we increased pricing were starting to see the effect of that pricing increase and our system value has increased  per watt on a gigawatt that would be equivalent to  million increase in net present value looking at our customer billings thatd be leases and power purchase agreements were now almost at  million per quarter and once we pay back tax equity debt and maintenance for the solar systems solarcity is generating  million of recurring cash flows next point id like to address is our cash outlook for the quarter we consumed  million a big cause of this was the tesla announcement the tesla announcement delayed our tax equity funds and just – the tax equity fund had to go back to credit committee to get approval those have all now been approved and have been funded but this caused a delay in q i just want to spend a few minutes describing the two primary sources of our financing we have tax equity and then we have debt tax equity is roughly twothirds of the cash needed to finance the systems and debt is roughly onethird once we closed the tax equity fund we needed to get it approved by debt provider which is the aggregation facility we have one large aggregation facility that approves all our tax equity funds and that takes roughly  days to approve they are now approving them in q and we expect that cash balance for q to increase over our cash balance in q for q we expect our cash balance to increase over q one final point i want to make before getting into questions and this one im really very excited about is in q we announced our new grid services offering as a reminder the grid services offering is services that we provide to the utility so the utility is our customer when providing grid services to the utility we leverage our existing infrastructure and we provide things like demand load shifting voltage control or reactive power just within the first few months weve established partnerships with pge southern california edison and the energy commission of california we have a strong pipeline of over  million in prospective opportunities when it comes to grid services were really unique we have the software and we also have the deployment infrastructure nobody else has this capability so were excited to help utilities manage the grid a lot better as you see large solar and storage being deployed for  and actually  weve invested a lot into products we believe that in order to differentiate ourselves in the future were going to have to have significant product differentiation and to maintain our leadership and actually expand our leadership we need to invest into products were going to be launching two new products at the end of this year which we expect will meaningfully increase our sales in  with that said i want to open it up to questions questionandanswer session operator thank you our first question comes from the line of philip shen with roth capital please proceed with your question philip leewei shen  roth capital partners llc hi thanks for taking my questions the first one is on the tesla deal and acquisition offer the final deal and offer price was actually lower than the original price can you comment on – and it might be hard for you to do this but the rationale for taking the lower offer and how that came about thanks elon reeve musk  chairman sure i can comment its elon here and yeah  now joins us and this call the first time is – that we can answer questions like this this was a negotiation of the independent board members i actually wasnt part of – any part of it it was simply what they came up with after i think a quite exhaustive discussion that lasted a week or two so ive not inquired about the details and im not privy to the details but it was ultimately what they concluded was fair between the independent board members of solarcity and the board members of tesla obviously this is now up to the shareholder votes – independent shareholder votes where obviously im recusing myself im not legally obligated to recuse myself im just doing so because i think its morally the right thing to do and so is lyndon and pete and jb straubel philip leewei shen  roth capital partners llc okay thanks elon in terms of the silevo manufacturing facility can you give us an update on what the latest – whats going on now are we – are you guys on track to hitting your targets of  gigawatt by year end  i believe and if not perhaps how much might be in place by the end of the year what the cost structures might be and so forth thanks peter rive  cofounder  chief technology officer sure this is peter so were actually going to be able to start making modules out of buffalo faster than we had anticipated right now were actually expecting to ramp the module lines by q of  so – and were going to be making a pretty interesting product and im excited to kind of reveal it to you all at some point but it is not just your typical module it is both very efficient and it looks really really good elon reeve musk  chairman its a solar roof as opposed to a module on a roof peter rive  cofounder  chief technology officer yeah so i mean i think that in – a couple of weeks ago we talked about us wanting to start actually having a roofing integrated product and a large part of that module manufacturing being there is going to be for that elon reeve musk  chairman yeah and id just like to emphasize i think this is really a fundamental part of achieving differentiated product strategy where you have a – its not even a beautiful roof that it is a solar roof its not a thing on a roof it is the roof thats – which is quite a difficult engineering challenge and not something that is available really anywhere else that is at all good i think this will be something thats quite a standout and  so this is one of the things im really very excited about the future so lyndon r rive  chief executive officer  director and its just addressing a really big market segment so just in the us theres  million new roofs installed every year and this is a product well focus on the – primarily focus on the new roof market elon reeve musk  chairman yeah i mean i think the interesting thing about this is that it actually doesnt cannibalize the existing product of putting solar on roof because essentially if youve got – if your roof is nearing endoflife you definitely dont want to put solar panels on it because youre going to have to replace the roof so theres a huge market segment that is currently inaccessible to solarcity because people know theyre going to have to replace their roofs you dont want to put solar panels on top of a roof youre going to replace however if you are close – if your roof is nearing endoflife well youve got to get a new roof anyway as lyndon was saying theres  million new roofs a year just in the us and so why not have a solar roof thats better in many others ways as well we dont want to show all of our cards right now but i think people are going to be really excited about what they see and like i said the cool thing is that it doesnt cannibalize the existing business because you got two classes of customer – like customers that – where the roofs nearing endoflife and customers where theyve just put in a new roof and so you actually get – this is a great situation where you get to introduce new product without cannibalizing the existing product peter rive  cofounder  chief technology officer and this is a product that were going to be kind of expediting module manufacturing for out of buffalo elon reeve musk  chairman right and this is – exactly – and this is why its really important to do the manufacturing inhouse because youre – it  control of the aesthetics and ideally really design – its kind of like making a custom car like when somebody orders a car from tesla theyll pick a wide array of options that car will be custom made to their preferences and you really want the roof custommade to the individual customer as a kit and then sent to – that would be the delivery team to get installed peter rive  cofounder  chief technology officer id just want to note that the majority of the capital expenses in order for us to get going on module manufacturing have essentially being incurred so as exciting as a product as this is the majority of the manufacturing expenses just for the module line here are essentially incurred and then we also have been looking at ways to significantly improve the capacity of the manufacturing facility in buffalo and we have both process equipment improvements as well as layout improvements that i think gives us the ability to meaningfully increase it above a gigawatt a year and whats really important for us in the factory is that its competitive for years to come so were going to take the time to make equipment modifications as you get the layouts exactly right we dont want to rush to actually initiate some of the equipment installation for the cell line and then have that be a regretful layout only months later so – but from a high level im pretty excited about what were doing at buffalo were going to have module manufacturing ahead of schedule and we have designs that will give us the ability to increase the capacity beyond a gigawatt operator thank you our next question comes from the line of brian lee with goldman sachs please proceed with your question brian lee  goldman sachs  co hey guys thanks for taking the questions maybe just start off with a high level one as you see some of the business mix evolving here what do you think the appropriate growth rate is as you transition to more of a loan system sale driven strategy versus – or product mix versus the pp and lease model before given the different financing mechanisms behind the two types of products and then how quickly – i know you said lyndon its up to  of bookings but how quickly do you think that goes to  for you guys lyndon r rive  chief executive officer  director so let me answer the second part so were pushing quite a bit on the cash and loan we like cash and loan it actually – from a cash generation for the business it improves it dramatically its also a lot easier to raise loan financing theres only ill call it a dozen or so tax equity providers but there are many providers that like high quality cash growth cash equity is a unique financing source as were financing straightforward solar systems is a lot easier itd be hard for me to give you exact forecast i mean i think itd be  im expecting to increase dramatically in q itd just be a little hard for me to give you an exact forecast of how much more but itll be a big focus for us in q frankly its a big focus for us right now but the effect of it will happen in q brian lee  goldman sachs  co okay elon reeve musk  chairman yeah and – pardon me for tagging on i talk too much but i think the – i think what well – if you look a little bit beyond that it is going to be a lot more towards cash and loan its actually economically more efficient for the end customer to do that so if the end customer has a good cost of capital or bad cost of capital which they usually do then solarcity – its fundamentally not  going to be more efficient for them to take the debt on themselves and then has the benefit of from a solarcity standpoint of decreasing dependence on the tax equity and securitization market brian lee  goldman sachs  co okay thank you thats helpful maybe related to that if we look at the competitive dynamics and market share over the course of several years there was clearly a big consolidation happening across the space as you and some of your peers were gaining a lot of share and just in recent quarters that seems to – the momentum there has reversed a bit as you see loans and cash system sales and those financing mechanisms coming into play does that reverse that momentum again where you start to see broader consolidation in the residential vertical and then i think one of the shifts weve also seen in the marketplace is some of these online kind of marketplace platforms starting to gain some traction is that something you have any initiatives around or you would even look to doing a partnership around to gain access to that channel lyndon r rive  chief executive officer  director yes so i think part of our – if you look at our customer acquisition costs in q we just had tremendous sales inefficiency so we made changes there sales efficiency has improved a lot and so with the sales efficiency improvement we now have seen bookings increase so we feel good about that in terms of the lease versus loans i dont think thats going to be the big differentiator financing has never really been a big differentiator everybody has always had financing initially what our biggest differentiator has been is that were vertically integrated we provided better services to our customers than any of our other competitors over time our competitors have vertically integrated their services as well now our focus is on products and we are releasing products that our competitors will not have and that will be the biggest driver to differentiating and growth elon reeve musk  chairman yeah absolutely brian lee  goldman sachs  co okay tanguy vincent serra  president chief financial  accounting officer to answer your last question were also focused obviously on developing an online channel and the ability for customers to purchase a solar roof or solar system through the internet brian lee  goldman sachs  co okay great thank you maybe if i could just squeeze one housekeeping one in for you tanguy on the pl the preproduction expense went from being in cogs last quarter to its now listed in opex just can you walk us what drives the delta from quartertoquarter in the accounting and how thats going to be treated in q and q thank you guys tanguy vincent serra  president chief financial  accounting officer sure absolutely brian so this is a consequence of what pete just discussed which is some of the cells that were manufacturing given the focus on the module line in buffalo and then the solar roof some of this other manufacturing in q q are now becoming rd and so – sorry in q q are now becoming rd as were classifying that spend as rd which is below cost so its just a matter of a decision to be made and the consequence of that from an accounting perspective brian lee  goldman sachs  co thanks guys operator thank you our next question comes from the line of patrick jobin with credit suisse please proceed with your question unknown speaker hi everyone its andrew  on for patrick a couple questions one on  guidance and specifically volume expectations for the fourth quarter with that big ramp and it being ci focused there has been some delays in the ci business for you guys in the past just curious your level of confidence in being able to deliver those megawatts with it looks like the majority being in the commercial segment tanguy vincent serra  president chief financial  accounting officer yeah so i think thats a fair comment so things – weve got the significant portion of those megawatts that were booking theyre already significantly underway so they are either actually under construction or through the permit and interconnection process and so weve got lineofsight on the vast majority of those megawatts the other comment id make is that includes some megawatts in mexico for the first time sort of real megawatts volume in mexico where – those that are cash sales and where the permitting structure is a little bit different and easier  and so – and theres no weather issues so we feel good about those megawatts unknown speaker great thats helpful and then in terms of just selling into california right now with nem  underway in certain utility territories how that is going and then how you guys anticipate even beyond that the sales process evolving from your perspective as you know we come into the timeofuse rate net metering program in california beyond that lyndon r rive  chief executive officer  director so weve actually moved our sales team over to selling net metering  already so remember the – we have to set the expectation with the customer of when the system is interconnected and its hard to forecast exactly when net metering  occurs – sorry  occurs versus  and so in our proposals we actually give expectation to our customers of what net metering  look like and so its already incorporated in our sales channel in pge at southern california edison we have a longer leadtime and the effective sales actually the sales efficiency has improved in july so i dont think its going to have that much of an effect in fact it hasnt had much peter rive  cofounder  chief technology officer i mean in the longterm weve been investing a lot in being able to integrate knowledge of the customers usage patterns with our rate structure databases with things like storage control smart thermostat control in order to be able to adjust when the customers energy is actually going to be used so i think youd maybe have like this shortterm anomaly which isnt having that much of an impact on us but in the long run i think its going to be a further point of differentiation for us unknown speaker that makes sense and just one more if i may and kind of segueing off that can you discuss at all your current attachment rate of storage today in the us and then what your expectations are on a forward basis particularly as you get into  and nem  and then even further on into timeofuse id be really curious sort of  what you expect storage attachment rates to be with new systems and ill hop back in the queue thanks peter rive  cofounder  chief technology officer sure so the majority of the storage bookings and deployments that weve had todate has been in commercial as well as utility scale last earnings call i was talking to you about having a backlog of over  megawatt hours in those market segments and so thats where the majority of the traction has been i think that when we think about the business in the long run if i look into the maybe like  and beyond i see us having  attach rate i think that the next kind of phase of solar adoption is going to be one that is almost always coupled with storage and so i would just say that i guess its kind of like a linear attachment rate between where we are right now which is singledigit percentages all the way to  as we enter the next decade tanguy vincent serra  president chief financial  accounting officer and in some instances youd actually go back and either retrofitting the utility scale or wind farm peter rive  cofounder  chief technology officer yeah tanguy vincent serra  president chief financial  accounting officer or a residential or commercial with the  benefit from the economics at the time peter rive  cofounder  chief technology officer yeah absolutely its one of the questions that we always get from our hundreds of thousands of customers like hey when are you going to be able to retrofit my system and storage that will be a massive upsell opportunity with all the systems that we already have deployed as well  operator thank you our next question comes from the line of ben kallo with robert w baird please proceed with your question benjamin joseph kallo  robert w baird  co inc broker hey thanks on those lines how much utility sales do we think youll have call it in two years versus your traditional business lyndon r rive  chief executive officer  director so we have a small team focused on that right now if you – total utility volume thats essentially customers that weve sold where the end buyer is the actual utility in the companys history is around  megawatts or so i do see that growing but itd be hard to give you an exact forecast of whether itd be in two years time theres long leadtime on that our primary focus today is on residential and commercial customers but that will become a bigger market of ours in the later years peter rive  cofounder  chief technology officer and as you remember that like when people say utility – like we structured our products and services that we have something to offer in generation as well as distribution and transmission and if you go to our website youll see the way that were explaining the services but on generation i see us being able to be a massive participant in the next phase of utilityscale solar generation which is to provide solar power through all of the peak hours i think that you can look at many utilityscale generation markets and see that theyre almost at the point of saturation for typical solar so what were positioning ourselves for is this next wave and this is going to be kind of planetwide its not just going to be a us thing and then also making sure that through distributed generation we can also offer products and services that are alternatives to traditional distribution and transmissionrelated expense so benjamin joseph kallo  robert w baird  co inc broker elon  peter rive  cofounder  chief technology officer im sorry benjamin joseph kallo  robert w baird  co inc broker i had two questions for elon real quick peter rive  cofounder  chief technology officer  i think im just going to say that yeah so we offer products and services also for distribution and transmission but im sorry go ahead benjamin joseph kallo  robert w baird  co inc broker so elon youve seen a lot of money invested im sure in the valley into nextgeneration solar a lot of money lost can you help us with the manufacturing side with silevo number one and number two how do we think about leadership going forward you have lots of competent people at solarcity but how do we think about who actually does daytoday management if tesla does get to buy solarcity thank you elon reeve musk  chairman well i think the – one thing on the solar side is to – on the panel and module side and cell side is to create a high level of product differentiation in particular with respect to aesthetics most people care a great deal about that i mean technically you could live in a house without drywall and just have all the insulation and wiring just hanging there but people care about drywall people care about remodeling their kitchen people care about their yard they care about making sure that their primary asset typically being their house is something that they – that it looks good and that theyre proud to show off and thats one of the primary – thats like the most important element of product differentiation here and then there is also of course the efficiency of the panel are you able to get a very high efficiency but still at a low cost and silevo has i think some important elements of that and i think well probably – we wont be talking about silevo as a name really because well be adding a lot of – assuming its going to be – the merger is approved by shareholders well be adding considerably to the technical team there it will become something far more than the original silevo were also entertaining some discussions with strategic partners on the solar cell manufacturing and some of those could head in an interesting direction our default path is still to continue the – assuming – again assuming we come together as a company to – the default path is still to continue with the cell engineering internally and bolster that team with – by recruiting worldclass engineers but we may conceivably on the solar cell side – i want to distinguish that from the module and from the overall roof system – there may be some merit to bringing in a strategic partner as tesla has with the battery cell manufacturing operator thank you our next question comes from the line of colin rusch with oppco  please proceed with your question colin rusch  oppenheimer  co inc broker hi thanks so much can you talk a little bit – or give us a sense of the percentage of potential customers that have said no to buying a solar system historically because of the age of their roof or issues that might lead to replacement of the roof lyndon r rive  chief executive officer  director its hard to give you a rough estimate of how many systems actually get disqualified because of the age of the roof elon reeve musk  chairman disqualified from a solarcity standpoint lyndon r rive  chief executive officer  director from solarcitys standpoint but its hard to know – if you have an old roof youre probably not looking to get solar so that customer probably didnt even come to solarcity in the first place if we look at our current roofs that dont qualify tanguy its around   tanguy vincent serra  president chief financial  accounting officer its  correct lyndon r rive  chief executive officer  director yeah peter rive  cofounder  chief technology officer thats not the relevant number i mean the issue is right now  from the top of the funnel lyndon r rive  chief executive officer  director yeah thats the biggest issue hands down elon reeve musk  chairman but what we do know is theyre not even considered lyndon r rive  chief executive officer  director yes peter rive  cofounder  chief technology officer exactly elon reeve musk  chairman i mean the number is probably close to  to  or more i mean figure – like essentially the basic math is like lets say youve got a year roof right and how far are you into the life of that roof if you are lets say more than  years or  years into the life of your roof and youve got say eight years left youre probably not going to want to put solar on your roof right because you know youre going to want to replace it so thats sort of where it transitions certainly if youve got like four years or five years left on a year roof youre definitely not going to get solar so that suggests pretty obvious toplevel analysis of something on the order of  but conceivably as high as  lyndon r rive  chief executive officer  director the answer to – once youve announced this product you – when a customer needs to upgrade his roof its something that bugs him for a long time theyve got to do it theyve got to do it oh theyve got to do it and so there is another buying motivation beyond just saving money off your electricity or using clean energy and so i should  think that will increase the sales demand more than just what were experiencing today and starting a savings proposition elon reeve musk  chairman yeah its like what if we can offer you a roof that looks way better than a normal roof what if we could offer you a roof that lasts far longer than a normal roof like now its a different ballgame lyndon r rive  chief executive officer  director yeah colin rusch  oppenheimer  co inc broker okay lyndon r rive  chief executive officer  director  getting a new roof colin rusch  oppenheimer  co inc broker thats super helpful guys thanks a lot all right so with teslas mission to really transform the energy economy i trust you guys are far down the road at looking at energy efficiency seeing as thats the most efficient most cost effective energy source how long is it going to be before the combined entity introduces a home energy management system or some sort of robust energy efficiency offering peter rive  cofounder  chief technology officer ill just say that it would also be a great feature in our roof if it were also energy efficient and then i think that in terms of home energy management systems solarcitys gateway has for many years been kind of a brain in the customers household that has a handle on how much energy theyre using as well as how solars being produced we have integrations with smart thermostats so i think that thats kind of already in place to some degree through the solarcity app you can log on you can see in general where your energy is going you can get realtime reading on how much energy youre consuming so a lot of that stuff is kind of already in place but its something that were going to be elaborating on in the coming years for sure elon reeve musk  chairman and certainly integrating that with the stationary battery pack so theres not a duplication of systems which would otherwise be the case  on the tesla call – i mean really like solar and battery go together like peanut butter and jelly its like a – you obviously need the battery particularly as you get to scale and you want to have solar be a bigger and bigger percentage of the grid if you dont have the batteries there to balance the grid and buffer the power you really cant go beyond a certain percentage of solar in a particular neighborhood you can – maybe you can go up to about  solar but more than that it starts to unbalance the grid and you need to buffer it because the – i mean obviously the energy generation is low at dawn and dusk its high in middle of the day and its zero at night so you got to smooth that out and so in order to – if you like sort of fast forward to where do we want the world eventually to be is we want the world to have both sustainable energy generation and sustainable energy consumption so that really requires three – the three critical ingredients for that is the solar panels the stationary batteries and electric vehicles so – and like i said you just – you cant get beyond a certain scale with solar unless you have the batteries to go with it to buffer the power and then you got to manage all of that because youll have millions of these batteries youve got to manage that integrate it with the utility i do want to emphasize theres still a very important role for utilities here because sometimes people think that this is an eitheror thing its like either rooftops are going to win or centralized generation is going to win and actually both are going to win because the electricity usage is going to increase dramatically as we transition away from burning old dinosaurs to electric cars and then to electric transport wed see roughly a doubling of electricity consumption as all transport moves to electric and then there is a tripling of electricity usage if you take all heating and make that electric as well because obviously most heating is from oil and natural gas particularly so colin rusch  oppenheimer  co inc broker okay thats super helpful and – the heating timeframe lowsingledigits right now and timeframe on the cars i think we can take some of that offline but i think my question is really about timeline for energy efficiency offering and it sounds like its in the works so i can take the rest of it offline thanks a lot guys elon reeve musk  chairman yeah its a high priority and we think its important operator thank you our next question comes from the line of michael morosi with avondale partners please proceed with your question michael morosi  avondale partners llc hi thanks for taking the question you called out mexico as factoring heavily into q shipments just looking at tesla and the fact that over  of sales in  came from international markets how could international sales and international storage play a factor in the combined company lyndon r rive  chief executive officer  director so once again assuming once the transaction is approved by the shareholders i mean teslas footprint internationally is super valuable well definitely look at that well analyze whats the cost of energy in all the different countries thats the number one ingredient and then when you combine solar combined with storage youre not tied to policy so you dont need net metering internationally you dont need a feeding tariff you dont need different programs you can just be competitive to the current cost of energy and so well look at those markets to see where the two combined can be very competitive and we will absolutely expand to  elon reeve musk  chairman yeah and i think theres also a lot of opportunity at the utility scale providing integrated solar battery system to utilities so that they can provide sustainable energy thats loadleveled and buffered to their customers and weve got a huge project in hawaii thats happening right now i think its the biggest in the us or peter rive  cofounder  chief technology officer i dont know of any of other firm  solar system that is bigger when you combine the demand with  elon reeve musk  chairman yeah we think its the biggest solar battery utilityscale installation in the united states maybe the world so i think theres going to be actually a lot of business with utilities as we provide them with an option to have sustainable centralized power generation thats what i want – i really want to emphasize like our goal is to work with utilities and to collectively to solve the future energy electricity demands of the world as the electricity demand rises tremendously due to electrification sustainability i mean i dont think anybody wants to have huge new power lines pulled through their neighborhoods and vast expansion of substations and all the things that would be necessary to fully electrify transport and heating its a huge headache to do that its not something that i think any consumer wants and its not a headache that utilities want to have to go through but if you dont have localized generation combined with central thats whats going to have to happen and that would suck so its just sort of terrible in every way so this is something thats a cooperative solution for the future lyndon r rive  chief executive officer  director were really seeing an uptick in that the utilities want to look at solutions how you manage largescale deployment of solar and storage as i mentioned in my opening remarks we have three products really going with utilities utilities wanted – were starting to see a movement of utilities wanting to collaborate and we have entire focus there i highly recommend you go to our website and look at all the utility services that we provide its a big focus for the company elon reeve musk  chairman yeah i think it also – i mean it helps to use that as an example of one of the reasons to combine tesla and solarcity is that in order to do this big wide utility solar battery project it had to go through the independent committees of both boards there had to be discussions back and forth it took a few months to get that all worked out and as we do many more of those deals if we go to dozens of those deals hundreds potentially thousands in the future this is completely unworkable i mean theres just no way we could get all of that through independent board committees its completely unworkable so the irony which i mentioned before is that this combination is about getting rid of the conflicts of interest so we can work together effectively to provide solutions to consumers and to utilities and large commercial customers colin rusch  oppenheimer  co inc broker thanks operator thank you our next question comes from the line of pavel molchanov with raymond james please proceed with your question pavel s molchanov  raymond james  associates inc hi thanks for taking the question guys can i just ask about the geographic footprint how many states are you currently in are you looking to exit any of your existing states and then conversely are you looking to enter any new ones in the foreseeable future thats my only question thanks lyndon r rive  chief executive officer  director yeah were in kind of roughly  states and probably open up one or two more states before the end of the year elon reeve musk  chairman and if i may add also just because i – particularly i want to add things that i think are beneficial with combination of the companies is that tesla is currently operating in over  countries and thus we have a presence around the world and wed love to bring solar solutions to all of those countries – our solar battery solutions and i think this is particularly powerful in places like germany and australia and in many other parts of the world so i think theres a lot of potential to amplify the expansion of sustainable energy generation pavel s molchanov  raymond james  associates inc okay just quickly following up youve entered a number of states just in the last six months and i guess what im curious is is your mix changing as youre entering these new states or are you still very heavily tied to kind of the legacy california new york arizona that youve historically been in for a longer period of time lyndon r rive  chief executive officer  director yes the way id view state expansion is any new state that were expanding in next year the effect of that new state is going to be very small the following year however that new state will have a larger effect and then the mix will start changing it just takes time to build out the infrastructure get the installations going and then of course the year after that those states will continue to grow so most of the volume that well get in any specific year will be because of states that we expanded to the year before so the states that were expanding into this year most of that volume and the impact youll see in  pavel s molchanov  raymond james  associates inc all right its useful i appreciate it operator thank you our next question comes from the line of vishal shah with deutsche bank please proceed with your question vishal b shah  deutsche bank securities inc yeah hi thanks for taking my question i just wanted to understand the customer behavior ahead of some of the silevo manufacturing ramp are you seeing a pause in customer demand or are your customers still asking you to sort of place – giving you orders for that – for the new equipment that theyll be installing at some point next year or are you seeing no change at all lyndon r rive  chief executive officer  director yes just in terms of the efficiency the biggest benefit is to us in operations so for our customers the difference to them would be two different panels so were not seeing a delay in our current option for customers for the modules that we have today so no were not seeing it as far as the solar modules  and be focused on a different market segment primarily and is going to be focused on the new roofing market so its addressing a market that we dont address today vishal b shah  deutsche bank securities inc okay thats helpful and also it sounds like there is great availability i mean theres no constraint in terms of loan availability are you thinking about – or is it possible to actually take the loan offering to the existing installed base of lease customers and convert some of those lease customers into loan customers lyndon r rive  chief executive officer  director no thats something we wont be able to do the way its structured the tax equity investors owns the equipment that equipment will be on the roof for  years the – all the focus would be on new customers vishal b shah  deutsche bank securities inc i appreciate it thank you and then one last question just on the mix earlier question what percentage of your mix – as some of these new states become important what percentage of mix will from california in  lyndon r rive  chief executive officer  director its hard to give you a forecast on that mix i dont want to set that expectation the – yeah we dont break out our state volume vishal b shah  deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of jeff osborne with cowen  co please proceed with your question jeffrey osborne  cowen  co llc hey good afternoon guys i had just a couple more questions on silevo if you dont mind i think in the past you had talked about certain level of capacity achieving kind of a low to mids cost per watt just given whats going on in the broader module market i was wondering if you could just confirm what capacity levels youre building for the silevo siliconbased product in buffalo and then also update us if theres been any technology advancements that perhaps would lower that cost per watt number lyndon r rive  chief executive officer  director yes so like i was saying before we actually think we will be expanding the capacity at this point i dont want to get specific and say what we think that well be expanding it by just yet but i think that well be expanding it beyond a gigawatt and i think that the cost potential over time is definitely in the  to  a watt range but i also – what i found in many discussions is people draw this comparison between essentially high efficiency modules and then the cost of standard efficiency modules and the benefits of high efficiency economically are first that you typically win more deals in front of the customers the customers prefer to have standard efficiency you also get more revenue per customer and your balance and system costs are lower so i dont think that its a fair comparison to compare the cost structure that we believe that we will have to the cost structure of our standard efficiency modules jeffrey osborne  cowen  co llc perfect and the followup i had was just on  elon reeve musk  chairman i think its worth adding like at tesla were achieving the lowest cost per kilowatt hour for battery packs at the cell level and at the pack level in the world despite having the highest energy density so we have the best cell at the lowest – best cell and pack at the lowest price – lowest cost im confident we can achieve that at solarcity as well jeffrey osborne  cowen  co llc got it and then just i wanted to see if elon or someone else on the floor there could elaborate on the  million in synergies it just seemed like the press and other analysts had some skepticism of that i dont cover tesla as you know but is there any further discussion or elaboration that you could offer would be helpful elon reeve musk  chairman i think this is – i mean obviously when you combine two companies there is some level of overlap and then at the product level there is some level of overlap with the solar battery solution if you have two separate companies you have to have two separate computers operating systems youve got to have separate communication systems interfacing with two separate server networks you are developing two separate phone apps for the consumer to monitor their system youve got to do two installation businesses instead of one so i would say that  million is a very conservative number lyndon r rive  chief executive officer  director and then if just look at the sales synergy if we just reduce  a watt in our acquisition cost that alone would be  million at a gigawatt run rate and that we may get just by virtue of having some real estate or access to  peter rive  cofounder  chief technology officer right jeffrey osborne  cowen  co llc got it yeah just real quickly as a followup is the intent for solarcity in the future as its roofing product comes along to either partner with local roofing in solar or do you actually have – intend to have your green bands  be both roofing companies as well as an electrician im just trying to understand what you look like in two years to three years are you going to be actually mounting the shingling replacement product as lyndon r rive  chief executive officer  director so on the roofing todd were going to keep the rest of the stuff a little secret and elon reeve musk  chairman were going to have a few cars to show okay i could have shown you quite a lot of leg here okay jeffrey osborne  cowen  co llc yes peter rive  cofounder  chief technology officer but the vans been on the jeffrey osborne  cowen  co llc thanks very much guys i appreciate it operator thank you our next question comes from the line of gordon johnson with axiom capital please proceed with your question gordon johnson  axiom capital management inc hey thanks for taking my questions guys so for q when looking at installations and bookings can you let us know what percent of those installations and bookings were sales from solarcity to tesla versus sales to rooftops and then i have a followup lyndon r rive  chief executive officer  director i dont understand that question gordon johnson  axiom capital management inc okay sure tesla has a gigafactory there were some solar systems installed on the rooftops of the gigafactory so im trying to figure out if there was a large order in q that helped installations and additionally potentially bookings associated with sales of systems from solarcity to tesla and if so what percent of installations and bookings were those sales lyndon r rive  chief executive officer  director im not even familiar with what the number is this is definitely not measurable elon reeve musk  chairman zero lyndon r rive  chief executive officer  director yeah i dont elon reeve musk  chairman zero weve not actually ordered any we will but we havent yet gordon johnson  axiom capital management inc okay so there were no sales okay i got it and then just with respect to the acquisition one question i had is it seems like there were comments out of tesla as recently as november of  that combining a battery and a rooftop solar company didnt make a ton of sense because effectively when you have a rooftop solar company with net metering the grid acts as effectively a battery ruling out the need for a battery technology so can you help us understand those comments that were made in  and now fast forwarding to today the rationale behind the acquisition lyndon r rive  chief executive officer  director yeah let me just talk about net metering where we see net metering evolving over the next few years because i think this is a really important part of how storage is a combination with the solar the case that id like everybody to review is what just recently happened in new york this is a collaboration of the local utilities and the solar industry and the collaboration is net metering for the next three years and then a phasing to more of a grid services model where you combine solar storage smart inverters and provide all these additional grid services and you phase that in and then essentially you phaseout net metering into that grid services model and so we see that probably happening as a standard policy and were going to promote that across all the different states but you – we have to get to a point where it is grid services so that utilities recognize the value that solar and storage can provide to the grid elon reeve musk  chairman its also just a relative scale thing up through the  power level produced by solar you dont need – you know theres some value to a battery but theres – its not totally necessary and in fact actually up through a certain – i mean at least through the  level all the way up to the  level solar actually helps the grid because it generates energy when people use it most like the electricity demand peaks during the day because thats when the air conditioning is running at maximum power thats when companies who are operating machinery is operating so solar actually helps utilities – like rooftop solar localized rooftop solar actually helps utilities up to a certain percentage and thats – you can sort of debate that percentage but its somewhere between like  – minimum  but all the way up to  but then beyond that point the – it gets very difficult to balance the power distribution in the grid and then you really have to have the batteries to scale ultimately to  longterm its tautological we have to have sustainable energy across the board or by definition it would be unsustainable so just looking at it from a macro standpoint you have to have a large number of batteries combined with a lot of solar wind will play a significant but smaller role hydro will play also a small role nuclear will play a small role geothermal will play a small role but the really heavy lifting is going to be solar and particularly for solar and even more so for wind being able to buffer the power is fundamental to the solution gordon johnson  axiom capital management inc okay so i just want to make sure i understood the answers correctly what you guys are saying is youre going to phase out net metering and shift to a different strategy and youre also saying that power peaks at i guess in the middle of the day at  o clock lyndon r rive  chief executive officer  director no i wouldnt – i mean thats to say a little hard statement were saying that over time as large volume gets deployed youre going to phase out of net metering and then provide grid services as you phase it out the key point is as large volume gets deployed elon reeve musk  chairman yeah and so – yeah exactly to reiterate in the beginning rooftop solar helps utilities but as it becomes a bigger percentage of the grid power you really need batteries to smooth out that power and yeah its really i mean just common sense i mean when is the sun the brightest yeah like middle of the day and its weaker at dusk and dawn and its off at night so clearly you need to buffer the power lyndon r rive  chief executive officer  director yeah i mean i just want to repeat the statement its based on large volume and to make the statement that we think net metering should end is just a misquote and an incorrect representation gordon johnson  axiom capital management inc thank you operator thank you ladies and gentlemen at this time there are no further questions i would to like turn the floor back to management for closing comments lyndon r rive  chief executive officer  director we dont have any closing comments thank you so much for everybodys time  elon reeve musk  chairman yeah let me just like – one little thing which is like i mean there is a lot of focus on this month or that month or this quarter or that quarter but i think its worth raising – lifting our gaze a little bit to think longerterm to a year or two years or several years out and ultimately to where do we – what do we want the world to look like and are we going there as fast as possible i think really any rational person who believes in science thinks that its important for the world to transition to sustainable energy generation and consumption sooner rather than later in fact even if you just assign a probability instead of saying its black and white what is your probability that going to sustainable energy – nonco generating energy is good versus bad even if you think its like – if you take the devils advocate position and say well we think its  likely that – hypothetically that massively increasing the co in the oceans and atmosphere is bad well okay were  but you only have one planet so even if you think its highly unlikely that global warming is real and that theres only a small chance that its bad we should still accelerate the advent of sustainable energy and anyone who thinks that – is  certain that global warming is fake and that massively changing the chemical composition of the oceans and atmosphere is fine is a bloody fool obviously so thats what this is all about this is about trying to accelerate to where we know we need to get to anyway and not unlike small potatoes put some pieces away but in a very big macro scale way lyndon r rive  chief executive

solar company’s business model rapid growth and ultimate goal of being the world’s largest energy provider yes indeed this  yearold entrepreneur from south africa anticipates no less than world domination although rive was tight lipped about the impending ipo expected in q this year he referred to the m investment from google last year and said “our expectation is that companies like google and other fortune companies start making similar investments” “in order to monetize the full benefits of the solar system you need a large tax paying company  might as well use that tax bill to motivate the growth of the renewable industry…” he added “we are approaching hundreds of fortune  and  companies…and will continually be raising funds potentially in perpetuity” solarcity is targeting companies that can benefit handsomely from the  federal business tax credit for solar investments although rive wouldn’t name names apple inc springs to mind immediately record profits and enormous tax base check recently inclined to alternative energy investments check in case you missed it apple recently invested in a massive  megawatt fuel cell development using bloom energy technology watch this space we’ll keep you updated   business model solarcity’s innovative model offers a range of solar options customers can buy systems outright or pay zero down and lease or purchase the power the system produces large investments from partners like google allow the company to make solar affordable and continue growing rapidly rive described the company’s business model thus “we install solar systems for free so we need capital to pay for that and take a long term revenue stream on the electricity that we sell so as fast as we grow that’s the business model that we’re in” chinese solar panels and tariffs the obama administration recently imposed tariffs on solar panels manufactured in china rive confirmed that about  of the panels solarcity installs are made in china the remainder come from japan korea and the us is he not concerned that the era of “cheap” chinese panels is over and that will impact the company’s bottom line “it’s more of an annoyance than a concern” rive said “it’s a worldwide market…if china’s costs go up we’ll just buy from somebody else” he added that economies of scale is the largest factor driving cost curves down and that in california despite incentives being reduced from watt just five years ago to c watt today adoption has never been higher job growth the company founded by lyndon rive and his brother peter on independence day  now employs  employees in twelve states and dc the company is hiring about four new employees a day rive confirmed with this rapid expansion and a market share which grew from  in  to  in  i asked the young ceo if the company was over extended “we have a four month waiting list…four months is totally acceptable our customers totally understand it” said rive “could we grow even faster  yes but then the wheels may start getting shaky so we are growing at a healthy rate to ensure quality safety and also customer satisfaction” check back soon for elon musk’s contribution to solarcity – he’s lyndon

and chief executive officer thanks aaron so for the quarter we installed  megawatts thats dramatically above our forecast of  megawatts which was what we forecasted during the last earning call tanguy will give an update on the big improvement there let me jump into q bookings so q bookings came in a lot lower than expected we had a bunch of headwinds that hit us all at the same time and id like to walk them through so for nevada we were expecting the grandfathering would be approved at the beginning of february and at the time everybody was in favor of grandfathering the governors office was in favor of it the solar industry the legislators consumers as well as the utilities were in favor of grandfathering now that did not happen and that actually had a spillover effect into other states customers were concerned about if they go solar would they get grandfathering now this has actually been addressed a lot of states have made it clear that theres year grandfathering and in q were not seeing this concern much at all we also had a bunch of pending regulatory outcomes in california massachusetts and new hampshire these are all open items in q that now have been resolved and actually look really good for the solar industry we now have longterm visibility in those states and in fact weve never had this type of longterm clarity for some time so though it was rocky in q we now have that clarity we also increased pricing in january and with the increase in pricing its pulled in our sales cycle so typically we have about a  day to  day sales cycle for residential and with our customers knowing that were going to increase pricing in january they came in and made the decision earlier what that – what happened to us then is that starting the year we essentially flushed our pipeline and now we have to build a new pipeline were also halfway through the quarter ended our mypower product we now redesigned it its a lot better and a lot more simple product for a customer to understand previously it was kind of a hybrid between a power purchase agreement and a loan now its a fixed monthly payment customers like it a lot more we just launched it we launched it last week and were expecting to see big demand for that and we also have different financing terms previously it was only year financing now we have year and year financing and were also seeing a big increase in demand for ownership and we want to make sure we address that market so were quite optimistic about our loan product that we just launched and then this  tax credit that got extended for five years which is a great win for the industry but the effect of that is commercial customers who were under time pressure to make the decision in order to get the systems installed in  they now have more time to make the decision and just going through the standard procurement process so weve seen the bookings increase again in q but we had a low in q because of all these headwinds and the volume was low that increased our customer acquisition costs these have all been addressed so these all temporarily affected us and were starting to see our customer acquisition costs come down quite dramatically in q but it will take us about two quarters to get back to normalized customer acquisition levels so because of the effect of q bookings we actually now need to reguide on the yearend guidance so the previous guidance was  megawatts the new guidance is going to be  megawatts to  megawatts this is because of q bookings and then as well as we are timing our commercial installations closer to interconnections from the utility weve seen now that often we install systems and the interconnection time lag may be three months to six months afterwards so were actually timing it to match the interconnection timeframe for the quarter for q were forecasting  megawatts installed but as mentioned these headwinds as i discussed that hit us in q they are past now and were looking forward to seeing the effect of our consumer loan product this will also allow us to expand into new states there are some states that do not allow us to offer a lease or ppa and with this new consumer loan product well be able to offer a lease and ppa in these states and then in terms of regulation or policy we now have better clarity than weve had for a very long time im going to hand you now over to tanguy our cfo tanguy vincent serra  president and chief financial officer thanks lyndon we installed  megawatts in q in the  megawatts theres a  megawatt utilityscale project that came in the last few days of the quarter which we were really expecting to come in the first few days of april crews outperformed and the weather cooperated but nevertheless we came in nicely above our conservative projections on our residential installations commercial came in where we expected the megawatts we deployed in q had a value of  per watt down slightly from our prior quarters on the back of lower srec pricing and increase in the mix of commercial deployment the piece im the most excited about for this quarter is how much we monetized  million of financing coming in in q this is a massive accomplishment by our capital markets team led by rad small at  per watt deployed in asset financing its a little bit above where we expect to be on a run rate basis given we took our assets with no back leverage down to  megawatts from  megawatts in q financing for us really is like working capital and the  megawatts represents about a month of assets that are in the tobefinanced bucket furthermore above and beyond the absolute dollar amount i like where we are strategically on financing weve monetized every piece of the value of a watt with tax equity residential and commercial asset debt as well as srec financing we tapped the bank market and the securitization market we also did a cash equity transaction at the beginning of q and ill talk more about that later but to summarize we monetized  per watt deployed or  million and as per usual theres a memo thats attached our audited financial statement explaining this number in detailed methodology our build costs continue to be bestinclass under  a watt the team lead by eric wittenberg has done a phenomenal job both our residential and commercial build costs were flat in q in spite of lower volume which implies our variable costs continue to come down and we are on track with our longterm install goals lyndon talked a little bit about our results in q and part of the fixed costs were booked through yielding a higher than we would like customer acquisition cost of  per watt overhead is marginally up on absolute dollar basis with some investments in policy and legal but we feel good about where were heading there lastly quick housekeeping note we tweaked the methodology for calculating unit costs we added in the cancel costs as per the industry standard but we took out the cost associated with managing the portfolio which were now reporting separately and theres a full cost memo explaining the details as per usual on our website so as i mentioned were doing a lot of work on our financial reporting and providing clarity on our business we probably show recurring cash flows from the generation of our portfolio we generated  million of billings paid for  million of maintenance costs and as i mentioned those costs were previously the unit costs – unit build costs weve taken them out and were putting them here now and we paid  million of tax equity distributions about  of billings and we paid  million of interest on the asset financing which leaves in q  million of recurring cash flow to solarcity note that in q that the cash flow from the portfolio was  million that included a oneoff  million payment from mypower customers paying down principal after their tax credit weve gone back and calculated this historically and providing a memo on the website tying back to our financials when you put it all together with the  million of cash we received from financing the  million we spent to build the assets pay for the overhead and the working capital our development company is roughly breakeven but when you add in the  million of cash received from the portfolio our solar business our solar development business generated  million of cash in q even after paying for all the rd and debt in our investment in grid software that we have at solarcity so cash flow positive for the solar business – for the core solar business furthermore we invested  million in our cell and module business which is continued success and peter will talk more about that but overall im happy to have proven that our solar residential and commercial business can be cash flow positive and generate value contracted in minimum cash flows above and beyond the cash as you might have seen we executed a cash equity trade over some of our assets its a great trade we had a super high quality institutional investor diligence our assets and our processes and we did a firstofitskind trade for  million theres a large class of investors that are looking for unlevered yield and the securitized price has no reference to libor and is nonrecourse soc if its a clear floor on the value of our residential assets at least  per watt of cash up front and we still own some residual and we own the year to year residual customer relationship im happy to have proven up this alternative source of funding the thing that matters to us is keeping the customer relationship and you offer grid services from those assets but we like the idea of leveraging in our recurring cash flows and redeploying the capital to devco to continue lowering that costs and growing this quarter were also disclosing our srec book this is cash flow from our assets on top of the recurring cash flow retained value we generate roughly  srecs in east coast states which we can monetize and assuming on average  per megawatt hour we generate another  million per year of cash and the number is growing as we continue deploying assets the chart in the earnings deck provides explicitly contrasts the srec with investmentgrade uptakers that we have and the implied cash flows from those contracts were seeing value continues to grow on an unlevered basis and given the finance of the assets and reducing the megawatts unfinanced as discussed at the beginning in net we can valueincrease from  billion to  billion our balance sheet continues to be upbeat and we are continuously moving assets from the – in development from our revolver into our aggregation facilities and then to our longterm options be it securitizations bank debt or cash equity opening new financing sources of takeout was an important strategic step for us its important to understand that all of our debt pieces have specific assets yielding either recurring cash flows for what is a clear financing takeout or vehicles that are tied to them and there are engines that can deploy hundreds of megawatts at limited debt with that let me pass over to pete to talk a little bit more about the new products peter rive  cofounder  chief technology officer hi everybody peter rive chief technology officer so the past couple of months some great progress has been made towards a future vision for how rooftop solar can be compensated and integrated into utility operations specifically a group of utilities and solar companies jointly proposed a longterm solution that supports net metering being in place until  it removes uncertainty for customers on grandfathering and recognizes the value that solar provides to the distribution system the post framework is basically to value the exported energy at the energy price plus the value to the distribution system plus the environmental benefits this approach should work for us and is in line with our goal to include storage with most of our solar systems around that timeframe additionally a big part of the discussions were having with regulators and utilities surround additional business model opportunities created by customersited energy resources and to that end were excited about some product releases that address utility infrastructure needs which is more than a  billion a year market we now provide products and services for firm generation as well as the transmission and distribution system and are seeing a x growth rate in this area we have over  megawatt hours of storage under contract and plan to complete one of the planets largest firm and dispatchable solar systems in hawaii this year were also engaged in several pilots with some of the largest investorowned utilities to prove the benefits of our control systems within the distribution system grid functions that have traditionally been performed through equipment like transformers and capacitor banks can now be performed by solar inverters providing us with opportunities to extend our income streams beyond the sale of energy and with that update i think that were moving to questions and answers i believe aaron n chew  vpinvestor relations operator well open it up to qa please questionandanswer session operator thank you and well go first to patrick jobin with credit suisse patrick s jobin  credit suisse securities usa llc broker hi thanks for taking my questions first question just about the cash equity financing whats your outlook for that market or source of capital for remainder of the year and then thanks for this disclosure were kind of backing into just over an  unlevered irr is that about right and then i have a few followups thanks tanguy vincent serra  president and chief financial officer hi patrick thank this is tanguy so look what we – the thing thats clear to us having done the work here is that this market is real exists and theres market participants that are very very active in it they typically not had exposure to the residential solar assets but invested in a number of different infrastructure classes so i think this market as i discussed is reasonably big since we announced this weve had a number of inbounds but at this stage were not willing to make any commitments for the rest of the year but its clearly an asset class that had interest from some of the largest most sophisticated institutional investors on the planet and then the – the specific terms of this specific agreement dont allow us to disclose the discount rate but weve disclosed i believe enough information for you to do your work and its – your number is probably right patrick s jobin  credit suisse securities usa llc broker okay and then my second question i guess its a twopart question relates to the cost structure just when we think about putting fewer volumes through the system here in  given the bookings challenges in q how should we think about cadence of total cost structure through the end of the year where do you think you can end the year and then the related question i guess relates to mix how sizable would the ci mix be in the volume guidance now and what if any volumes are you including with the utilityscale solar and storage thanks tanguy vincent serra  president and chief financial officer yeah so the – pete mentioned theres project in kauai that is utilityscale that well be building out that one is clearly in the guidance the rest of the mix is roughly the same mix as historically call it  residentialcommercial we can do that on mix does that make sense answer your question patrick s jobin  credit suisse securities usa llc broker and then the first question and – i mean the equipment cost you have cleared tanguy vincent serra  president and chief financial officer but – we variablized significantly the installed cost structure so that number is going to continue to come down on a likeforlike basis so residential assets are going to continue to be built for less theres some procurement benefits that will ripple through cost of panels are continuing to decline as well as cost of inverters so those numbers are going to be coming down and then lyndon has some comments around the cost of acquisition lyndon r rive  cofounder and chief executive officer yes so this cost of acquisition will come down quite dramatically in q but itll probably take about two quarters or so before we get to normalized acquisition levels that weve seen in the past peter rive  cofounder  chief technology officer and also i think they were – on the utility question like were carving out a pretty special niche here in a differentiated type of generator when you combine solar and battery so its not like a typical utilityscale solar economics with kauai as an example its about  a kilowatt hour ppa and its a very different type of ppa in that its combined with the battery and the energy is available at night the same is also true with the project that we are finishing installing right now in connecticut its this combination of the power purchase agreement with the capacity agreement so the majority of the utilityscale business that were pursuing is this kind of hybrid between solar economics and battery economics but its not like were signing up   a kilowatt hour utilityscale projects or anything like that patrick s jobin  credit suisse securities usa llc broker thank you operator thank you well now go to krish sankar with bank of america merrill lynch krish sankar  bank of america merrill lynch hi thanks for taking my question i have a few of them first one lyndon a highlevel question if i look at it over the last couple of years theres been a lot of moving parts you guys want to retain assets now the focus is shifting a little bit you are willing to sell maybe price discounting whatever it is so you changed focus from growth to cost reduction so my big picture first question is what exactly is the business model of solarcity then i have a couple of followups lyndon r rive  cofounder and chief executive officer so the business model of solarcity is to provide energy at a lower cost than you can get it today from fossil fuel and then longterm our goal is to transform our energy infrastructure to a renewable infrastructure in doing this there are many different products that customers want some customers prefer a power purchase agreement some customers prefer leases and were seeing a growing demand for customers wanting to own new equipment and thats where we have solar loans but to answer your question – so i think there was another question on volume and cost optimization yes we have reduced volume and we are focusing on cost optimization for this year krish sankar  bank of america merrill lynch all right did you guys quantify what exactly would be the cost exiting calendar  lyndon r rive  cofounder and chief executive officer no we havent given a forecast for  we have given a forecast for the end of  of  million krish sankar  bank of america merrill lynch so that is still on target lyndon r rive  cofounder and chief executive officer yeah we still feel good about that krish sankar  bank of america merrill lynch all right and just another followup is it looks like you need  of your installed regions the second half of the year to meet at least  gigawatt target so im kind of curious what gives you the confidence you can hit that trend what are the key factors of state that would be the key drivers to – for you to hit at least  gigawatt this year lyndon r rive  cofounder and chief executive officer yes so we feel very confident about our gigawatt now the key thing there is based on all the state policies that we see right now is we dont – we actually have tremendous clarity in all our primary states so unless something happens too in the primary states feel good about the gigawatt getting to  gigawatt that was then we need to see an improvement of conversion rate from the loan product and im optimistic about the loan product i feel very confident about the  gigawatt and depending on how the loan product goes it will get us potentially to  gigawatt or over krish sankar  bank of america merrill lynch got it thank you operator thank you well take our next question comes from philip shen with roth capital partners philip leewei shen  roth capital partners llc hey everyone thank you for taking my questions just as a quick followup on mypower can you talk about – can you just give us a bigger overview of the product specifically do you have a partner on the solar loan product or do you have a source of capital that youve already designated and identified for that product specifically and then getting back to mix can you help us understand of the annual guidance how much might be mypower lyndon r rive  cofounder and chief executive officer shen so in terms of the partner for essentially a relaunch of mypower were actually not going to be calling it mypower its just a little confusing in the name its going to be solar loan so its a little more straightforward but essentially its mypower  and the product is a fixed monthly payment to the customer out of the gates were going to be partnering with multiple financial partners to provide it – to be viewed as a cash sale and well be selling it and then somebody else will be financing it so thats the current plan for the loan product in terms of mix its hard to forecast how historically out of the gates mypower was around  range and then it started winding down to around   depending on the state but im optimistic about it weve seen a trend towards consumers wanting to own it and if you can provide financing cost that makes it very affordable we think the ownership model will take some share of our business philip leewei shen  roth capital partners llc lyndon can you share any of the names of the financial partners by chance lyndon r rive  cofounder and chief executive officer not at this stage philip leewei shen  roth capital partners llc okay one more if i may and ill jump back in the queue with the cash equity deal in place can you talk to us about how you view abs versus cash equity how you might toggle between the two what might we see next should we expect to see a cash equity deal next or an abs ahead of that since the debt markets are incrementally improving since earlier this year and then additionally can you talk us through the potentially the eventual tax implications of the cash equity deal so given the fact that much of the depreciation has passed on to tax equity investors what are the potential tax implications from the cash equity financing thanks tanguy vincent serra  president and chief financial officer thanks a lot tanguy so first question on securitization versus cash equity well the way our business works is is we develop assets and the pipeline is financed by the revolver we then take it out with the tax equity and the aggregation facility and then we bought time and what we really want to do is optimize around that so theres a number of markets that i can take out and put a permanent cap on these assets so the securitization market ive always liked we clear north of  a watt in the securitization context and on a significant portion of the back end so we like that market a lot again the key here is clearing our costs once we clear our costs then its a liquidity decision as opposed to a pl decision the cash equity market as we believe we price at bestinclass – firstofitsclass kind of security thats a market thats going to be continuously available more players are entering this particular market and over time we think the cost of that could continue to be coming down and then theres the bank debt market i dont think you should discount the bank debt market bank debt market is attractive and theres a number of banks that are looking for really elongated paper with super high quality assets in us dollars and then id say above and beyond anything else is that the quality of our reporting the quality of our data the quality of our process the auditability of everything from our people in china that are looking at our suppliers factories down to our om business and the way we accept assets or fleet is truly phenomenal and so were able to access all the capital that other players may not be so i feel good about all those different sectors i dont want to predict what were going to do next i think the beauty of having a number of choices is that were not overly relying on a given market and i think thats really important as we think about the outlook right here so on the tax – does that make sense phil do you need anything any other clarification there philip leewei shen  roth capital partners llc okay no that makes sense and if you can talk about the tax impact especially on the pretax npv that would be fantastic thanks tanguy vincent serra  president and chief financial officer sure so i dont want to sound too technical here but the investment is structured as a combination of debt and a piece of deferred and so as a consequence its financing and we – there is no tax implications for us upfront philip leewei shen  roth capital partners llc okay thanks again talking and lyndon ill jump back in the queue tanguy vincent serra  president and chief financial officer thank you phil operator thank you and well continue on to brian lee with goldman sachs brian k lee  goldman sachs  co hey guys thanks for taking the question i have two of them maybe the easy one to start off i think in the recent past you guys have talked about i think about  billion to  billion of capital in total needing to hit the operational plans for  now with the new target in place can you update us as to what that number would be and then as a followup to that how much youve already secured maybe a quick rundown on tax equity todate debt and then maybe any other forms of capital you would count towards that new  funding target and then i have a second question tanguy vincent serra  president and chief financial officer sure hey brian this is tanguy so the – round numbers right about  gigawatt of volume and roughly on average  billion  billion on the cost structure nearly about  billion total so thats the rough breakdown of the assets of the capital that we need for financing purposes over the last four months weve raised  billion so were well on track to be able to raise that capital the one thing about the cash equity i think is interesting to know is that as a consequence of the cash equity we actually paid down some of our aggregation facilities freeing up more capacity from there so thats the beauty of being a model where youre recycling capital which is youre able to use capital more than once so with that right now weve got  million of available pocket financing capacity which includes just under  million of tax equity on – as you can see on page nine brian k lee  goldman sachs  co okay thank you thats helpful second question was just around the – i guess maybe that philosophy around growth here this is the third year in a row you grow with the volume targets i dont think theres been once where there was a financing issue at play at least for your guys commentary as to what might have driven the need to adjust volume targets over the past couple of years so given how important that part of the equation is for you guys funding the business just wondering i guess at a high level what the thought process is around maybe completely throwing down customer ads to the point where maybe the cumulative cash from the installed base starts to offset some of the growth opex and you can selffund to some degree and so basically targeting absolute volumes not to grow each year which doesnt trend very well right now it appears based on the markets reaction but just maybe focusing on net customer ads even if lower each year to target a better cash flow and profitability growth also just be curious to hear your thoughts on transition to do something like that lyndon r rive  cofounder and chief executive officer just let me just address the reforecast for this year and so the original plan was  megawatts the adjustment for that is nothing at all to do with anything relating to financing its purely just because of the multiple headwinds that hit us in q and if it wasnt for that wed probably – the guidance would stay as is or pretty close to as is right now everything just happening all in one quarter was just too much to recover from and still keep on track for the rest of the year and were really seeing big improvements in q and its to get everything back to normalized levels again in q and in terms of growth we are very excited about a lot of the innovation that were doing here and although we are seeing about  growth this year i dont want to forecast for  but once the business starts generating cash the goal will be to go back into growth mode again operator and well continue on to colin rusch with oppenheimer colin rusch  oppenheimer  co inc broker thanks guys can you talk a little bit about the comp trajectory to date just in terms of your construction costs obviously not coming down quite as much as we would have expected can you talk a little bit about whats going on internally with that and how we should see that move forward and maybe talk about it a little bit but just specifically what areas youre going to get the cost out of tanguy vincent serra  president and chief financial officer thats going fine absolutely so just to be clear the q costs on the installed side are a colin rusch  oppenheimer  co inc broker yeah yeah im just talking about the construction cost im fully aware of the amortization over the number of megawatts tanguy vincent serra  president and chief financial officer agree so the q costs is  in q  in q so to make sure were clear on with that this is a blend of residential costs and commercial costs our residential costs are lower than our commercial build costs and both residential and commercial were flat to down on a likeforlike basis between q and q but the mix effect of deployed assets in q skewed up the cost per watt of residential – of the blend sorry but the thing to know is that both residential and commercial are separately on a downward trajectory so that nothings changed there thats been true as long as ive been here i think its going to be forever peter rive  cofounder  chief technology officer yeah and then a couple of things on what were seeing how to reduce costs because today were seeing the asps of module prices decline were seeing the same happening with inverters and then theres a couple of pretty big breakthroughs in the mounting hardware on the residential side as well as on the commercial side that will further drive down costs and give us a lot of confidence for our longterm cost targets colin rusch  oppenheimer  co inc broker okay great and then as you look at the variety of the ways that you can monetize these assets how much lead time do you need for decisionmaking purposes from looking at whats going on in the market to decide which route youre going to go and to the point that you monetize and actually price these things and how much flexibility do you have in terms of switching from one strategy to another with the given portfolio tanguy vincent serra  president and chief financial officer yeah so the key here is having tax equity funds that are fully deployed with all the assets billing once youve got a – that creates a very very neat series of assets receipt of cash flows that are very discrete and easily financeable so just for sake of argument typically you would raise a tax equity in the given quarter deploy it and install it in the next and then have everybody – all the customers and the underlying assets reach permission to operate its being able to be billing in the fourth quarter so thats the timeline so the assets go from the revolver and then ultimately to the aggregation facility and then at that point executing whether its on a bank debt transaction a securitization or cash equity trade is weeks – not sort of call it  months  days  days to get to trade down along those lines depending on market conditions securitization might go faster this cash equity trade we did we did in that sort of timeframe and this was a market that did not exist where we had to write the docs from scratch that gives you a sense of the speed at which we can execute here colin rusch  oppenheimer  co inc broker okay great ill take the rest of it offline thanks a lot guys operator thank you and our next question will come from julien dumoulinsmith with ubs julien dumoulinsmith  ubs securities llc hey good afternoon guys tanguy vincent serra  president and chief financial officer hey julien how are you julien dumoulinsmith  ubs securities llc good thank you so just following up a little bit on that cash flow breakeven commentary and bringing the business back in line there when do you think youll get there such that you begin focusing on growth again i just want to kind of reframe the story and then secondly you talked about normalizing your cost structure id just be curious you are indeed reiterating your cost targets for  correct i just want to make sure i have this correct that youll get to that level at that point in time unknown speaker so this is  so we wont get to  cost dollars in the next two quarters so thats not the outcomes the julien dumoulinsmith  ubs securities llc right but youre on target for  – in  unknown speaker yeah yeah yeah we still feel very very good about our own target for  million at the end of  so we still feel good about that goal and so – but in terms of your growth question were working hard towards being net cash flow positive in q and at that point in time were going to be looking at the market conditions the cash generation of the business and then decide if we want to go back into growth mode and julien dumoulinsmith  ubs securities llc and could you define the cash flow target a little bit more just what that means unknown speaker cash coming in the business is more than the cash going out of the business tanguy vincent serra  president and chief financial officer difference in cash position between two periods being higher unknown speaker good and not counting any dilutive equity raise tanguy vincent serra  president and chief financial officer julien one comment just to be clear in q so we actually achieved that target on just the solar business we actually cleared  million and some retained value on a cash basis we cleared  million and we then invested  million into our cell and module business for building a bestinclass asset but that feels pretty good julien dumoulinsmith  ubs securities llc got it so just to be clear though by hitting the devco cash you hit it for this quarter outside of the – obviously the cell module tanguy vincent serra  president and chief financial officer thats right and so the goal here is that to lyndons point to make the cell and module bar on slide  go to the other side of the chart so its unequivocal that we are generating cash even after having paid for the  julien dumoulinsmith  ubs securities llc okay fair enough guys thank you operator thank you we will now hear from ben kallo with baird benjamin j kallo  robert w baird  co inc broker hey lyndon peter aaron and tanguy thank you for taking my question krishs at mother merrill i think his question was very good what is solarcity if we take a step back and i think the market thinks that the residential business in the us is not a good business and so could you just explain why its a good return on invested capital right now for you guys and theres a lot of math being done around some of the asset sales and people worried about capital just talk us through what youre thinking what the business looks like in five years and if the return on invested capital is different then the markets thinking that youre losing money on these deals with cash equity thank you thats it tanguy vincent serra  president and chief financial officer yeah let me just address that head on because i think this is one i really dont agree with so let us just take a step back so here are the economics right on a – and weve been extremely transparent on where all the numbers come from they all tie to our gaap financials theyre all on the financials so theres no debate about these numbers so we can build these assets in june  – we built these assets for about  per watt its about  of construction costs some coa and then some overhead were building them for  a watt as lyndon said in q our sales are going to be higher than expected but overall were building this for  a watt now in that  a watt as pete said the cost of panels the cost of inverters is clearly going to continue coming down so its a cost per watt that is declining theres clearly three years of regulatory runway here as established – as lyndon talked about so what that gives us is that the topline economics arent going to change too much over the next three years when you combine all that with an explicit cash trade with a leading investor were clearing at least  a watt for a portfolio that is somewhat reasonably representative but arguably with a little bit of a less california in our current mix were clearing at least  so the worst case scenario were clearing  less  and youre clearing  a watt on the resi asset now thats a margin concept the return on capital concept is what does it take to grow and this is the key point which is when we grow we add warehouses we add trucks we add qualified installers but there is no capital cost associated with growing that and as you see we disclosed our specific capex for our solar business – our solar development business which is in the singledigit million dollars a quarter so the idea that the residential business does not clear super attractive return on capital is just wrong and im happy to spend more time on that benjamin j kallo  robert w baird  co inc broker are you taking share tanguy vincent serra  president and chief financial officer im sorry benjamin j kallo  robert w baird  co inc broker are you taking share lyndon r rive  cofounder and chief executive officer share like could you tell us what do you mean tanguy vincent serra  president and chief financial officer the benjamin j kallo  robert w baird  co inc broker your market share how is that changing and why tanguy vincent serra  president and chief financial officer so as a percentage of installs the q numbers arent out yet to the best of my knowledge i saw vivint came out to provide this call i havent got time to go through the numbers but it feels like were doing pretty well in the market yes peter rive  cofounder  chief technology officer yeah and i think that like in q it went up from q i havent seen the q numbers yet but its probably going to be like in the kind of mids i would guess somewhere in there i dont think that theres a big reduction in our share of installations or anything lyndon r rive  cofounder and chief executive officer yeah with the new loan product i think it should – it should accelerate tanguy vincent serra  president and chief financial officer does that answer your question it is really important to me we all agree that the – this return on capital concept is measuring the difference in margin over the ebitda grow on that basis were absolutely a great business benjamin j kallo  robert w baird  co inc broker and so what – so whats the difference between you and number two three and actually number ten and how has the market changed with size and scale because if you guys – if capital is a constraint then doesnt everyone else has that issue and you should be able to take share or am i wrong lyndon r rive  cofounder and chief executive officer so capital is not a constraint so we dont really address that it hasnt been a constraint its not our constraint and its not capital this is a highquality asset and people want to finance this asset tanguy vincent serra  president and chief financial officer yeah but ive got massive respect for all our competitors the one thing i would say is that our key clear differentiators are cost structure our cost structure is just better than everybody elses and were optimally selling is the commodity electron so were clearly in a better place there the other big differentiator i think is all the investments that were making under petes leadership on the grid services the agreement that was – come up between us and some of our peers in one of the eastern states the state of new york i think its a blueprint for how the industry is going to go from forward so weve got clear technological leadership we own our mounting hardware and destiny around that we have clear ebitda to capital and were ultimately building what is our bestinclass power plants for the lowest cost that feels like pretty strong differentiators lyndon r rive  cofounder and chief executive officer yeah and you – yeah tanguy kind of mentioned this but our zep product itself a mounting hardware it allows us to go fast so theres less disruption for the customer but at the same time it just looks better than any other installed system out there and so aesthetically its just a betterlooking system than any of our competitors benjamin j kallo  robert w baird  co inc broker thats what – lyndon i think we should focus on that more going forward than tax equity flips and depreciation accelerated depreciation over five years im not telling you how to run your business but wall street thinks this is way too complicated and we need to get back to brass tacks of what you guys do and thats just my two cents here lyndon r rive  cofounder and chief executive officer and thats great feedback i think well maybe have a little more indepth product review the next time i think thats great great to hear that – were investing a lot and we have massive differentiation benjamin j kallo  robert w baird  co inc broker thank you guys tanguy vincent serra  president and chief financial officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from vishal shah with deutsche bank vishal shah  deutsche bank yeah hi thanks for taking my question you mentioned your custom acquisition costs will come back in the next two quarters where do you think costs will lead in q q timeframe and then is this second half mix going to be more skewed towards commercial given that youre sort of pushing some of the installations to – closer to interconnection timeframes and does that impact your project value or economics in the second half lyndon r rive  cofounder and chief executive officer so in terms of custom acquisition costs i expected to come roughly ish down this next quarter and then the following quarter back to normalized acquisition levels in terms of commercial mix roughly its going to be about  so i dont expect too much change in the total value of megawatts deployed vishal shah  deutsche bank okay great and then can you just talk about whether you are raising ppa rates in other markets outside of california and how that is impacting just the customer behavior it looks like the world financing environment while its good its slightly in terms of cost its worse than what you were previously expecting so does that translate into higher rates in the industry overall lyndon r rive  cofounder and chief executive officer yeah i think the biggest impact in our pricing increase was the flushing of the pipeline and accelerating customers from january to december and so starting the year with essentially no pipeline was the biggest impact in terms of the pricing increase we increased slightly its just about a  to  per kilowatt hour depending on the market and this is a small increase but that does make a difference on a dollars per watt basis we dont see this as a reason for losing business at least we dont see it yet and we actually see a lot of our competitors actually needing to increase their pricing too in fact weve also started to increase our commercial pricing as well vishal shah  deutsche bank okay great thank you operator thank you our next question comes from gordon johnson with axiom capital management gordon johnson  axiom capital management inc hey guys thanks for taking my question tanguy vincent serra  president and chief financial officer hey gordon gordon johnson  axiom capital management inc hey so i guess first with respect to the cash equity deal i guess with respect to the cash equity portion the  million is that cash thats available to invest immediately in growth and debt repayment and then in addition with respect to that deal will you guys continue to recognize revenue and other financials on the projects or the project cash flows that were sold to john hancock i have a followup tanguy vincent serra  president and chief financial officer thanks for that im not quite sure of all the numbers so the cash equity trade that we announced was  million of cash in with that we repaid in part the aggregation facilities and so – of  million and the rest was cash that we cleared for the company and so that is cash sitting on our balance sheet right now gordon johnson  axiom capital management inc right but is that cash – im sorry is that cash associated with the tax equity is that cash that you have available in your coffers to immediately extend to apply the growth and debt repayment or is that cash already accounted for is a proportion of that cash already accounted for tanguy vincent serra  president and chief financial officer well the cash is fungible so when we execute the trade cash came in we repaid a part of  million of aggregation facilities and the rest was cash that was absolutely available on our cash balance – on a daily cash balance yes gordon johnson  axiom capital management inc okay and then are you guys going to recognize the revenues and other financials associated with the projects the project cash flows you saw will you still recognize those revenues in your income statement even though the cash associated with those revenues is being paid to john hancock tanguy vincent serra  president and chief financial officer so just to be clear so the trade is that theres – john hancock takes about  of the cash flows but we retain a portion of them and so yes absolutely we will continue recurring that that way gordon johnson  axiom capital management inc okay so youll recognize  of revenues and then with respect to your guidance to be cash flow positive this year i just want to be clear here so youre saying youre going to be cash flow positive including financing the debt raises and potential equity raises as well as module manufacturing investments so youre not saying youre going to be cash flow positive from an operating cash flow perspective or free cash flow perspective youre saying youre going to cash flow positive from the perspective of including financing because you may do as well as excluding any module manufacturing investment is it – am i thinking about that correctly tanguy vincent serra  president and chief financial officer it will be cash flow positive but that includes the financing for the assets gordon johnson  axiom capital management inc so were not so okay sorry tanguy vincent serra  president and chief financial officer it includes the – for the quarter for the cost of the manufacturing but if there was a diluted round it would not include any of that so its only focused on all cash generated from financing the assets gordon johnson  axiom capital management inc okay okay and then lastly i noticed last quarter or not last quarter but the quarter before you guided your q calls to  million to  million they actually came in at  million the gaap opex so is the higher cost this quarter a potential spillover from delayed cost recognition in q and how should we think about that transitioning through i guess the rest of the year thanks for the questions guys tanguy vincent serra  president and chief financial officer i didnt follow that last question  million what was the question gordon johnson  axiom capital management inc yeah so the gaap opex guidance for q operating expense guidance was  million to  million the number actually came in at  million so we thought that your cost could be slightly higher this year as there was some delayed cost recognition from q to q not this year im sorry this q the first quarter of  it looks like your cost was higher i wanted to know if the cost is going to remain at that level or we should see some work down on that going forward tanguy vincent serra  president and chief financial officer so the – in q as we talked about last time around were reducing the marketing spend in q and so as a consequence those costs came down a little bit on a cash opex basis for those costs not linked to q so – in q the run rate were at right now is going to stay roughly where it is with increased volume as lyndon mentioned so our unit costs will come down gordon johnson  axiom capital management inc okay thanks again guys tanguy vincent serra  president and chief financial officer thank you operator our next question comes from michael morosi with avondale partners michael morosi  avondale partners llc hi guys first half on the utility services segment longerterm how much of a factor do you think this could play in the overall business in terms of leveraging cost over a larger installed base and also yeah from a more strategic standpoint as the business becomes more ownershipagnostic whether its loan products yeah presumably that means that the business is increasingly agnostic with respect to whether utility is ultimately on these assets as well so how does this segment kind of position solarcity for those longerterm market developments lyndon r rive  cofounder and chief executive officer yeah so – and i think that if i look at the next decade id be surprised if we werent driving call it  to  of our revenues from utilities i think that you end up in a situation where you have an energy contract with the customer and you know how that assets financing may change and it seems to get a lot of airplay but like that the payments to us come in part from utility and in part from the customer but the value proposition to the customer is still cheaper cleaner and probably more reliable energy so yeah i just see that in the long run say  and beyond the way that the grid is basically designed and maintained is fundamentally different and utilities dont necessarily have to look only to capital expenses in order to be able to meet the grid needs but kind of look to these customer side of resources for a lot of these benefits peter rive  cofounder  chief technology officer yeah i mean looking at that timeframe to me theres no doubt that all systems that we will be deploying at that time will have storage combined with smart inverters and when you have that you can provide all the grid services you need to the utility the idea that well be investing into big power plants at that time i highly doubt it and we have an asset that can generate energy at a pace thats needed and youll be able to store it and youll be able to provide services to the grid thats a far better way of building out the grid and leveraging existing equipment that well be deploying anyway so this is just over and above the equipment of – the services over and above the equipment were deploying anyway and in terms of the utility ownership of behind the newer generation i just think that its and i think this is shared with economists and many regulators that extending the utilitys monopoly position should be avoided as much as it can be i think that people are more looking towards ways to kind of innovate within the utility sector and so a couple of interesting ideas of being advanced in terms of being able to give the utilities the ability to earn income over services they can procure from companies like solarcity rather than necessarily only owning earning income also capital expenses or all equipment that they own lyndon r rive  cofounder and chief executive officer yeah its actually once against this business i actually im very encouraged by that i want utilities to get into this business and if they want to get directly into the same business they should just not under their regulated division as pete mentioned it should be under a different part of the company which doesnt have the protection of all the rate payers they can go through the same process make the same investment decisions that we have to make but i think in the long run itll just be more simplistic to partner in that area michael morosi  avondale partners llc thats great and then with respect to the asset monetizations one of the bigger question marks around the company and the value that the company creates is is how to value the renewal period public equity investors have apparently always very heavily discounted it or at least in recent quarters they have the abs market does not attribute much value to it or any value yeah the cash equity deal with hancock didnt – yeah was a year term so what can you do to prove out that renewal value or to maybe even change innovate around contract structures that may be even extended contract terms as theres more of a track record with the technology in the field and people get more comfortable around the longerterm production profiles is there any opportunity to kind of partially prove out that renewal period by actually making it not a renewal period and instead making it a longer contracted period peter rive  cofounder  chief technology officer well i mean i think that like a longer contracting period for the customer wouldnt necessarily be good to us i dont that think we necessarily want to try to increase the contract term and i dont – i cant immediately think of some way to prove out exactly what will happen  years from now but i think that i can just extrapolate as to what the value of energy will be and then also just think about what additional technologies can be deployed alongside that that will be particularly appealing to the customer so being able to  years from now retrofit the system with the technology that can allow them to participate in this going to kind of grid services of the economy or being able to add a battery to add additional reliability as well as additional income streams i think that what gives me great confidence in renewal is the ability to supplement the products they have with something that will be even more appealing at that point combined with the fact that fundamentally the value of the energy is expected to be quite a bit lower than what theyre paying the utility lyndon r rive  cofounder and chief executive officer yeah and the asset life of this is  years  years the direct warranty is  years so this tremendous value plus the renewal period tanguy vincent serra  president and chief financial officer also just the value of the relationship with the customer i think is a little less kind of tangible but its present – and not just the customer but the relationship that we have with them im seeing that the customer may sell their home – will likely sell their home in that period so and thats not as tangible but i think in my opinion anyway its incredibly valuable michael morosi  avondale partners llc all right thanks a lot guys operator i will go to sven eenmaa with stifel sven eenmaa  stifel nicolaus  co inc yes thanks for taking my questions first i wanted to ask in terms of the hancocktype of asset monetization transactions if you think of these megawatts deploying in the years in – during a year like how big part of the mix you would expect to finance through such type of transactions going forward lyndon r rive  cofounder and chief executive officer yeah i appreciate the question thanks so i think it really would depend on where the financing markets are so if you have a vibrant securitization market we might want to do more in the securitization markets but this creates another significant opportunity it also depends on – this is a way to clear more liquidity upfront than we would on a securitization so it also depends on specific liquidity requirements of the business at that moment in time so i dont want to give a mixed forecast basis i would expect we would do all of our assets over time go either into bank debt securitization or cash equity and a nice healthy mix of all three over the cycle but any given period i dont know sven eenmaa  stifel nicolaus  co inc got it second question i wanted to ask in terms of you mentioned the combination of the cost structure on the utility projects youre doing consisting of a traditional utilityscale plus storage how should we think that impacting your kind of cost curve here as we go through the rest of the year i mean your high dollar s in the current quarter as the mix increases whats the implications here lyndon r rive  cofounder and chief executive officer yeah i think in subsequent quarters well be providing you a better framework to understand the cost and the profit associated with solarplus battery systems so its unfortunate at this point in time but i dont think that we can kind of break it out or give you a good indication but i think that generally speaking were going to be able to give you a good framework to understand what the solar costs are and then separately what the cost of storage is sven eenmaa  stifel nicolaus  co inc as a last question i want to ask in terms of – and i apologize if you mentioned it already but if i look at your first quarter bookings and sequential kind of  growth commentary here what will be the catalysts here on bookings front to drive you guys into that  gigawatt level for that or  gigawatt level for the year to be able to meet that target lyndon r rive  cofounder and chief executive officer sorry i didnt understand the question youre saying what causes to tanguy vincent serra  president and chief financial officer what will the catalysts to increase booking and going forward peter rive  cofounder  chief technology officer i mean solar alone will be a good example of it lyndon r rive  cofounder and chief executive officer so the regulatory issues have – are being resolved at least most of them have so thats a big item q had many decisions that had to be made california made its decisions massachusetts made its decision new hampshire made its decision so thats all now being addressed the solar loan product there is a growing demand for customers who want to own the equipment so we think that will have an impact seasonality kicks in so now were entering into the summer and then were also going to be expanding into new states and so those are the other areas that will help us with the additional bookings sven eenmaa  stifel nicolaus  co inc got it thanks a lot operator thank you well now go to sophie karp with guggenheim sophie karp  guggenheim securities llc hello thank you for taking my question guys i just wanted to get your perspective on how much leverage do you think is appropriate for these assets and your funding mix has moved quite a bit it is more debtfinanced this quarter or less tax equity so what do you kind of see as a normalized level in terms of what are the metric you want to choose debt to cash flow or debttoebitda for these assets within the powerco thank you tanguy vincent serra  president and chief financial officer yeah i think in terms of more of percentage of pd they could have the securitization markets look at it so you look at most tax equity cash flows you discount that back at  that gives you a dollar number and then the securitization market well say its anywhere between  and  of that number would be available for securitization principal then there is some dscr ratios around that but thats kind of the metric to look at sophie karp  guggenheim securities llc thank you and then just as a followup on the mix i guess i just want to make sure i understood you correctly i think you said that going forward you expect to have  residential  ci but this quarter in particular we saw a higher percentage of the ci is that right tanguy vincent serra  president and chief financial officer thats right yes sophie karp  guggenheim securities llc okay thank you ill go back in the queue operator thank you and well now go to edwin mok with needham  company edwin mok  needham  co llc hi thanks for taking my questions so just want to quickly revisit kind of your opex or your cash opex i think this quarter you said because of the low booking more on – your opex went up a lot and you expect to come back in the second quarter as youre booking accelerated right so just how do you kind of think about your overall opex for the company i think previously you guys talked about that number likely to continue grow on a sequential and yearoveryear basis just want to kind of get a sense where do you think opex or cash opex would be for the company lets say by towards the second half of the year end and or we are kind of at the level that you think youre good enough to ramp up your booking level and therefore you can keep it at this level any kind of guidance on that tanguy vincent serra  president and chief financial officer so we really think about the cost on a unit basis and so thats why weve disclosed the cost memo which really ties all of our opex numbers to a per unit basis so the parts of the opex are included in overhead and the cost of sales we expect the overhead piece on an absolute dollar basis to be roughly flat and we expect the sales and marketing piece to reflect as when lyndon said a decline on a per unit basis in q and q edwin mok  needham  co llc i see and beyond this year right as you look longerterm do you think lets say you continue to grow and increase your size – your installation per year do you see a need to continue to grow that or i would have think that as you build out certain regions you can kind of basically kind of stop in those regions and still kind of get more leverage out of your sales team do you not see that or can you give us some color on that lyndon r rive  cofounder and chief executive officer yes so you definitely need to continue investing into sales and marketing we saw that when we slowed down our performance marketing so all the advertising in november december it generates less leads so you do need to continue to invest into sales and marketing we are looking at different sales channels to continue reducing our acquisition costs when we look at different acquisition costs some of the sales channels is actually quite low and so well be scaling those more aggressively so but we will still continue investment in sales and marketing i dont see that changing and even in states like california we still only have call it   penetration so we need to continue to advertise operator thank you and our next question comes from pavel molchanov with raymond james pavel s molchanov  raymond james  associates inc yeah hey guys you mentioned at the beginning that the regulatory climate is the best in years as you put it in a really long time what are the remaining question marks in at the state level that you have yet to get clarity on and that you expect to be resolved by the end of the year lyndon r rive  cofounder and chief executive officer so the – id say the biggest open item right now is arizona and i dont expect that we get clarity at the end of the year probably clarity q next year – maybe a little later than q next year but arizona today is the biggest unanswered state but the for rest of the states clarity looks really good peter rive  cofounder  chief technology officer i mean i think that like traditionally when people talk about clarity and the way weve talked about it its been a strong focus on net metering but there is a lot of distributed resource plan that are currently being evaluated in california and new york and other places where like the utility business model and the way that utilities can be compensated is changing so there is a lot of interesting stuff happening in new york and california this year that were watching very closely in california we have good net metering run rate there is a lot of stuff going on as to how utilities in california can include the benefits of these customersited resources and the distribution systems so theres a lot of stuff happening there that hopefully will create the environment for us to be able to see greater incomes from our solar systems lyndon r rive  cofounder and chief executive officer yeah and i actually expect to get clarity for nevada in the februaryish legislation the legislators definitely want to do the right thing  people are treated really unfairly and so now the legislators want to look at addressing that and i know that the state wants to see solar come back the community definitely wants us to come back so thats another area that i think well see more clarity around the february march timeframe pavel s molchanov  raymond james  associates inc and then just a small kind of a technical question you introduced a new line item on the revenue statement operating lease prepayments and upfront incentives what is that going to correlate with in other words is that tied to your cash sales or the megawatts installed whats the connection there tanguy vincent serra  president and chief financial officer yeah thanks so what we try to do is really break out in the financials theres total revenue from periodic billing so that ties to the amount of megawatts that we have under management and the irradiance and the dollars coming in associated with those ppas leases and longterm contracts we then have revenue from offering these prepayments and upfront incentives so those would be correlated to the oneoff dollars coming in from specific oneoff programs and so that would correlate to megawatts installed or deployed deployed would be probably a better metric pavel s molchanov  raymond james  associates inc okay appreciate it operator thank you and ladies and gentlemen that does
