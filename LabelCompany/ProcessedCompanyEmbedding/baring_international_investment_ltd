bonds owned morningstar combines credit rating information provided by the fund companies only using ratings assigned by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization  nrsro with an average default rate calculation to come up with a weightedaverage credit quality the weightedaverage credit quality is currently a letter that roughly corresponds to the scale used by a leading nrsro funds with a low credit quality style box placement are those whose weightedaverage credit quality is less than bbb medium are those less than aa but greater or equal to bbb and high are those of aa or higher when classifying a bond portfolio morningstar first maps the nrsro credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates as determined by morningstars analysis of actual historical default rates morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average default rate for the entire bond fund finally morningstar maps this average default rate to its corresponding credit rating along a convex curve for interestrate sensitivity morningstar obtains from fund companies the average effective duration generally morningstar classifies a fixedincome funds interestrate sensitivity based on effective duration of the morningstar core bond index mcbi which is currently three years the classification of limited will be assigned to those funds whose

in the dropdown at the top of this page in order to see its performance details all investments involve risks including possible loss of principal special risks are associated with foreign investing including currency fluctuations economic instability and political developments investments in developing markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors currency rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time and can reduce returns because the fund may invest its assets in companies in a specific region including europe it is subject to greater risks of adverse developments in that region andor the surrounding regions than a fund that is more broadly diversified geographically current political and financial uncertainty surrounding the european union may increase market volatility and the economic risk of investing in companies in europe derivatives including currency management strategies involve costs and can create economic leverage in the portfolio which may result in significant volatility and cause the fund to participate in losses as well as enable gains on an amount that exceeds the funds initial investment the fund may not achieve the anticipated benefits and may realize losses when a counterparty fails to perform as promised the funds risk considerations are discussed in the prospectus performance data represents past performance which does not guarantee future results current performance may differ from figures shown investment return and principal value will fluctuate with market conditions and you may have a

with a low credit quality style box placement are those whose weightedaverage credit quality is less than bbb medium are those less than aa but greater or equal to bbb and high are those of aa or

to investing in   capital ideas viewpoints five keys to investing in  by capital ideas editorial team december   back to topby capital ideas editorial team december   the events of the past year have made one thing clear — it’s almost impossible to know what’s coming next but whether it’s economic uncertainty or a geopolitical event that rocks the markets there are steps an investor can take to be prepared for shocks and surprises here are five ways to stay on track despite unforeseen turbulencethis article was updated on march   uncertainty is a sure thing keep calm and carry onwhen it comes to shock and awe  delivered the united kingdom’s decision to leave the european union the election of donald trump as president of the united states turmoil in china’s markets challenges to globalization — clearly the world remains an uncertain placeswift and dramatic change can inspire powerful emotions and lead to very human but ultimately destructive investment decisions for investors confronted with confusion and uncertainty the natural temptation is to retreat “keep calm and carry on” may be good advice but for many investors it can be hard to followhistory offers hope time after time the market has demonstrated its ability to climb a “wall of worry” ever since the market’s low in  in the wake of the financial crisis the sp has demonstrated its strength in the face of issues ranging from the “flash crash” to political turmoil at home and abroadmany of the events depicted on this chart have been costly the market however has not only survived but thrived for more than a century the us market has endured wars recessions assassinations scandals and natural disasters and each time it has come backthrough it all the market has demonstrated remarkable strength and resiliency in the face of challenges investors should follow suitwhat does the rest of the year hold for investorslearn what capital group economists and portfolio managers think in our  midyear outlookget the outlook diversification still matters so keep your balancein the  bear market diversification didn’t matter the great recession took a toll on nearly every asset class and portfolio but in the  downturn diversification worked if you hadn’t piled into tech you were spared a lot of pain when the dotcom bubble burstthe debate over investment diversification is likely to go on and on but today a strategic allocation in stocks and bonds around the world remains a hallmark of a portfolio that can help investors fulfill their objectives in the long runinvestors are likely to be faced with situations in  that might tempt them to deviate from their longterm strategy for example the united states’ economy looks likely to continue setting the pace for global growth while europe’s economy continues to struggle that might make some investors question the value of investing abroadbut today’s environment requires a global perspective investors should consider having exposure to stock and bonds from around the world ideally the resulting portfolio will have the potential to benefit from the extraordinary changes in the world’s capital markets that present longterm investment opportunitieswhile it is true that rising interest rates can hurt bond prices in the near term bonds should continue to play an important role in a diversified portfolio bonds can mitigate volatility preserve capital and supply the investor with either current income or a relatively certain amount at some point in the futureit’s also important to remember that over the long term higher rates can be beneficial for fixed income investors as bonds are sold or reach maturity the proceeds can be reinvested in bonds with a higher coupon which can help offset the impact of price declines“if you’re a longterm investor you have to remember that you are constantly reinvesting bond coupons bond maturities” says capital group portfolio manager wesley phoa “if rates are trending higher you’re reinvesting them at higher rates and so the returns that you end up getting don’t look as bad as you might have expected” income is scarce casting a wide net can pay dividendsthere are nearly  million people over  in the united states and many of them have one thing in common they want their dividends millions of retiring baby boomers need income but they may have to search far and wide for yieldhistorically dividends have always played a significant role in driving equity returns and helping investors meet their financial goals dividend income is especially important during retirement this chart shows that at a time when an increasing number of people are approaching retirement age the dividend yield of the sp  and the yield on treasuries are both at relatively low levelsto be sure strong demand for dividend income has driven valuations for many traditional dividend payers in the us — such as utilities and consumer staples — high above longterm averagesfor investors willing to look beyond us borders there are a significant number of companies in both developed and emerging international markets with high dividend yields some greater than  in fact since  dividends have accounted for more than half of average annual total returns in developed international marketsglobal bonds can also play a role in portfolios an extraordinary expansion in global capital flows has dramatically increased the selection of fixed income opportunities a global bond strategy can allow investors to participate in these expanding opportunitiesthe evolution of dividendpaying securities abroad just as millions of investors are shifting from accumulating wealth to entering the retirement income phase provides another reason for including international equities and bonds in a welldiversified portfolio relax it’s not all doom and gloomtake a deep breath relax in an age when doom and gloom seem to be all we read about or see on television it just might be possible that things aren’t as bad as they seem in fact things may just be getting better — and not for the few but for the manyin the united states for example disposable personal income reached nearly  trillion in  or nearly  more than in  household credit card debt dropped to  billion in  down from  billion in this chart shows the remarkable decline in poverty around the world indeed the global standard of living is rising at a remarkable rate with millions of people moving into the middle class many of them are reaching for a better life a powerful force that could have significant ramifications for the global economy and companies around the worldthanks to innovation education and a strong entrepreneurial spirit in most of the world the future actually looks bright from cars that can drive themselves to breakthrough drugs that could lead to victory in the war against cancer we may be on the cusp of a dramatically different and better futureduring a time when pessimism can sometimes seem overwhelming capital group portfolio manager carl kawaja has a refreshing theory about life and the world things get better“i think that the world broadly gets better” carl says “i think people become wealthier i think health care becomes better i think education improves i think we know a lot more about the world” life happens control what you can with a longrange plandon’t get too high or too low try to maintain an even keel fight fear with factsall of those can be hard to do when the world’s markets and global economy are going through times that can be both exhilarating and frightening the evidence shows that euphoric investors tend to buy high and fearful investors sell lowthe capital group home of american funds conducted a proprietary survey of investors in  and found that those who work with a financial advisor are more likely to stay on track toward their longterm goals while also feeling better and more confident about achieving them they are also more likely to invest a larger percentage of their income and invest regularlyadvisors can help investors overcome uncertainty and fear by keeping them committed to a consistent investing plan that has the potential to fulfill their investment objectives an advisor can help investors stay focused on the big picture when the market drops for example an advisor can put things in perspective and keep people from jumping out of investments that are aligned with their goals navigating toward your desired destination can be easier when you have someone you can turn to for directionclose xsign up now to get
