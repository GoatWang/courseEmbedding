paper goods allowing them to operate in spite of wartime shortages called food cooperatives inc the products procured by this organization were sold under the food club and elna labels some of the members of food cooperatives were also members of another cooperative called top frost foods in addition to supplying frozen foods to its members top frost also had an impressive quality program that set its specifications higher than those of the leading national brands by early  it was obvious that the two cooperatives were clearly well matched which resulted in a merger of the two companies in december of that year this was the beginning of topco associates inc as it is known today folklore has it that the name topco came from the top of top frost and the co of food cooperatives some people claim its an acronym for top companies     copyright     by topco associates llc privacytermsloginregister
