association news board members  staff council news minnesota soybean growers association minnesota soybean research  promotion council by minnesota soybeanminnesota soybean growers association msga director lawrence sukalski has reached out to his crop insurance agent to discuss dicamba and he advises fellow growers not to hesitate reporting suspected dicamba damage in their fields  “most importantly growers who think they might be suffering from dicamba damage need to make sure they’re covered for insurance reasons before it’s too late in the season” the martin county farmer says “they shouldn’t be afraid to file a report we want to be as diligent as we can on the dicamba issue to properly manage this and that starts with documentation” earlier this week the minnesota department of agriculture mda had reported receiving  dicambarelated complaints well below the numbers seen in other states joshua stamper mda’s pesticide  fertilizer management division director says the names of people filing potential dicambarelated complaints are kept private within the department and aren’t shared publicly  “the potential for drift is always going to be there but we don’t believe these cases to be offlabel uses” stamper says “we do advise farmers to follow the best management practices cross their ts and dot their is” stamper says a complaint doesn’t necessarily mean dicamba drift is to blame other culprits and factors could be to blame most complaints are inspected in approximately one week  “drift volatility and failure to properly clean sprayers these are all on the table for causes but it’s hard to know unless folks report and document any damage they might observe” says tom peters extension agronomist at north dakota state university “this is important because the only way we can learn more about dicamba drift is by compiling the reported data we need to see the full numbers before issuing any conclusions”  sukalski says msga is taking the issue seriously and proceeding with caution but there is no cause for alarm at this stage  “we’re trying our best to collaborate with industry partners and the mda to find a solution” he says “msga is holding meetings and working hard to get the word out there that if you think you’ve experienced dicamba damage the best course is to report it”  for more information growers can visit xtendimax’s

minnesota soybean  gathering dicamba data needed for documentation farm bill discussion draws engaged crowd july   commentsin association news events minnesota soybean growers association by minnesota soybeanthe forthcoming farm bill was discussed among concerned and passionate citizens at the mankato vfw during a dialogue session hosted by minnesota farmers union  “farmers need certainty” says chuck ackman sen amy klobuchar’s outreach director “don’t do a sixmonth extension”  the future of the farm bill however remains vague and unclear “all we know for sure about the next farm bill is it will be printed on paper” says bruce miller of minnesota farmers union “but it’s an important piece of legislation”  about  members from the area including minnesota state sen nick frentz state rep clark johnson and staffers for senators and congressmen were on hand to discuss their concerns with a threeperson panel from national farmers union and minnesota department of agriculture  crop insurance rural broadband access the federal budget and the supplemental nutrition food assistance program snap were all discussed at length  “the bill needs to be drafted according to the needs of rural america” says rob larew national farmers union senior vice president of public policy and communications “whether it’s crop insurance conservation or snap these are all safety nets for our community” the current farm bill which expires in fall  represents less than two percent of the entire federal budget snap makes up about  percent of the farm bill and president trump’s proposed budget would cut snap by  billion about  percent over  years “when you take all those portions of the budget that no one’s willing to cut – like social security medicare medicaid interest on our debt defense spending –suddenly the ag part of the budget become a much bigger target” says lawler who has worked on four farm bills “i always ask folks to look at it in context that the farm bill takes up such a small part of the overall budget” forty seven million american are on snap and economic reports indicate  in snap benefits generate about  in economic activity in minnesota more than  farmer’s market accept snap  allegations of snap fraud are a myth says sophia lenarzcoy associate director of hunter solutions minnesota  “we’re really interested in protecting snap it’s an important story to tell in terms of the economic impact it has for growers” lenarzcoy says “a lot of people are just doing the best they can snap has a great track record and brings a lot of money into our state and it’s the moral thing to do right people should be able to afford food and there are people struggling to make ends meet farming who qualify for snap ”  rep johnson believes it’s important the farm bill is broad to garner more support  “we need these other additions to add to the political coalition” he says sen frentz agreed with others who stated rural broadband is in dire need of upgrades “i’m surprised rural broadband is not more of an issue” he says “farmers need better broadband access one of the best things we can do for them is to make sure they have internet so i encourage everyone to speak up on that issue”  lawler says he would take the crowd’s comments back with him to washington dc “we’re very much engaged with all the messages we’re hearing in meetings like this and making sure they are being delivered to our congressional members” he says “the committees are very much engaged in getting this farm bill up and running”

minnesota soybean growers association water by minnesota soybeanenvironmental protection agency epa administrator scott pruitt expressed his department’s support for agriculture during a roundtable discussion wednesday hosted by agrigrowth at the securian center in st paul “we see you as partners not your adversaries” pruitt told about  minnesota ag representatives “to say that farmers who are the stewards of their land don’t take care of the land is a dc mindset”  pruitt visited minnesota during a multistate tour to explain the epa’s recent proposal to rescind the clean water rule and recodify the regulatory text that existed prior to the  defining “waters of the united states” wotus  “what the  ruling did was give the epa authority to make judgment calls” pruitt says “i believe the wall street journal said this but we want to be ‘peerreviewed not palreviewed” the review comes on the heels of president donald trump’s february executive order reviewing wotus ensuring pollution control and promoting economic growth pruitt says the proposed rule would be in accordance with supreme court decisions agency guidelines and longstanding practices  “we as an agency can’t make it up as we go along” pruitt says “that’s what the last administration did … wotus was so extreme”  pruitt says he favors a more narrow definition of public waters as part of the epa’s “back to basics” approach  “the rule created uncertainty as applied” he says “the epa shouldn’t be an ebbandflow agency science should be independent…this is the first in a twostep process to redefine wotus it’s something that has to be fixed”  pruitt railed against the agency’s role in regulatory oversights during previous administrations “we want to get to truth and data” he says “we want objective science driving our decisions” a diehard baseball fan pruitt labeled his agency in the beginning months of his tenure a “rookie ball” organization that is “batting ”  “we’re getting vertical with the epa” he says “that’s revolutionary at the epa the agency hasn’t done things on time everything wrong with regulatory power we’re the poster child”  later in the discussion pruitt indicated an interest in participating in an aerial tour of the red river valley pruitt anticipates the epa will releases its final ruling on wotus in the first quarter of   “we’re going to get rid of the bad rules” he says “then we’re going to do our job”  httpsmnsoybeanorgwpcontentuploadsdfhxdowvyaaikjpg   minnesota soybean httpsmnsoybeanorgwpcontentuploadsmsrpclogojpg minnesota soybean  pruitt discusses wotus with

soybean growers association minnesota soybean research  promotion council by minnesota soybeanfor most minnesota farmers the prospects of having to file an elk damage claim are very limited but for those northern farmers who are unfortunate to suffer damage on their properties claims are inevitable with that said the minnesota department of agriculture mda wants producers to know the process has changed for submitting elk damage claims “our elk claims process serves as an important financial lifeline for farmers” said andrea vaubel mda assistant commissioner “there aren’t many elk claims but the damage can be pretty significant when it occurs” according to minnesota statute the elk damage compensation program requires that crop loss must be investigated by a federal crop adjuster or county extension agent in a timely manner vaubel said that because of several factors including the retirement of longtime extension educators in the north the university of minnesota extension educators will no longer be able to verify elk claims “producers will need to get in touch with their crop insurance agent to verify the damage” she said while there are no “federal crop insurance adjusters” because of the privatization of the federal program there are adjusters who have federallysupervised training the us department of agriculture has assured mda that crop insurance companies are willing to do elk investigations for their customers vaubel says that if producers don’t have crop insurance or have issues with their crop insurance company agreeing to verify a claim they should contact blane white mda animal damage compensation program coordinator at blanewhitestatemnus or   “time is of the essence” vaubel said “claims have to be filed in a pretty timely manner”
