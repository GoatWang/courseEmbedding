income by simply being a winner in the state lotto the new york post reports that the wall street millionaire was able to win his “chump change” as a secondplace prize in the state lotto drawing that was conducted last week out of the six lotto numbers that were selected according to the report robert fagenson was able to hit five of them the yearold ceo was even able to hit the bonus number which allowed him to rake in  in an interview with the new york post fagenson opened up about his lottery win and his reassurance of the state lotto in general “i was just wondering if the system really

combination of his wife’s birthday their wedding anniversary and the birthdays of his two daughters each year fagenson sends a check in the amount of  to the lottery in exchange for the chance to win big in the drawing that adds up to an estimated  that fagenson has spent on the lottery over the past two decades alone based on that calculation he was able to generate a major return on his longterm investment from a single win the new york post reports that robert fagenson plans to keep playing the lotto each week the fact that he was able to win  and hit five out of six numbers is probably all the motivation that he needs to do so however the bigger picture of fagenson’s finances shows why  might be considered “chump change” for him according to the wall street journal fagenson donated the same amount of money that he won from the state lotto —  — to an animal charity based in long island back in  according to the daily mail public records show that fagenson also owns a manhattan
