operations the following information should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this form q together with the more detailed business information and the march   audited financial statements included in the companys registration statement filed on form s amendment no  file no  as filed with the sec on july   it also includes our detailed expenditures and milestones for our plan of operations described herein statements in this section and elsewhere in this form q that are not statements of historical or current fact constitute forwardlooking statements general overview our company was incorporated in the state of nevada on february   to engage in the development and sale of electronic medical record emr software for small and medium sized physician offices and clinics our principal executive offices are located at mlynska    kosice slovak republic our phone number is   we are a development stage company we only just completed our first fiscal year end on march  and we have no subsidiaries we are in the early stages of developing our emr software we currently have no revenues no operating history and no users or revenues for our proposed software our plan of operations over the  month period following successful completion of our offering is to gain support for our concept and create fully functional emr software this product when completed will be commercially viable and available for commercial sale initially the emr software is planned to be a software tool that will collect and capture patient data electronically and store it in a format that enables efficient access and viewing and distribution by printing or email our planned second phase product development will focus on interconnectivity of our emr software with various third party vital signs monitors such as blood pressure monitors or temperature monitors we are in the initial stages of attempting to raise up to  in common share equity to proceed with our emr first phase product development in order to do so we filed a registration statement with the sec to conduct our initial public offering our registration statement was declared effective on august   as of the date hereof we have not raised any equity and we cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations our business is subject to all of the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise and we are at least  months away from the date hereof from generating any revenue if at all we believe that the funds from this offering will allow us to operate for one year only if we are successful in raising the maximum permitted under the offering our current planned offering is also only sufficient to complete development of the basic emr software provided we raise the maximum we currently estimate that we will require an additional  for the commercial launch of our basic emr software and subsequent to the completion of the basic emr software another  months and  to develop the software development kit for interoperability with third parties from inception until the date of this filing we have had limited operating activities primarily consisting of the incorporation of our company and the initial equity funding by our officer and director we received our initial funding of  through the sale of common stock to our officer and director who purchased  shares at  per share going concern we have very limited operations and no revenues we have incurred losses from operations since inception no revenues are anticipated until we complete and successfully commercialize our planned emr software the ability of our company to continue as a going concern is dependent on raising capital to fund our business plan and ultimately to attain profitable operations accordingly these factors raise substantial doubt as to the companys ability to continue as a going concern our activities to date have been financed from the proceeds of share subscriptions from our inception to june   we have raised a total of  in gross proceeds from the issuance of our common stock we require significant additional financing to develop our business there is no guarantee that we will be able to raise any additional funds plan of operation our plan of operations over the  month period following successful completion of our offering is to create fully functional and compliant emr software this product will be commercially viable and available for purchase when completed initially the emr system is planned to be a software tool that will collect and capture patient data in electronic format we are also planning to provide file output in pdf format so it can be emailed by the user the patient features that our emr will include in this first phase are patient profile first  last name contacts street  city  zip code  country  phone  email all parameters will be pdf format enabled for printing and email and will have a designated output directory associated with them for efficient clinical access and viewing we are also planning to design all data fields with a textbased editor to allow for physician and any other user notes to be easily entered and captured on the patient file in order to achieve our plan we have established the following goals for this initial  month period  create product overview and slide deck for investors results of operations from the inception of our company on february   to march   our first fiscal year end we incurred a loss of  all of which was incurred for the incorporation of our company we incurred a loss of  for the three months ended june   comparisons are not meaningful because our company was only just incorporated on february   this loss includes  for general and administrative costs and  for professional fees for our  audit and legal fees associated with our s registration statement for our initial public offering from inception on february   to june   we have incurred cumulative losses of  we believe we will continue to incur losses into the foreseeable future as we develop our business revenues we did not generate any revenues from february   inception to june   we will not be in a position to generate revenues for at least  months from the date hereof future revenue generation is dependent on the successful development and commercial launch of our emr software we currently estimate that we will require an additional financing of  to launch our product liquidity and capital resources historically we have financed our cash flow and operations solely from the sale of  of common stock to our director of the  we raised  was used for operating activities since our inception on february   as of june   our resultant cash balance was  and our net working capital balance was  as of the date hereof our net working capital balance is  we believe our current cash and net working capital balance is only sufficient to cover our expenses for the next  months if we cannot raise any additional financing prior to the expiry of this timeframe we will be forced to cease operations and our business will fail even under a limited operations scenario to maintain our corporate existence we believe we will require a minimum of  in additional cash over the next  months to pay for the remainder of our total offering costs and to maintain our regulatory reporting and filings other than our planned offering we currently have no arrangement in place to cover this shortfall in order to achieve our stated business plan goals we require the funding from this offering we are a development stage company and have generated no revenue to date we cannot guarantee that we will be able to sell all the shares required even if we are successful in raising all of the funding under this offering we will still not be in a position to generate any significant revenues or become profitable we still must raise significant additional funding to continue with our business our planned offering is only sufficient to enable us to develop our basic emr software we believe we will require an additional  for marketing expenses for the commercial launch of our basic emr software and another  months and  to develop the software development kit for interoperability with third party monitoring equipment manufacturers these funds will have to be raised through equity financing debt financing or other sources which may result in the dilution in the equity ownership of our shares we will also need more funds if the costs of commercialization and further development are greater than we have budgeted we will also require additional financing to sustain our business operations if we are ultimately not successful in earning revenues we currently do not have any arrangements in place regarding our current offering or any subsequent offering for further financing and we may not be able to obtain financing when required obtaining commercial loans assuming those loans would be available will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments there are no assurances that we will be able to obtain further funds required for our continued operations even if additional financing is available it may not be available on terms we find favorable at this time there are no anticipated sources of additional funds in place failure to secure the needed additional financing will have an adverse effect on our ability to remain in business aug   c  cybernet data systems inc all rights reserved more

we are considered the smallest as we do not currently have a commercial product yet available for sale or use we will be competing with well funded startups traditional independent software developers and manufacturers and fully integrated large private and publicly held companies producing a wide range of products and services we will likely face additional competition from the entry of new companies into our target market our competitors have significantly greater resources and are able to spend more time and money on concept and focus testing software and product development testing and marketing lead times are significant for the adoption and regular use of emr software by any given small to medium sized physician office or clinic conversions of paper records to emr databases usually involve customization and significant time to train personnel and convert paper records competition is also based on product quality and features data storage brandname recognition ease of use effectiveness of marketing and price in order to compete effectively we believe we must offer  competitive pricing   hour user support   guaranteed uptime for hosted solutions  rapid development of new features  incentives and bonuses to clients who refer new customers  dedicated sales and support staff  work directly with users to develop features according to their needs  work directly with all the major device manufacturers to integrate their devices seamlessly into our system in addition regardless of our competitors market position financial resources or size our success also depends on our ability to successfully execute several other competitive strategies which we believe must successfully address the following for our customers  increase office productivity and clinical workflow we must design and build our emr software specifically to reduce office transition time and resources to convert the existing paper records in addition to ongoing daily data record keeping we plan on developing software that will enable simple conversion of paper based formats to electronic formats through the use of simple readily available paper scanners which can convert the paper file into digital and pdf format we consider this a key feature as the pdf can be easily saved to the computer database reducing staff time  connectivity and integrated automation of patient vital signs ultimately our emr software must have the ability to record patient vital signs directly from a given monitoring device such as a blood pressure monitor seamlessly into the emr database this reduces human data entry errors and increases office productivity in the future we plan to incorporate this functionality by creating vital signs capture through the use of an integrating software development kit for use with various diagnostic monitoring equipment manufacturers  reduced user cost through the use of open source software we believe we can achieve a pricing advantage over our competitors as our development will be initially created from opensource software and modified to suit our needs as a result our capital costs for development are reduced which enables us to pass these savings onto customers and reduce startup costs for the company open source software is where the original creator provides the rights to study change and distribute the software for free to anyone and for any purpose typically open source software is found on the internet and is obtained at no cost free of licensing fees which enables us to pass on those savings to our users  data backup we plan to design our emr database for instant backup when data is entered the back up facilities can either be managed in house on separate servers or with independent third party data storage facilities  physicianoperator remote access we are planning to offer physicians and their approved operators the ability to remotely login and view patient records via secure access we believe remote access is a competitive advantage that most other emr providers do not provide and is an invaluable feature when physicians and care providers not in the office and require patient data  data security  encryption data security must be a key aspect of our software to comply with hipaa security rules and ensure security measures are met encryption is the conversion of data into a form often called ciphertext which cannot be understood by another party human or machine without being decrypted first our software programs will be built to offer a high level of protection through the use of algorithms to scramble the original input data into a new form which cannot be read without the use of decryption keys in order for our software and our company to be successful we will first need to alert our target market about our proposed emr product and the advantages we intend to offer our prospective customers when our product is completed we will also have to develop a comprehensive ongoing marketing plan to sell the software we believe our marketing and promotion strategy will be subject to major revisions are we get closer to actually launching the product company description our company was incorporated in the state of nevada on february   to engage in the development and sale of electronic medical record emr software for small and medium sized physician offices and clinics we are in the early stages of developing our emr software we currently have no revenues no operating history and no users or revenues for our proposed software our plan of operations over the  month period following successful completion of our offering is to gain support for our concept and create fully functional emr software this product when completed will be commercially viable and available for commercial sale initially the emr software is planned to be a software tool that will collect and capture patient data electronically and store it in a format that enables efficient access and viewing and distribution by printing or email we are also planning to design all data fields with a textbased editor to allow for physician and any other user notes to be easily entered and captured on the patient file our planned second phase product development will focus on interconnectivity of our emr software with various third party vital signs monitors such as blood pressure monitors or temperature monitors we will achieve this by developing a sophisticated software development kit or software tool which will enable diagnostic manufacturers to have their vital sign monitors speak to our system so that patient vital signs can be correctly and electronically captured in the emr system we believe this is very important to our long term survival and profitability as it will increase clinical workflow reduce clinic operating costs and reduce patient errors for our clients and give us a competitive edge over our competitors our current planned offering is only sufficient to complete development of the basic emr software we currently estimate that we will require an additional  for the commercial launch of our basic emr software and subsequent to the completion of the basic emr software another  months and  to develop the software development kit for interoperability with third parties  our principal executive offices are located at mlynska    kosice slovak
