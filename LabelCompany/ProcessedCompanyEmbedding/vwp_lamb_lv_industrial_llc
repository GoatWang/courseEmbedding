acquires two new assets in las vegas february   all las vegas real estate february  industriallas vegas office  henderson       mca realty a full service real estate investment and management company has acquired two assets in the las vegas market including the harmon warehouse center a  squarefoot multitenant industrial building in southwest las vegas as well as the gibson tech center a  squarefoot office building in henderson nevada for a combined total of  million “in comparison to other markets across the west las vegas continues to offer value and pricing levels that are still well below former peak levels” says tyler mattox principal at mca realty “the local industrial market is in its th consecutive quarter of positive net absorption and vacancy in this market dropped to  percent at the end of last year – the lowest in southern nevada since ” mattox notes that the office market in las vegas and its henderson submarket is also performing well posting five consecutive years of healthy net absorption with steadily increasing lease rates “we acquired each of these assets well below their replacement cost giving us the opportunity to increase value over time” he says “the attraction of the gibson tech center asset in particular was the freestanding nature of the building with an  square feet surface parking ratio which will allow us to attract tenants with higher parking needs than those that a traditional office building can accommodate” mca realty now owns  assets encompassing nearly one million square feet in las vegas  the firm continues to seek out industrial and office acquisitions in the  million to  million range mca’s two recent acquisitions include acquisition   harmon warehouse center mca realty acquired harmon warehouse center a  squarefoot multitenant industrial building from an institutional investor for  million “this is an asset we have been watching carefully for many months” says mattox  “with no new development of multitenant industrial product underway in the market we anticipate strong tenant demand for this property over the next several years” the prior owner of harmon warehouse center implemented a  million renovation program in   even as a renovated asset the property is currently operating at rents that are percent below market value “we will immediately increase net operating income by bringing rents up to market levels as leases roll” says mattox “moving forward we plan to hold the asset and to capitalize on continued growth and rent appreciation given its superior location and adjacency to the strip harmon warehouse center is located at  and  valley view boulevard in las vegas nevada approximately one mile from the las vegas strip the buyer and seller were represented by kevin higgins garrett toft zac zaher sean zaher and jake higgins of cbre   acquisition   gibson tech center mca realty has also acquired gibson tech center a  squarefoot vacant office building in henderson nevada the property was acquired at a significant discount to replacement cost at  million “this building was a former itt facility that had functionally obsolete improvements” says mattox  “our business plan is to “whitebox” and reposition the building to appeal to call center and other tenants with significant parking requirements” according to the las vegas review journal the call center industry is flourishing in southern nevada due in large part to the region’s strong population of multilingual residents “by removing interior walls and creating a space tailored to this growing industry we plan to lease the property and increase value” explains mattox gibson tech center is located at  north gibson road in henderson nevada less than a mile from the  beltway less than two miles from the us freeway and  miles east of mccarran airport and the las vegas strip mca was represented by ryan martin taber thill and patti dillon of colliers international mca completes three

and bigbox construction is dominating the region” says bkm’s director of acquisitions brett turner who explains that there is essentially no new development of multitenant light industrial product underway in the area “this lack of available supply is driving significant investor demand for highquality renovated industrial buildings such as patrick commerce center allowing us to achieve a premium price for this asset” explains turner during its ownership bkm capital partners completely renovated and repositioned the property integrating a series of capital improvements including modernizing landscaping and paint providing new roofs and repairing hvac units “when we initially acquired this asset in  the property was only percent occupied” says turner “our integrated operating platform coupled with these strategic renovations allowed us to bring occupancy up to percent at close stabilizing cash flow and increasing net operating income” turner adds “we recognized the true value potential of this asset and market very early on which enabled us to deliver an attractive product to the market ultimately maximizing yields for our institutional investment partners”

cosmetic upgrades we were able to bring the property up to percent occupancy with rents more in line with market” says turner “we more than doubled rental rates this created strong stabilized inplace

acres on lamb boulevard just south of e craig road in the north las vegas submarket cbre’s kevin higgins and zac zaher assisted with the development analysis and land acquisition via west plans to develop a square foot “midbay” multitenant industrial development catering to small and midsized tenants an underserved segment of the market the building will have foot clear height up to  suites or bays catering to tenants in the  to  square foot range  the frontloaded building will also be crossdocked enabling larger tenants additional loading and distribution functionality  the tentative address is  n lamb boulevard las vegas nevada  the project has not yet been named over the past several years industrial property vacancy has in las vegas has declined from a peak of approximately  to a current vacancy of just over   most new development has been large warehouse distribution buildings catering to large ecommerce companies  however as the entire market has been recovering small to midsized tenants now have very few options if they are looking to either enter the market or move locations or if they have outgrown their existing space  viawest group’s goal is to fill this market need  “we are very excited to enter the las vegas industrial market with this project” noted gary linhart founding partner at viawest group  “we have been looking to either buy or develop midbay buildings but with  vacancy and very little competitive product on the horizon we think it is time to build” he added kevin higgins stated “we believe there is an excellent opportunity for an entrepreneurial developer like via west to take advantage of the underserviced midbay market in the north las vegas submarket” viawest is looking to add to its investment in las vegas with a focus on
