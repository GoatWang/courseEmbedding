helping the world invest better since  hi fool premium advice help fool answers contact us login search search better buy danaher corporation vs fortive corp we compare the investment proposition of the legacy company with the company spun off in  which stock is more attractive in  and why lee samaha tmfsaintgermain mar   at am danaher corporation nysedhr vs fortive corp nyseftv makes for one of the most interesting comparisons in the industrial sector of course there is nothing stopping you from owning both stocks  in fact before the spinoff of fortive in july  investors did own both businesses as a set  and certainly their differing investment propositions would provide diversificationhowever the split has created two significantly different companies so lets take a look at the contrasting investment cases for the two stocks  why fortive corp was spun off the rationale behind the spinoff was the creation of two separate companies with differing investment profiles in order for their management teams to better focus on growing their respective core businesses essentially danaher now consists of the legacy companys life sciences diagnostics dental water quality and product id segments and the acquired pall corp mainly life sciences and cepheid diagnostics businesses fortive comprises the legacy companys test and measurement retail fueling telematics and automation businesses image source fortive corp cyclical growth vs defensive growth there are three key differences between the two companies first around  of danahers revenue comes from life sciences diagnostics and dental end markets in other words its arguably not an industrial stock anymore and has relatively defensive end markets meanwhile fortives motley collection of industrial businesses should give far more exposure to the cyclicality of economic growth considering that most forecasters are predicting a pickup in industrial production growth starting in  and president trumps emphasis on infrastructural spending and supporting us manufacturing would indicate that fortive has more potential for upside surprise to its earnings in the next few years  meanwhile danahers end markets although strong dont have much cyclical upside so if you are specifically looking for exposure to a the potential of a stronger economy then fortive is the better choice organic vs acquisition growth second the legacy danaher company was noted for its acquisition strategy this largely involved buying unloved companies and applying its socalled danaher business system a set of lean manufacturing and continuous improvement principles to them in order to raise their margin and return on capital rather amusingly fortive is now calling its application of the same principles the fortive business system these principles will look familiar to fortive investors image source danaher corporation while the new danaher and fortive are following the same principles their relative positions are different in  for example danaher already has pall corporation a  billion acquisition in  and cepheid a recent  billion acquisition to fully integrate while fortive is hungrily on the mergersandacquisitions trail this year a quick look at both companies fourthquarter earnings reveals a lot about what to expect in  for example danahers core revenue grew  in the fourth quarter acquisitions also contributed  leaving reported revenue growth at  after a negative  foreigncurrency impact is included meanwhile core operating margin grew  basis points  basis points equals  but was held back by a basispoint reduction due to acquisitions and a basispoint reduction due to acquisition specific charges  the end result was an basispoint improvement  in short danahers acquisitions hurt margin in the fourthquarter consequently its opportunity is to expand margins at the acquisitions going forward on the other hand on the recent earnings call fortives ceo james lico affirmed that new ma continues to be our main priority in  and he later argued that the  outlook for  to  eps growth doesnt assume any ma and we expect to deploy some ma and thats the thing i think is going to take our  earnings growth up over the next year or two the contrast in corporate strategy in  is clear danaher is integrating and generating organic growth this year while fortive is more hungry for acquisitions and hoping those deals will help it grow in the future  different margin and cash flow profiles as you see in the chart below fortive commands higher margins and free cash flow fcf this is highly relevant because it will need cash flow to deploy in order to make acquisitions while danahers opportunity lies in expanding its margin and fcf generation particularly as it grows its sales of highmargin consumables  currently at  of total sales dhr ev to ebitda forward data by ycharts danaher vs fortive based on the ratio of enterprise value to ebitda shown in the chart above both stocks look more than fully valued however if i were forced to choose id say danaher looks the better bet there is no shortage of stocks to buy to benefit from a cyclical recovery so fortive doesnt necessarily stand out there and if the market keeps going up then its likely that fortive will find it tougher to make the acquisitions it needs to get earnings growth into double figures in  on the other hand danahers secular growth prospects are compelling even if its valuation right now is not danaher can grow its valuation in time via internal execution while fortive needs acquisitions and strong economic growth the interesting thing about both stocks is that they would both look very attractive given a market slump  fortive would get to make acquisitions cheaper and investors would get a better entry point into danahers longterm growth prospects you may have to wait for this lee samaha has no position in any stocks mentioned the motley fool has no position in any of the stocks
