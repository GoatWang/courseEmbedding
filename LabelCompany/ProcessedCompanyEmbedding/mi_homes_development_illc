reviewsrawatie of tampa fl on may  satisfaction ratingi have built  homes in tampa fl from  to  this is my first home built with mi homes on april   we signed a contract with mi homes in tampa to build a new home located on  i paid the escrow earnest money deposit of  to mi homes to start building our mi home was scheduled to completefinish on  per the addendum to agreement cash closing we were to provide to mi homes within five business days following the effective date financial statements or other written verification of our financial ability to purchase the property we provided our signed sale contract for  as written verification of our financial ability to purchase the property as cash equivalents mi homes accepted this as satisfactory adrian  informed us that we would not need to sign a separate contingency addendum to dissolve the contract and receive our deposit back in the case that we could not sell our existing home to fund the purchase of the new home before signing we asked adrian  point blank if we would be able to remove ourselves from the contract and recover our  in the event that we were not able to purchase the home we asked that specific question because we understood that we would not be able to purchase the property without first selling our existing home we made that very clear to adrian  before and at the signing he affirmed that we would be able to remove ourselves from the contract and recover our deposit and that no contingency needed to be written into the contract to affirm that we took his word as a representative of mi homes and signed the contract had we been properly informed that we would not be able to recover our deposit we would not have signed the contract he stated that mi homes would act in good faith to return our deposit if we were not able to buy mi homes never requested from us any other proof of ability to purchase as they never expected us to have another avenue to purchase ie a mortgage or cash on hand our briarhill ct home was listed for sale on  then came the unforeseen circumstances when the sale of our residence fell through on august  that i was unable to meet the deadline and finalize the mi home purchase i went to visit adrian  and adviseshow him the cancellation of contract we acted in good faith having full intentions of purchasing the mi home then the issue began with mi homes i spoke to the manager brian  several times via phonesemails begging him to give me some more time explaining that i had dropped my home selling price again he agreed to grant an extension until november   i continued diligently seek new buyer and dropped the price of her home multiple times hoping to finalize the mi purchase our home didnt sell by  but we had another signed contract at hand so i contacted adrian  he stated the home is sold later i found out that mi homes sold crowned sparrow lane home on  and it closed on  i spoke to adrian  sale consultant several time in person and via emails requesting a refund of the earnest money deposit funds explained that is a substantial amount of monies to lose due to lack of representation unfortunately because i was without proper representation and if i had representation we would have been advised that the agreement must include a contingency on the sale of her home in writing from mi homes and not to trust any their words mi home defaulted and lied to us and on their contract i filed a complaint with bbb department of consumer protection and now florida office of financial regulation and department of business and professional regulation if anyone is reading this and have the same problem or issue with mi homes and you know they lied and did not act in good faith or did not have you signed the proper agreement or lack of representation and keep your money please contact me at   i will be happy to share my story and more detail and we can file claim against mi homes i want to hear from you i do believe i am not the first one tell me your story ps i recently purchase built a home from taylor morrison in tampa when i told them its a cash purchase they request evidence of funds ie bank statement assets documents with  business dayshelpfulyesnoadam of new braunfels tx on march  satisfaction ratingbeautiful models  your home wont look like that the first problem and we should have walked was it took  months to build the finish work on our home is horrible our first construction manager quit halfway through the build and no one thought to see where the houses he was involved in were at in the build process mind you all of my problems wereare finish work and we arent the pickiest people on the planet but for what we paid for this house we should have gotten much better resultsnone of the doors were hung properly  they close automatically they dont close all the way there are large gaps and one door doesnt even touch the stop you can see in the gap into the guest bathroom all the trim on the doors need to be redone none of the corners meet properly and some are sticking off of the wall a good  inchtile was a mess  we paid for the upgrades and most of the tile work in the master shower iswas done so poorly they had to come out twice and still havent fixed it right cracked tiles caulked over missing grout and bad alignment the tile guys said when you use dark grout with white tile its a problem and blamed the mi design center for selling us that combocounter tops have gouges in them like someone with a hammer in their toolbelt was leaning over it and damaged them  both bathrooms paint was very uneven and some walls werent even painted all the way the landscaping on one side is completely dead because we had bad rain and it got washed away they said theyd fix it  still waiting texture is really bad in spots fixes are really bad window sills werent sanded before installpaintevery upgrade wasnt done well we have used all of our vacation at work to be home for these repairs to be made three times no one showed to do the trim work and still havent and the two times the tiles guys came one guy was there for  hours and messed up more than he fixed and the second time they were there for an hour and still missed stuff now its our problem because we cant be there during the week to get this stuff done going on  months later like i said its all finish work that would take a crew that knew what they were doing a few hours to fix but its getting that crew to do it waiting to get stuff fixed is a nightmarehelpfulyesnoalvin of cibolo tx on march  satisfaction ratingwe bought a home in  through mi homes after living in it for a year and some months we had a inspection done because we were about to move being a military family we move every  years the inspection came back saying that water was running back under the house so we put in for mi homes to come fix the problem along with other issues someone came out put dirt and left no grass to keep mud from washing away week later the rain comes in and washes away most of the dirt after call they and emailing mi homes they send out someone to put grass on the dirt so the rest wouldnt wash away most of the dirt was nearly gone so now we back where we almost started a year later we put the house up for sale and most of the realtors are saying this house has foundation issues now we are had to take the house off the market to get it fixed so we can sell it in almost a years time no one has reached out to say ha lets make it right and offer anything we ended up with a complete foundation lift on our home its march now and if the house is not sold by may we will have paid over  in mortgage our realtor said that she would never sell another mi homehelpfulyesnobob of new albany oh on feb  satisfaction ratingi would not recommend mi to anyone when they built my home they use pressed paper for the trim my home is not  yrs old and even though it has always been painted thoroughly the pressed board trim is deteriorating and it is costing me a fortune to replace it how could any reputable builder use pressed board trim they even used it under the front door it deteriorated over time and it destroyed the joist which supported the front door what a horrible builderhelpfulyesnogreg of woodbury mn on feb  satisfaction ratingwe visited the sales on site location on  and was engaged and told the lot cost was included in the base price of the home by a sales representative on site confirmed two days later by primary principal sales representative cameron as he

about important consumer news new buyers guides and top product recommendationsoops something went wrong mind trying againsubscribe nowjoseph of katy tx on feb  satisfaction ratingmi homes is simply a money hungry low level builder do not purchase a home from mi homes in the houston area we regret ever considering doing business with them we were building with them in the katy area and lost a significant amount of money we went through  months of the building process with them and finally opened our eyes towards the type of company they are and decided to pull out of our contract before we lost more money they have very poor construction management apparently building  to  houses at a time is too much for them to handle they missed many things that we had requested in our initial contract once they had missed those things they refused to go back and make things correct when you request to speak with management be prepared to get the run around and eventually very unprofessional responses be prepared to be your own construction manager and inspect daily because their qaqc is subpar and below a beginner home builder once we decided to cancel our contract because of multiple missed requests and poor quality we were asked to put our complaints in writing their response to our complaints and refund request was a simple no they kept our  deposit and refused to refund any of it their contract is written completely in their favor as is expected i wish i had listened to other reviewers on here they are simply a very bad home builder and should not be trusted with such an important investmenthelpfulyesnoshenat of carmel in on dec  satisfaction ratingdo not buy an mi home you will live to regret i wish i had listened to those who warned about them and i didnt and not only do i regret it every day i am paying a steep price for not listening there are so many other builders to choose from who do far better work please do not make the same mistake i have made my home is defective from the foundation to the roof the stress of the situation combined time off from work this home has cost me so much do yourself a favor do not buy mihelpfulyesnokatrina of grand prairie tx on nov  satisfaction ratingmi homes are beautiful but stay away i fell in love with a mi home but have been very upset since purchasing one biggest issue was a gas leak i have been smelling gas on and off since i moved in the gas company came and the radar began to alarm the minute i opened the front door the pipe under the stove was not connected

that if you are looking for a home builder to avoid mi homes they conduct shady business practices and attempt to bait and switch you once you sign the contract we signed a contract with them to build a house on aug st the division president cliff  signed off on the contract as the authorized agent for mi homes on september st we proceeded to place our current home on the market to sell we were in the process of negotiating with a buyer for our house when we received a call from the sales representative for mi homes on september th  days after signing the contract stating they had made an error in the pricing of our home when writing the contract and the price of the home was actually  more than the agreed upon pricehe told us that he was really sorry for the error and hoped we would agree to still build with mi homes even for  increase in price if not then he understood and they would cancel our contract they took zero responsibility for their own mistake any reputable company would have accepted the error and held their employees responsible not the customer they get out from underneath their mistake with no penalty or consequence from it they preach to you about family and how superior their customer service is and how each step of the way they will be there to ensure customer satisfactioni guess they only care about their customer when they are getting your money they dont care about customers they only care about their bottom dollar the founders of the company would be so disappointed in this as stated on their website they said they always asked themselves if they were the customer building the house would they be satisfied with the outcome what customer would be satisfied about negotiate in good faith only to have the other party negotiating in bad faith and

satisfaction ratingas promised both mi homes and i gave each other second chance and i must say im elated i did the home they built is simply unbelievable it far surpasses a mere shelter the home they built is a haven of beauty and quality its a place i can be proud of that i can happily invite other family members to visit and enjoy with the utmost confidence in quality and craftsmanship moreover my entire experience was awesome the people from my agent to the builder rep to the folks at the style center and even the folks at mi financial bent over backwards to accommodate our concernswhat people have to recognize is there will always be a certain amount of craftsmanship concerns in building a new home but the number of houses built vice the percentage of flaws is usually surprisingly small comparatively but in this day and time where common courtesy and decency is a needed commodity i can honestly say mi homes did just that with me and my family  they wowed us would i go thru the

march  and we closed in september  sheffield square subdivision everyone was great until we signed the contract and things got even worse after we closed there were many things we wanted in our home that we saw in the model home we were told that we could have these items but they were an upgrade which we expected we were ready and willing to pay the upgrade for the items we wanted as they were huge selling factors for us during the design phase we were told one by one that we could not have the upgraded items we had specifically inquired about one was a range hood featured in the model home their reasoning was that the design of the home could not accommodate the hoodwhen we questioned them about the hood in the model after being given several very different excuses we were ultimately told that the hood in the model was not functioning and never would function why didnt they tell us that before we signed the contract when we specifically inquired about the range hood after months of going back  forth we ended up with an ugly illfitting hood with a huge price tag they destroyed the sides of our cabinets when they installed it and refused to fix it the height of the hood is significantly lower than what was specified by ge the manufacturer and mi refuses to fix it even though we were told it would be raised by the time we returned from closing i suppose that was our fault for trusting them and closing before these items were actually fixed there were numerous selections crown moulding various can lights additional outlets upgraded fixtures etc that mi failed to pull through on the final papers and were never installed the original customer care representative who is no longer with the company assured us that these items would be installed within  days of closing it has been over a year and mi is refusing to do anything about it our walls have severely cracked in several places our wood floors are uneven the base boards have noticeably separated from the walls the granite on our island has come loose from the cabinet base our range hood is not secure and about to fall off the wall honestly not sure if that would be a bad thing since it is hideous we lose power in half of our house a couple times a month and were told that it could be a bad power cord from our new tv we moved the tv to another area of the house and it worked fine however the original part of the house still loses power every couple weeks the walkway leading to our front door has cracked in half all of our grass is dead shingles are falling off of our roof on a daily basis the grout in our shower has fallen out a few times now when moving our range to clean behind it we noticed they forgot one wood plank the pendant lights above our island were installed completely uneven they wouldnt fix them so we had to resort to taking the lights down and capping them the list goes on and ona couple of weeks ago they sent a painter out to fix all of our wall cracks perhaps it was his first day but we now have paint on our wood trim everywhere he worked and white paint from the trim on our painted walls we have paint on our railings and on our floors and they told us to chip it off with our nails we were forced to use mi financial for our loan and i say forced because they refused to provide our original lender with documentation he needed and then said they would have to charge us  to get him the documents and then they would have to remove a k option allowance they gave us when we purchased the home we never said we were using mi financial at that time so not sure why we would lose kwe have lived here for just about a year and already have all of these problems we have spoken to a woman in their chicago office who i will not name but she has been nothing but rude to us i have never been treated so horribly by someone who i gave my business to or just any person for that matter to make matters worse we now have huge issues with our taxes which the county told us is a result of mi homes failing to properly divide the pin numbers before closing we submitted all of the correct documentation to divide by legal description after closing all of our neighbors are also having the same problem and mi will not assist them eitherhelpfulyesnogangadhar of des plaines il on aug  satisfaction ratingi visited open house for mi homes there the people are

do not prioritize completion of punch list items in your house it appears as though their only priority is to build as many houses as they can in the shortest amount of time there is little to no oversight of work being done in houses the construction managers are nowhere to be found unless there is a home inspection taking place there is no oversight of workers coming to do repairs in homes after youve closed many of the residents have complained that repair workers are careless and upon repairing one thing they ruin anotherresidents many of whom have infants and young children are not given any notice as to when construction workers are going to complete tasks that will block residents garages residents have been trapped inside for numerous hours by workers mi homes does not employ workers who can construct walls at or near  degree angles once you close the only solution that mi homes has for your crooked walls is to remove the baseboard trim and shim it so that the trim masks

problems selling our current homefearing not being able to move forward we contacted mi homes explained our situation and they refused to refund our k in earnest money so for my k worth of

deal they had going was half off up to  options we met with the agent on sunday morning at the lothome site to make sure it was still available and also to make sure we could build the ainsley plan we were given the green light we went back to the office and wrote a  check and signed paperwork to get the building process started i was told by the agent that he would forward the paperwork to his boss to see if they approve it and get back with me i reached out to the agent on tuesday to see if i was go to go things got really interesting i was told that the price of the lot i was planning to build on had gone up exponentially i was told the developer decided to raise the price of the lot because it was the last decent lot remaining in that area of the community i was told that they wouldnt be able to offer me any incentives on that particular lot i choose to build on it the only problem was that i personally called the developer and was told the price of that particular lot was still the same as before they never increased the price of the loti got an email from mi homes even before my real estate agent confronted about them about the lot asking me where i would like them to mail my check my real estate agent called the mi agent and confronted the individual about their story lets just say there was a dial tone involve from mi agent a few minutes afterwards my real estate agent got a call from the vp of sales for mi he was very rude and arrogant his first words were how dare you bring me a contract like that asking  off my agent tried to tell him that his agent had suggested the  off incentive but he just talked over my agent mr vp also said that the incentives they offered were only valid on lots they owned the irony about that is that every single lot that the agent showed us three other builders showed us the exact same lot as theirs in other words the lots they claim they owned at least the ones we were shown were all pool lots i was just so tired of

buyer for the first town home which seemed impossible to the agentdecember came and my spouse lost his new job  wasnt a good fit but we still thought that he would find something before we had to close in feb  this did not happen early jan  we asked how much we would lose if we could not close i have an illness that i have to have health insurance and with healthcare reform in would be a  shock to our budget crunching the numbers we realized that we would be bankrupt in a few months since there would be no unemployment extension after trying to get an answer we were first told our whole deposit a little over  the contract states the  or the full deposit never in my mind did i think that mi would keep the entire deposit  feeling a  amount will be fair for all contracts i mean why put  if you are just going to keep the entire deposit and you would treat customers differently by the amount of money given they ended up giving us just over  back saying  would be their holding cost we checked the market and places were selling within  days which this was not exception and sold for more money so they made money and they kept our money we did sign a termination agreement but only after them threatening to keep all our money if we didnt sign by noon that day the amount of money we lost was deemed liquidated damages but liquidated damages are not to be a penalty  if it can

is perfect but it has been a frustrating and time consuming experience with a company who says they pride themselves in customer service an appointment was missed for repairs on  and no contractors ever showed causing me to missed a day of work when he did show up on  some of the contractors never showed and some of the issues previously identified were never address such as replacement of insulation in garage utility room leak smelled musty for several months now and coughing when im around that area squeak in subfloor bulge on the side of third level stairs leaking top gutter mirror in rd hall bath never adjusted in addition to minor plainly evident issues which he can make the judgment call to repair for example like a cracked tile getting any other repairs that affect the health comfort example lack of air flow in certain parts of the house water pooling in the deck and aesthetics example center kitchen island with a seam down the middle which was unexpected was difficult to even ask him to bring to the attention of upper management the seam was finally addressed only after everyone in the neighborhood who got surprised with this new seam in their kitchen countertop complained about it they said it was because someone got hurt bringing it up the stairs so they had to cut the granite countertop into two pieces to make it lighter when they come to replace to a full piece they were going to lift it up the stairs again how curious also some of the contractors who needed to follow up for repairs never called even after they told me they would either email or call examples of contractors who never called back even after one week contractor for stair to replace a flight of stairs and contractor for heating and air conditioning to schedule to reinstall a humidistat which was installed incorrectly and finally today for an appointment that was made last week with the subcontractor for the concrete in the garage the contractor informed me that they cannot come today as scheduled to finish off the concrete in the garage causing a waste of another days work in totality the effort to address issues in the house has been and continues to be frustratingi do like the design and layout of the house because the openness of the design makes the interior airy with more natural sunlight and makes the interior look more spacious this type of environment looks inviting to live in and to conduct social events on the other hand there is a design flaw in this house and possibly for houses having a th level with the back exposed to the western sun the fourth level becomes extremely hot which is the entire summer even with all windows and doors shaded and darkened the two small ac vents for the loft which is blowing out minimal air and cannot be adjusted because the house lacks a damper system built into the blower unit our point of contact stated there was nothing he could do about the damper system when it was brought to his attention that it was never installed but when we brought it to the attention of higher personnel they said it was md law to have dampers during the summer temperature on the fourth level would be around  degrees warmer than the temperature in the rd level when the th level is hot some of the advertised square footage cannot be used making it reasonably uninhabitable this is in my opinion a flaw in the design of some of the house that needs an immediate resolution i really tried to love the house but there were problems after problems with this house that at this point i really wonder if i had made the right choice i do understand that every home will have some minor issues but i do not consider a leak a minor issue i had not one not two but three leaks in the house under the kitchen sink in the utility closet and the biggest on the roof then there are other issues all over the house such as water pooling on the deck gutters leaking a neighbors gutter which was built as a continual trespass on my property hardwood floors squeak in almost every single place subfloor squeaks spotty messy and off colored grout jobs unsightly wall bulge in numerous locations stair treads that didnt fit in the grove and slots dented doors bolts catching on the door trim for every door causing black marks on the door frame railing pickets that are loose and some not aligned and tilted squeaks under the carpets only to find out that many parts of the carpet padding were torn then stapled under the carpets paint lines and drips all over the house and i can go on and on it would seem that there is almost no attention to detail during construction and finishing of the house this is not to mention that we hired an inspector to do a predrywall inspection he noted about  things we made sure to come before they said they would put the drywall up and what do you know they already started putting it up as we tried to go through to check to see if they had fixed it they didnt address some of the big issues noted so who knows if they ever fixed anything that was behind the drywall either at that point we figured what was the purpose of getting an inspector if they werent going to do any of the changes anyway in shopping for a house builder i wanted a house with minimal problems and with attention to detail the jd power and associate marketing at the model house convinced me that mi homes since it ranks highest in customer satisfaction and home quality among newhome builders affected my decision to choose mi homes as my builder i feel subsequently that my trust was misplaced and that i was duped by the marketing i have lost my trust in the builder what was once the hope of getting a beautiful and functional home has turned into a nightmare of problems after problems that no one either cares to address or does so reluctantly and halfheartedly we can no longer recommend mi homes to our friends family and coworkers who inquired about the builders in crown gaithersburg we can only say the community is coming along nicelyhelpfulyesnomr of windermere fl on july  satisfaction ratinga few months ago i met marie at the model home of hickory hammock i mentioned my partner and i were looking for a home she said they had nothing for us and we should not go through the model home she said i could go through the home at  if we were interested in as it was under construction there seemed to be an attitude with her that day when i mentioned i had a partneron june   salesperson marie l wrote a contract for us to purchase  from mi homes we did not like marie as she displayed an obvious sense of dishonesty and lack of product knowledge for example we specifically asked her if this quick delivery home had the certificate of occupancy and she said yes at the final walk through of the home we asked the same question of the foreman on site that day who told us that no the certificate of occupancy had not yet been received there were numerous additional circumstances that caused us to distrust marie and we asked salesperson curtis to handle our deal and we did not want to be dealing with someone else who was dishonest at the time we did not realize how vindictive marie was and that she and her boss jeff  would ultimately and unethically sell the house to a previous buyer that was never disclosed to us at the time of the contract signing marie told us in front of our realtor that she lies to jeff  all the time to get her deals to go through the approval process later when we met her again to buy the home we told her we wanted curtis to write the agreement but she insisted it seemed marie decided upfront to discriminate against us when we later overnighted the check marie was in the model home at the time of the delivery we have written proof that marie refused to accept our check from the courier service it is clear she had a different agenda and maliciously worked against us on the purchase of this homecurtis returned from vacation and indeed worked with us we signed the purchase agreement on  and your authorized agent signed it on  we had an executed agreement at this time since we had a cash deal agreement we moved quickly to the closing date on the day of the final walk through we toured the property with the site manager at the very same time we were there a workman was on the front porch with a jackhammer and he was digging up the wall on the front porch it was explained to us that the laundry tub plumbing was not done properly and needed to be repaired this included jack hammering the wall to expose the pipes we were shown that the pipes were not connected and the error needed to be corrected we received a written letter showing that the repair would be completed by july th we discussed this with curtis who said mi homes would work with us and we would not close while this major plumbing problem was causing the house to be ripped apart the pipes were in the center of the cement wallit came time for us to give the check after repairs were made and we presented curtis with a bank check for the amount that was shown on the hud statement of course all the title work was completed and the closing paperwork was all completed and notarized and in the hands of the title company we were shocked to hear what happened next we were told that the keys would not be given to us and that a previous buyer one that had come before us had once again decided to purchase our home we needed to await a decision from the broker jeffso we called and talked with jeff  who yelled at us and used foul language and told us he would do whatever the  he wants to do pardon the language but this is how he yelled at us he had another buyer and he was probably not going to let us buy the house what a horrible and unethical man you have representing your companyat the time of the contract signing we gave a check for  deposit we were told that they would not cash this check since our closing was in such a short time so this was communicated to the title company and the hud was prepared without the deposit being used we have learned that your company indeed cashed the check making an overpayment as well for a house you did not want to sell to uswhen we started hearing the deal was falling apart we had spoken with numerous management people in the mi homes management team david  bruce  and robin the secretary for the ceo we have told many others in your industry about this conversation and we have learned that the broker has quite a reputation for being unprofessional to buyers other builders have said they know that jeff  is trying to drive the mi homes business into the ground we have learned that we are not the first buyers he has turned away with his obscenitieswe understand that you spend considerable funds to attract buyers to your new neighborhood why then would you allow this behavior to exist on the part of your broker and salesperson this bad behavior obviously negates all the advertising dollars mi homes is spending in allowing these unethical practices to occur you now have unhappy people spreading the word to others that mi homes accepts unethical practices as the normal course of business is it a normal course of business for mi homes to treat your customers in this manner why did mi homes sit back and allow this to happen we are in
