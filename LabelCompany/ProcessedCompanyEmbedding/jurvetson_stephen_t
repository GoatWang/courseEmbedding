politics strategy life sports video all × from to you have successfully emailed the post × heres why investor steve jurvetson saved elon musks space dreams julie bort sep    pm  facebook linkedin twitter email print spacex founder elon musk orlando sentinel in  elon musk was dead set on colonizing mars and building electric sports cars and just about broke steve jurvetson was the venture capitalist who saved him on thursday night jurvetson a board member of both spacex and tesla talked about why he invested in musks companies when the entrepreneur was out of money and the rest of the world thought musk was crazy the answer jurvetson wants to fly to the moon jurvetson who is a managing partner at draper fisher jurvetson spoke at the prestigious silicon valley churchill club a local techindustry event series he accepted the clubs game changer award on behalf of spacex  he was boyishly gleeful as he talked about spacex his admiration for musk and the spacex mission oozed during an interview conducted by internet pioneer esther dyson jurvetson dropped several tidbits musks original plan was to colonize mars he started building rockets because he thought it was crazy that rockets were not reusable he had to solve the affordablerocket problem before he could get to mars hes still planning on going to mars spacex lowered the cost of going into space by x the ministers of china say we cant compete on price with that in how many industries have you heard ministries of china say ever say that jurvetson laughs musk thought that it would take  million to get his first trip to mars he was  million in and had spent all of his money between that and tesla and he went into personal debt by  things were looking dismal but musk is the most riskimmune person ive ever met he says hes really an american hero more than anyone ive ever met musk called me around the darkest times he remembers i was a believer all along and just wanted my partners to let me invest in something this cool i really like rockets jurvetson had invested in musks other company tesla motors which was proving electric cars could be green stylish and fast jurvetson is actually the owner of the first tesla model s no  off the production line so will he take a rocket flight absolutely but not the first or second said jurvetson i think thats crazy stuff that line drew a big laugh from the audience jurvetsons dreams are simpler than musks he doesnt want to go all the way to mars just a simple orbit around it he thinks other people will want to do the same because a spacex flight should be affordable putting seven people in orbit should not cost more than flying a commercial jet around earth said jurvetson who argued it should actually cost less go to the moon thats my dream given that spacex was the first commercial entity to ever successfully dock with a space station it seems pretty likely that dream will soon come true dont miss heres the rocket elon musk just sent to the space

and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no
