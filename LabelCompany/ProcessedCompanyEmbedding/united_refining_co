what is a yelper doing reviewing and rating a petroleum refinery well more than being a bunch of foodies were bunch of cyber friends enjoying shared comments opinions and experiences so why not rating a refinery can be tricky since it wouldnt be fair to rate the big verticals the wellhead to gasoline pump types such as an exxon or bp against a small regional only doing around  thousand barrels a
