cross my heart has a significant problem right off its gimmick work against the film the opening scenes establish annette o’toole and martin short’s leads as they prepare for a date each has the help of a second for exposition’s sake though it doesn’t make the exposition particularly natural both actors are appealing both characters are appealing the opening scenes set up the viewer knowing the truth about each character which they plan on hiding from the other hence the title then the date starts and o’toole’s really good she’s often doing these delicate movements while short’s stuck in a lame romantic comedy the more she does them the worse short gets the middle of the film is mostly real time on their date and while his character is believable short’s no longer likable and the film’s gimmick of preparing the viewer in advance backfires it makes o’toole the protagonist which the film isn’t set up to do oddly enough even though the script’s used up all of its goodwill by threequarters through once the actors get to play the characters straight–particularly short like i said o’toole’s always good–everything starts working out the chemistry between the stars is so good it’s too bad director bernstein and cowriter gail parent wasted so much time on the insincerity and using it for joke fodder real nice support from paul reiser in a small role and nice photography from thomas del ruth it’s fine but the actors deserve more ★★½ credits directed by armyan bernstein written by bernstein and gail parent director of photography thomas del ruth edited by mia goldman

barry levinson  october  andrew wickliffe leave a comment i’ve probably seen diner ten times but i still don’t know where to start with it barry levinson sets the present action between christmas and new year’s so one probably could sit down and chart out what happens on each day there’s a big basketball bet driving some of the narrative but mostly just for mickey rourke and ellen barkin but also for kevin bacon and levinson leaves so much of it unresolved–bacon for example–while concentrating for the finish on the things he didn’t pay much attention to throughout the film the film often has this great fifties soundtrack going which masks its quietness even though levinson writes these amazing dialogue exchanges the most telling moments for the cast–even at the beginning levinson and stu linder cut together these amazing sequences from the very start peter sova’s photography helping out a lot of course–isn’t what they’re saying it’s the moments where the characters are silent and thinking all of the acting is outstanding rourke and barkin are the best then steve guttenberg and kevin bacon… then tim daly and daniel stern not because daly and stern are bad but because stern has the least to do daly has a little more but levinson sort of dulls the focus off him as the film progresses the choices levinson makes regarding what characters get attention and when are more of his brilliant ones in diner it’s an exceptional motion picture one appreciates its sublimeness more on each viewing ★★★★ credits written and directed by barry levinson director of photography peter sova

andrew wickliffe leave a comment crazy people is distressingly tepid it has a number of fine performances–dudley moore’s sturdy and likable in the lead daryl hannah’s outstanding as his love interest and the supporting cast’s so good i’m going to wait a while to talk about them to go out on an up note but the film itself very tepid like they threw in curse words to guarantee an r rating when it really could have been pg strangely enough writer mitch markowitz does a great job with the swearing he just doesn’t do enough of it the film concerns an institutionalized ad writer moore it’s more of a retreat really–there’s the kindly doctor an underutilized mercedes ruehl and friendly fellow patients moore recruits these patients to write honest and very funny ads but then markowitz runs out of story sure people only runs ninety minutes but there are long gaps without moore or even his fellow patients instead the picture concentrates on jt walsh’s odious advertising executive not even paul reiser as moore’s friend sticks around for the entire runtime and ruehl gets an unceremonious boot luckily the actors playing the patients are outstanding david paymer’s probably the best but paul bates and danton stone are both good too ben hammer’s fine as the evil doctor–people has a big problem with internal logic an evil doctor doesn’t make a good villain besides an annoying score from cliff eidelman it’s technically proficient the parts are funnier than the final product much funnier ★ credits directed by tony bill written by mitch markowitz director of photography victor j kemper

comment what a difference a cast makes barry levinson’s pilot for a “diner” television series reunites some of the film crew–editor stu linder does a wonderful job–but the only returning actors are paul reiser and jessica james both are good–and alison la placa and mady kaplan are great as the wives levinson’s best writing is for them–but they don’t offset the new leads worst is max cantor in for daniel stern then michael madsen for mickey rourke and finally mike binder for steve guttenberg levinson’s script’s part of the problem he writes cantor and binder’s parts for the original actors binder might’ve with better dialogue madsen’s awful but levinson inexplicably writes the character as a dimwit james spader’s okay in for kevin bacon it’s interesting–especially since it’s a direct sequel to the movie–very well directed and written in parts but the male leads sink it not recommended credits written and directed by barry levinson director of photography dominic palmieri edited by
