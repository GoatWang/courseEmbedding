burd health client login letter from steve burd founder and ceo i formed burd health in september  to help mid to large selfinsured organizations with  plan members to achieve three ambitious outcomes lower corporate healthcare expenses by  to  reduce employee outofpocket expenses improve employee health and fitness we are focused on the selfinsured because selfinsured companies have the freedom to design their own benefit plan… which is critical to achieving extraordinary results the lessons we learned at safeway where i served as ceo for  years – are completely transferrable to every major us company while safeway’s results are remarkable  of the value we bring our clients today result from products and initiatives never deployed at safeway given all the complexity distortion and disconnects in the us healthcare system the opportunity to improve efficiencies lower cost and improve plan member health is extraordinary between  and  us healthcare spending increased  that’s no surprise – our health care system lacks market incentives often ignores personal accountability does not coordinate care and takes more than  years to adopt best standards across all providers while inflation has slowed recently the department of health and human services predicts that healthcare costs will grow by  per year through  that is unacceptable to us… and it is likely unacceptable to you as well at burd health we can reverse the rising tide of healthcare spending for companies and keep more money in the pockets of employees all while improving the overall health of your workforce if we don’t save your company money there are no fees and you pay for none of our expenses we win only when you win      – steve burd httpwwwburdhealthcomwpcontentuploadshealthcareopportunityvmpwhat

diagnosis like that i immediately called our company’s health advocate program i had access to the top doctors learned a tremendous amount of information and got the leading treatment plan and then the transplant surgery i truly got the gift of life thank you for caring about our health and for having programs that really make a difference”  thom b “i called my company’s medical advocate program a few days after my husband was diagnosed with cancer when we had so much information to process at a very emotional time my advocate explained the many medical terms and treatment options specific to jim’s type of cancer over a few months and numerous calls the knowledge i gained was invaluable – it greatly relieved the anxiety a cancer diagnosis brings and focused us on the right treatment plan for jim’s cancer and at the cell level to being cancerfree steve burd understands the importance of employee health and i am grateful for this program”  leslie d “three years ago i was diagnosed with breast cancer the medical advocate service helped me understand the situation and was invaluable in navigating treatment options i have been very impressed with the program and my results thank you steve burd for providing this service i highly recommend it”  chiaching s “the healthy measures program that steve created at my company changed not only the way i managed my own health but also for my entire family we got healthier together saved money and have successfully maintained the positive results year after year i have never felt better – it’s life changing we are a healthier family

board safeway nationality american born  in valley city north dakota education carroll college bs  university of wisconsin ma  family married chris maiden name unknown children two career southern pacific transportation company – marketer arthur d little – management consultant safeway – consultant selfemployed – management consultant stop  shop – consultant fred meyer – consultant safeway  consultant – president – chief executive officer – chairman of the board address safeway  stoneridge mall road pleasanton california  httpwwwsafewaycom ■ steven a burd was an evangelical christian and a tough leader a combination that puzzled his opponents but that put him in the mainstream of a movement that resulted in the election of another evangelical christian george w bush as president of the united states in  burd was one of bushs most prominent supporters in california burds strength and perhaps his bane was his remarkable skill as a micromanager he could increase sales from a store by merely rearranging the shelving on an aisle and he could save his company money by adjusting how plastic bags were ordered railroad to consulting burds father was a railroadyard superintendent and burd was raised primarily in minot north dakota he earned a bs in economics from carroll college in  and in  he earned an ma in economics from the university of wisconsin after which he took a job in marketing with the southern pacific transportation company in  burd joined the industrial management consulting firm of arthur d little in new york city where he earned a reputation for fixing broken companies while at arthur d little he attracted the attention of the management of kohlberg kravis roberts  company a firm that specialized in leveraged buyouts of troubled companies in  burd worked at safeway as a management consultant after kohlberg kravis roberts bought the ailing supermarket chain in  he went into the consulting business for himself while continuing to help safeway with its organizational problems ailing chains in  kohlberg kravis roberts asked him to consult at stop  shop a chain of stores that was losing its customer base burd helped fix the chains problems with product selection which had not kept up with changing consumer tastes in  he went to oregon to help the local supermarket chain fred meyer although burd had no official title and was technically an outsider as the representative of the parent company kohlberg kravis roberts he found he had real muscle behind him when he ordered changes his most significant contribution to the chains recovery was to set up management systems to keep track of operating expenses and how supplies related to sales by the end of  the mismanagement of safeway was legendary with tales of employees driven to suicide and others killed by workrelated stress appearing in newspapers and magazines employee morale was awful amid chronic fears of sudden seemingly arbitrary dismissals and store closings safeways prices were higher than those of its competitors driving away customers and it was losing money rapidly fresh from his twoyear turnaround success at fred meyer burd was asked to consult again at safeway turning safeway around when he returned to safeway burd found a paranoid corporate culture outraged labor unions customers who felt betrayed by a chain that closed profitable local stores and an accounting system that was so neglected that management could not know what was making money and what was not on october   kohlberg kravis roberts forced safeways management to accept burd as its new president it had to have been a tough situation for burd because the man most widely blamed for safeways woes peter magowan remained chief executive officer ceo magowan was supposedly burds superior in the governance of the company but in terms of micromanagement burd had few peers and he soon made his presence felt throughout the company the chain had  stores mostly in the far west of the united states and in canada it had nine regional companies each run independently of the others it took burd years to make the nine divisions partners he began with seemingly simple matters such as the procurement of plastic bags for bagging groceries he found that each of the nine companies had its own individual deals with plasticbag manufacturers seven altogether as he would for procurement in general burd centralized at corporate headquarters in oakland california the ordering of plastic bags by narrowing the suppliers to two which translated into a savings of  million per year burd introduced streamlined systems of cost analysis which also resulted in savings for example store managers reported that instore salad bars were earning  percent margins a big boost for a company that was losing money yet when burd examined the losses due to spoilage and the cost of labor to maintain the salad bars he discovered that they were actually losing money so he had them eliminated for  safeway grossed  billion and its shares sold for about  on april   burd was appointed ceo as well as president of safeway with magowan remaining as chairman of the board but no longer involved with the daytoday operations of the company burd took to visiting individual stores to study layouts products and even the ambient music and lighting he began adjusting each stores produce section to suit the ethnic preferences of the neighborhood adding for example more mangos in predominantly hispanic neighborhoods he was distressed by the amount of produce and other perishables that was spoiling on shelves and pressured store managers to keep their produce fresh he introduced organic produce to safeway reasoning that low prices alone would not make customers loyal and that special highquality products could help cement consumer loyalty burd succeeded at lowering shelf prices to make safeway competitive with other supermarkets the savings that resulted from his management reforms were used to lower prices further remodel stores train employees to give better service and to introduce the safeway select line of premium inhouse products which became very successful at attracting and retaining customers who wanted a brand line they could trust although kohlberg kravis roberts had reintroduced safeway to the stock market in  it still held  percent of the shares and its support helped burds reforms stick by the end of  safeway had achieved a  percent profit margin about the industry standard which at the time was regarded as significant evidence of safeways new efficiency and improved customer service on september   burd was elected to safeways board of directors in  burd began the safeway category optimization process which considered a stores offerings aisle by aisle rather than by product category the idea was to put products on the aisles where customers would expect to find them in  safeway owned  percent of vons a southern california supermarket chain burd forced a buyout of the remaining  percent of shares from a reluctant vons management this expanded safeways holdings to  stores employing  workers customer service improved throughout safeways stores with employees remembering frequent customers by name and escorting customers to the appropriate aisles when they asked about a specific product insistence that employees smile at customers may have backfired when some women employees protested that their smiles elicited unwanted interest from male customers the price per share of safeway stock rose to  burd believed that enabling employees to invest in safeway stock was good for the financial health of both the employee and the company and he believed shares needed to be priced low enough that employees could easily invest in them so in  he had safeway split its shares two for one by  onefourth of safeways employees owned  percent of the companys stock burd developed a program of sending anonymous inspectors into individual safeway stores to check on the service provided to customers safeways privatelabel plants were selling their products to other kohlberg kravis roberts chains increasing the profits realized at each plant safeways sales increased  percent and the chain tried to underprice its competitors on average shelf prices kohlberg kravis roberts lowered its holding of safeway stock to  percent safeway netted  billion in  and burd sought to use the money to acquire new stores believing that by increasing its size safeway would achieve an economy of scale that would allow it to survive the looming challenges of discount chains such as walmart and target expansion on may   burd was elected safeways chairman of the board with magowan remaining only as a director this was burds chance to fully shake loose from his predecessor meanwhile kohlberg kravis roberts brought its holding in safeway down to  percent meaning that burd was largely free of their oversight too by october  safeways shares were selling for  after the split and its financing seemed strong enough for burd to make a daring move in november  safeway bought dominicks finer food of illinois for  billion consisting of cash and an assumed debt of  million dominicks had  stores and was a chain known for its premium products three years earlier the chain had been purchased for  million by yucaipa companies owned by los angeles magnate ron burkle the sale to safeway was a big windfall for him and financial analysts criticized safeway for paying too much dominicks had cost safeway about  million per store compared with  million per store in the  vons deal burd was sure he could turn dominicks into a powerful asset the way he had made safeway into one—by careful attention to details safeway invested  million into improvements at dominicks rearranging store layouts widening aisles and introducing safeways highly successful house brands dominicks employees were paid about  per hour more than those at local rival jewel owned by albertsons making it difficult to compete on shelf price burd cut staffing at dominicks to try to lower expenses the initial results were not good customers were unhappy that comfortable old layouts had been replaced by safeways open configuration and that safeway brands had replaced premium name brands for three consecutive years dominicks income declined and its regional marketshare fell from  percent to  percent to be fair to burd highquality safeway brands had achieved margins as high as  percent in the vons chain as well as at other safeway stores giving reason to expect them to find appreciative buyers in illinois in  safeway purchased randalls food markets of texas to realize quick savings safeway reduced the chains product selection and as at dominicks introduced its house brands to customers unfamiliar with them at both dominicks and randalls understaffing caused long lines at checkout registers angering customers and lowering employee morale burd had long believed that high employee morale would result in better customer service and he believed safeway could excel in customer service making its stores more attractive to shoppers than those of competitors so the decline in morale was to him a serious problem burd believed that a key asset was store location—placing stores where they were most convenient for shoppers thus he was always looking for ideal store locations in may  for example safeway bought six stores in houston from albertsons because they seemed well placed burds aggressive moves to acquire more stores created excitement among investors and journalists and by  rumors were rife about what his next moves would be that year safeways stock peaked at a little over  per share an increase in value of  billion since  the chains sales had doubled since  and the profit margin was  percent a big increase over  in february  safeway bought  stores in arizona from abco foods then purchased the genuardis family markets supermarket chain in pennsylvania for  million genuardis had  stores thereafter genuardis developed a reputation for poorly stocked shelves and poor produce burd viewed safeways advantages as location selection perishables and service but market forces were turning against him in october  united food and commercial workers union ufcw members struck three safeway stores in thunder bay ontario canada burd said that safeway had to contain its labor costs in order to compete with challenges from discount chains and he threatened to close the stores rather than give in in june  after months of negotiations he did just that in  safeway took over  billion in write downs admitting the value of assets had gone down a  million charge on dominicks in april taking a loss in value and a  million charge on dominicks again in november  in november  safeway put dominicks up for sale safeways books valued dominicks at only  million ron burkles yucaipa companies offered safeway  million to buy back dominicks but safeway turned him down burkle said he felt slighted by safeway in august  safeway sued burkle for interfering in negotiations with dominicks union costing safeway a purchaser for the chain because the purchaser could not reach an agreement with the union increases in costs of meat and dairy products further hurt safeways bottom line because in a lowinflation economy it would have a hard time justifying increases in prices to its shoppers meanwhile conditions at genuardis had deteriorated so badly that safeway ran newspaper ads apologizing to customers and asking them to forgive safeway and to try shopping at genuardis stores again for  safeway grossed  billion but it lost  million riding a hurricane events in  almost cost burd his career and safeway its financial strength walmart announced that it would open  supercenters—stores that sold a full line of groceries as well as walmarts other offerings—in california discount chains in general but walmart in particular worried burd and other supermarket leaders because they could significantly underprice traditional supermarkets the biggest advantage for walmart seemed to be in the cost of labor walmart employees were paid on average about  per hour less than safeway employees and received few benefits whereas safeways employees enjoyed some of the best benefits for retail workers anywhere in the country the charge by the federal government in  that walmart employed illegal immigrants who received no benefits only heightened the anxiety walmart caused its competitors burd said that labor costs were a threat to the supermarket industrys survival that high wages and benefits made it impossible for the chains to compete with walmart and target which were nonunion on october   the ufcw went on strike against safeways vons stores in southern california vons had  stores and generated  percent of safeways sales in support of safeway albertsons and ralphs which was owned by kroger company locked out ufcw workers union leaders said they chose to strike only vons because vons would have the toughest negotiators the three supermarket chains made burd their spokesperson mindful of his belief that employee morale translated into customer service burd moved to mitigate some of the hardships of striking vons workers by setting up a fund to aid workers with mortgage bills car payments and other expenses hoping to alleviate the hard feelings that would result from a strike on october   burd said the three supermarket chains had made their final offer to the union declaring that the only changes that could be made to the offer would be to make it less good signonsandiegocom october   burd wanted to cut safeways contributions to health care from  per hour worked to  per hour worked for its part the ufcw feared that safeway could set a precedent that would affect contract negotiations throughout the united states safeways share price fell to  on october   which was still much higher than it had been in  while burd talked publicly about the longterm future of the industry and labor costs he was working on revolutionary changes in how the supermarket industry dealt with vendors for decades supermarket chains charged vendors for shelf space and shelf position that is in order to have its products placed in a good position on stores shelves the vendor would pay the chain in cash in  burd was reworking in his typically meticulous fashion the relationship between safeway and vendors demanding not cash for product placement but price concessions he saw safeways future in buying products for the lowest realmarket value and then passing on the lowered prices to consumers the prices might not beat those of discount chains but they could be low enough that with superior products and service safeway would attract customers away from walmart and its ilk further he started having stores remodeled to be more comfortable for shoppers installing imitation wood floors and softer lighting for example market studies had indicated that shoppers found walmart stores chaotic and anxious burd sought to make safeways stores welcoming and calming for  safeway grossed  billion but lost  million failing to make a profit because it lost  million in the fourth quarter of the year mostly due to lost revenue from its vons stores the west coast leader of the ufcw was sean harrigan a friend whom burkle had helped become president of the california public employees retirement system calpers in march  calpers and the pension funds of new york illinois and connecticut each owning shares in safeway urged fellow shareholders to oppose burd during the may   meeting of shareholders a few financial analysts recommended that their clients vote to oust burd in january  about  demonstrators tried to march to burds home but were stopped by the gates and guards they prayed and called burd evil he was vilified in the press and on web sites for being greedy for costing shareholders  billion in stock value during a decline since  and for abusing the rights of employees the southern california strike was settled in february  in an arbitrated compromise that left workers with wages and benefits higher than in other retail businesses safeways stock value was increasing to over  per share shareholders complained that safeways board of directors lacked independence and profited from doing business with safeway thus the board dismissed three directors burd and two other longtime directors from the s were targeted in the shareholders meeting but each was reelected with over  percent of the vote a proposition to separate the offices of ceo and chairman of the board received only  percent of the vote even so a new position of lead independent director was created to help look after the interests of shareholders see also entry on safeway inc in international directory of company histories  sources for further information barron
