 references  external links biometric tokenizationedit biometric tokenization is a security protocol in which sensitive biometric data required for authentication is encrypted and substituted with a nonsensitive equivalent referred to as a token which is then used for authentication through a symmetric or asymmetric cryptographic channel systems based on biometric tokenization rely on the decentralized storage of biometric data on the clientside of an authentication channel  in users’ connected devices  as opposed to a centralized repository such as a serverside database unlike the use of passwords which are compared against a centralized database of many users’ passwords biometric tokenization allows users to authorize transactions by verifying their unique biometric template on their own local device  which is then used to sign a cryptographic challenge validated on a server rather than exposing sensitive biometric authentication data to the internet user credentials are stored locally and tokenized  preventing malicious rd parties from reusing compromised credentials by combining the user experience of biometric tokenization with the strength of public key cryptography hypr provides a decentralized biometric authentication scheme to replace the use of centralized passwordbased systems the result of implementing biometric tokenization is an “inverted” authentication channel in which hackers are unable to gain credentials by attacking a centralized repository of biometrics and are forced to target individual user devices by forcing malicious attackers to divert attention from a centralized validation server to many clientside devices biometric tokenization decreases the viability of an attack on the clientserver authentication channel rendering the common largescale serverside data breach an unscalable attack vector according to hypr corp hypr technology is designed based on the following principles authentication channels should

proven futile for securing mission critical systems as seen in the recent us office of personnel management breach biometric authentication provides enterprises a solution to the infosec conundrum but developers and endusers are concerned about how customer data is stored to address this dilemma biometricsasaservice provider hypr corp announced today the general availability of its biometric tokenization sdk for third party integration a video overview and demonstration of the hypr sdk is available here httpsyoutubegfjjragi   the hypr sdk enables enterprises to seamlessly implement biometric authentication in any application users may leverage biometric devices such as phones and tablets to authenticate with fingerprint facial or voice recognition it includes mobile and desktop client libraries as well as server side software to enable biometric tokenization unlike other biometric security protocols the hypr platform allows users to authenticate actions without ever transmitting biometric data across the internet rather than storing user data on a centralized server with hypr that data is kept securely offline works with existing infrastructure the hypr sdk is an addon piece of software instead of replacing a companys authentication scheme hypr simply adds biometric authentication compatibility to an existing infrastructure replaces insecure passwords the hypr platform enables companies and their users to leverage modernday biometric sensors on trusted consumer devices to replace passwordbased entry – without having to worry about storing user credentials the biometric tokenization protocol supplied by hypr eliminates the risk of storing biometric data online maximizes security and compliance hypr tokenizes biometric data and marries the convenience of a mobile biometric device with the security of advanced public key cryptography user data never leaves the device but authentication still takes place on the server side enables a bringyourownbiometrics environment hypr is device agnostic and gives enterprise customers full control of how biometric authentication is used by their partners employees and customers a bank might want to only use fingerprint readers on certain devices but not facial recognition for instance george avetisov ceo of hypr corp saidwhen we started building the hypr platform there was one mobile device on the market with a fingerprint reader by the end of  analysts project over a billion biometricenabled devices will be in internet users hands were ensuring that companies are utilizing those biometric devices the right way and that user data is kept safe the hypr sdk is currently in deployment across a number of banks which are implementing biometric security solutions for use cases ranging from internal employee authentication to their consumerfacing mobile apps mobile wallets and even bitcoin platforms also are integrating hypr to prevent payment fraud across their user base
