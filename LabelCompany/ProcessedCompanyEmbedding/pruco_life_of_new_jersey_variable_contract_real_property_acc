parsippany new jersey atlanta georgia chicago illinois and san francisco california a field office or an affiliate of prudential financial supervises the management of properties in all of pim�s accounts proposals to acquire properties for the partnership are usually originated by a field office they are reviewed and approved by the investment management committee of prei depending upon the size of the acquisition and other factors a proposed real estate investment may also be submitted for review to the investment committee of the board of directors of prudential although percentage limitations on the type and location of properties that may be acquired by the partnership have not been established the partnership plans to diversify its investments through the type of property acquired and its geographic location the partnership�s investments will be maintained to meet the internal revenue code diversification requirements see general investment and operating policies in order for the partnership to meet its stated objectives it will have to acquire properties that generate more cash than needed to pay its gross operating expenses to do this a substantial portion of the partnership�s assets will be invested in properties with operating histories that include established rent and expense schedules however the partnership may also acquire recently constructed properties that may be subject to agreements with sellers providing for certain minimum levels of income upon the expiration of or default under these agreements there is no assurance that the partnership will maintain the level of operating income necessary to produce the return it was previously experiencing the partnership may purchase real property from prudential financial or its affiliates under certain conditions see conflicts of interest the property acquired by the partnership is usually real estate which is ready for use accordingly the partnership is not usually subject to the development or construction risks inherent in the purchase of unimproved real estate from time to time however the partnership may invest in a developmental real estate project that is consistent with the partnership�s objectives the partnership will then be subject to those risks the partnership will often own the entire fee interest in an acquired property but it may also hold other direct ownership interests these include but are not limited to partnership interests limited liability company interests leaseholds and tenancies in common property management and leasing services the partnership usually retains a management company operating in the area of a property to perform local property management services a field office or other affiliate of prudential financial will usually  supervise and monitor the performance of the local management company  determine and establish the required accounting information to be supplied  periodically inspect the property  review and approve property operating budgets and  review actual operations to ensure compliance with budgets in addition to daytoday management of the property the local management company will have responsibility for  supervision of any onsite personnel  negotiation of maintenance and service contracts  major repair advice  replacements and capital improvements  the review of market conditions to recommend rent schedule changes and  creation of marketing and advertising programs to obtain and maintain good occupancy rates by responsible tenants the local management company fees will reduce the cash flow from the property to the partnership the partnership usually retains a leasing company to perform leasing services on any property with actual or projected vacancies the leasing company will coordinate with the property management company to provide marketing and leasing services for the property when the property management company is qualified to handle leasing it may also be hired to provide leasing services leasing commissions and expenses will reduce the cash flow from the property to the partnership prei may on behalf of the partnership hire a prudential financial affiliate to perform property management or leasing services the affiliate�s services must be provided on terms competitive with unaffiliated entities performing similar services in the same geographic area see conflicts of interest annually the field office which oversees the management of each property owned by the partnership will together with the local property management firm develop a business plan and budget for each property it will consider among other things the projected rollover of individual leases necessary capital expenditures and any expansion or modification of the use of the property the approval of an officer of prei is required the field office will also periodically report the operating performance of the property to prei investments in mortgage loans types of mortgage loans the partnership is authorized to invest in mortgage loans including conventional mortgage loans that may pay fixed or variable rates of interest and mortgage loans that have a �participation� as defined below the partnership will not make mortgage loans to prudential financial affiliates the partnership intends to give mortgage loans on  commercial properties such as office buildings shopping centers hotels industrial properties and office showrooms  agricultural properties and  residential properties such as garden apartment complexes and highrise apartment buildings these loans are usually secured by properties with incomeproducing potential based on historical or projected data usually they are not personal obligations of the borrower and are not insured or guaranteed ���� first mortgage loans the partnership will primarily make first mortgage loans secured by mortgages on existing incomeproducing property these loans may provide for interestonly payments and a balloon payment at maturity ���� wraparound mortgage loans the partnership also may make wraparound mortgage loans on incomeproducing properties which are already mortgaged to unaffiliated entities a wraparound mortgage loan is a mortgage with a principal amount equal to the outstanding balance of the prior existing mortgage plus the amount to be advanced by the lender under the wraparound mortgage loan thereby providing the property owner with additional funds without disturbing the existing loan the terms of wraparound mortgage loans made by the partnership require the borrower to make all principal and interest payments on the underlying loan to the partnership which will then pay the holder of the prior loan because the existing first mortgage loan is preserved the lien of the wraparound mortgage loan is junior to it the partnership will make wraparound mortgage loans only in states where local applicable foreclosure laws permit a lender in the event of the borrower�s default to obtain possession of the property which secures the loan ���� junior mortgage loans the partnership may also invest in other junior mortgage loans junior mortgage loans will be secured by mortgages which are subordinate to one or more prior liens on the real property they will generally but not in all cases provide for repayment in full prior to the end of the amortization period of the senior mortgages recourse on such loans will include the real property encumbered by the partnership�s mortgage and may also include other collateral or personal guarantees by the borrower the partnership will generally make junior or wraparound mortgage loans only if the senior mortgage when combined with the amount of the partnership�s mortgage loan would not exceed the maximum amount which the partnership would be willing to commit to a first mortgage loan and only under such circumstances and on such property as to which the partnership would otherwise make a first mortgage loan ���� participations the partnership may make mortgage loans which in addition to charging a base rate of interest will include provisions permitting the partnership to participate a �participation� in the economic benefits of the underlying property the partnership would receive a percentage of  the gross or net revenues from the property operations andor  the increase in the property value realized by the borrower such as through sale or refinancing of the property these arrangements may also grant the partnership an option to acquire the property or an undivided interest in the property securing the loan when the partnership negotiates the right to receive additional interest in the form of a percentage of the gross revenues or otherwise the fixed cash return to the partnership from that investment will generally be less than would otherwise be the case it is expected that the partnership will be entitled to percentage participations when the gross or net revenues from the property operations exceed a certain base amount this base amount may be adjusted if real estate taxes or similar charges are increased the form and extent of the additional interest that the partnership receives will vary with each transaction depending on  the equity investment of the owner or developer of the property  other financing or credit obtained by the owner or developer  the fixed base interest rate on the mortgage loan by the partnership  any other security arrangement  the cash flow and pro forma cash flow from the property and  market conditions the partnership intends to use this additional interest as a hedge against inflation it assumes that as prices increase in the economy the rental prices on properties such as shopping centers or office buildings will increase and there should be a corresponding increase in the property value there is no assurance that additional interest or increased property values will be received in that event the partnership will be entitled to receive only the fixed portion of its return standards for mortgage loan investments in making mortgage loans the investment manager will consider relevant real property and financial factors including  the location condition and use of the underlying property  its operating history  its future incomeproducing capacity and  the quality experience and creditworthiness of the unaffiliated borrower before the partnership makes a mortgage loan the investment manager analyzes the fair market value of the underlying real estate in general the amount of each mortgage loan made by the partnership will not exceed when added to the amount of any existing indebtedness  of the estimated or appraised value of the property mortgaged dealing with outstanding loans the partnership may sell its mortgage loans prior to maturity if it is deemed advisable by the investment manager and consistent with the partnership�s investment objectives the investment manager may also  extend the maturity of any mortgage loan made by the partnership  consent to a sale of the property subject to a mortgage loan or finance the purchase of a property by making a new mortgage loan in connection with the sale of a property either with or without requiring the repayment of the mortgage loan  renegotiate the terms of a mortgage loan and  otherwise deal with the mortgage loans of the partnership investments in saleleasebacks a portion of the partnership�s investments may consist of real property saleleaseback transactions �leasebacks� in this type of transaction the partnership will purchase land and incomeproducing improvements on the land and simultaneously lease the land and improvements generally to the seller under a longterm lease leasebacks may be for very long periods and may provide for increasing payments from the lessee under the terms of the leaseback the tenant will operate or provide for the operation of the property and generally be responsible for the payment of all costs including  taxes  mortgage debt service  maintenance and repair of the improvements and  insurance in some cases the partnership may also grant the lessee an option to acquire the land and improvements from the partnership after a period of years the option exercise price would be based on the fair market value of the property as encumbered by the lease the increase in the gross revenues from the property or other objective criteria reflecting the increased value of the property in some leaseback transactions the partnership may only purchase the land under an incomeproducing building and lease the land to the building owner in such cases the partnership may seek in addition to base rents in its leasebacks participations in the gross revenues from the building in a form such as a percentage of the gross revenues of the lessee above a base amount which may be adjusted if real property taxes increase or for other events the partnership may invest in leasebacks which are subordinate to other interests in the land buildings and improvements such as a first mortgage other mortgage or lien in those situations the partnership�s leaseback interest will be subject to greater risks the partnership will only acquire a property for a leaseback transaction if the purchase price is equal to not more than  of the estimated or appraised property value the partnership may dispose of its leasebacks when deemed advisable by the investment manager and consistent with the partnership�s investment objectives general investment and operating policies the partnership does not intend to invest in any direct ownership interests in properties mortgage loans or leasebacks in order to make shortterm profits from their sale although in exceptional cases the investment manager may decide to do so in the best interests of the partnership the partnership may dispose of its investments whenever necessary to meet its cash requirements or when it is deemed to be desirable by the investment manager because of market conditions or otherwise the partnership will reinvest any proceeds from the disposition of assets and any cash flow from operations which are not necessary for the partnership�s operations and which are not withdrawn by the partners in order to make distributions to investors pursuant to the variable contracts issued by the partners or to prudential to return its equity interests pursuant to this prospectus the proceeds will be reinvested in investments consistent with the partnership�s investment objectives and policies in making investments in properties mortgage loans leasebacks or other real estate investments the partnership will rely on the investment manager�s analysis of the investment and will not receive an independent appraisal prior to acquisition the partnership expects however that all the properties it owns and most mortgage loans it holds will be appraised or valued annually by an independent appraiser who is a member of a nationally recognized society of appraisers each appraisal will be maintained in the partnership records for at least five years it should be noted that appraised values are opinions and as such may not represent the true worth or realizable value of the property being appraised the partnership usually purchases properties on an unleveraged basis the properties acquired will typically be free and clear of mortgage debt immediately after their acquisition the partnership may however acquire properties subject to existing mortgage loans in addition the partnership may mortgage or acquire properties partly with the proceeds of purchase money mortgage loans up to  of the property value although this is not usually done the partnership may do so if the investment manager decides that it is consistent with its investment objectives when the partnership mortgages its properties it bears the expense of mortgage payments see borrowing by the partnership the partnership may also invest a portion of its assets in nonparticipating mortgage loans real estate limited partnerships limited liability companies real estate investment trusts and other vehicles whose underlying investment is in real estate the partnership�s investments will be maintained in order to meet the diversification requirements set forth in regulations under the internal revenue code the �code� relating to the investments of variable life insurance and variable annuity separate accounts in order to meet the diversification requirements under the regulations the partnership will meet the following test  no more than  of the assets will be invested in any one investment  no more than  of the assets will be invested in any two investments  no more than  of the assets will be invested in any three investments and  no more than  of the assets will be invested in any four investments all interests in the same real property project are treated as a single investment the partnership must meet the above test within  days of the end of each calendar quarter to comply with the diversification requirements of the state of arizona the partnership will limit additional investments in any one parcel or related parcels to an amount not exceeding  of partnership�s gross assets as of the prior fiscal year end in managing the assets of the partnership the investment manager will use its discretion in determining whether to foreclose on defaulting borrowers or to evict defaulting tenants the investment manager will decide which course of action is in the best interests of the partnership in maintaining the value of the investment property management services are usually required for the partnership�s investments in properties which are owned and operated by the partnership but usually will not be needed for mortgage loans owned by the partnership except for mortgage servicing it is possible however that these services will be necessary or desirable in exercising default remedies under a foreclosure on a mortgage loan the investment manager may engage on behalf of the partnership prudential financial affiliated or unaffiliated entities to provide these additional services to the partnership the investment manager may engage prudential financial affiliates to provide property management property development services loan servicing or other services if and only if the fees paid to an affiliate do not exceed the amount that would be paid to an independent party for similar services rendered in the same geographic area see conflicts of interest the investment manager will manage the partnership so that the real property account will not be subject to registration under the investment company act of  this requires monitoring the proportion of the partnership�s assets to be placed in various investments current real estaterelated investments the current principal real estaterelated investments held by the partnership are described below many of these investments were originated by and previously held in the prudential real property account of pruco life insurance company the �pruco life account� a separate account established to fund the real estate investment option under variable contracts issued by pruco life prior to the formation of the partnership the pruco life account followed the same investment policies as those followed by the partnership pruco life contributed the assets held in the pruco life account to the partnership as its initial capital contribution to the partnership properties the partnership owns the following properties as of december    office properties � the partnership owns office properties in lisle and oakbrook terrace illinois brentwood tennessee and beaverton oregon total square footage owned is approximately  of which  or  square feet are leased between  and  years  apartment complexes � the partnership owns apartment complexes in atlanta georgia raleigh north

allocating a portion of your net premiums or purchase payments or transferring a portion of your contract fund to the real property account these include valuation risks see valuation of contract owners� participating interests certain conflicts of interest see conflicts of interest as well as the following risks liquidity of investments because the real property account will through the partnership invest primarily in real estate its assets will not be as liquid as the investments generally made by separate accounts of life insurance companies funding variable life insurance and variable annuity contracts the partnership will however hold approximately  of its assets in cash and invested in liquid securities the primary purposes for such investments are to meet the expenses involved in the operation of the partnership and to allow it to have sufficient liquid assets to meet any requests for withdrawals from the real property account such withdrawals would be made in order to meet requested or required payments under the contracts the partnership may also borrow funds to meet liquidity needs see borrowing by the partnership we have taken steps to ensure that the partnership will be liquid enough to meet all anticipated withdrawals by the partners to meet the separate accounts� liquidity requirements it is possible that the partnership may need to dispose of a real property or mortgage loan investment promptly in order to meet such withdrawal requests general risks of real property investments by participating in the real property account and thereby in the investment performance of the partnership you will be subject to many of the risks of real property investments these include ���� risks of ownership of real properties the partnership will be subject to the risks inherent in the ownership of real property such as fluctuations in occupancy rates and operating expenses and variations in rental schedules it may be adversely affected by general and local economic conditions the supply of and demand for properties of the type in which the partnership invests zoning laws and real property tax rates operation of property in which the partnership invests will primarily involve rental of that property to tenants the financial failure of a tenant resulting in the termination of their lease might cause a reduction in the cash flow to the partnership if a lease is terminated there is no assurance that the partnership will be able to find a new tenant for the property on terms as favorable to the partnership as those from the prior tenant investments in hotels are subject to additional risk from the daily turnover and fluctuating occupancy rates of hotel rooms and the absence of longterm tenants the partnership�s properties will also be subject to the risk of loss due to certain types of property damage such as from nuclear power plant accidents and wars which are either uninsurable or not economically insurable ���� risks of mortgage loan investments the partnership�s mortgage loan investments will be subject to the risk of default by the borrowers in this event the partnership would have the added responsibility of foreclosing on or pursuing other remedies on the underlying properties to protect the value of its mortgage loans a borrower�s ability to meet its mortgage loan payments will be dependent upon the risks generally inherent to the ownership of real property mortgage loans made by the partnership will generally not be personal obligations of the borrowers the partnership will only rely on the value of the underlying property for its security mechanics� materialmen�s government and other liens may have or obtain priority over the partnership�s security interest in the property in addition the partnership�s mortgage loan investments will be subject to prepayment risks if the terms of the mortgage loans permit mortgagors may prepay the loans thus possibly changing the partnership�s return junior mortgage loans including wraparound mortgage loans will be subject to greater risk than first mortgage loans since they will be subordinate to liens of senior mortgagees in the event a default occurs on a senior mortgage the partnership may be required to make payments or take other actions to cure the default if it has the right to do so in order to prevent foreclosure on the senior mortgage and possible loss of all or portions of the partnership�s investment �due on sale� clauses included in some senior mortgages accelerating the amount due under the senior mortgage in the case of sale of the property may be applied to the sale of the property upon foreclosure by the partnership of its junior mortgage loan the risk of lending on real estate increases as the proportion which the amount of the mortgage loan bears to the fair market value of the real estate increases the partnership usually does not make mortgage loans of over  of the estimated or appraised value of the property that secures the loan there can be no assurance that in the event of a default the partnership will realize an amount equal to the estimated or appraised value of the property on which a mortgage loan was made mortgage loans made by the partnership may be subject to state usury laws these laws impose limits on interest charges and possible penalties for violation of those limits including restitution of excess interest unenforceability of debt and treble damages the partnership does not intend to make mortgage loans at usurious rates of interest uncertainties in determining the legality of interest rates and other borrowing charges under some statutes could result in inadvertent violations in which case the partnership could incur the penalties mentioned above ���� risks with participations the partnership may seek to invest in mortgage loans and leasebacks with participations which will provide the partnership with both fixed interest and additional interest based upon gross revenues sale proceeds andor other variable amounts if the interest income received by the partnership is based in part on a percentage of the gross revenues or sale proceeds of the underlying property the partnership�s income will depend on the success in the leasing of the underlying property the management and operation of such property by the borrower or lessee and upon the market value of the property upon ultimate disposition if the partnership negotiates a mortgage loan with a lower fixed interest rate and an additional percentage of the gross revenues or eventual sale proceeds of the underlying property and the underlying property fails to generate increased revenues or to appreciate the partnership will have foregone a potentially greater fixed return without receiving the benefit of appreciation state laws may limit participations in the event of the borrower�s bankruptcy it is possible that as a result of the partnership�s interest in the gross revenues or sale proceeds a court could treat the partnership as a partner or joint venturer with the borrower and the partnership could lose the priority its security interest would have been given or be liable for the borrower�s debts the partnership will structure its participations to avoid being characterized as a partner or joint venturer with the borrower ���� risks with saleleaseback transactions leaseback transactions typically involve the acquisition of land and improvements thereon and the leaseback of such land and improvements to the seller or another party the value of the land and improvements will depend in large part on the performance and financial stability of the lessee and its tenants if any the tenants� leases may have shorter terms than the leaseback therefore the lessee�s future ability to meet payment obligations to the partnership will depend on its ability to obtain renewals of such leases or new leases upon satisfactory terms and the ability of the tenants to meet their rental payments to the lessee prei investigates the stability and creditworthiness of lessees in all commercial properties it may acquire including leaseback transactions however a lessee in a leaseback transaction may have few if any assets the partnership will therefore rely for its security on the value of the land and improvements when the partnership�s leaseback interest is subordinate to other interests in the land or improvements such as a first mortgage or other lien the partnership�s leaseback will be subject to greater risk a default by a lessee or other premature termination of the leaseback may result in the partnership being unable to recover its investment unless the property is sold or leased on favorable terms the ability of the lessee to meet its obligations under the leaseback and the value of a property may be affected by a number of factors inherent in the ownership of real property which are described above furthermore the longterm nature of a leaseback may in the future result in the partnership receiving lower average annual rentals however this risk may be lessened if the partnership obtains participations in connection with its leasebacks reliance on the partners and the investment manager you do not have a vote in determining the policies of the partnership or the real property account you also have no right or power to take part in the management of the partnership or the real property account the investment manager alone subject to the supervision of the partners will make all decisions with respect to the management of the partnership including the determination as to what properties to acquire subject to the investment policies and restrictions although the partners have the right to replace the investment manager it should be noted that prudential pruco life pruco life of new jersey and the investment manager are whollyowned subsidiaries of prudential financial the partnership will compete in the acquisition of its investments with many other individuals and entities engaged in real estate activities including the investment manager and its affiliates see conflicts of interest there may be intense competition in obtaining properties or mortgages in which the partnership intends to invest competition may result in increased costs of suitable investments since the partnership will continuously look for new investments you will not be able to evaluate the economic merit of many of the investments which may be acquired by the partnership you must depend upon the ability of the investment manager to select investments investment restrictions the partnership has adopted certain restrictions relating to its investment activities these restrictions may be changed if the law permits by the partners pursuant to these restrictions the partnership will not  make any investments not related to real estate other than liquid instruments and securities  engage in underwriting of securities issued by others  invest in securities issued by any investment company  sell securities short  purchase or sell oil gas or other mineral exploration or

state of arizona the partnership will limit additional investments in any one parcel or related parcels to an amount not exceeding  of the partnership�s gross assets as of the prior fiscal year conflicts of interest the investment manager will be subject to various conflicts of interest in managing the partnership pim invests in real estate equities and mortgages for the general account of prudential financial affiliates and for third parties including through separate accounts established for the benefit of qualified pension and profitsharing plans pim also manages or advises in the management of real estate equities and mortgages owned by other persons in addition affiliates of prudential financial are general partners in publicly offered limited partnerships that invest in real estate equities and mortgage loans prudential financial and its affiliates may engage in business activities which will be competitive with the partnership moreover the partnership may purchase properties from prudential financial or its affiliates the conflicts involved in managing the partnership include ���� lack of independent negotiations between the partnership and the investment manager all agreements and arrangements relating to compensation between the partnership and the investment manager pim or any affiliate of prudential financial will not be the result of arm�slength negotiations ���� competition by the partnership with prudential financial�s affiliates for acquisition and disposition of investments prudential financial affiliates are involved in numerous real estate investment activities for their general account their separate accounts and other entities they may involve investment policies comparable to the partnership�s and may compete with the partnership for the acquisition and disposition of investments moreover additional accounts or affiliated entities may be formed in the future with investment objectives similar to those of the partnership in short existing or future real estate investment accounts or entities managed or advised by prudential financial affiliates may have the same management as the partnership and may be in competition with the partnership regarding real property investments mortgage loan investments leasebacks and the management and sale of such investments prudential financial affiliates are not obligated to present to the partnership any particular investment opportunity regardless of whether the opportunity would be suitable for investment by the partnership prudential financial affiliates have however adopted procedures to distinguish between equity investments available for the partnership as opposed to the other programs and entities described above if investment accounts or entities managed by prudential financial affiliates have investment objectives and policies similar to the partnership and are in the market to acquire properties or make investments at the same time as the partnership the following procedures will be followed to resolve any conflict of interest the investment allocation procedure �iap� has been established to provide a reasonable and fair procedure for allocating real estate investments among the several accounts managed by prudential real estate investors �prei� the iap is administered by an allocation committee composed of the managing directors portfolio management allocation decisions are made by vote of the allocation committee and are approved by the chief executive officer of prei �ceo� sufficient information on each investment opportunity is distributed to all portfolio managers who each indicate to the allocation committee their account�s interest in the opportunity based on such expressions of interest the allocation committee allocates the investment opportunity to an account and may also determine a backup account or accounts to receive the allocation in the event the account which is first allocated the opportunity fails to pursue the investment for any reason after giving appropriate consideration to the following factors and with the goal of providing each account a fair allotment of investment opportunities  the investment opportunity�s conformity with an account�s investment criteria and objectives including property type size and location diversification anticipated returns investment structure etc  the amount of funds available for investment in total and by property type by an account  the length of time such funds in total and by property type have been available for investment  any limitations or restrictions upon the availability of funds for investment  the absolute and relative to amount of funds available amount of funds invested and committed for the account  whether funds available for investment are discretionary or nondiscretionary particularly in relation to the timing of the investment opportunity  an account�s prior dealings or investments with the seller developer lender or other counterparty and  other factors which the allocation committee feel should be considered in fairness to all accounts participating in the iap if an account which has been allocated an investment opportunity does not proceed with the acquisition and either i no backup account has been determined by the allocation committee or ii all accounts which were deemed backup accounts do not proceed with the acquisition the opportunity may be reallocated to another account by the allocation committee if an investment opportunity is appropriate for more than one account the allocation committee may subject to the ceo�s approval permit the sharing of the investment among accounts which permit such sharing such division of the investment opportunity may be accomplished by separating properties in a multiproperty investment by coinvestment or otherwise ���� competition with the partnership from affiliates for the time and services of common officers directors and management personnel as noted above pim and prudential financial affiliates are involved in numerous real estate investment activities accordingly many of the personnel of pim and prudential financial affiliates who will be involved in performing services for the partnership have competing demands on their time conflicts of interest may arise with respect to allocating time among such entities and the partnership the directors and officers of prudential financial and affiliates will determine how much time will be devoted to the partnership affairs prudential financial believes it has sufficient personnel to meet its responsibilities to all entities to which it is affiliated ���� competitive properties some properties of affiliates may be competitive with partnership properties among other things the properties could be in competition with the partnership�s properties for prospective tenants ���� lessee position it is possible that prudential financial or its affiliates may be a lessee in one or more of the properties owned by the partnership the terms of such a lease will be competitive with leases with nonaffiliated third parties the partnership limits the amount of space that an affiliate of prudential may rent in a property owned by the partnership ���� use of affiliates to perform additional services for the partnership the partnership may engage prudential financial affiliates to provide additional services to the partnership such as real estate brokerage mortgage servicing property management leasing property development and other real estaterelated services the partnership may utilize the services of such affiliates and pay their fees as long as the fees paid to an affiliate do not exceed the amount that would be paid to an independent party for similar services rendered in the same geographic area ���� joint ventures with affiliates the partnership may enter into investments through joint ventures with prudential financial its affiliates or investment programs they sponsor the partnership may enter into such a joint venture investment with an affiliate only if the following conditions are met  the affiliate must have investment objectives substantially identical to those of the partnership  there must be no duplicative property management fee mortgage servicing fee or other fees  the compensation payable to the sponsor of the affiliate must be no greater than that payable to the partnership�s investment manager  the partnership must have a right of first refusal to buy if such affiliate wishes to sell the property held in the joint venture and  the investment of the partnership and the affiliate in the joint venture must be made on the same terms and conditions although not the same percentage in connection with such an investment both affiliated parties would be required to approve any decision concerning the investment thus an impasse may result in the event the affiliated joint venture partners disagree however in the event of a disagreement regarding a proposed sale or other disposition of the investment the party not desiring to sell would have a right of first refusal to purchase the affiliated joint venture partner�s interest in the investment if this happens it is possible that in the future the joint venture partners would no longer be affiliated in the event of a proposed sale initiated by the joint venture partner the partnership would also have a right of first refusal to purchase the joint venture partner�s interest in the investment the exercise of a right of first refusal would be subject to the partnership�s having the financial resources to effectuate such a purchase if the partnership invests in joint venture partnerships which own properties instead of investing directly in the properties themselves they may be subject to risks not otherwise present these risks include risks associated with the possible bankruptcy of the partnership�s coventurer or such coventurer at any time having economic or business interests or goals which are inconsistent with those of the partnership ���� purchase of real property from prudential financial or affiliates the partnership may acquire properties owned by prudential financial or its affiliates subject to compliance with special conditions designed to minimize the conflicts of interests the partnership may purchase property satisfying the partnership�s investment objectives and policies from an affiliate only if  the applicable insurance regulators approve the partnership�s acquisition of real property from prudential financial or affiliates to the extent such approval is required under applicable insurance regulations  the partnership acquires the property at a price not greater than the appraised value with the appraisal being conducted by a qualified unaffiliated appraiser  a qualified and independent real estate adviser other than the appraiser reviews the proposed acquisition and provides a letter of opinion that the transaction is fair to the partnership and  the affiliate has owned the property at least two years the cost paid by the affiliate is established and any increase in the proposed purchase price over the cost to the affiliate is in the opinion of the independent real estate adviser explicable by material factors including the passage of time that have increased the value of the property the real property account�s unavailability to certain contracts pruco life of new jersey has determined that it is in the best interest of contract owners participating in the real property account to provide the real property account with the flexibility to engage in transactions that may be prohibited if the real property account accepts funds under contracts subject to erisa or the prohibited transaction excise tax provisions of the internal revenue code accordingly owners of pruco life of new jersey contracts that are purchased in connection with  iras  tax deferred annuities subject to section b of the code  other employee benefit plans which are subject to erisa or  prohibited transaction excise tax provisions of the code may not select the real property account as one of the investment options under their contract by not offering the real property account as an investment option under such contracts pruco life of new jersey is able to comply with state insurance law requirements that policy loans be made available to contract owners valuation of contract owners� participating interests a contract owner�s interest in the real property account will initially be the amount they allocated to the real property account thereafter that value will change daily the value of a contract owner�s interest in the real property account at the close of any day is equal to its amount at the close of the preceding day multiplied by the �net investment factor� for that day arising from the real property account�s participation in the partnership plus any additional amounts allocated to the real property account by the contract owner and reduced by any withdrawals by the contract owner from the real property account and by the applicable contract charges recorded in that contract�s subaccount some of the charges will be made  daily  on the contract�s monthly anniversary date  at the end of each contract year and  upon withdrawal or annuitization periodically pruco life of new jersey will withdraw from the real property account an amount equal to the aggregate charges recorded in the subaccounts the �net investment factor� is calculated on each business day by dividing the value of the net assets of the partnership at the end of that day ignoring for this purpose changes resulting from new contributions to or withdrawals from the partnership by the value of the net assets of the partnership at the end of the preceding business day the value of the net assets of the partnership at the end of any business day is equal to the sum of all cash held by the partnership plus the aggregate value of the partnership�s liquid securities and instruments the individual real properties and the other real estaterelated investments owned by the partnership determined in the manner described below and an estimate of the accrued net operating income earned by the partnership from properties and other real estaterelated investments reduced by the liabilities of the partnership including the daily investment management fee and certain other expenses attributable to the operation of the partnership see charges the partnership may invest in various liquid securities and instruments these investments will generally be carried at their market value as determine by a valuation method which the partners deem appropriate for the particular type of liquid security or instrument the value of the individual real properties and other real estaterelated investments including mortgages acquired by the partnership will be determined as follows each property or other real estaterelated investment acquired by the partnership will initially be valued at its purchase price in acquiring a property or other real estaterelated investment pim will not obtain an independent appraisal but will instead rely on its own analysis of the investment�s fair market value thereafter all properties and most real estaterelated investments will ordinarily be appraised by an independent appraiser at least annually at least every three months pim will review each property or other real estaterelated investments and adjust its valuation if it concludes there has been a change in the value of the property or other real estaterelated investment since the last valuation the revised value will remain in effect and will be used in each day�s calculation of the value of the partnership�s assets until the next review or appraisal it should be noted that appraisals are only estimates and do not necessarily reflect the realizable value of an investment the estimated amount of the net operating income of the partnership from properties and other real estaterelated investments will be based on estimates of revenues and expenses for each property and other real estaterelated investments annually pim will prepare a monthbymonth estimate of the revenues and expenses �estimated net operating income� for each property and other real estaterelated investments owned by the partnership each day pim will add to the value of the assets as determined above a proportionate part of the estimated net operating income for the month in effect pim will establish a daily accrued receivable of the estimated net operating income from each property and other real estaterelated investments owned by the partnership the �daily accrued receivable� on a monthly basis the partnership will receive a report of actual operating results for each property and other real estaterelated investments �actual net operating income� such actual net operating income will be recognized on the books of the partnership and the amount of the thenoutstanding daily accrued receivable will be correspondingly adjusted in addition as cash from a property or other real estaterelated investment is actually received by the partnership receivables and other accounts will be appropriately adjusted periodically but at least every three months pim will review its prospective estimates of net operating income in light of actual experience and make an adjustment to such estimates if circumstances indicate that such an adjustment is warranted pim follows this practice of accruing estimated net operating income from properties and other real estaterelated investments because net operating income from such investments is generally received on an intermittent rather than daily basis and the partners believe it is more equitable to participating contract owners if such net operating income is estimated and a proportionate amount is recognized daily because the daily accrual of estimated net operating income is based on estimates that may not turn out to reflect actual revenue and expenses contract owners will bear the risk that this practice will result in the undervaluing or overvaluing of the partnership�s assets pim may adjust the value of any asset held by the partnership based on events that have increased or decreased the realizable value of a property or other real estaterelated investment for example adjustments may be made for events indicating an impairment of a borrower�s or a lessee�s ability to pay any amounts due or events which affect the property values of the surrounding area there can be no assurance that the factors for which an adjustment may be made will immediately come to the attention of pim additionally because the evaluation of such factors may be subjective there can be no assurance that such adjustments will be timely made in all cases where the value of the partnership�s investments may be affected all adjustments made to the valuation of the partnership�s investments including adjustments to estimated net operating income the daily accrued receivable and adjustments to the valuation of properties and other real estaterelated investments will be on a prospective basis only the above method of valuation of the partnership�s assets may be changed without the consent of contract owners should the partners determine that another method would more accurately reflect the value of the partnership�s investments changes in the method of valuation could result in a change in the contract fund values which may have either an adverse or beneficial effect on contract owners information concerning any material change in the valuation method will be given to all contract owners in the annual report of the operations of the real property account although the abovedescribed valuation methods have been adopted because the partners believe they will provide a reasonable way to determine the fair market value of the partnership�s investments there may well be variations between the amount realizable upon disposition and the partnership�s valuation of such assets contract owners may be either favorably or adversely affected if the valuation method results in either overvaluing or undervaluing the partnership�s investments if a contract owner invests in the real property account at a time in which the partnership�s investments are overvalued the contract owner will be credited with less of an interest than if the value had been correctly stated a contract owner withdrawing from the real property account during such time will receive more than he or she would if the value had been correctly stated to the detriment of other contract owners the converse situation will exist if the partnership�s assets are undervalued borrowing by the partnership the partnership may borrow for partnership purposes including to meet its liquidity requirements and the leveraging of currentlyowned property to buy new property subject to a maximum debt to value ratio of  pursuant to california state requirements based on the aggregate value of all partnership assets the partnership will bear the cost of all such borrowings the real property account and contract owners participating in it will bear a portion of any borrowing costs equal to their percentage interest in the partnership moreover although the partnership will generally make unleveraged investments it reserves the right to borrow up to  of the value of a property with the value of a property determined as explained under valuation of contract owners� participating interests increasing the partnership�s assets through leveraged investments would increase the compensation paid to pim since its investment management fee is a percentage of the partnership�s gross assets any borrowing by the partnership would increase the partnership�s risk of loss it could also inhibit the partnership from achieving its investment objectives because the partnership�s payments on any loans would have to be made regardless of the profitability of its investments charges pursuant to the investment management agreement the partnership pays a daily investment management fee which is equal to an effective annual rate of  of the average daily gross assets of the partnership certain other expenses and charges attributable to the operation of the partnership are also charged against the partnership in acquiring an investment the partnership may incur various types of expenses paid to third parties including but not limited to brokerage fees attorneys� fees architects� fees engineers� fees and accounting fees after acquisition of an investment the partnership will incur recurring expenses for the preparation of annual reports periodic appraisal costs mortgage servicing fees annual audit charges accounting and legal fees and various administrative expenses these expenses will be charged against the partnership�s assets some of these operating expenses represent reimbursement of the manager for the cost of providing certain services necessary to the operation of the partnership such as daily accounting services preparation of annual reports and various administrative services the investment manager charges the partnership mortgage loan servicing fees pursuant to the standards outlined in item  under conflicts of interest in addition to the various expenses charged against the partnership�s assets other expenses such as insurance costs taxes and property management fees will ordinarily be deducted from rental income thereby reducing the gross income of the partnership as explained earlier charges to the contracts will be recorded in the corresponding subaccounts of the real property account from time to time pruco life of new jersey will withdraw from the real property account an amount equal to the aggregate amount of these charges aside from the charges to the contracts pruco life of new jersey does not charge the real property account for the expenses involved in the real property account�s operation the real property account will however bear its proportionate share of

withdrawing a portion of its interest in the partnership the partnership will normally obtain funds to meet such a withdrawal request from its net operating income and from the liquid securities and

to increases in operating costs resulting from inflation critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment management on an ongoing basis reviews critical estimates and assumptions if management determines as a result of its consideration of facts and circumstances that modifications in assumptions and estimates are appropriate results of operations and financial position as reported in the consolidated financial statements may change significantly actual results could differ from those estimates the following sections discuss critical accounting policies applied in preparing our consolidated financial statements that are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions valuation of investments real estate investments � the partnership�s investments in real estate are initially carried at their purchase price subsequently real estate investments are reported at their estimated market values based upon appraisal reports prepared by independent real estate appraisers members of the appraisal institute or an equivalent organization within a reasonable amount of time following acquisition of the real estate and no less frequently than annually thereafter with independent updates quarterly the chief real estate appraiser of prudential investment management �pim� is responsible to assure that the valuation process provides objective and reasonable market value estimates the purpose of an appraisal is to estimate the market value of real estate as of a specific date market value has been defined as the most probable price for which the appraised real estate will sell in a competitive market under all conditions requisite for a fair sale with the buyer and seller each acting prudently knowledgeably and for self interest and assuming that neither is under undue duress unconsolidated real estate partnerships are valued at the partnership�s equity in net assets as reflected in the partnership�s financial statements with properties valued as described above mortgage and other loans receivable which are accounted for as loans are independently valued according to the same appraisal process as other investments in real estate other real estate investments include notes receivable which are valued at the amount due and approximate market value as described above the estimated market value of real estate and real estate related assets is determined through an appraisal process except for other real estate investments which are determined as stated above these estimated market values may vary significantly from
