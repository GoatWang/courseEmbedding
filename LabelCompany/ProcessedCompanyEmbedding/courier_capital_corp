leading venture capitalists the big question what do investors want here balderton capital’s anna boffetta talks about the product itself venture capital is a shoe leather industry vcs rack up a lot of miles due to the sheer volume of fascinating entrepreneurs and great businesses we meet the job requires a wellrefined system to appraise what a good company looks like as far as prospective products and services go you can divide them into three major categories core technologies transactions and subscriptions and networks and communities  core technology this is problem solving in a fundamentally new way and based around the strength of the technology alone these companies are not always focused on a specific industry and the founders are usually extremely smart technologists often phds deep mind and magic pony are great examples of this type of company i look at the underlying technology its uniqueness its efficiencies and how it could be applied within a particular industry or to improve the success of a specific task the commercial application comes next  transactions and subscriptions the vast majority of tech startups fall under this category the stats do the talking for these companies i look for product or market fit traction and scalability user data is crucial here conversion retention and churn revenues and opportunities for product upselling and crossselling i like to see that companies are getting bigger and that they are intelligently improving the product and driving revenue even on a monthly basis examples of companies in this category are airbnb transferwise slack and yoox netaporter  network or community the value for these products lies in the users most of them are mobile first and laserfocused on a particular industry web curation social networks transportation apps information services i look at cohorts how downloads or visits can be converted into users – specifically at how many return monthly weekly and daily i also look at churn after one three six and  months and i want to understand how the company acquired its users through organic growth or paid channels this process helps me understand why people will use this product and the value of the data that’s generated by these users user data can shape the monetisation opportunities too examples include facebook whatsapp clue and citymapper common characteristics of great products  there are also some general areas we analyse i believe user experience reveals a lot about the culture of the company its soul in addition we appraise how the company differs from competitors and the sustainability of the product over time the main thing to remember is that a ‘product’ involves more than just a product team product is the net result of the whole team’s effort for your product or service to really click with the market it has to click within the company first anna boffetta is an associate at balderton capital this story is taken
