capitalization of the stocks owned and the horizontal axis shows investment style value blend or growth for fixedincome funds the vertical axis shows the credit quality of the bonds owned and the horizontal axis shows interest rate sensitivity as measured by a bonds effective duration morningstar seeks credit rating information from fund companies on a periodic basis eg quarterly in compiling credit rating information morningstar instructs fund companies to only use ratings that have been assigned by the following nationally recognized statistical rating organizations nrsros moodys standard  poors fitch and eganjones if two nrsros have rated a security fund companies are to report the lowest rating if three or more nrsros have rated the same security differently fund companies are to report the rating that is in the middle for example if nrsro x rates a security aa nrsro y rates the same security an a and nrsro z rates it a bbb the fund company should use the credit rating of a in its reporting to morningstar please note morningstar inc is not itself an nrsro nor does it issue a credit rating on the fund an nrsro rating on a fixedincome security can change from timetotime for credit quality morningstar combines the credit rating information provided by the fund companies with an average default rate calculation to come up with a weightedaverage credit quality the weightedaverage credit quality is currently a letter that roughly corresponds to the scale used by a leading nrsro bond funds are assigned a style box placement of low medium or high based on their average credit quality funds with a low credit quality are those whose weightedaverage credit quality is determined to be less than bbb medium are those less than aa but greater or equal to bbb and high are those with a weightedaverage credit quality of aa or higher when classifying a bond portfolio morningstar first maps the nrsro credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates as determined by morningstars analysis of actual historical default rates morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average default rate for the entire bond fund finally morningstar maps this average default rate to its corresponding credit rating along a convex curve for interestrate sensitivity morningstar obtains from fund companies the average effective duration generally morningstar classifies a fixedincome funds interestrate sensitivity based on the effective duration of the morningstar core bond index mcbi which is currently three years the classification of limited will be assigned to those funds whose average effective duration is between  to  of mcbis average effective duration funds whose average effective duration is between  to  of the mcbi will be classified as moderate and those that are at  or greater of the average effective duration of the mcbi will be classified as extensive for municipal bond funds morningstar also obtains from fund companies the average effective duration in these cases static breakpoints are utilized these breakpoints are as follows i limited  years or less ii moderate more than  years but less than  years and iii extensive more than  years in addition for nonus taxable and nonus domiciled fixed income funds static duration breakpoints are used i limited less than or equal to  years ii moderate greater than  and less than equal to  years iii extensive greater than  years unsubsidized yields reflect what the yield would have been without the effect of reimbursements and waivers the adviser and its affiliates have or may voluntarily waive a portion of their fees including but not limited to distribution and service b fees and reimburse certain expenses there is no guarantee that the fund will avoid a negative yield such undertaking may be amended or withdrawn at any time month trailing distribution yield at nav refers to the month historical cash flow paid over the past

expected performance given its level of risk as measured by beta beta reflects the sensitivity of the funds return to fluctuations in the market index rsquared indicates how much of a funds fluctuations were attributable to movements in the funds benchmark standard deviation is a measure of how volatile a funds returns are sharpe ratio is a measure of a funds riskadjusted performance capture ratio reflects the annualized product of fund vs index returns for all months in which the index had a positive return upside capture or negative return downside capture the morningstar rating™ for funds or star rating is calculated for managed products including mutual funds variable annuity and variable life subaccounts exchangetraded funds closedend funds and separate accounts with at least a threeyear history exchangetraded funds and openended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes it is calculated based on a morningstar riskadjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a managed products monthly excess performance placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance and does not include the effects of sales charges the top  of products in each product category receive  stars the next  receive  stars the next  receive  stars the next  receive  stars and the bottom  receive  star the overall morningstar rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three five and year if applicable morningstar rating metrics the weights are  threeyear rating for  months of total returns  fiveyear rating threeyear rating for  months of total returns and  year rating fiveyear rating threeyear rating for  or more months of total returns while the year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the year period the most recent threeyear period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all

generally subject to higher risk and volatility please note that lower minimum tax rates on capital gains and dividends would make the investment return for the taxable investment more favorable and
