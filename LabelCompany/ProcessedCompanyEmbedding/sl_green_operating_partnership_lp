should be read in conjunction with the financial statements appearing in item  of this annual report on form k the new york city commercial real estate market continued to strengthen in  and we took advantage of this strengthening market in improving occupancies and deploying capital in the borough of manhattan to strategically position the company for future growth leasing and operating we have historically outperformed the manhattan office market and did so again in  our manhattan office property occupancy on samestore properties based on leases signed increased to  from  in the prior year during  we signed office leases in manhattan encompassing  million square feet of which  million square feet represented office leases that replaced previously occupied space our marktomarket on these  million square feet of signed manhattan office leases that replaced previously occupied space was  for  the highlight of our leasing activity during  was the signing of an agreement extending

manhattan office inventory currently under construction and scheduled to be placed in service by  or early  demand for space in certain submarkets such as midtown south and a lack of new supply created conditions in which asking rents for direct space in midtown south increased during  by  to  per square foot asking rents for direct space in midtown increased during  by  to  per square foot and have increased by  since the recessionary trough in in the first quarter of  over the same period net effective rents which take into consideration leasing concessions have increased by  acquisition and disposition activity sales volume in manhattan in  increased  to  billion compared to  billion in  partly as a result of a flurry of activity in the fourth quarter nevertheless consistent with our multifaceted approach to property acquisitions we were able to source transactions that provide value enhancement opportunities including the acquisition of equity interests in six office retail and multifamily properties during  representing total investments of  billion we also took advantage of the improving market conditions and interest by institutions and individuals seeking ownership interests in properties to sell assets disposing of properties with more limited growth opportunities and raising efficiently priced capital for reinvestment during the year we sold our fee interest in  west th street new york new york  main street stamford connecticut and  west th street new york new york  debt and preferred equity beginning in  we saw an increase in opportunities to acquire existing debt and preferred equity positions in high quality manhattan office properties at discounts that enabled us to generate high risk adjusted yields and offer offmarket access to property acquisitions as  progressed and the availability of acquiring discounted debt and preferred equity in high quality properties waned we began to focus on the origination of financings typically in the form of preferred equity and mezzanine table of contents debt for owners or acquirers seeking higher leverage than was available from traditional lending sources lending at modest leverage levels traditional sources of junior financings have not yet materialized this provided us with an opportunity to fill a need for additional debt by providing more modest amounts of leverage the typical investments made by us during  were to reputable owners or acquirers and at leverage levels which are senior to sizable equity investments by the sponsors during  our debt and preferred equity activities included purchases and originations inclusive of accretion of reserves previous discounts and payinkind interest of approximately  million and sales redemption and

values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements investment in commercial real estate properties on a periodic basis we assess whether there are any indications that the value of our real estate properties may be impaired or that their carrying value may not be recoverable a propertys value is considered impaired if managements estimate of the aggregate future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges for consolidated properties to be generated by the property is less than the carrying value of the property to the extent impairment has occurred the loss will be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the calculated fair value of the property we do not believe that the values of any of our consolidated properties were impaired at december   we also evaluate our real estate properties for potential impairment when a real estate property has been classified as held for sale real estate assets held for sale are valued at the lower of their carrying value or fair value less costs to sell in june  we recorded a  million impairment charge in

costs of land and building under development include specifically identifiable costs the capitalized costs include but are not limited to preconstruction costs essential to the development of the property development costs construction costs interest costs real estate taxes salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development we consider a construction project
