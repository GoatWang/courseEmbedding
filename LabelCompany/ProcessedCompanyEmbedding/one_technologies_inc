company already has orders for  of its  productionin its first year of public operation patriot one technologies inc otcqbptotf tsxvpat frapl has won a major award for its new weapons scanning system as well as signed agreements with important distributors and moved closer to being able to provide a steady supply of a commercial product although it has only been trading since last november patriot one has made impressive progress it won on wednesday april th the first place in the antiterrorismforce protection category in the new product showcase nps component of the isc west industry trade show and conference in las vegas nv the premier platform for security professionals to evaluate new products and technologies for use in security applications the security screening equipment that is now in use at airports uses millimeter wave technology that is big slow and expensive people and packages must pass through special frames in which they are scanned for concealed weapons this method also raises serious privacy questions the patriot one system uses microwave technology that is small fast and cheap it can screen objects in real time as they move along and is not disruptive of normal innocent traffic the new system focuses on suspicious items raising no privacy issues the patriot one system is an integrated hardware and software solution that immediately identifies objects of interest being carried in a single scan it then makes a determination if they are a threat by comparing the new discovery to its constantly updated database of known threats in this way it can distinguish a smartphone from a knife or a gun there are no privacy issues since it only zeroes in on the object it finds to highlight the various components of the system the company calls its breakthrough cognitive microwave radar cmr technology the basic package to be deployed is a small box that can be easily concealed to a screen passing people without intruding on their progress if it identifies a threat the information is transmitted through preestablished channels to security personnel andor automatic machinery for an appropriate response the technology has the potential for very widespread use i recall that somewhere it wrote that the company would charge  for an installation plus a modest monthly fee to cover the ongoing and updated database the company has not released any sort of estimates or projections for sales but it has enormous potential among potential locations that are candidates for the use of this technology the company has identified  public schools in the usa alone each school  entrances  federal buildings in us alone  us embassiesconsulates globally  canadian government offices in  countries cinemas  in the us alone the top  chains represent  indoor screens in  sites and  drivein screens in  sites  and also over  stadiums with cap over  just in north america alone each with multiple entrances it is also cheap and flexible enough to be used on public transportation including  public school buses in the us alone each bus has two doors  subway stations in london alone  us passenger transit stations nationwide and  airports in  countries and territories the company is following a lowcapital business model maintaining patents and an engineering staff but outsourcing the manufacture of the products itself in a message at the beginning of may summarizing q and talking about plans for the future president dinesh kandanchatha said that the central aim of the company is to deliver products in q  a month later the company said that it had m in signed agreements from around the world the president also noted that in field trials the system successfully and consistently detected concealed weapons with zero false negatives and a false positive rate of less than  per cent what this means is that it detected all weapons no false negatives but it flagged a few nonweapons as threats less than five percent false positives this performance can be expected to improve with more experience but in any case it is an erronthesideofcaution type of performance presumably these would be checked out by the security staff and should not be a problem what is still lacking is fcc and industry canada certification at that time the president wrote that the company hoped to submit for certification before the end of q if everything is on target the certification submission is already in but if not submission is probably imminent the president wrote that the companys internal testing indicated that its production system can meet or exceed all the requirements for both fcc and industry canada certification while meeting our commitment to maintain the highest possible standard of efficacy the company hopes to have certification by the end of the summer it has already had requests from some customers for them to apply for special waivers that are possible under certification exemption guidelines the companys chief science advisor is dr natalia k nikolova who is a professor of electrical engineering at mcmaster university and a canada research chair in highfrequency electromagnetics she began the research in  under the sponsorship of defense research and development canada drdc drdc sponsored a project that involved professors from four canadian universities  royal military college queens university mcmaster university and the university of toronto  and one us university  pennsylvania state university  to carry out preliminary feasibility studies in an interview in the companys newsletter she said that investors contacted mcmaster university in december  and proceeded toward commercialization activities immediately after a partnership was formed patriot one was established as a startup company for the sole purpose of bringing this solution to market the company has signed agreements with resellers in canada the us the uk and south africa it recently signed an agreement with a relatively large reseller in new zealand aotea security did anyone say dilution so far the price of the stock has hovered around us plus or minus no one has missed anything by not buying up until now on the other hand the companys lowcapital business model plus the forecast first sales already in q suggests that there will not be massive dilution before sales start rolling in furthermore the company did raise funds in the middle of june and the amount was relatively modest for a total of  million canadian it has not yet had any meaningful business operations so its financial statements so far are of no interest the company still seems to be largely under the radar of investors and there is a possibility of an explosive rise in the stock price once word gets out there is no way to know when this will be the potential is certainly very great but the company is still in startup mode and you should not invest any money that you cannot afford to lose disclosure i amwe are long ptotf i wrote this article

costeffective system that is being developed for commercial application in public locations within a realistically short timeframe current technology fails for many reasons smart detection gets small and practical radar technology on a chip advances in radar technology leads to weapons detection adaptation semiconductor technology now routinely allows microwave circuits to be packaged into integrated circuits ic microwave radars have been in military service for years but not widely deployed in commercial or consumer applications because of expense until now a variety of applications have arisen such as liquidlevel measurement motion detection door openers intrusion alarms and police speed meters effectiveness the most widespread use of both microwave and millimeterwave radar is automotive safety devices including adaptive cruise control automatic braking collision warning blind spot detection lane departure warning and backup object detection while not the same as patscan™
