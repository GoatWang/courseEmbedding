semiconductor corporation as incorrectly transmitted by pr newswire cypressfirst sends letter to cypress semiconductor stockholders cypress should not tolerate an overcompensated and conflicted executive chairman urges stockholders to protect and enhance stock value by voting the gold proxy card at the annual meeting for the election of dan mccranie and camillo martino san jose calif may   prnewswire  camillo martino and j daniel mccranie nominees for election to the cypress semiconductor corporation nasdaq cy cypress or the company board of directors at the  annual meeting of stockholder scheduled to be held on june   and tj rodgers founder and former ceo of cypress and the companys largest individual stockholder collectively cypressfirst today issued the following open letter to cypress stockholders regarding the upcoming election of directors the full text of the letter is reprinted below the cypressfirst letter urging cypress semiconductor stockholders to vote the gold proxy card for the election of dan mccranie and camillo martino can be found at wwwcypressfirstcom or on the website of the securities and exchange commission wwwsecgov                                                      may   this election contest is about ethics good governance and doing whats right for cypress—and its stockholders dear fellow cypress stockholder only a few weeks remain before the cypress annual meeting of stockholders on june  at which you will have the choice to replace ray bingham the executive chairman and eric benhamou the lead director with two betterqualified directors both of whom are semiconductor veterans having held between them three ceo positions and  directorships the purpose of this letter is to step back from the fray of the election and examine a few simple facts that show why the cypress board needs change cypress and its stockholders deserve better than bingham and benhamou cypress should not be forced to compete with its own executive chairman who has received a compensation package from cypress worth  million in cash and stock and also stands to make millions more by working for canyon bridge a private equity firm funded by the chinese government which focuses on acquiring semiconductor companies—in direct competition with cypress cypress also deserves a lead director who holds the board accountable to the companys clear ethical standards and benhamou has failed his duties in this regard cypress stockholders have the power to rectify these problems of excess compensation and conflict of interest by voting the gold proxy for dan mccranie and camillo martino to replace ray bingham and eric benhamou we fully support ceo hassane elkhoury and his management team—they are not the problem but we do believe that cypress and its stockholders urgently need two new directors who have strong ethical principles and extensive governance experience—directors who will follow rather than evade cypresss ethical standards as stated in the companys code of business conduct and ethics  as new directors dan mccranie and camillo martino would work diligently and creatively—without millions of dollars in excessive compensation—to assist management not only in bringing better governance to cypress but also in solving its chronic problem of low gross margin ray bingham whom we are seeking to replace took control of cypress on april   and thus has been the top executive of the company for over a year without making any progress on improving gross margin indeed in the most recent quarter gross margin declined by nearly  to   better results are promised by the end of  and in —but without substantial gross margin improvement cypress will not be able to pay down its debt increase its dividend or improve its bottom line and thus share price  which directors do you believe can better help ceo elkhoury and the management team in addressing low gross margin dan mccranie and camillo martino both of whom have semiconductor operational experience—or ray bingham and eric benhamou neither of whom has any prior semiconductor operational experience cypress should not tolerate an executive chairman who serves two masters the cypress boards latest strident attack letter is an attempt to divert your attention from the critical bingham conflict of interest and overcompensation issues with irrelevant attacks on our motives we focus here on the issues themselves there are two simple and undeniable facts related to binghams conflict of interest problem cypress and canyon bridge compete for potential ma candidates every day bingham cannot simultaneously serve two masters who have the same objectives this conflict of interest problem will fester until he decides—or the stockholders decide for him—which of his competing jobs he will leave despite the boards diversionary claims the ongoing conflict of interest problem has never been about the lattice semiconductor acquisition by canyon bridge rather it has always been about the direct headtohead competition between canyon bridge and cypress to find and acquire semiconductor companies this is an untenable situation with ray bingham on both sides of the fence how can cypress stockholders be properly served by an executive chairman who upon learning of a new ma opportunity must decide which of his two masters to serve ray bingham eric benhamou and the cypress board have resisted all of our efforts to learn about and disclose to stockholders the true story of binghams involvement with canyon bridge they continue to misrepresent and omit facts in their communications to stockholders despite rulings by the delaware chancery court that forced them to turn over relevant documents they are still fighting us—document by document—to prevent you from receiving that relevant information what have they got to hide if cypress has effective conflict of interest policies at every level as the board claims why do they continue to fight at your expense in the delaware court the fact that ray binghams two employers compete with each other and have glaring conflicts on opportunities is as plain as day for all to see—except for bingham benhamou and the board another diversionary tactic used by the cypress board is to insist that canyon bridge is not a cypress competitor by claiming that there was no conflict of interest because cypress did not attempt to buy lattice after the companys latest discussions in  the fact that both cypress and canyon bridge were at times interested in acquiring the same company simply illustrates that a structural conflict of interest exists  what acquisition opportunities does ray bingham know about—right now—that he has not passed on to cypress  if there are any he would be in violation of one of his fiduciary duties as a cypress director consider the following facts canyon bridge states in an sec filing that it focuses on acquiring interests in companies in the technology sector specifically companies in the semiconductor industry cypress has acquired  semiconductor companies—about one per year over its history  furthermore well over  of cypresss revenue today comes from acquired businesses cypresss recent successes proudly touted as part of cypress  are heavily dependent on prior acquisitions where would cypress be today if its ma efforts had not been successful in these three critical market segments automotive fujitsu and spansion acquisitions communications broadcoms iot group acquisition and usb typec three usb acquisitions lead director benhamou must share the blame as lead director mr benhamou has a duty not to turn a blind eye on this conflict of interest problem but rather to enforce within the board the cypress code of ethics which establishes these principles  source sec form adv part  brochure canyon bridge management corp  conflict of interest  a conflict of interest exists where the interests of one person or entity conflict with the interests or benefits of the company cypress our policies prohibit any employee from accepting simultaneous employment of any kind without written permission of the company and prohibit any employee from accepting simultaneous employment with a company supplier customer developer or competitor it is a conflict of interest to serve as a director of any company that competes with the company although you may serve as a director of another company our policy requires that you first obtain approval from the companys chief financial officer before accepting a directorship additionally you must disclose to the company any interest that you have that may conflict with the business of the company employees agents or contractors should always try to avoid even the appearance of impropriety why do eric benhamou ray bingham and the board desperately want you to agree that canyon bridge and cypress dont compete we believe it is because bingham obviously is violating the companys crystalclear code of ethics and therefore the board needs a reason to continue ignoring binghams conflicts why has this all happened—and why is the cypress board resisting our reasonable settlement proposals and fighting to prevent disclosures to its own stockholders if you look past the diversionary attacks we think that the answers are simple and obvious ray bingham wants to wear two hats he wants to be paid millions as the parttime executive chairman of cypress and millions more as an owner and cofounder of canyon bridge according to the canyon bridge sec filing the canyon bridge management corp which is owned by just three individuals—ray bingham benjamin chow and hong john kao—will receive a  management fee every year on total invested funds currently  billion that adds up to  million per year  the chinese investors have already paid  million in management fees for just the last tenandonehalf weeks of  and a further  million in advance for  management fees in addition ray bingham benjamin bin chow and hong john kao are also the owners of another corporation the canyon bridge private equity fund which will receive a carried interest of  of the funds profits we believe this data helps answer the prior question of which master bingham will serve  we are worried it will be the one who pays millions in management fees plus a cut of the profits not cypress given these newly uncovered facts do you really want mr bingham as your executive chairman—or even as a member of the cypress board eric benhamou also does not deserve your support he was the chairman of the compensation committee that recommended and locked in binghams egregious executive compensation package forcing a single yesorno vote on creating the executive chairman position  source sec form adv part  brochure canyon bridge management corp   from dispositions of investments made by the private equity fund after the return of invested capital and preferred returns to the limited partners  stockholders can rightly ask to see benhamous claimed study by compensation experts that justified an  annual salary plus target bonus for a job to which bingham showed up just two days per week and how is it remotely rational that bingham should be paid  million in rsus with threeyear time vesting for his transitionary role to mentor hassane elkhoury benhamou allowed bingham to become the only cypress executive whose equity compensation is not performancebased finally benhamou in his capacity as lead director is responsible for making sure that you as stockholders were given all the facts in the proxy materials dealing with the election of directors you were not thats why cypress was forced to file a supplement to the proxy statement on may   see our other letter dated may   which discusses the inadequacies of the latest cypress supplement in a may   letter the board now publicly admits that binghams executive chairman role should end spinning it as the company will transition away from the executive chairman structure by the end of the current year we believe cypress should transition on june  and remind stockholders that their vote will make that change happen why wont cypress give stockholders a break and end binghams makework job on june  or—will the board quietly arrange for bingham to get all of his unvested and unearned rsus eric benhamou should be leading the effort to return to stockholders ray binghams unnecessary  million equity package and his  salary plus target bonus eric benhamou should also be held accountable as lead director for the boards coverup of binghams ethical violations its time for the cypress board to do whats right for cypress and allow full disclosure of all the facts to stockholders we continue to offer a solution that will end the proxy contest lawsuits and festering governance problems we will accept enlarging the cypress board to nine directors if dan mccranie and camillo martino are added to the cypress board under acceptable terms and with acceptable committee assignments and if mr bingham returns to receiving normal cypress directors pay on june  if our offer is accepted we will not seek to replace bingham and benhamou at the annual meeting finally if our offer is rejected again by the board remember that you the stockholders have the power to end this conflict restore good governance and send a clear message to the cypress board that you will not tolerate selfenrichment at the stockholders expense please vote to elect our two new superlatively qualified directors to replace ray bingham and eric benhamou we appreciate your support and strongly recommend your prompt vote on the gold proxy for dan mccranie and camillo martino to be elected to the cypress board sincerely s j daniel

us chip deal approval  sourcesliana b baker greg roumeliotis and koh gui qing min readreuters  canyon bridge capital partners llc the chinabacked buyout fund that agreed to acquire lattice semiconductor corp lscco in november for  billion has resubmitted the deal for us government review three people familiar with the matter said the move comes after the committee on foreign investment in the united states cfius a government panel which reviews acquisitions by foreign entities for potential national security risks did not complete its assessment by friday within the maximum time of  days that is awarded for assessing applications refiling the deal with cfius resets the clock and gives it additional time of up to another  days for it to complete its national security review and discuss potential issues with the companies the sources said another factor in canyon bridge and lattice resubmitting the application was that the vacancies left in senior positions at several government agencies more than two months after the inauguration of us president donald trump have reduced the panels capacity to review cases expeditiously two of the sources added the development does not necessarily spell trouble for the deal some transactions which previously refiled their application with cfius including chemchinas  billion acquisition of swiss seeds and pesticide maker syngenta ag synns were subsequently approved canyon bridge and lattice had previously said they had expected the deal to close in early  since announcing our partnership with canyon bridge in november  we have had continued ongoing and productive discussions with cfius we look forward to working closely with the committee throughout its review lattice said in a statement lattice declined to comment on the refiling of the deal with cfius canyon bridge also offered no comment cfius did not respond to requests for comments from outright acquirer to sole investor canyon bridge cofounder benjamin chows intention was to create a deal structure that would minimize us government scrutiny three sources told reuters a chinaborn american chow was working for a chinese statebacked entity called china reform fund management when he decided in the middle of deal talks with lattice last august to set up canyon bridge in palo alto california according to lattices proxy statement to its shareholders for a timeline on the deal click this changed the role of china reform which is controlled by the top decisionmaking body of the chinese government from outright lattice acquirer to sole investor in canyon bridge china reform did not respond to requests for comment reuters revealed last november that china reform fund management was the sole investor in canyon bridge after that story several us lawmakers wrote to us treasury secretary jacob lew asking for us regulators to block the deal lattice has argued that its chips do not have military applications and are not therefore a security risk the companys shares however are trading at around  per share well below the deal price of  per share indicating investor concern that cfius could find that some of its chips have potential to be used in military equipment in the future most foreign buyers of us companies with activities that potentially affect national security file their deals with cfius when they register they indicate whether they think the deal requires a full review known in cfius terminology as a covered transaction     while chow was not seeking to conceal the involvement of china reform in the deal he believed a buyout fund based in the united states bidding for lattice would trigger the minimum amount of scrutiny by cfius compared with a chinese buyer according to three people close to the deal who requested anonymity to discuss the deliberations chows plan called for registering the deal with cfius as a noncovered transaction indicating its position to cfius that no review was merited according to the sources chow told reuters in a statement that he created canyon bridge to attract a broad base of general partners and limited partners though he did not identify any new investors beyond china reform he did not comment on whether canyon bridge was also aimed at minimizing cfius scrutiny but added that he always expected to file for a cfius review covered transaction cfius decisions are not made public making it difficult for acquirers to know in advance how cfius would likely view a case without the advice of regulatory lawyers who deal regularly with the secretive panel canyon bridges us law firm jones day supported chows plan taking the view that a us limited partnership backed by chinese investment with no governance rights over the us partnership would not be viewed as a foreigncontrolled entity by cfius and therefore the deal would not trigger a review according to the sources a jones day spokesman did not respond to several requests for comment by telephone and email lattice and its lawyers disagreed because of canyon bridges reliance on a single chinesecontrolled investor according to the sources they convinced canyon bridge to call in law firm covington  burling llp for a second opinion which also backed lattices view the sources said covington  burling did not respond to a request for comment lattice eventually convinced chow that they should both plan to file the deal with cfius as a covered transaction indicating to cfius it should get a review as we made clear at the time of our announcement and in our proxy statement we have always been committed to the cfius process we first reached out to cfius months before selecting a strategic partner and reached out to it again after entering negotiations with canyon bridge but before signing an agreement lattice said in a statement    by that stage however canyon bridge was already formed while it only had one investor chow wanted to keep it to potentially attract more investors in the future the sources said the deal was announced on nov  with canyon bridge rather than china reform as the acquirer reporting by liana b baker in san francisco and greg roumeliotis and koh gui qing in
