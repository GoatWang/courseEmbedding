they hold one of the best holiday parties ive ever attended work life balance is good and most managers are quite accommodating when it comes to sick children  school events etcconscareer growth is very limited if you are the kind of person who will just do his job and not try to advance or change anything this is a good place to be its very difficult to move within the organization internal promotion is hardly encouraged and even when you try it takes forever an internal employee is the last person they want to hire its reverse at most places and pay raises are hard to come by if you are a low  mid level employee the higher ups are paid well so you will see a lot of turnover in the lower ranks but the higher ups have been there forever they dont allow remote working most managers are micro managers things happen very slowly here everything requires approval of the ceo most manager have little to no power to effect changeadvice to managementpromote from within they are more likely

company is small in terms of staff about  when i was there but huge in assets and scope they work pretty hard for happy employees all the free lunches and parties and the holiday galas at the smithsonian with entertainment and gourmet food it was a great job also i never worked with such nice and welcoming people who also are some of the smartest people in the industry it was amazing definitely the best boss of my life was there i thought my salary was pretty good and the bonus structure was confusing but generousconsthe entire company is run by the ceo every single decision above a few thousand dollars goes through him meaning it can be tricky some days to get done what you need to get done if hes decided to take an interest in it youll spend all your time trying to convince him you know what youre doing rather than doing it then again the everyone internally deals with it so everyone understands thats what happened vendors get frustrated as hell so thats never fun to deal with but its a big enough company most of them are willing to deal with it to a point all in all one of the best jobs i ever had and i miss it all the timeadvice to managementyou cant have people step up as leaders if they arent given a chance to do so one day the ceo will leave and they will be totally unprepared for how to deal with it so expanding decision making capabilities will avoid a major problem if an emergency were to happen it also gets frustrating for an employee who knows they probably wont ever significantly advance within the company because of that which leads to slightly
