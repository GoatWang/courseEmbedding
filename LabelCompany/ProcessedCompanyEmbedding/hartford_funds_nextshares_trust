rather than determined in the market at the time of trade execution like etfs nextshares and etfs have many similarities but also important differences  how does the transparency of nextshares compare to etfs because nextshares do not disclose their full holdings on a daily basis they are sometimes described as less transparent than etfs this ignores theÂ greater transparency ofÂ investor trading costs that nextshares provide and the potential benefits to nextshares of keeping portfolio trading information confidential some view this as better transparency not less transparency  how are nextshares similar to etfs nextshares and etfs are both registered investment companies regulated under the investment company act and operating pursuant to exemptive relief granted by the sec etfs and nextshares funds can grow and shrink in response to changes in investor demand helping avoid the widely fluctuating premiums and discounts to which closedend funds are frequently subject seeÂ question Â  the normal buying and selling of individual shares of both nextshares and etfs takes place in the secondary market rather than in transactions with the fund itself like a mutual fund because both nextshares and etfs are held in brokerage accounts they are similarly convenient to buy sell and own both nextshares and etfs are typically offered with a single class of shares with no sales loads or embedded distribution and service b fees in both structures all investors have access to a single lowcost share class both nextshares and etfs limit the issuance and redemption of their shares to transactions in creation units by or through authorized participants both nextshares and etfsÂ can lowerÂ fund transfer agency expenses by utilizing the highly efficient depository trust company dtcÂ share processing system also used for exchangelisted stocks both nextshares and etfs normally issue and redeem creation units of shares primarily on an inkind basis meaning that transacting investors pay or receive securities or other noncash instruments transacting primarily in kind may be more taxefficient than transacting in cash and can benefit fund performanceÂ  nextshares and etfs may transact wholly or partly in cash when inkind delivery is not practicable or deemed not in the best interests of shareholders both nextshares and etfs charge transaction fees on creation unit purchases and redemptions to offset the associated fund trading costs which can benefit fundÂ performance  how are nextshares different from etfs nextsharesÂ are actively managed and seek to exceed the returns of their performance benchmark and peer funds most etfs are passively managed seeking to match the returns of their benchmark index passivelymanaged etfs typically have lower ters than nextshares primarily due to their lower management fees the prices of nextshares trades are linked to the funds next daily nav and determined after nav is computed etf trade prices are determined intraday when the trade executes and do not bear a direct relationship to nav or portfolio values at time of execution because the prices of nextshares trades are contingent on the next determined nav nextshares do not offer investors the opportunity to transact at prices determined intraday nextshares are designed to be longterm investment vehicles and are not suited for shortterm trading nextshares protect the confidentiality of fund trading information avoiding the potentially dilutive effects of other market participants frontrunning the funds trades because making markets in nextshares does not involve arbitrage nextshares can maintain efficient share trading without disclosing fund holdings by contrast etfs typically disclose their entire holdings each day use of navbased trading can facilitate efficient and lowcost trading of nextshares by providing market makers with a simple reliable marketmaking profit opportunity different from making markets in conventionally traded etfs nextshares market makers are not exposed to intraday market risk on fund positions held use of navbased trading provides builtin transparency and potential control of trading costs for nextshares investors because trading prices are directly linked to nav buyers and sellers of nextshares know exactly what they pay in trading costs and can control their trading costs by using limit orders etf investors typically cannot accurately measure their trading costs and cannot use limit orders to control the costs of trading  what potential advantages do nextshares have over actively managed etfs because they protect the confidentiality of fund trading information nextshares are broadly compatible with active management in a way that the etf structureÂ may not be unlike active etfs nextshares are not required to publicly disclose their full holdings on a daily basis because the mechanism supporting efficient trading of nextshares does not involve arbitrage nextshares can trade at consistently low costs without disclosing their nonbasket holdings by disclosing their full holdings each day active etfs provide potentially valuable information to frontrunners which are traders that seek shortterm profits by buying and selling ahead of large investors whose trades they anticipate frontrunning can increase an active etfs trading costs and cut into performance daily holdings disclosures can also hurt the business interests of fund sponsors by providing research insights to competitors and enabling replicators to offer lowcost competing versions of the same strategy due to the requirement that actively managed etfs disclose their current holdings every business day most leading fund sponsors have avoided introducing their best most proven active strategies as etfs as a result the range of available active etfs is quite limited by contrast nextshares funds are expected to include a broad complement of establishedÂ strategies from leading managers other potential benefits of investing in nextshares that are not available with active etfs include trading cost transparency and the ability to control trading costs using limit orders see question  Â back to resources comparing nextshares to mutual funds  how are nextshares similar to actively managed mutual funds nextshares and active mutual funds are both registered investment companies regulated under the investment company act like mutual funds nextshares funds may issue and redeem shares on a daily basis enabling them to grow and shrink in response to changes in investor demand nextshares and active mutual funds both seek to outperform their benchmark index and peer funds nextshares funds may employ the same range of investment assets and management strategies as used by active mutual funds to pursue their investment objectives nextshares and active mutual funds are subject to management fees typically established in relation to the scope of management services provided and the fees charged for other similarly managed funds investor transactions in both nextshares and mutual funds take place at navbased prices although nextshares trade in the secondary market trading prices of nextshares are directly linked to the funds next daily nav neither nextshares nor mutual funds offer investors the ability to transact at prices determined in the market intraday at the time of trade execution both nextshares and active mutual funds protect the confidentiality of fund trading information nextshares disclose their full portfolio holdings on a monthly or quarterly basis with a time lag similar to mutual funds by not making their holdings available on a current daily basis both nextshares and mutual funds can maintain the proprietary nature of their investment programs and Â protect against predatory trading by frontrunners both nextshares and mutual funds provide transparency of investor trading costs buyers and sellers of nextshares and mutual funds can always know exactly how their transaction prices compare to the corresponding fund value  how do nextshares differ from active mutual funds nextshares trade in the secondary market and shareholder transactions directly with the fund are limited to purchases and redemptions of creation units of shares by or through authorized participants mutual fund shares areÂ individually purchased and redeemed directly from the issuing fund in cash at nav plus or minus a sales load where applicable and do not trade in the secondary market prices of nextshares bought or sold in the secondary market may vary from nav by an amount of trading costs premiumdiscount to nav determined in the market when the order executes because trading prices of nextshares mayÂ differ from nav and commissions may apply nextshares may be more expensive to buy and sell than mutual funds unlike mutual funds dollarbased nextshares transactions may not be available at all brokerdealers other common mutual fund investor options such as automatic dividend reinvestment free exchanges among funds in the same family and systematic purchasewithdrawal plans are also generally not available for nextshares brokerdealers may make these and other fund services available for nextshares as part of an enhanced service offering to their customers nextshares have a single class of shares with no sales loads or distribution and service b fees mutual funds are typically offered with multiple share classes many with sales loads andor b fees nextshares utilize the highly efficient dtc share processing system toÂ lower transfer agency expenses after management fees and b fees transfer agency expenses are normally the largest category of mutual fund expenses nextshares can minimize their flowrelated trading costs by issuing and redeeming shares primarily in kind most types of nextshares funds are expected to utilize inkind transactions see question  mutual funds almost always issue and redeem shares in cash nextshares charge transaction fees on purchases and redemption of creation units to offset the associated fund costs mutual funds rarely impose purchase or redemption fees on transacting shareholders nextshares funds that issue and redeem shares primarily inkind may not be required to maintain aÂ significantÂ cash reserve as a buffer against shareholder withdrawals holding less fund cash benefits performance when the aggregate return of the funds noncash holdingsÂ exceed cash returns but hurts performance when cash returns exceed the aggregate return of the funds noncash investments  what are the sources of the potential performance benefits of nextshares versus active mutual funds compared to mutual funds with the same strategy and portfolio management nextshares have a number of builtin potential cost advantages that can enhance performance no distribution and service b fees results in cost savings versus mutual fund share classes that charge such feesÂ  lowÂ fund transfer agency expensesÂ because nextshares use the highly efficient dtc transfer agency services transfer agencyÂ expenses are expected to be lower than for most mutual fundsÂ  little or no flowrelated trading costs nextshares canÂ lower flowrelating trading costs by issuing and redeeming shares primarily in kind and can offset associated fund costs by imposing transaction fees mutual funds generally do not issue or redeem shares in kind or charge transaction fees and less cash dragÂ nextshares that transact primarily in kind may operate with lower average cash balances than mutual funds that issue and redeem shares in cash  why are transfer agency expenses expected to be lower for nextshares than most active mutual funds nextshares funds can operate with low transfer agency expenses because they utilize the highly efficient dtc share processing system used for exchangelisted stocks and etfs in the dtc system shareholders hold shares through a brokerage account normally aggregated with other shareholders accounts into an omnibus account that holds shares directly with dtc or a dtc participant and fund transfer agents are relieved of most of the account servicing and transaction processing responsibilities that are required of mutual fund transfer agentsÂ  because mutual fund transfer agents have more responsibilities than etf and nextshares transfer agents they generally receive higher fees than are charged to etfs and nextsharesÂ  a number of typical mutual fund shareholder services such as reduced sales loads under rights of accumulation and statement of intention plans and waivers of backend sales charges upon the death of a shareholder or in other prescribed circumstances do not apply to nextshares because they do not charge sales loads other typical mutual fund shareholder services such as automatic dividend reinvestment free exchanges among funds in the same family and systematic purchasewithdrawal plans are not standard offerings in the dtc system much like for etfs brokerdealers may make enhanced nextshares service offerings available to their customers including programs facilitating dividend reinvestment and systematic purchaseswithdrawals unlike for mutual funds the cost of these added services is externalized from the fund and limited to those shareholders who elect to take advantage of them  what are the potential tax advantages of nextshares compared to mutual funds mutual funds often have to sell holdings that have increased in value to raise cash to meet shareholder redemptions when a fund sells appreciated holdings it recognizes taxable gains most nextshares funds are expected to meet redemptions primarily in kind by distributing portfolio securities under the internal revenue code when a regulated investment company distributes appreciated assets to meet redemptions no gain is recognized by the fund by using inkind distributions to meet redemptions a nextshares fund canÂ reduce required sales of portfolio securities to raise cash for redemptions that can mean lower fund capital gains distributions and lower tax bills for investors holding nextshares in taxable accounts the use of inkind redemptions to reduce shareholder taxes works exactly the same for nextshares as it does for etfs Â back to resources comparing nextshares to closedend funds  how do nextshares compare to closedend funds nextshares and closedend funds are both exchangetraded investment funds nextshares can issue and redeem shares in creation unit quantities on an ongoing daily basis whereas closedend funds maintain a substantially fixed number of shares after their initial offering the ability to issue and redeem creation units enables nextshares funds to expand and contract in response to changes in investor demand this helps avoid the fluctuating premiums and discounts of closedend funds widely viewed as their biggest drawback Â back to resources buying and selling nextshares  how do nextshares trade buying and selling nextsharesÂ is similar in most respects to buying and selling etfs and exchangelisted stocks throughout each trading day market makers quote bids and offers that are posted on an exchange buyers and sellers submit trade orders through brokerdealers the executing exchange matches orders received from brokerdealers against market maker quotes and other orders to execute trades and reports the results of completed trades to the parties to the trade member firms market data services and the nscc the nscc clears and settles executed trades with settlement normally occurring on the third following business day t each step works substantially the same for nextshares as for etfs and exchangelisted stocks whats different about nextshares trading is how quotes are expressed and how and when the price of executed trades is determined different from other exchangetraded instruments nextshares use a patented new trading protocol called navbased trading in navbased trading all bids and offers are quoted throughout the day relative to the funds nextdetermined nav and all trade prices are directly linked to nav trade executions are binding at the time orders are matched with final price contingent upon the determination of nav as an illustration a nextshares fund may be quoted intraday at a best bid of nav  and a best offer of nav  a buy order executed at the quoted offer price would in this example trade at nav  if the funds nav on that day is  the final trade price is   where and whenÂ do nextshares trade nextshares list on nasdaq andÂ are available for trading each business dayÂ throughout nasdaqs core trading session generally  am until  pm eastern time shares may also trade on other trading venues that have licenses rules and systems in place to support nextshares trading  howÂ are nextshares quotes and trades reported intraday trading prices of nextsharesÂ are available intraday through brokers offering nextshares and can be accessed usingÂ  the funds ticker symbol different from other exchangetraded securities prices of nextshares are expressed by reference to nav a price denoted for example as nav  means that days closing nav plus one cent representing prices in this manner makes it clear that bids offers and execution prices for nextshares are based on nav and that the final price of executed trades is determined when nav is computed nasdaq reports all nextshares bids and offers and executed trades in real time to member firms and market data services using proprietary nasdaq data feeds and through the consolidated tape the nextshares trade and quote data disseminated through proprietary nasdaq data feeds andÂ made available by brokerdealers offering nextshares is displayed in a nav nav  navbased format due to systems limitations the nextshares trade and quote data disseminated through the consolidated tapeÂ is in proxy price format with fundÂ nav represented by a proxy price of  and premiumsdiscounts to nav represented by the same difference from  eg nav  isÂ shown as  nav  as  market data services may report nextshares trade data in navbased or proxy price formatÂ  representations of nextshares trade and quote prices in proxy price format can be converted to the navbased format by subtracting  from the displayed proxy price and expressing the difference relative to nav eg  translates to nav  and  to nav  to avoid potential investor confusion nasdaqÂ is working with market data services providers to seek to ensure that representations of intraday bids offers and execution prices of nextshares that are made available to the investing public consistently follow the navbasedÂ format rather than proxy price format  how can a nextshares investor entering a sharebased trade determine the number of shares to buy or sell if the investor wants to trade an approximate dollar amount likeÂ sharebased trades to buy or sell approximateÂ dollar quantities of etfs and listed stocks this requires a simple calculation  dividing the intended dollar amount of the purchase or sale by the estimated price for a nextshares fund the transaction price can be estimated as the sum of the most recent iiv and the current bid for sales or offer for purchases if for example an investor seeks to buy approximately  of a nextshares fund whose current iiv is  and whose current offer price is nav he or she should place an order to buy  shares Ã· a nextshares funds current iiv can be accessed on the funds websiteÂ although iivs may provide useful estimates they cannot be used to calculate with precision the prices of shares bought and sold which are based on nav especially during periods of volatile market conditions and for trades executed early in the trading day buyers and sellers of nextshares face the risk that prices of shares purchased and sold may differ materially from intended levels iivs are calculated by independent third parties neither a nextshares fund nor any of its affiliates is involved in or responsible for the calculation or dissemination of iivs nor do they make any warranty as to their accuracy  howÂ are nextshares trade orders submitted and executed orders to buy and sell nextshares are submitted through a brokerdealer just like orders to trade etfs and listed stocks both market orders and limit orders may be accepted for nextshares trades limits on limit orders are expressed relative to nav rather than as an absolute dollar price by using limit orders buyers and sellers of nextshares can control their trading costs in a manner not available for etfs like etf and listed stock orders nextshares orders transmitted by brokerdealers to nasdaqÂ are matched against the best current offer for a purchase or best current bid for a sale for execution executionsÂ are binding on both buyer and seller at the time orders are matched all nextshares orders that are not executed on the day the order is submittedÂ are automatically cancelled as of the close of trading that day as a new type of fund nextshares may initially be offered by a limited number of brokerdealers  what happens after a nextshares trade executes immediately after a nextshares trade executes on nasdaqÂ the exchange provide the parties to the trade with a notice of trade execution indicating the number of shares bought or sold and the executed trading cost premiumdiscount executed tradesÂ are recorded and stored intradayÂ until theÂ funds daily nav is determined by the funds pricing agent after receiving the funds nav nasdaqÂ prices each nextshares trade executed on the exchange that day at nav plus or minus the trades executed premiumdiscount using the final trade price each executed nextshares tradeÂ is then disseminated to member firms and market data services and confirmed to the parties to the trade to supplement the previously provided information to include final pricing results of completed nextshares tradesÂ are transmitted toÂ nscc for standard clearance and settlement with settlement normally occurring on the thirdfollowing business day t  when and how is nav determined theÂ pricing agent of each nextshares fundÂ determines theÂ funds nav once each business day as of the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange normally  pm eastern time nav is computed by dividing the current value of fund assets less liabilities by the number of shares outstanding navs are generally distributed by the pricing agent by approximately  pm each business day  what are the potential advantages of navbased trading as compared to how etfs trade the principal potential advantage of navbased trading is that it can support investors ability to trade nextshares at consistently low costs while maintaining the confidentiality of fund trading information unlike conventional etf trading nextshares trading does not require daily disclosure of fund holdings to function effectively as a second potential advantage nextshares trading provides investors with builtin transparency of their trading costs and the ability to control trading costs using limit orders in a manner not available for etfs  what determines nextshares trading costs although nextshares are quoted throughout the day at navbased prices eg nav  nav  there is not a fixed relationship between trading prices and nav instead the premium or discount to nav at which share prices are quoted and transactions execute will vary depending on market factors then in effect including the balance of supply and demand for shares among investors transaction fees and other costs in connection with purchasing and redeeming creation units of shares the cost and availability of borrowing shares competition among market makers the share inventory positions and inventory strategies of market makers the profitability requirements and business objectives of market makers and the volume of share trading reflecting these and other market factors pricesÂ of shares in the secondary market may be above at or below nav the transaction fees applicable to each days creation unit purchases and redemptionsÂ are disclosed prior to the open of market trading other costs of purchasing and redeeming creation units include the commissions paid to buy or sell basket instruments and the variance between the aggregate price paid to buy or sell basket instruments and their value reflected in nav higher and more uncertain costs to create and redeem creation units generally translate into higher trading costs for buyers and sellers of nextshares  why are nextshares trading costs expected to be consistently low nextshares are expected to trade with consistently low trading costs because navbased trading offers simple and reliable profit opportunities to market makers linking nextshares trade prices to the funds next daily nav means that nextshares market makers do not need to adjust their bids and offers eg nav  nav  in response to intraday market moves linking trade prices to nav also eliminates market makers exposure to intraday market risk on their fund inventory positions because the basket instruments and creation unit transaction fees that apply each business day are disclosed prior to the beginning of trading nextshares market makers know each day the primary costs of entering into creation unit transactions on that day and the instruments to be paid or received in creation unit transactions if a market maker can purchase nextshares in the secondary market at a discount to nav that exceeds the cost of redeeming it need only accumulate enough individual shares to constitute a creation unit to redeem the position at a profit similarly if a market maker can sell shares in the secondary market at a premium to nav that exceeds the creation cost it need only accumulate a creation unitsized short position in shares and then purchase a creation unit to realize a profit by maintaining creation unit sizes that are relatively small ie in a range of  to  shares nextshares funds enable market makers to limit their exposure to overnight inventory risk in fund shares held to the extent that market makers hold positions in nextshares overnight theyÂ can aggregate fund holdings with other risk positions and transact at or near the market close to buy or sell offsetting macro hedges the opportunity for market makers to earn reliable profits by trading in nextshares is expected to attract market makers to nextshares and competition among market makers should ensure consistently tight trading markets nextshares solutions believes that a key consideration for the sec in granting nextshares exemptive relief was confidence that nextshares will trade with consistently low trading costs the mechanisms supporting efficient trading of nextshares are applicable across different asset classes and investment strategies funds whose holdings trade at wider bidask spreads and with less liquidity should be expected on average to exhibit higher investor trading costs  how can nextshares trade efficiently if they dont disclose their full holdings each day in etf trading consistently low investor trading costs cannot be assured unless market makers have sufficient knowledge of portfolio holdings to enable them to effectively arbitrage differences between an etfs market price and its underlying portfolio value and to hedge the intraday market risk they assume as they take inventory positions in connection with their marketmaking activities if market makers cannot arbitrage differences between an etfs price and underlying value and cannot effectively hedge their intraday fund positions the etf cannot be expected to trade within a consistently narrow range of underlying value thats why active etfs are required to disclose their full holdings every day different from etfs nextshares offer market makers a profit opportunity that is not based on arbitrage and does not require the management of intraday market risk because all nextshares trading prices are based on endofday nav it makes no difference to a nextshares market maker whether the funds underlying value goes up or down over the course of the day this means that unlike for etfs market makers dont need to enter into intraday hedges or adjust their hedges as they buy and sell nextshares positions over the course of the day because they dont engage in arbitrage and dont need to hedge intraday nextshares market makers dont need to know a funds nonbasket holdings nextshares market makers do require disclosure of a funds current basket instruments to effect inkind purchases and redemptions of creation units and manage the associated risks to provide this nextshares funds disclose the current composition of their basket as well as the creation unit transaction fees that currently apply prior to the beginning of market trading each business day in sum nextshares can trade efficiently without disclosing their nonbasket holdings because nonbasket holdings are irrelevant to market makers competition among market makers seeking simple and reliable profit opportunities should ensure consistently low trading costs for nextshares investors in granting nextshares exemptive relief the sec concluded that use of navtrading provides a reliable basis for ensuring that nextshares will trade with consistently low trading costs while enabling nextshares funds to maintain the confidentiality of their nonbasket holdings Â back to resources creations and redemptions  how do nextshares issue and redeem shares like etfs nextshares issue and redeem shares in creation unit quantities in transactions by or through authorized participants also like etfs nextshares issue and redeem creation units of shares at nav plus or minus a transaction fee that is intended to offset the estimatedÂ cost to the fund ofÂ processing the transaction and converting the transferred basket instruments to or from the desired composition an investor does not have to be an authorized participant to transact in creation units but must place an order through and make appropriate arrangements with an authorized participant subject to certain limited exceptions the basket instruments paid or received by a fundÂ are the same for all purchases and redemptions of creation units on the same day all basket instrumentsÂ are valued the same for transaction purposes as in calculating the funds nav to the extent there is a difference between the nav of a creation unit and the aggregate value of the basket instruments exchanged the party conveying the lower value pays to the other the balancing amount in cash  how is the composition of the basket determined each nextshares funds daily basket is determined by its investment adviser andÂ consists of instruments that the adviser considers appropriate in light of the funds objectives and policies current portfolio positions and current trading program basket instrumentsÂ are limited to current portfolio holdings and cash to keep fund trading costs low and to enable the fund to be as fully invested as possible basket instruments generally consist of securities and other noncash portfolio holdings rather than cash to the extent practicable use of inkind transactions may also increase a funds tax efficiency and promote low investor trading costs byÂ minimizing transaction fees applicable to creation unit transactions to preserve the confidentiality of fund trading activities a funds basketÂ is notÂ normallyÂ a pro rata representation ofÂ the fundsÂ current portfolio positions not all fund holdingsÂ are typicallyÂ included in the basket and basket weightings may vary from portfolio positions held instruments being acquired by a fundÂ are generally excluded from the basket until their purchase is completed and instruments being sold may not be removed from the basket until the sale program is substantially completed when deemed by the adviser to be in the best interest of the fund and its shareholders other portfolio positions may be excluded from the basket whenever portfolio positions are excluded from the basket the basket may include proportionately more cash than is in the portfolio with such additional cash substituting for the excluded positions creations and redemptions may be effected entirely in cash when inkind delivery is not practicable or deemed not in the best interests of shareholders some nextshares funds may issue and redeem creation units entirely in cash on an ongoing daily basis theÂ  basket used inÂ fund creations and redemptions is not intended to be representative of current portfolio holdings and may vary significantly from the funds current holdings  how and when is the composition of the basket communicated prior to the opening of nasdaqs core trading session each business day generally  am eastern time each nextshares fund posts the basket in effect for that day on the funds public website and disseminates the basket to market participants through nscc the posted basket applies until a new basket is announced for the next business day and thereÂ are no intraday changes except to correct errors  how many shares constitute a creation unit the number of shares in a creation unit may vary from  shares to  shares for nextshares funds and is stated in the funds prospectus the size of a funds creation unitsÂ is set by its adviser based primarily on its determination of the size that is most conducive to efficient secondary market trading maintaining creation units that are generally smaller than etf creation units can help nextshares market makers manage their inventory positions to limit exposure to daytoday market risk  what is the cutoff time for submitting creation unit orders validly submitted orders to purchase and redeem creation unitsÂ are accepted from authorized participantsÂ until the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange generally  pm eastern time on the business day that the order is placed all orders must be received by the funds distributor no later than the order cutoff time to receive the nav determined on the transmittal date the distributor may impose earlier cutoff times on custom orders and orders to purchase and redeem income funds on days the bond markets close early orders to purchase and redeem income funds may not be accepted on days when the bond markets are closed  are basket substitutions permitted a nextshares fund may permit cash to be substituted for some or all of the basket instruments when a the instruments are for the purchase of a creation unit not available in sufficient quantity b the instruments are not eligible for trading by the authorized participant or the investor on whose behalf the authorized participant is acting or c a holder of fund shares investing in foreign instruments would be subject to unfavorable income tax treatment if the holder receives redemption proceeds in kind no other basket substitutionsÂ are permitted in addition a nextshares fund may require purchases and redemptions on a given business day to be made entirely on a cash basis when this occurs the fund will announce before the open of trading that all purchases all redemptions or all purchases and redemptions on that day will be made entirely in cash a nextshares fund may also determine upon receiving a purchase or redemption order from an authorized participant to require the purchase or redemption as applicable to be made entirely in cash  what transaction fees apply to purchases and redemptions of creation units purchasers and redeemers of creation units are charged a transaction fee to cover the estimated cost to the fund of processing the purchase or redemption and the estimated fund trading costs incurred in converting the transferred basket to or from the desired portfolio composition each funds transaction fee is determined by the funds adviser on a daily basis andÂ limited to amounts determined to be appropriate to defray the estimated expenses that the fund incurs in connection with the transaction the purpose of transaction fees is to protect the funds shareholders from the dilutive costs associated with issuing and redeeming creation units the amount of transaction fees will differ among nextshares funds and may vary over time for a given fund depending on the estimated trading costs for its portfolio positions and basket processing costs and other considerations transaction fees may include fixed amounts per creation or redemption event amounts varying with the number of creation units purchased or redeemed and amounts varying based on the time an order is placed funds that permit substitution of cash for basket instruments may impose higher transaction fees on the substituted cash amount the transaction fees that apply to a funds purchases and redemptions of creation units each business dayÂ are posted on the funds website and disseminated to market participants through the nscc prior to the open of market trading the transaction feesÂ are payable to the fund by the transacting party and limited in accordance with the requirements of the sec applicable to openend management investment companies offering redeemable securities Â back to resources investor information  what information about nextshares fundsÂ is available through fund websites each nextshares fund sponsor maintains a public website that discloses current fund information and contains links to current fund documents including a fact sheet summary and full prospectuses statement of additional information and shareholder reports for each fund the website displays current fund iivs updated at intervals of not more than  minutes throughout each business days regular market trading hours and includes a calculator to assist transacting investors in sizing buy and sell orders each funds website displays the funds nav for the prior business day and the following trading information for that day intraday high low volumeweighted average and closing trading prices of shares expressed as premiumsdiscounts to nav the midpoint of the highest bid and lowest offer prices as of the close of exchange trading expressed as a premiumdiscount to nav the spread between highest bid and lowest offer prices as of the close of exchange trading and volume of shares traded the fund website also includes charts showing the funds historical premiumsdiscounts and trading spreads over time the trading information provided for nextshares offers a level of investor cost transparency unparalleled among exchangetraded products before the opening of regular market trading each business day each nextshares fund posts to its website the daily basket and creation unit transaction fees in effect that day consistent with mutual fund disclosure requirements a complete list of current portfolio positionsÂ is made available at least once each calendar quarter with a lag of not more than  days nextshares funds may provide more frequent disclosures of portfolio positions at their discretion  what investor information is available at nextsharescom nextshares solutions has developed and maintains a website at nextsharescom as a central resource to support the introduction of nextshares the website includes a library of nextsharesrelated educational tools and materials including white papers questions and answers a compendium of selected news articles and links to regulatory and technical documents andÂ sponsor web sites  what are intraday indicative values iivs and how are they useful to nextshares investors iivs provide an indicative estimate of a nextshares fundsÂ current value throughout each trading day their purpose is to help investors entering sharebased orders determine the number of shares to buy or sell if they want to transact in an approximate dollar amount ie if i want to acquire approximately  of a nextshares fund how many shares do i buy iivs can be accessed on fund websites iivs are calculated by an independent third party and disseminated by nasdaq at intervals of not more than  minutes throughout each business days regular trading session generally  am to  pm eastern time iivsÂ are based onÂ fund holdingsÂ used to determine that days nav and current market prices of holdings as determined intraday neither a nextshares fund nor any of its affiliatesÂ is involved in or responsible for the calculation or dissemination of iivs norÂ do they make any warranty as to their accuracy iiv inaccuracies could result from various factors including difficulty pricing portfolio instruments on an intraday basis although iivs may provide useful estimates they cannot be used to calculate with precision the prices of shares bought and sold which are based on nav especially during periods of volatile market conditions and for trades executed early in the trading day buyers and sellers of nextshares face the risk that prices of shares purchased and sold may differ materially from intended levels unlike for etfs access to timely and accurate iivs is not required for buyers and sellers of nextshares to estimate their trading costs navbased trading provides builtin trading cost transparency for nextshares investors  how and whenÂ do nextshares funds disclose their full holdings nextshares solutions expects most nextshares funds toÂ provide website disclosures ofÂ their full portfolio holdings on the same basis as similar mutual funds which isÂ typically monthly with a lag of approximately  days the frequency and manner of holdings disclosure for each nextshares fund is set forth in its prospectus a complete list of the portfolio holdings of all nextshares fundsÂ are required toÂ be filed with the sec and made available on the funds website at least once each calendar quarter with a reporting lag of not more than  days the holdings disclosure requirements of nextshares are the same as apply to mutual funds due to lags in reporting a funds actual holdings may vary significantly from the most recent publicly disclosed portfolio composition Â back to resources owning nextshares  how are positions in nextshares held nextshares are held in brokerage accounts nextshares of various sponsors can be combined in a single account along with holdings of etfs and other securities nextshares are expected to be freely transferable across brokerage accounts and among different brokerdealer firms  do nextshares issue stock certificates no fund shares are held in bookentry form which means that no stock certificates are issued dtc serves as the securities depository for shares dtc or its nominee is the record owner of all outstanding fund shares beneficial owners of sharesÂ are shown on the records of dtc or dtcparticipating institutions and exercise their rights in shares on an indirect basis through dtc and dtc participants  do nextshares offer automatic dividend reinvestment no automatic dividend reinvestment is provided for nextshares brokerdealers may offer dividend reinvestment to their customers as part of an enhanced service offering Â back to resources masterfeeder structure  what is a masterfeeder structure and how can it be used for nextshares efficiencies in the management and administration of two or more investment funds of the same sponsor that follow similar investment programs may be achieved by the funds investing in a common underlying investment vehicle using a masterfeeder arrangement rather than holding their investments directly the feeder funds invest indirectly in the securities and other assets of the associated master fund use of masterfeeder canÂ benefitÂ feeder fundÂ performance as economies of scale that may be realized in managing and administering the master fund pass through as lower expenses to the feeder funds aÂ nextshares fundÂ that operates as a feeder fund may coinvest alongside a mutual fund of the same sponsor in a common master fund through this arrangement the nextshares fund and corresponding mutual fund effectively share theÂ same portfolio management and investments positioning both funds to potentially benefit from economics of scale nextshares masterfeeder arrangements may involve existing mutual funds that previously operated in a masterfeeder structure with the nextshares fund added as an additional feeder fund existing mutual funds that currently operate on a standalone basis may also convert to a masterfeeder structure to accommodate the launch of corresponding nextshares funds as feeder funds because master funds are organized as partnerships investors in a newly formed feeder fund are shielded from potential tax liability on unrealized master fund portfolio gains unlike when a new share class whether exchangetraded or not is added to an existing mutual fund the terms of the masterfeeder exemptive relief provided for nextshares prescribe that a master fund with one or more feeder funds transacting with the master fund on a cash basis and other feeder funds that transact primarily in kind should transact with each feeder fund on a basis that protects the master fund and indirectly other feeder funds against the costs of accommodating the feeder funds inflows and outflows for nextshares masterfeeder arrangements master funds accomplish this by applying transaction fees to feeder fund transactions that are sized to cover the associated cost to the master fund master fund transaction fees are applied to all feeder funds in the same manner to avoid discrimination and to treat all investors fairly Â back to resources special considerations and risks most of the risks of investing in nextshares relate to the funds underlying investments just like mutual funds and etfs a few special considerations and risks also apply to nextshares investing  compared to investing in a mutual fund with similar holdings and similar management what are the special considerations and risks of investing in nextshares unlike mutual funds nextshares are exchangetraded and shares are not individually redeemable this exposes nextshares investors to market trading risks not present for mutual funds there can be no guarantee that an active trading market for shares will develop or be maintained or that their listing will continue unchanged trading prices of shares may be above at or below nav fluctuate in relation to nav based on supply and demand in the market for shares and other factors and may vary significantly from nav during periods of market volatility buying and selling shares may require payment of brokerage commissions and expose buyers and sellers to other trading costs due to brokerage commissions and other transaction costs that may apply frequent trading may detract from realized investment returns and an investors returns will be reduced if the investor sells shares at a greater discount or narrower premium to nav than he or she acquired the shares because nextshares funds do not pay b fees or impose sales loads they are not compatible with all mutual fund distribution and service arrangements which may restrict investor access certain shareholder services typically provided for mutual funds such as automatic dividend reinvestment free exchanges among funds in the same family and systematic purchasewithdrawal plans are generally not available for nextshares the above special considerations and risks also apply to etfs  compared to investing in etfs what are the special considerations and risks of investing in nextshares unlike most etfs nextshares are actively managed different from all etfs nextshares trading prices are linked to the next nav rather than determined at the time of trade execution these differences expose nextshares investors to active management risk and contingent pricing risks performance versus peer funds and the funds benchmark depends on the successful application of analytical skill and investment judgment buyers and sellers of sharesÂ do not know the price of shares purchased and sold until nav is determined trade prices may vary significantly from anticipated levels including estimates based on intraday indicative values during periods of significant market volatility although limit orders can be used to control differences in trade price versus nav cost of trade execution they cannot be used to control or limit trade execution prices because nextshares funds are actively managed their total expense ratios and fund trading costs are generally higher than index etfs holding similar investments trading in connection with active portfolio management may also cause nextshares funds to be less taxefficient than index etfs holding similar investments most of the above risks and special considerations also apply to actively managed mutual funds Â back to resources regulation  how are nextshares regulated each nextshares fundÂ is a registered investment company under the investment company act among other requirements nextshares funds must file with the sec a registration statement on form na and operate in accordance with its terms  what sec exemptive relief do nextshares require because nextshares fundsÂ do not comply with all the provisions of the investment company act applicable to openend investment companies investment advisers to nextshares funds must obtain sec exemptive relief prior to launch among other matters exemptive relief is required to permit nextshares to trade on an exchange and to redeem shares only in creation units aggregations the first sec order providing exemptive relief to offer nextshares was granted to eaton vance management and related parties on december   see investment company act release no  dec   file no  eaton vances application for exemptive relief was initially filed on march   the eaton vance order prescribed that a shortform application be used for future exemptive relief requests submitted by other advisers that agree to abide by the terms and conditions of the eaton vance order  what sec approvals are required to list and trade nextshares in november  the sec approved nasdaq rule  governing the listing and trading of nextshares funds on the exchange see securities exchange act release no  nov    fr  nov   srnasdaq under the provisions of nasdaq rule  and consistent with the trading approvals required for active etfs nasdaq must receive approval to list and trade shares of each nextshares fund  eaton vance nextshares funds have been approved to list and trade on nasdaq other exchanges that seek to trade nextshares must receive approval by the sec of an exchange rule similar to nasdaq rule  and likely also separate trading approvals for individual nextshares funds  can other registered investment companies invest in nextshares funds yes the nextshares exemptive relief allows unaffiliated registered investment companies to invest in fund shares beyond the normal regulatory limits if certain terms and conditions are met including that the registered investment company first enters into a written agreement with the fund regarding the terms of the investment Â back to resources tax treatment  how does the tax treatment of nextshares compare to mutual funds and etfs nextshares are subject to the same federal income tax treatment as mutual funds and etfs funds in each structure are generally taxed as corporations and treated as regulated investment companies under subchapter m of the internal revenue code  what authority governs the tax treatment of inkind redemptions section b of the internal revenue code provides that no gain shall be recognized by a regulated investment company upon the distribution of appreciated property if such distribution is in redemption of its stock upon the demand of the shareholder Â back to resources competition  has the sec approved other product structures similar to nextshares no nextshares is the only portfolioprotective exchangetraded product structure to receive sec exemptive relief in october  the sec issued notice of its intent to deny approval of the only alternative structure to visibly advance toward final consideration by the sec exemptive applications have been filed for other structures but none show signs of nearing approval  for regulatory purposes what distinguishes nextshares from proposed alternative structures nextshares solutions believes that a key consideration for the sec in evaluating proposed portfolioprotective etp structures is whether the proposed structure provides an adequate basis for ensuring that trading prices of fund shares will remain in consistently close alignment with nav other considerations include whether the proposed method of maintaining pricevalue alignment avoids discrimination among investors and whether the asserted portfolio protection benefits will be realized in practice nextshares solutions believes that the secs decision to grant nextshares exemptive relief reflects their conclusion that use of navtrading provides a reliable basis for ensuring that nextshares will trade with consistently low trading costs while enabling nextshares funds to maintain the confidentiality of their nonbasket holdings whether other proposed etp structures  which neither disclose their full holdings on a daily basis nor utilize navbased trading  can obtain exemptive relief in the future remains to be seen  if approved would other proposed portfolioprotective etp structures be broadly applicable across fund asset classes no other proposed structures are generally limited to funds holding primarily us equities and cash by contrast the nextshares structure is broadly applicable across all the asset classes in which mutual funds invest Â back to resources intellectual property  what intellectual property rights underlie nextshares aspects of navbased trading are protected by nine issued and additional pending us patents held by nextshares methods for combining mutual fund and etp assets in a shareholderprotective masterfeeder arrangement are subject to a separate pending patent application nextshares also holds other intellectual property in the form of trademarks copyrighted materials and protected confidential knowhow Â back to resources transparency  how does the cost transparency of nextshares compare to etfs and mutual funds the costs to invest in a mutual fund etf or nextshares fund include the ongoing cost of ownership and the cost to enter and exit fund positions while ownership costs are similarly transparent across the three structures mutual funds and nextshares offer full transparency of investor trading costs and etfs do not mutual fund and nextshares investors can always know exactly what they pay in trading costs to buy and sell the cost to purchase or redeem a mutual fund equals the sales charges and other transaction costs paid which are directly reported by the fund or can be readily measured by comparing the transaction price to nav the trading costs to buy and sell nextshares consist of the executed premiumdiscount to nav and the commissions paid for example a person buying nextshares at nav  pays two cents a share plus commissions in trading costs by contrast most etf investors can only guess their trading costs they can see what they pay in commissions but thats only one element of etf trading costs the difference between etf trade execution prices and underlying portfolio values is often far more significant because most etf investors dont know that relationship they cannot accurately measure their trading costs comparing etf trade prices to the funds nearest disclosed iiv provides at best an indirect measure of investor trading costs etf iivs are disseminated at second intervals rather than continuously and most etf investors dont know precisely when their trades execute or have access to iiv data records to permit posttrade comparisons moreover unlike navs etf iivs are frequently based on stale price data and may be prone to frequent errors a recent academic study by antti petajisto inefficiencies in the pricing of exchangetraded funds concluded that the difference between an etfs share price and the value of the underlying portfolio is often economically significant indicating that the unsophisticated investor may face an unexpected additional cost when trading etfs proponents of etfs frequently cite transparency as a key benefit of the etf structure thats certainly not the case for investor trading costs for which the transparency of both nextshares and mutual funds far exceeds that of etfs  how does the portfolio transparency of nextshares compare to etfs and mutual funds most etfs and all actively managed etfs disclose their full holdings daily mutual funds and nextshares funds typically disclose their full holdings on a monthly or quarterly basis usually with a  to  day lag seemingly the advantage here goes to etfs but with portfolio holdings disclosure more doesnt necessarily equal better its clear that most fund investors dont place significant value on having current daily access to fund holdings a naissance investor survey found that only  percent of investors believed that its important for full holdings to be disclosed every day there is however one audience that is keenly interested in realtime disclosure of a funds holdings frontrunning traders armed with daily holdings and a history of fund trading patterns a frontrunning trader can learn to anticipate a funds future trading by trading ahead of the fund the frontrunner can profit at the funds expense driving up fund trading costs and undercutting shareholder returns daily holdings disclosures can also hurt the business interests of fund sponsors by providing research insights to competitors and enabling replicators to offer lowcost competing versions of the same strategy due to the required holdings disclosures most leading fund sponsors have avoided introducing their leading strategies as etfs thus depriving their investors of the performance and tax advantages an exchangetraded product structure can provide Â back to resources misperceptions and myths  what are some common misperceptions and myths about nextshares nextshares are etfs although nextshares are similar to etfs in many respects they are not etfs among other distinctions trading prices of nextshares are linked to the funds next daily nav rather than determined in the market at the time of trade execution like etfs nextshares are nontransparent nextshares disclose all the same portfolio information as commonly provided by mutual funds which are hardly nontransparent unlike etfs nextshares provide builtin transparency of investor trading costs and the potential performance benefits of keeping portfolio trading information confidential some view this as better transparency not less transparency the primary purpose of nextshares is intraday trading the primary purpose of nextshares is to deliver improved performance to active fund investors because prices are linked to nav rather than determined intraday nextshares are not suited for shortterm trading the economics of nextshares dont fit with how brokerdealers distribute funds in recent years the distribution of mutual funds by traditional brokerdealers has migrated significantly toward institutional share classes with no sales loads or distribution and service b fees held in feebased advisory accounts nextshares are completely compatible with this distribution model buying and selling nextshares is complicated buying and selling nextshares isÂ essentially the same as buying etfs and exchangelisted stocks the main distinction is that prices are linked to nav rather than determined in the market at the time of trade execution nextshares cant trade efficiently because they dont disclose their holdings because nextshares trade at navbased prices market making does not involve arbitrage or expose market makers to intraday market risk as a result nextshares can trade at consistently low costs without disclosing their nonbasket holdings portfolio trading confidentiality is important only for equity funds although a few leading fund managers have introduced actively managed fixed income etfs there is no reason to believe frontrunning and freeriding concerns apply only to equity funds any strategy that buys or sells over multiday periods is potentially vulnerable to frontrunning and any active manager that discloses current portfolio holdings is at risk of freeriding other competing fund structures are about to be introduced the process of getting a new fund structure approved by the sec and into the market is lengthy with a number of visible steps there is no evidence that any competing portfolioprotective etp structure is nearing approval Â back to resources Â  we apologize for the
