acquisitions ma include  synergy the most used word in ma is synergy which is the idea that by combining business activities performance will increase and costs will decrease essentially a business

acquirer to eliminate future competition and gain a larger market share in its products market the downside of this is that a large premium is usually required to convince the target companys shareholders to accept the offer it is not uncommon for the acquiring companys shareholders to sell their shares and push the price lower in response to the company paying too much for the target

in the early s according to an array of industry consultants • strengthening global demand  we believe lng demand will rise over the coming years driven by widespread interest in cleaner  burning higher  yielding fuels increased coal plant retirements geopolitical considerations and burgeoning demand from new buyers • us lng sought after  we believe traditional lng buyers are seeking to diversify away from oil  linked contracts and are looking to increase destination flexibility as a result low  cost us lng is poised to capture market share supported by the country’s abundant gas supply — particularly in the case of nextdecade access to cheap and abundant associated gas from the permian basin and eagle ford shale — existing pipeline infrastructure geopolitical trade considerations and a competitive project execution environment • supply shortfall  a global supply shortfall is developing as lng market dynamics are shifting towards new and emerging markets with burgeoning sector opportunities – such as lng  to  power – adding to global lng demand diminishing resources in historically abundant lng markets as well as expiring contracts not necessarily re  contracting with existing providers in an array of jurisdictions further increase the desire among lng buyers and importers to diversify their supply with reliable and cost  effective solutions nextdecade plans to commence commercial operations of its rglng facility in time for a global supply shortfall expected in    years  • growing regasification capacity  according to the international gas union since  ten countries have constructed almost  mtpa of regasification capacity with a further  mtpa already under construction and expected to be operational by the end of  boosting the need for lng as the lng market expands and more companies explore import options aided by floating storage regasification units “fsrus” we believe a wide variety of importers will emerge leading to

strong market interest and more specifically interest in feed gas sourced from west and south texas which benefits from low  cost associated gas as production in key basins permian basin and eagle ford shale is expected to create more supply than available demand • cheap feedstock gas  we believe rglng is the most proximate lng project to the robust reserves and production of the permian basin and eagle ford shale providing it with access to some of the cheapest feedstock gas in the us excess gas cannot be flared for extended periods of time in the state of texas  thus associated gas break  evens in the permian basin imply “negative” basis providing an opportunity for gas to reach gulf coast markets economically we believe stable outlets like lng export facilities are likely more attractive for gas producers than domestic options where incremental demand may be limited • infrastructure expansion we believe nextdecade’s rbpl designed to interconnect with eight existing pipelines with a combined throughput capacity of  bcfd will have supply flexibility and competitive pricing eastward takeaway capacity is already expanding in the region with high  profile plans over the next    months among key sponsors such as enterprise energy transfer and others  • significant local investment significant local investment has led and is anticipated to lead to even more

proposed merger – can be assessed using the below methodologies nextdecade valuation at the time of the valuation assessment nextdecade was a limited  liability company and as such is considered to be a “pass  th rough” entity for taxation purposes although following the proposed merger the combined entity will be a c  corp — and thus subject to taxation on income earned — nextdecade believes its assets and their corresponding income ear ned will be mlp eligible and thus nextdecade’s assets may be considered to be pass  through entities for taxation or other purposes notwithstanding the above any prospective investor should not rely on this valuatio n a ssessment for taxation purposes and should consult any relevant legal tax accounting financial andor other relevant advisors prior to

mergers apr print this page images included post a comment access to capitalmergers and acquisitionsposted at  am there are five commonlyreferred to types of business combinations known as mergers conglomerate merger horizontal merger market extension merger vertical merger and product extension merger the term chosen to describe the merger depends on the economic function purpose of the business transaction and relationship between the merging companies conglomerate a merger between firms that are involved in totally unrelated business activities there are two types of conglomerate mergers pure and mixed pure conglomerate mergers involve firms with nothing in common while mixed conglomerate mergers involve firms that are looking for product extensions or market extensions example a leading manufacturer of athletic shoes merges with a soft drink firm the resulting company is faced with the same competition in each of its two markets after the merger as the individual firms were before the merger one example of a conglomerate merger was the merger between the walt disney company and the american broadcasting company horizontal merger a merger occurring between companies in the same industry horizontal merger is a business consolidation that occurs between firms who operate in the same space often as competitors offering the same good or service horizontal mergers are common in industries with fewer firms as competition tends to be higher and the synergies and potential gains in market share are much greater for merging firms in such an industry example a merger between cocacola and the pepsi beverage division for example would be horizontal in nature the goal of a horizontal merger is to create a new larger organization with more market share because the merging companies business operations may be very similar there may be opportunities to join certain operations such as manufacturing and reduce costs market extension mergers a market extension merger takes place between two companies that deal in the same products but in separate markets the main purpose of the market extension merger is to make sure that the merging companies can get access to a bigger market and that ensures a bigger client base example a very good example of market extension merger is the acquisition of eagle bancshares inc by the rbc centura eagle bancshares is headquartered at atlanta georgia and has  workers it has almost  accounts and looks after assets worth us  billion eagle bancshares also holds the tucker federal bank which is one of the ten biggest banks in the metropolitan atlanta region as far as deposit market share is concerned one of the major benefits of this acquisition is that this acquisition enables the rbc to go ahead with its growth operations in the north american market with the help of this acquisition rbc has got a chance to deal in the financial market of atlanta  which is among the leading upcoming financial markets in the usa this move would allow rbc to diversify its base of operations product extension mergers a product extension merger takes place between two business organizations that deal in products that are related to each other and operate in the same market the product extension merger allows the merging companies to group together their products and get access to a bigger set of consumers this ensures that they earn higher profits example the acquisition of mobilink telecom inc by broadcom is a proper example of product extension merger broadcom deals in the manufacturing bluetooth personal area network hardware systems and chips for ieee b wireless lan mobilink telecom inc deals in the manufacturing of product designs meant for handsets that are equipped with the global system for mobile communications technology it is also in the process of being certified to produce wireless networking chips that have high speed and general packet radio service technology it is expected that the products of mobilink telecom inc would be complementing the wireless products of broadcom vertical merger a merger between two companies producing different goods or services for one specific finished product a vertical merger occurs when two or more firms operating at different levels within an industrys supply chain merge operations most often the logic behind the merger is to increase synergies created by merging firms that would be more efficient operating as one example a vertical merger joins two companies that may not compete with each other but exist in the same supply chain an automobile company joining with a parts supplier would be an example of a vertical merger such a deal would allow the automobile division to obtain better pricing on parts and have better control over the manufacturing process the parts division in turn would be guaranteed a steady stream of business synergy the idea that the value and performance of two companies combined will be greater than the sum of the separate individual parts is one of the reasons companies merger source httpwwwinvestopediacom  and httpwwweconomywatchcom related content apr post a comment benefits of
