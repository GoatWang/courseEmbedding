florida lennen v marriott ownership resorts inc et al cv was filed on behalf of purchasers of marriott timeshare interests in marriotts pointsbased marriott vacation club program the mvc product and owners of marriotts tradtional weektoweek timeshares legacy timeshares in sum the action involves allegations that defendants through a series of convoluted and patently illegal transactions engaged and continue to engage in a scheme to convey illusory real property ownership interests to purchasers of the mvc product while purchase of the mvc product is said to convey both title to a florida timeshare estate and a beneficial interest in a florida land trust it in fact conveys neither in reality the mvc product conveys to its purchasers nothing more than a simple awards program prodiving access to selected marriottowned timeshares throughout the country the purpose of packaging the mvc product as a real estate transaction is simple the product provides significant opportunities for revenue that would not otherwise exist in connection with an awards program of this nature or even for that matter with the sale of legacy timeshares of the type marriott has sold for decades the

marriott first american and others have profited greatly from sales of the mvc product purchasers of the mvc product continue to suffer the consequences of the deception for one mvc owners are deprived of any of the benefits of realproperty ownership while shouldering all the burdens costs and fees as if they had such title moreover purchasers continue to suffer harm as a result of marriotts opaque and discretionary pointvaluation process which results in significant dilution and lacks any reliable metric for tracking their socalled beneficial interests as well as marriotts unfettered process of adding and restricting access to properties in the underlying land trust finally as defendants continue to exploit and profit from the mvc product owners of legacy timeshares aslo suffer due to continued and increasing interference with their and actual ownership interests and marriotts unlawful exchange and reservation procedures that restrict their ability to use and

and none compare to marriott excellent location walk to restaurants and shops it is the perfect island life by howardh jan   the property is getting tired and is in need of refurbishment inside the units the linens barely fit the beds there is limited drawer space in the bedrooms be prepared to listen to all day announcements at the pool after am with amplified water aerobics music then daily bingo then happy hour it can be difficult to find a quiet spot at the pool however there are plenty of beach huts which are quiet but there is an additional fee to use them the drinks are not cheap and they are weak the service at the indoor restaurant champions is poor by jocelynb sep   our home away from home have been owners for  years and have gone every other year only bc we need variety on offyears simply love everything about it by danl updated may   great resort for families and couples convenient location and clean resort by ginaf updated may   love this resort only complaint is the palapa rental procedure needs a bit of updating too but i believe that is underway  by moninab updated dec   i love love love this place absolutely worth staying here love the marriott auba ocean club trillion stars by judithm nov   quiet lovely rooms with all the amenities and morenot the crazy pace of the surf club pool is less busy and noisy staff helpful everything is beautiful by vivians jul   great vacation place great location and great service by matthewl feb   just came back from a  night stay in aruba and my wife and i had a wonderful stay i found renting through redweekcom to be an excellent experience and would defiantly do it again i rented from florence holmes and she was a pleasure to deal with we found the ocean club to be far superior to the surf club everything is very convenient and getting chairs at  by the pool every day was never an issue the one issue we had at the pool was the spotty internet service i know we are supposed to be on island time but the truth of the matter is that most people feel the need to stay connected to family friends and work i have att and had zero service at the pool or in the lobby it only worked well when i was in my room for some reason my wife on the other hand has verizon and she was able to access the internet at the pool and in the lobby i think the beaches in front of the marriott properties are the biggest and the best in aruba the beaches in front of the other hotels are not nearly as big the ocean club offers bingo on a daily basis along with other activities the pool bar was always busy and we met a lot of friendly people throughout the week the bartender wilma was out favorite we enjoyed wonderful dinners at the nearby restaurants i think madam jenette was out favorite however i think simply fish went downhill most of the fish they offer is not local the service was the worst we had all week and my wife and i both sent back the tuna we ordered for dinner it was at best a  thick which in our minds was unacceptable for i think  tuna steaks should be much thicker cut to allow for a proper sear in defense of the simply fish management they truly tried to resolve the issue but by that time it was too late we paid for our apps and drinks and were ready to leave the unsung hero of the week was the pelican nest you can walk there from the ocean club and eat on the pier over the water i would recommend for any dinner you have in aruba to make a reservation in hindsight i wish i made reservations weeks prior to my arrival to ensure i got into every restaurant i wanted to dine wacky wahoo was the one restaurant that was completely booked all week that i was unable get a reservation the restaurant is supposedly very small if i could recommend one thing to all of the folks in the aruba service industry is to be friendlier in my  experiences on the island i found a lot of the locals lacking customer service skills on several different occasions of course the worst part is leaving if its on a saturday give yourself  hours to get through multiple security checkpoints and us customs sunday is a whole different story not nearly as busy i hope you find this review helpful by franks sep   we fell in love with aruba and the marriott ocean club several years ago  and it continues to be the best vacation spot we have been to guaranteed weather most times of the year with the breezes always present to keep you cool and relaxed upscale property with the feel of home not as congested as the surf club next door activities if you wish very relaxing atmosphere something for everyone never disappoints by angelodamico updated aug   just came back from our th trip to aruba in june  love the island the people the weather the food especially the marriot ocean club try simply fish right on the marriott beach for a sunset show and dinner by maryl mar   we love the ocean club we were there for presidents week and it did not feel crowded at all the check in process was very easy rooms are not ready before pm we like to relax by the quiet pool there is plenty of shade and sunshine plus you can take a dip in the pool to cool off also the hot tub is just above it so very convenient the room was great even the utensils were nice we stayed at another timeshare the week before and you can tell the difference in the quality of the supplies and the friendliness of the staff also it has free internet and the tv channels are very similar to our cable in the us they do need to update the laundry facilities only  dryer was working on our floor and two washers by jackiel feb   it appears that a more current review for the resort is needed checked in was smooth and our room request was once again fulfilled the coconut trading company has been replaced by a beach shop otherwise all others remain the same complex looks in great shape and the gardeners work meticulously during the day keeping up with the landscaping pool maintenance and cleaning starts at sunrise the towel hut line remains the place to congregate very early in the morning seems like the spot to catch up with friends made from years past when you cant sleep would be nice to see more straight chairs placed around the pool the beach is cleaned daily staff is still as friendly as ever some down sides if you want to know in desperate need of new washerdryers and the activities leave a lot to be desired the price of drinks at happy hour are ridiculous we find that most of our friends go to a different resort during that time or make in the room and bring down to the pool found security sleeping at pool one morning by donna nov   we have owned  weeks in a  bd unit at the ocean club since  and have been using them almost every year we were there recently from    and couldnt be more pleased about the condition of the units and the friendliness of the people the beds sleep wonderful we also love the casino in the marriott hotel next door and for those who dont know if you sign up for a players card you can get room comps for food and beverage on your ocean club unit when you check out that is a nice plus for those who like to visit the casino the pool area is nice but nothing seems to change about the reserving of chairs i was pleasantly surprised that the pool personnel will address people who attempt to smoke in non smoking areas you always have those who think rules dont apply to them we ate at ruths chris steak house at the hotel and the food was superb as usual we also ate at champions at the ocean club a couple of times there is so much shopping entertainment and food venues nearby that it would be hard not to find something to do by toddc updated jun   as good as it gets by robertak updated may   my family prefers the ocean club to either the hotel or the surf club because it is approx  the size of the surf club and quieter than either the hotel or the surf the advantage is that you are in an uncrowded resort especially around the pool situated in between the other two resorts the hotel has the best casino on the island the spa is at the ocean club and all  resorts offer a variety of restaurants in every price range all of marriotts aruba properties are beautiful and well maintained i own at both the ocean club and the surf club you cant go wrong with aruba and marriott has the best places on the island walk along the beach and you can easily access all the other hotels their restaurants and casinos new shopping malls multiplex cinema many new restaurants and bowling are all in walking distance by alr apr   we have been staying at both marriott ocean and surf clubs for a few years both are great resort weve found ocean club more to our liking its more upscale than surf and not crowded at all we try to stay at the ocean club a few weeks per year its more expensive than surf but its well worth it by colleenc feb   we just spent a week at marriotts aruba ocean club is a beautiful resort and we could not find a single thing to complain about taxi from the airport to the resort was  we rented a beach hut every day for  per day is money well spent the pool area is beautiful and spacious the resort is beautiful the landscaping is out of this world the word paradise kept going thru my mind food and drinks reasonably priced we had maid service one day of the week and that was fine the condos have everything you need my only wish would be that they had a washer and dryer but there are washer and dryers on each floor many restaurants to choose from casinos arent vegas style and i dont think you would ever really win much if anything on the machines but it was fun drinks are free if you are playing there is a grocery store nearby for  taxi ride our driver waited for us while we grocery shopped we made sure it was worth his while since he was so nice in offering the airport doesnt open until  am so if you have an early flight dont make the mistake we did in getting there at  the airport is very nice with quite a few shops and restaurants we had a view of the iguana sanctuarywhich was nice lots of visible security so we never felt that safety was an issue i would definitely recommend this resort to anyone its absolutely beautiful very clean the beach is beautiful one of the best places we have ever been and we have been to alot of places very family oriented loved it by kathyh aug   without a doubt one of the best locations in the caribbean aruba is safe and has a dedicated and friendly staff the ocean club is perfect for families too we have been  times the restaurants are five star too enjoy by ncowen updated jun   we have been very pleased with the resort in total beach is reserved for ocean club owners and guests and not crowded like surf clubs beach gorgeous property great for families or a couples getaway by waynek apr   been there for  years some years a month at a time  the place is super by charlottes feb   weve had the opportunity to stay at the marriott ocean club resort  times with our family or friends  have thoroughly enjoyed it each timesome of our best vacations ever so many things to do  so close to everything just walk outside to the pool or beach  a short drive or taxi ride into town by darleen jan   i really depend on these reviews to help me make a decision on my destination so here goes the resort is very good no problems except the beach we have been to quite a few caribbean islands at christmas time and i have never been so disappointed in a beach in all the times we have traveled it is so crowded that there is nothing beautiful or relaxing about it we have never seen so many cabanas and every one of them packed with chairs and people all day long the beach water is also disgusting the so called beach appears man made if you really want to spend your money and time at a typical beautiful tropical beach do not stay at this resort by gregs dec   a beautiful resort and beach with a very friendly staff by dorothyp updated jun   visited the week of june th it was a fabulous property we were very happy with our stay at the ocean club staff very friendly and efficient d and l piteo by juliea updated apr   i visit aruba ocean club two or three times a year it is always a pleasure staying at this  star resort i have been to many other caribbean islands but none of them come close to arubas ocean club the people there cant do enough for you they are far the nicest and most polite people i have ever met the island is safe to walk around in any time of the day or night there are a few supermarkets on the island that are very big and clean and offer everything we have back home the drinking water is one of the most delicious water that i have ever tasted and the food is out of this world marriott ocean club has the largest rooms on the island this island has every convenience that we have in the states there is something for everyone in the family you never get bored there are water sports for adults and children fishing parasailing snorkling horseback ridding and one of the biggest casinos on the island is right next door across the street there is a newly built plaza with restaurants shops and a nice movie theater the beaches are clean long and beautiful and the weather is perfect with always a nice breeze the resorts rooms are absolutely gorgeous and the best part is that aruba is only  hours from newark airport there is nothing negative to be said about this resort only that you cant find anywhere better than this as a package deal this resort is absolutely perfect julie a by davidt jan   i just returned from the ocean club and found it to be delightful the units are modern clean and well maintained as usual the only drawback i noticed is that they have cut back on the daily exchange of towels both in your rooms and at the towel hut there is a once a week cleaning of your room free of charge with clean towels provided any additional requests for clean room towels are for a fee at the end of the day the towel hut always ran out of towels so often you would have to wait in line the next morning for a clean beach towel all in all the stay was nice and the weather was beautiful unfortunately aruba is getting busier each year with more  more buildings and stores popping up everywhere its starting to loose a little of its appeal because of that by rhondam oct   ive been an owner at the aruba ocean club for  years my family and i look forward to our time there year after year there is always something fun to do lots of water activities along the beautiful beach site seeing horse back riding atvs snorkeling and scuba diving boating fishing great resturants night activities casinos and of course lots of sunshine  the timeshares are very roomy clean and beautifully decorated you wont be disappointed by berniced aug   i have had great vacations here the lazy river pool allows you to spend the day floating in the water or head down to the beach to float in ocean water i love the short walk to the hotel for great sushi in the lobby by vickic updated jul   just returned from an excellent week at the marriott my  br unit was huge clean and had an awesome view staff could not have been more pleasant or efficient the system they use for the palapas beach huts works well you can either reserve an odd numbered unit for up to  days for a small fee or use one of the even numbered ones on a firstcome basis there always seemed to be enough huts many people have mentioned the cost of food being exceptionally high i disagree after traveling extensively throughout the islands in fact i thought there were more reasonably prices choices than many other resorts plus you have a kitchen if you do not choose to go out for every meal beach area was quieter than the pool area but neither were particularly loud i found the resort very relaxing and i would return there for sure by briank updated mar   stayed here in march  and had a great time the property and unit was clean and the staff was friendly was very glad i choose the ocean club rather than the surf club for me being able to get a beach hut each morning was important you have plenty of space so you are not on top of your neighbor at the beach i struggled chosing between the surf club and ocean club while the surf club is newer and some consider cosmetically nicer be prepared to be packed in like sausages on the beach or at the pool it appears the surf club overbuilt for the amount of frontage they have the ocean club was just a little more laid back and fewer screaming little ones than the surf club if you have a young family they will enjoy the lazy river at the surf club be prepared food is very very expensive in aruba that being said it was a nice trip by fainag dec   we just came back from a weeklong vacation at mariotts ocean club i loved everything there the property was amazing the staff was very friendly and helpful it was clean and whatever we had to be done was done they have a person there who reserves all your trips and makes restaurants arrangements the front desk people were very friendly and tried to help us as much as possible the room that we had was specious and bright it had a partial ocean view but we didnt spend that much time in the room anyway we travelled with a  yearold toddler you dont need to bring a crib and a high chairthey give it to you the kitchen was fully stacked and they have a supermarket nearby and it has anything you wish for american and local stuff we rented a car for the duration of our trip and i recommend you doing the same its not that much a day but you have freedom to go anywhere any time cob costs about  each way but the car cost us about  a day which we thought was a good deal especially with the child parking is free or it costs very little the beach was clean and we didnt have a problem reserving palapas they were always available overall it was an great vacation and i would definately return to aruba and marriott by lanitap may   when i booked this trip i was a bit skeptical of aruba for my kids as i thought there wasnt much to see or do here and the airfare to get here was too expensive for a relaxing vacationwas i ever wrong we stayed in the marriott ocean club a beautiful resort with all the amenities of a hotel the only other large resort developer on the island is named divi aruba who had just as nice accomadations but there site was a little more spread out marriotts site has all the restaurants entertainment beaches and other amenities just a short walk away we rented a car which i suggest and chose to take avis insurance because if you damage a car in aruba you have to pay for the damages before you leave and get reimbursed by your insurance company when you return to the states we arrived at the resort and got placed in room  which was on the nd floor of the main building it was a garden view in which we had a great view of the pool and if we turned our heads to the left we could see the beach our room was a br with a  person jacuzzi tub  person shower and a sleeper sofa the kitchen had granite counters and a breakfast bar the resort had a great pool although you couldnt use the pool at the marriott surf club i didnt mind as the ocean club was much less crowded and congested and had a more cozy feel to it than the surf club the beach was riddled with covered huts called palapas with beach lounge chairs under them and if you wanted one in the morning you could just reserve it for free however i was always able to get a front row palapas no matter if i reserved one or not we packed seasoned meat that i froze and precooked minute maid rice for dinner i also preordered online eggs ham cheese bread and milk for our breakfast that we picked up from the onsite market when we arrived it was already packed and ready to go my first evening here we just relaxed by the beach watching the sunset and drinking a pina coladayum we went to the beach packed a picnic lunch  drinks from our room and dipped in the beach my  complaint about this resort and this part of aruba was the sand was hard with lots of crushed seashells and if you didnt wear swim shoes you could cut your feet the beach water temp was warm and blue with pirate ships wind surfers and other water sports right onsite and in view they had a band playing in the background and iguanas roamed freely the onsite casino which we didnt feel paid out to well and they had high bet minimums at the tables we play black jack starting at  so we went up the road to the alahambra casino that paid out well and we could play black jack for  a hand the large gym rivals some gyms you may pay for a membership to join then went out to explore some of aruba on our own mostly everything in aruba will be closed on sunday a short walk down the beach will take you to the bar called moombas for drinks dinner at smokey joes a fantastic rib joint where the rib dish was about  and they had these great jaimacan beef pattiesyum yum they usually had another band playing all day and you can make dinner reservations for madam jeanettes a cozy romantic carribean  dutch restaurant they have pastries and ice cream at the elaborate snack bar in the casino definately reserv the  hour jeep tour which is the best tour for you  at  pp and includes a great lunch and all the sites the island has to offer in  swoop we went on the tour with abc for the  hr tour of aruba that covered the natural pool baby beach the oldest catholic church in aruba the caves ostrige farm old gold mines the natural bridge and the lighthousedefinitely well worth every penny we came back the room and had dinner at simply fish a restaurant on marriott property located on the beach at the marriott where we were staying we enjoyed the dinner location and the service dont leave without stopping at lindas pancakes for a late brunchyum yum then we turned in the car went flew home definitely a do over vacation the marriott aruba ocean club far exceeded our expectations and is a definite do over by petere feb   have stayed at the aruba ocean club several times and love it more each time we stay we purchased here  years ago and are very happy with the resort the beach is beautiful the pool area is not crowded and we feel safe whenever we stay at the ocean club by robertm updated jul   we have gone every year for the past  years no other place on the island can compare the staff is exceptional and always willing to go the extra mile to make everyone happy by robertl may   we love the marriott ocean club smaller and more cosy than the surf club but with the same amenities great for families or couples by michael jan   we just returned from the aruba ocean club and liked the facility very much with one exception  out of control kids running up and down the hallway and slamming doors at all hours of the day and night running kids everywhere including the pool area etc other than that we loved it we will definitely go again maybe at a quieter time than during the week after new years eve by james updated dec   stayed at the ocean club december   this is a very nice resort and we enjoyed it very much because of its more intimate atmosphere i actually liked it more than the marriot surf club next door i would most definitely return to the marriot ocean club in the future by bruce oct   we sent our daughter and new soninlaw here for their honeymoon in august of this year they had nothing but great things to say about the facilities and the usual excellant service from the marriott staff as a matter of fact  my daughter is pretty picky and she had absolutely nothing bad to say about the entire experience she has convinced us to exchange our week another year our home resort is cypress harbor for ourselves  by peter jun   the best in aruba by maureenpendleton updated feb   we have stayed and bought at the marriott ocean club and
