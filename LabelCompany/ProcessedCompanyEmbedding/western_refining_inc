stations and convenience stores the western refining owns and operates four refineries with a total crude oil capacity of approximately  barrels per day bpd in addition to a  bpd refinery in el paso texas and as the result of the may   acquisition of giant industries western refining owns and operates a  bpd refinery on the east coast of the united states near yorktown virginia and two refineries in the four corners region of northern new mexico with a combined throughput capacity of  bpd western refining operates in three business segments the refining group the wholesale group and the retail group the western refinings refining group operates the four refineries and related refined products terminals and asphalt terminals at its refineries it refines crude oil and other feedstocks into finished products such as gasoline diesel fuel jet fuel and asphalt the western refinings refineries market finished products to a diverse customer base including wholesale distributors and retail chains its retail group operates service stations and convenience stores and sells gasoline diesel fuel and merchandise its wholesale group distributes gasoline diesel fuel and lubricant products as of february   western refining owned and operated  retail service stations and convenience stores in arizona colorado and new mexico a fleet of crude oil and finished product truck transports and a wholesale petroleum products distributor western refining wholesale inc which operates in arizona california colorado nevada new mexico texas and utah ceo david foster came to el paso in  to manage an existing refinery that was then in bankruptcy in  foster and his managers bought the refinery from the creditors three years later the same group bought another contiguous refinery both of these facilities dated to before world war ii but had been modernized extensively by  in january  they took the operation public at  per share and paid off all of the western refining’s debt then in may of last year came the acquisition of giant with three more refineries and the retail locations in arizona colorado and new mexico this is a management team that definitely eats its own cooking ceo foster owns  of the western refining and together the management and the directors own over  of the outstanding stock in addition management’s annual bonuses are paid in restricted stock so that up to two thirds of their annual compensation every year comes in the form of stock i think that we can expect this management to act like the owners they are us refining capacity petroleum refining is a competitive business with much of western refining’s competition coming from bigger companies and from large international oil companies that produce some or all of the crude that they refine it is a cyclical business whose profitability tends to run separately from the price of crude oil there are certainly questions about western refining’s near term prospects with the price of crude oil at historic highs and the prospect that high gas prices that may cause customers to drive less this summer western refining’s margins decreased in the third quarter of  because of merger related administrative costs in the fourth quarter the western refining lost  million the loss was caused by low margins the price gasoline did not keep up with the increase in the price of crude oil maintenance problem at the yorktown refinery and pipeline problems in el paso mr market ever vigilant passed judgment by discounting the price of the western refining’s stock from the mid sixties to the low teens whether his judgment is rational and reasonable or mostly emotional is the question that we are trying to answer here there has been a general decline in price of all the refiners valero energy is down to  from a high of  alon is at  down from  and frontier from a high of  is now at  see chart below western refining inc year december  in millions except share data        net sales

capital spending      jim grant in his january  letter had this to say about the current price to the stock just to judge by the collapse in the share price youd never suppose that western refining wnr has boosted its refining capacity by  since the completion of a contentious merger with giant industries last year in fact youd probably guess that the merger was stillborn crack spreads ie refining margins had turned negative fuel cells had wholly displaced gasoline and americas towns and cities were clamoring for the privilege of building a new refinery not at all in fact crack spreads hover above their fiveyear averages gasoline remains americas preeminent automotive fuel and at least in the matter of refinery construction nimby is still americas mindset in fact u s refining capacity has remained flat for the last  years the countries  refineries currently handle  million barrels a day in  there were twice as many refineries that were capable of refining about the same amount of crude as a result of the failure to add capacity today we import  million barrels of refined products gasoline diesel and jet fuel port arthur on april  the wall street journal ran a story reporting that royal dutch shell plc and saudi aramco are in the process of spending  billion to expand their refinery at port arthur texas from  barrels a day capacity to  barrels a day the cost of this project on a barrel per day basis  billion divided by  is  per barrel in comparison western refining paid  per barrel for giant industry’s capacity and mr market thinks they are both crazy it is interesting that the market has decided that the refining capacity is worth so much less than what shell and aramco are willing to spend to build new capacity it is not likely that western refining’s older facilities would ever be able to operate as efficiently as the facilities that shell will build but still the discount  does not seem particularly rational by this measure of value buying western refining is buying dollars for  western refining crack spreads during the fourth quarter of   of western refining’s operating income came from the refineries so western refining is still mostly in the business of refining crude oil because of this the western refining’s profitability or lack thereof is almost totally dependent upon the crack spread the difference between what it costs the western refining to buy crude oil and the price at which it can sell its refined products for refiners in general profits tend to be seasonal with the second and third quarters strong because the crack spreads tend to be higher during the summer driving season in the short term the stocks of refiners are primarily a speculation on crack spreads and in that sense things should be getting better over the next couple of quarters the first quarter is now over and we know that spreads in the first quarter were considerably better that they were in the fourth quarter the crack spreads in the first quarter were back to about where they were in the third quarter of  a level that barring any nasty surprises we have not heard about yet should generate a nice profit for western refining margins like the third quarter of  should give the western refining  to  per share earnings in the first quarter progress on any of their operational issues would allow better results because the operating profit for a refiner is not dependent upon the price of crude oil it is possible for refining margins to decline as oil prices are increasing which is what happened in the third and fourth quarter of  at the same time falling crude oil prices can make for happy refiners the table below is a list of the operating income of western refining and three of their competitors the biggest and oldest of these is valero energy corp although valero is quite a bit larger than western refining their operations are similar and prior to western refinings merger with giant industries their operating margins were about the same this was particularly true in   and first two quarters of  the operating profit at frontier oil are considerably higher than the other refiners in this table because their two refineries in cheyenne wyoming and el dorado kansas are able to process a higher percentage of heavy crude current market value of refining capacity company market capitalization  millions capacity barrels per day market value per barrel per day western refining    valero energy    alon energy    frontier oil    frontier processes about  of total production as heavy crude this compares to western refining’s refineries which currently refines about  heavy crude at el paso yorktown should be able to refine  heavy crude but maintenance problems have kept yorktown in the red since the mergerboth companies refine considerable quantities of west texas intermediate crude while the west texas crude generally runs  to  per barrel cheaper than light sweet crude the difference between heavy and light crude has been running from  to  per barrelwe can see from the table that refining margins were strong during ’s when crude prices were declining but weak from  to  and  and  in the short term it is likely that refining margins will remain weak as crude prices increases but with a long term perspective it is interesting that these margins even with the hurricane spike in  and  still are not back where they were in the early nineteen nineties refining margins fell in the fourth quarter of  because the price of crude oil was increasing while gasoline prices failed to keep pace probably because seasonal weakness valero’s operating margin in the fourth quarter was  about one fourth of the rate in the second quarter but also less than half its rate in the fourth quarter of  for western refining their fourth quarter resulted in a loss but refining margins were not the only problem there were also maintenance problems at yorktown and pipeline problems at el paso below is a list of potential factors that will affect western refining’s profit level for the next year or two western refinings operating profit as a percentage of revenue   western refining

gasoline diesel and jet fuel fail to follow maintenance expenses at western refining refineries come in above estimates a hurricane hits yorktown virginia the yorktown refinery is on the virginia coast and is vulnerable to damage from any hurricane that strikes this area western refining fails to realize cost synergy’s it expects from merger western refining’s merger and the debt that resulted from the purchase of giant industries together with current conditions in the debt market have cut the western refining’s margin for error a prolonged period low refining margins or a series of serious maintenance problems at its refineries could cause financial problems western refining good news refining margins recover to levels seen in the last three years the four corners refineries are able to acquire enough crude to approach operational capacity versus present operation at  of capacity before the merger in  giant industries purchased a pipeline that runs from west texas  miles to northwestern new mexico that had been idle for seven years the company has refurbished the pipeline and in late  put it back on line prior to  the only supply available to the four corners refineries was from local producers that were able command a high price for their crude even with this local production there was not enough crude available to run these refineries at full capacity the yorktown refinery returns to profitable operation yorktown operated at a loss in the second half of  in spite of its ability to process heavy crude with up to  of its capacity and so should be western refining’s most profitable refinery these production problems appear to be related to crude oil purchased by giant that is causing maintenance problems purchases of this crude have been terminated a hurricane hits the western gulf coast western refining has no refineries exposed to the gulf coast hurricanes in  and  damaged refineries along the gulf coast and the resulting temporary reduction of refining capacity this caused a spike in refining margins western refining is able to successfully raise its overall capacity for heavy crude from  before the merger and  after the merger to their projected goal of  by the summer of  merger synergies are successfully realized western refining projects  to  million reduction in administrative costs as a result of the merger all things considered it appears a good deal of the potential bad news has been discounted by current price while short term prospects for the industry are indeed cloudy the known risks are mostly in the price of western refining’s stock any good news will be a surprise and with short interest high any good news could causes a sharp rally in the stock short interest in the stock has been increasing rapidly since december  in december there were  shares held short by march  short interest had jumped to  shares and by march  the figure was  shares this is about  of the western refining’s  million share float it appears that the shorts smell blood and are piling on big time this is a factor that will tend to prolong the present down trend but is at the same time is piling up ammunition for an eventual rally at the end of march the western refining was even appearing on lists of stock with naked short positions richard loschs blog search form search main menu home client service investment philosophy blog

objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a

make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump
