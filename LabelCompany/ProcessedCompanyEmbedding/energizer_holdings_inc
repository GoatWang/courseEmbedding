easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal

what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago the crux of this approach is comparing the most accurate estimate to the zacks consensus estimate although the zacks rank is also an important feature of the esp metric combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report and hopefully surge higher in price too in fact when

reconciliation of gaap and nongaap measuresfor the quarter and six months ended march  the company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap  however management believes that certain nongaap financial measures provide users with additional meaningful comparisons to the corresponding historical or future period these nongaap financial measures exclude items that are not reflective of the companys ongoing operating performance such as costs related to the spin restructuring activities acquisition and integration costs and gains on sale of real estate  in addition these measures help investors to analyze year over year comparability when excluding currency fluctuations acquisition activity as well as other company initiatives that are not ongoing  we believe these nongaap financial measures are an enhancement to assist investors in understanding our business and in performing analysis consistent with financial models developed by research analysts investors should consider nongaap measures in addition to not as a substitute for or superior to the comparable gaap measureswe provide the following nongaap measures and calculations as well as the corresponding reconciliation to the closest gaap measure in the following supplemental schedulessegment profit  this amount represents the operations of our three
