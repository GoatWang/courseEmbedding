holiday season the retail industry typically sees a large boost in sales leading up to the holidays in november and december buckle is no different as the companys fourth quarter sales are nearly

industry overview porters five force rivalry among existing firms high  buckle competes across a highly competitive industry in which consumers are incentivized by fashion selection quality price location and shopping experience buckle competes with many specialty retailers department stores local or regional department stores boutique specialty shops and mail order and internet retailers  are just some of buckles competitors abercrombie  fitch and hiollister anf aeropostale aro american eagle aeo ascena retail group asna the parent company of maurices express expr forever  gap gps metropark pacsun psun vanity wet seal wtsla bonton bont dillards dds macys m nordstrom jwn are the competitors buckle listed in their  annual report threat of new entrants high  the retail store industry is always emerging especially in the trendy fashion scene in which bke operates the barriers to entry are insignificant and companies can often times become obsolete or go bankrupt if they are unable to stay current with consumer fashion trends threat of substitutes low  because clothing offers few alternatives and buckle offers a wide range of products that align with their target market fashion preferences their is little threat of substitutes competition is a much larger threat to the industry buyer power highmedium  individual consumers have low switching costs on where they purchase their jeans and therefore buckle has limited power in raising prices if raw material costs eg cotton increase furthermore consumer trends have a whole are a real concern to retailers  where style trends can make a once prospering specialty retailer obsolete by the end of a season buckles merchandise team works to ensure buckle is able to anticipate identify and adapt to changing consumer demands however its ability to do so in the future is not guaranteed supplier power lowmedium  buckle is not materially dependent any one vendor in  only two vendors accounted for more than  of net sales koos manufactoring inc the manufacturer of the majority of bke proprietary brands accounted for  of net sales and miss merock revival accounted for  other significant vendors include mek silver jeans buffalo jeans hurley billabong afflication sinful archaic obey roar rvca fox and fossil although individually these vendors cannot materially affect buckles operations their s ability to carry a wide and diversified product line that aligns with consumer trends is vital to their operations swot strengths buckle has a history and a reputation for its denim selection and attention to the individual customer experience it uses a diverse product portfolio to appeal and draw out their intended target audience buckles key differentiators are a lot more easier to emulate through inperson transactions nonetheless buckle has been expanding its online platform reaching  of net sale sin  weaknesses there are many wellestablished competitors with a larger market share and possible better brand equity than buckle with the recent economic slowdown many consumers of bke are dipping down into a more affordable price range further bke is sensitive to consumer spending and general economic conditions opportunity buckle management continue to focus on a realistic growth platform having recently penetrated the northeastern united states opening its first four stores in the region during  buckle will continue to target the region with plans of opening its first store in massachusetts and rhode island during  in addition to its growth strategy management is also improving margins by promoting and growing its proprietary brand and continue to hone its supply chain operations in  buckle completed the construction of a new  square foot distribution center in kearney nebraska  the companys only operating store distribution center the company also leverages their management information systems mis to improve efficiencies threats competitiors remain the most prominent threat to bke many of the companys competitors are considerably larger and have substantially greater financial marketing and other resources than buckle  of  buckle stores are located in shopping malls for continued successful growth bke will have to continue to be effective at competing for favorable locations and lease terms where competition for prime locations can be intense further the retail apparel industry often has unpredictable fashion swings with trends changing very often buckle needs to keep ahead of the curve which is a huge challenge for all clothing retailers they have done this so far however the main threat for bke is loosing market share competitor analysis anytime i refer to buckles peers peer group comparable or comparable peers i am including the following companies all of which were listed as competitors in buckles  annual report and unless otherwise noted am referring to a mean average of the companies included specialty retailers abercrombie  fitch company anf  abercrombie  fitch co through its subsidiaries operates as a specialty retailer of casual apparel for men women and kids the company sells casual sportswear apparel including knit and woven shirts graphic tshirts fleece jeans and woven pants shorts sweaters outerwear personal care products and accessories under the abercrombie  fitch abercrombie kids and hollister brands it also offers bras underwear sleepwear and athome products for women under the gilly hicks brand the company sells products through its stores directtoconsumer operations and websites which include abercrombiecom abercrombiekidscom hollistercocom and gillyhickscom as of january   it operated  stores in north america europe and asia abercrombie  fitch is a sizable competitor of buckle abercrombie has much more size and reach  with over a  stores and an international unit additionally abercrombie strictly sells proprietary products their brand is well recognized and targets the same demographic as buckle it is interesting to see anf has a desirable gross margin to bke probably because their proprietary brands return a higher margin than buckles private label business this preferable margin though doesnt make it past sga expenses as bke has more than three times the operating margin and profit margin aeropostale aro  aeropostale inc operates as a mallbased specialty retailer of casual apparel and accessories it designs markets and sells merchandise principally targeting  to  yearold young women and men the company offers a collection of apparel including graphic tshirts tops bottoms sweaters jeans and outerwear as well as accessories including sunglasses belts socks and hats it also offers casual clothing and accessories focusing on elementary school children between the ages of  and  in addition the company sells its products through its ecommerce website aeropostalecom as of march   it operated  aeropostale stores in  states and puerto rico  aeropostale stores in canada and  ps from aeropostale stores in  states aeropastle targets the youngest portion of buckles demographic because they take a low cost leader approach and only cross several years into bkes target market  aeropsatle is not a key competitor to buckle nonetheless it is interesting to see aros favorable rations unfortunately because of their place in the market many remain bullish on aeropastle on increasing price competition amongst teen competitors ongoing high teen unemployment and increasing cost of goods as commodities continue to run american eagle outfitters aeo  american eagle outfitters inc operates as an apparel and accessories retailer in the united states and canada the company offers denim wear sweaters graphic tshirts fleece outerwear and accessories under the american eagle outfitters brand name targeting  to  year old men and women and clothing and accessories for kids ages  to  through online under the kids by american eagle brand name and for babies under the brand name little it also provides a collection of dormwear intimates and personal care products for girls under aerie by american eagle brand name as of january   the company operated  american eagle outfitters stores  aerie standalone stores and  kids stores in addition it sells merchandise through its ecommerce web sites including aecom aeriecom and kidscom further the companys online business aeo direct ships its products to  countries worldwide american eagle outfitters inc was founded in  and is headquartered in pittsburgh pennsylvania american eagle is very similar to abercrombie  fitch in its competition to bke aeo has considerable size on buckle despite the apparent benefits of scale buckle is still able to return a higher operating and profit margin  by keeping costs low express expr  express inc operates specialty retail stores in the united states the companys stores offer apparel and accessories for women and men between  and  years old across various aspects of the lifestyles comprising work casual jeanswear and goingout occasions it also sells gift cards as of january   the company operated  stores including  dualgender stores  womens stores and  mens stores located primarily in hightraffic shopping malls lifestyle centers and street locations in  states throughout the united states the district of columbia and puerto rico in addition it operates seven express stores in saudi arabia kuwait and the united arab emirates through its development agreement with alshaya trading co and sells its products through ecommerce website expresscom the most interesting observation in comparing bke with expr is their high return on equity ratios despite both having relatively high roe ratios both companies get their in their own distinct ways for bke it is margins that really drive the high roe its ebit margin was  in  compared to expr with  margin however express is able to derive a higher roe by turning over its product a little more frequently through heavy incentives and markdowns the opposite strategy of bke and significantly higher leverage ratio buckle had a financial leverage ration of  in  compared to express with  leverage both companies have admirable roes  but arrive at the metric in distinct ways gap gps  the gap inc operates as a specialty retailing company the company offers clothing accessories and personal care products for men women children and babies under the gap old navy banana republic piperlime and athleta brand names its products include wardrobe basics such as denim khakis and tshirts fashion apparel casual apparel and accessories maternity apparel womens underwear sleepwear loungewear and sports and active apparel and shoes and accessories the company also franchises agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate gap and banana republic stores worldwide as of march   it operated approximately  stores in the united states the united kingdom canada france japan and ireland the company also offers its products through catalogs as well as gapcom bananarepubliccom oldnavycom piperlimecom and athletacom web sites gap operates a portfolio of specialty retailers although a single brand may not be a meaningful competitor of buckle the conglomerate of gap inc certainly offers scalability and resources that bke cannot match similar to american eagle and abercrombie  fitch it is interesting to observe the differences in gross operating and profit margin to demonstrate how cost effective buckle is able to operate it is interesting to note that none of buckles competitors have been successful or interesting in implementing its cost savvy operating methods pacific sunwear of california psun  pacific sunwear of california inc together with its subsidiaries operates as a specialty retailer in the action sports fashion and music influences of the california lifestyle the company sells casual apparel and a selection of accessories and footwear to teens and young adults it operates mallbased chain of retail stores under the pacific sunwear and pacsun names the company also operates an ecommerce website at pacsuncom which sells pacsun merchandise online as of january   it leased and operated  stores in  states and puerto rico pacsun is the most similar retailer to buckle it is apparent when observing the two firms how effective bke has been in taking market share from pacific sunwear the customer centric focus of buckle has allowed it to effectively dismantle the operations and health of pacsun wet seal wtsla  the wet seal inc a specialty retailer operates stores that sell fashionable and contemporary apparel and accessory items designed for female customers the company operates two primarily mallbased chains of retail stores under the wet seal and arden b names its wet seal stores provide fashionable and basic apparel and accessories for teenage girls and arden b stores offer contemporary collections of fashion basic separates and accessories for the feminine contemporary woman in addition the company operates webbased stores including wetsealcom that provides wet seal merchandise and ardenbcom which offers arden b apparel and accessories as of may   it had  stores including  wet seal stores and  arden b stores in  states the district of columbia and puerto rico like all the other specialty retail stores despite having less scale and proprietary products that demand higher margins bke is able to surpass wet seal in returns and margins department stores dillards dds  dillards inc together with its subsidiaries operates as an apparel and home furnishing retailer in the united states the company offers a selection of merchandise including fashion apparel for women men and children as well as accessories cosmetics home furnishings and other consumer goods its merchandise selections comprise lines of brand merchandise such as antonio melani gianni bini roundtree  yorke and daniel cremieux it also sells its merchandise online through its web site dillardscom in addition the company operates as a general contracting construction company as of january   it operated  retail department stores located primarily in the southwest southeast and midwest regions of the united states macys inc m  macys inc together with it subsidiaries operates department stores and internet websites in the united states the companys retail stores and websites sell a range of merchandise including mens womens and childrens apparel and accessories cosmetics home furnishings and other consumer goods as of january   it operated  stores in  states the district of columbia guam and puerto rico under the names macys and bloomingdales as well as websites under macyscom and bloomingdalescom names bonton stores bont  the bonton stores inc through its subsidiaries operates department stores in the midsize and metropolitan markets of the united states its stores offer brandname fashion apparel and accessories for women men and children as well as provide cosmetics home furnishings and footwear as of january   the company operated  stores under various nameplates including the bonton bergners boston store carson pirie scott elderbeerman herbergers and younkers in  northeastern midwestern and upper great plains states and under the parisian nameplate in detroit michigan nordstrom jwn  nordstrom inc a fashion specialty retailer offers apparel shoes cosmetics and accessories for women men and children in the united states the company offers a selection of brand name and private label merchandise it sells its products through various channels including nordstrom fullline stores nordstrom rack offprice stores last chance clearance stores and jeffrey boutiques and through

loyalty program the company also designs and contracts to manufacture private label merchandise sold in its retail stores as of april   it operated  stores including  nordstrom stores  nordstrom racks  jeffrey boutiques and  last chance store located in  states the company was founded in  and is based in seattle washington it becomes fully apparent when analyzing across its department store peers how buckle has truly positioned itself in the marketplace as a boutique retailers with personalized services but yet the platform to leverage department store like selection because of the size of buckles operation relative to department stores it is hard to draw much on an individual analysis but yet a big picture view is necessary to better understanding buckle inc and the industry dynamics additional competitors in addition to those listed above metropark forever  and vanity were listed as competitors but were not included in comparison analysis because they remain privately held and principal information remains private maurices ascena retail group was not included because ascena retail group its publicly traded holding company also operates dress barn and justice retail stores which are not competitors of buckle and make up the majority of the companies revenue hollister is listed as a direct competitor and is owned and operated by abercrombie  fitch in addition to those listed certain local regional department stores and small specialty stores as well as with mail order and internet retailers compete with buckle buckle inc financial and operating metrics comparison figures as of april th  bke had a market cap of  billion dollars nearly half the size of the peer group we used in comparison buckle had  stores in operation with of  square feet per location much smaller than the peer group averages of  stores and  square feet it is important to note that the peer group consists of four department stores  macys m nordstrom jwn bonton bont and dillards d  all of which have much larger stores that focus on serving a more broadly defined target market these department stores are considered peers because similar to buckle the majority of their sales are attributed to nonproprietary brand name products of the remaining retailers in the considered peer group only pacsun psun  have minority sales in privately branded products when you take the department stores out of consideration bke better reflects the peer group average with an average of  square feet per location and  locations but again their is fundamental differences between the average specialty retailer and buckle buckles fewer store locations exposes their promising growth potential however if bke ever wants to reach the size of its larger retail competitors abercrombie  fitch american eagle or pacific sunwear it will need to look to international markets in addition as buckle continues to expand domestically it may soon reach a point of less desirable new store locations however with a sustainable growth rate it appears management is aware of these challenges and that is not an immediate threat to its growth prospects returns and margins the margins of buckle are incredible buckle improved margins for the tenth consecutive year in  and continue to lead its peer group i believe these margins are a result of three factors a lean inventory system premier store locations and customer centric shopping experience lean inventory buckles efficient and effective daily inventory system is leading catalyst to its impressive historical margins each store will receive no more than one of each size of their products and then assess what is selling on a daily basis to determine inventory in the future the daily inventory turnover drives customer traffic as patrons are encouraged to visit the store more regularly to see the latest products any inventory that hasn’t sold quickly is shipped to another store where the product has received higher demand management believes the benefit or limiting the amount of markeddown products exceeds the cost of this daily inventory shipment premier store locations buckles management seeks the most prominent locations in malls often times requesting increased traffic areas it is managements belief that the incremental costs incurred from the more demanded space is more than offset by increased revenue from the marginal traffic and compliments the daily inventory system customer focus as previously discussed buckle often times does what its competitors are not willing or able to do most stores are equipped with an inhouse alterations individual in addition to the unique initiatives discussed previously bke also employs a “customer tracker” where frequent shoppers are documented with their sizes in clothing previous purchases and fashion preferences as new clothing comes in the store that employees feel are good for customers they simply call the customers up individually to inform them of the new item this is the type of customer attention that separates buckle days of working capital finance needed buckle is able to effective manage its working capital to ensure liquidity and solvency it also is effective in reinvesting the free cash flows in high return projects liquidity ratios buckle continues to remain liquid with very limited solvency risk they have never incurred debt to fuel growth and as demonstrated by the metrics above are very effective at investing capital and free cash flows to derive an economic benefit this is not a coincidence there is no reason to believe management cannot be just as effective in the foreseeable future retailer specific operating metrics revenue per square foot and same store sales growth are often time the metrics used in analyzing retailers bke remains well above its peer group in revenue per square foot despite having below par same store sales growth in  its strong revenue per square foot metric is derived from its core differentiators  being able to augment a well educated sales staff with a diversified line of product offerings to offer customers look as opposed to a product  with leads to more customer satisfactions loyalty and a greater percentage of bundle sales transaction of two or more products when combined with managements preferences for higherend leasing space it is my belief bke will continue to be in the top quartile of revenue per square foot in its peer group in addition buckle continues to position itself well for same store sales growth and revenue per square foot by continuously reinvesting in existing stores with a remodeling effort references ↑             buckle annual report ↑ bke  k selected quarterly financial data pg  ↑ abercrombie  fitch co business
