hereby incorporated by reference as if set forth in full hereinbackground of the inventionthe present invention relates generally to pharmaceutical methods and systems for ordering and receiving prescribed medication and in particular to methods and systems for providing information regarding prescribed medication and verifying that the prescribed medication is the medication shippedgenerally a pharmacy compounds and dispenses medication based on order of a physician a health care pharmacy includes other features not generally found in most general pharmacies some features include special administrative features provision of drugs for nursing stations manufacturing of pharmaceutical preparations preparation and revision of a hospital formulary and monitoring the drug regimen of the individual patient ie clinical pharmacy however the additional features provided by the health care pharmacy come with an increased cost in the complexity of the pharmaceutical operationsto assist in the reduction of the complexity of pharmaceutical operations pharmaceutical administrative systems have been implemented the conventional pharmaceutical administrative system allows a pharmacy to receive an order from a health care provider such as a hospital and assist the pharmacy in filling the order also some pharmaceutical administrative systems provide information regarding potential side effects of a particular medication however the conventional pharmaceutical administrative system is often cumbersome to operate and not intuitive to a pharmacist or technician operating the computer systemalso generally the conventional pharmaceutical administrative systems do not have “builtin checks to assist the pharmacist or health care provider in dispensing or preparing prescribed medication for instance medications such as intravenous iv solutions require a specific mixture of ingredients the incorrect amount of one ingredient the wrong ingredient added to the iv solution or a combination of ordered ingredients that has unintended results may prove to be hazardous to the patient receiving the medication also once an iv solution is prepared by the health care provider pharmacy the health care provider upon receipt of the iv solution relies on the label on the iv solution to identify the medication in other words no safeguard to verify the contents of the iv solution is provided to ensure that the medication ordered by the health care provider is “actually” the medication shippedfurthermore conventional pharmaceutical administrative systems are often limited in the information provided to the pharmacy and the health care provider regarding the potential risks and problems associated with a particular medication for instance an iv solution may contain high concentrations of an ingredient that if conveyed to the health care provider may cause the health care provider to order another medication alternatively the health care provider may just want to customize the concentrations or ingredients of a medication based on the information about the particular medicationaccordingly there is a need for pharmaceutical administrative systems and methods in providing flexibility without increased complexity to the health care provider pharmacy in ordering and dispensing medication also the pharmaceutical administrative systems and methods need to verify and provide safeguards to the health care provider to ensure that the medication is properly received and administered furthermore the pharmaceutical administrative systems and methods should provide relevant information for a particular medication and the ability to customize the medicationsummary of the inventionthe present invention provides a pharmaceutical administrative system

operational units although described separately can be configured as a single unit or as a single computing device with a software program incorporating the before mentioned unitsfig  illustrates a flow diagram of one embodiment of operating the pharmacy administrative system of the present invention in step  an order is prepared through the pharmacy network in step  a customer is selected in one embodiment a patient is selected and an associated customer is automatically determined and selected in step  customer information is gathered from the customer unit in step  based on the order specifically the drug being ordered the formulary unit identifies ingredients within the specific drug in step  the option is provided to customize the order and any information related to the order such as the ingredients of the drug or customer contact information based on the order and any customization of the order the order maintenance unit validates the order using a subroutine or subprocess as shown in fig  in step  the order maintenance unit determines if the order is valid or invalid if the order is validated then the order proceeds along in which a medication specific label can be generated or a solubility curve can be viewed and then the process ends once the order is placedhowever if in step  the order maintenance unit does not validate the order then in step  the order maintenance unit can be commanded by the user eg the pharmacist to override the invalidation as a result a medication specific label can be generated or a solubility curve can be viewed and then the process ends once the order is placed however if in step  the invalidation is not overridden then the order maintenance unit notes the improper entries and provides reentry of the information in step  once the reentry of information is complete the process repeats by once again validating the order in step turning back again to the order maintenance unit  of fig  the order maintenance unit is further configured to provide additional safety and convenience features for the pharmacy administrative system these features include generating medication specific labels especially for intravenous iv solutions for customers or patients and notifying and warning a user such as a pharmacist at a pharmacy client system concerning potential problems or issues with a medication orderedin one embodiment the order maintenance unit is further configured to permit customization of ingredients to a medication based on their caloric content the order maintenance unit allows for the selection of the amount of carbohydrates lipids proteins types of proteins and formulary items once selections have been made for a particular medication for an order the order maintenance unit is capable of balancing the order balancing the order ensures that no errors have been made in the customization of the medication if the medication does not balance the order maintenance unit notifies and warns the user eg the pharmacists that an error in the customized medication has occurredin one embodiment the validation of the medication includes balancing electrolytes in a medication an electrolyte is a material that conducts an electric current when it is fused or dissolved in a solvent usually water electrolytes are composed of positively charged species called cations and negatively charged species called anions for example sodium chloride nacl is an electrolyte composed of sodium cations na and chlorine anions cl−as such the order maintenance unit is configured to allow for the selection of the amount of acetate to chloride ratio cation preference and calcium preference once selections have been made for a particular medication for an order the order maintenance unit validates ie balances the order balancing the order ensures that no errors have been made in the selection of the electrolytes in the medication if the medication does not balance the order maintenance unit notifies and warns the user eg the pharmacists that an error in the selection of the electrolytes has occurred in one embodiment the global database contains default values for the electrolytes for a specific medication that are initially used by the order maintenance unitfor an order the order maintenance unit  generates a medication specific label based on the information stored in the global database the medication specific label is outputted or printed through a conventional printer the medication specific label is then affixed to the medication ordered the medication specific label identifies particular information about the medication such as ingredients and other information such as customer and patient names for iv solutions in particular information is provided on the medication specific label concerning mixture of ingredients compatibility of ingredients temperature and precipitation warnings drug interactions and ph requirementsalso for an intravenous solution additional validation operations can be performed to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the medication based on the medication specific labels in one embodiment a refractive index of an iv solution is calculated and the calculated refractive index is stored in the global database the order maintenance unit then retrieves the calculated refractive index from the global database for the specific medication and order furthermore the order maintenance unit generates a medication specific label containing the refractive index for the iv solution thereonhence once the medication specific label is affixed to the iv solution a pharmacy or any customer such as a hospital can verify the integrity of the iv solution for instance the pharmacy or hospital can measure the refractive index of the iv solution and compare the measured refractive index to the printed refractive index on the medication specific label if the indexes match then the pharmacy or hospital can be assured that the iv solution is as labeled however if the indexes do not match then the pharmacy or hospital is alerted to the fact that the iv solution is wrongly labeled and thus should not be usedin one embodiment flame photometry is used for intravenous solution to establish the presence or absence of an element potassium flame photometry is used to calculate the level of potassium in an iv solution and the calculated level of potassium is recorded in the global database for the iv solution the order maintenance unit retrieves the calculated flame photometry from the global database for the specific medication ie the iv solution and for a specific order furthermore the order maintenance unit generates a medication specific label containing the calculated level of potassium for the iv solution thereonhence the pharmacy can verify the level of potassium in the iv solution in one embodiment when the medication reaches its destination ie a hospital the hospital can verify the level of potassium in the iv solution for instance the hospital or pharmacy can measure the level of potassium using a standard test station and compare the measured level of potassium to the printed level of potassium on the medication specific label therefore if the levels match then the hospital or pharmacy can be assured that the iv solution is as labeled if the levels do not match the hospital or pharmacy can make an informed determination if the level of potassium in the iv solution is acceptablethe extent to which a component can be separated from solution can be determined from the solubility product constant obtained by determining the quantity of dissolved substance present in a known amount of saturated solution this value is known as the solubility the solubility can be drastically altered merely by adding to the solution any of the ions that make up the precipitate although solubility can be altered over a wide range the solubility product itself remains practically constant over this same range the solubility is critical because an iv solution that precipitates can extremely harmful to a patientwhere a medication being ordered contains phosphate andor calcium in one embodiment the order maintenance unit is configured to create and view solubility curves for a selected brand of amino acid dextrose and drug additive the order maintenance unit receives data set entries to identify the amino acid dextrose and drug additive and to define the amount or percentages of each item once the data set entries have been assigned for a particular medication for an order and during a validation of the order the order maintenance unit is capable of generating a calcium phosphate solubility curve based on the data set entriesin one embodiment a graphical representation of the calculated calcium phosphate solubility curve is displayed or plotted and presented to the pharmacy client system via a user interface screen or window in a further embodiment a printout of the calculated calcium phosphate solubility curve is provided to a user of the pharmacy client system as such a printout of the calculated calcium phosphate solubility curve can be included in a patients chart or file in another embodiment a calcium phosphate solubility curve is determined by examining the global database for curve data that matches or closely matches the percentages of the selected amino acid dextrose and drug additive in one embodiment other calcium phosphate solubility curves within the range of the calculated calcium phosphate solubility curve that are stored in the global database are identified and are available to the order maintenance unit to be selectively viewedthe amount of calcium phosphate in the medication for the order is then determined by the order maintenance unit if the amount of calcium phosphate is above the calcium phosphate solubility curve then the calcium phosphate will cause precipitation ie the process of producing a separable solid phase within a liquid medium therefore the order maintenance unit notifies and warns the user eg the pharmacists that an error in the amount of calcium phosphate in the medication has occurredin one embodiment in the event a calcium phosphate solubility curve cannot be identified the ratio of calcium to phosphate is determined the ratio of calcium to phosphate is then compared to a predetermined acceptable amount of calcium and phosphate for the medication from the global database as such if the ratio of calcium to phosphate exceeds the acceptable amount of calcium and phosphate the order maintenance unit notifies and warns the user that an error has occurred the error being that the amount of calcium phosphate in the medication is too high although the order maintenance unit will notify and warn a user regarding an error in the validation of the order the order maintenance provides the user the ability to override ie disregard the errorreferring now to fig  a flow diagram of one embodiment of a subprocess for validating an order for a medication or medications is shown in step  the subprocess determines if the electrolyte preferences of the medication have been modified if in step  the subprocess determines that the electrolyte preferences of the medication have been modified then the order is balanced in step  and in step  the subprocess determines if the order balances for instance the amount of acetate to chloride ratio is evaluated and compared to a predetermined acceptable value for the amount if the ratio exceeds the acceptable value the subprocess notes the problem and issues a warning in step  and then the subprocess ends if in step  the subprocess determines that the electrolyte preferences of the medication have not been modified then the process continues to step  likewise if in step  the subprocess determines that the order balances then the process continues to step in step  the subprocess determines if the caloric content of the medication has been modified then the order is balanced in step  and in step  the subprocess determines if the order balances for instance the amount of lipids is evaluated and compared to a predetermined acceptable value for the amount for the prescribed medication if the amount of lipids exceeds the acceptable value the subprocess notes the problem and issues a warning in step  and then the subprocess ends if in step  the subprocess determines that the caloric content of the medication has not been modified then the process continues to step  likewise if in step  the subprocess determines that the order balances then the process continues to step in step  the amount of calcium and phosphate in the medication is determined if no calcium or phosphate are in the medication then the process continues to step  in step  based on the amount of calcium and phosphate determined the calcium phosphate solubility curve is calculated in step  in step  calcium phosphate solubility of the medication is identified and compared to the calculated calcium phosphate solubility curve if the amount of calcium phosphate exceeds or above the calculated phosphate solubility curve the subprocess notes the problem and issues a warning in step  and then the subprocess ends if in step  the subprocess determines that the amount of calcium phosphate is below or on the calculated phosphate solubility curve then the process continues to step in step  the process determines the refractive index for the iv solution by calculation as described above the process then in step  determines the level of potassium in the iv solution by calculation as described above in step  the process generates a medication specific label including the calculated refractive index and the calculated level of potassium of the iv solution in step  physical tests are performed in one embodiment as described above a physical test is performed by a pharmacy or a customer such as a hospital to determine the refractive index of the iv solution in one embodiment also described above a physical test is also or alternatively performed by the pharmacy or hospital to determine the potassium level of the iv solution in one embodiment the pharmacy or hospital uses flame photometry to determine the potassium level of the iv solution once the physical tests are completed the pharmacy or hospital compares the results of the physical tests to the information on the medication labels eg the potassium level andor the refractive index in step  and then the subprocess ends subsequently if the results of the physical tests do not match the information on the medication labels then the pharmacy or hospital is able to take the appropriate action such as not using and reordering or remake the iv solutionaccordingly the present invention provides a pharmaceutical administrative system and methods that provide increased flexibility in features with greater safeguards although this invention has been described in certain specific embodiments many additional modifications and variations would be apparent to those skilled in the art it is therefore to be understood that this
