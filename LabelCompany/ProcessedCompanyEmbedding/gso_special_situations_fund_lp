shield from frequent client redemptions blackstone group lp is ending its  billion distresseddebt hedge fund and will shift most of the assets into other credit funds that lock up client capitalthe firm said it’s offered investors in its gso special situations fund the option to move assets into other distressed credit pools that don’t feature withdrawals the special situations team led by blackstone partner jason new will continue to oversee the investments“we have decided to transition the investment activities of our hedge fund into our other distressed funds with longerduration drawdown structures” spokeswoman paula chirhart said “these funds better complement our competitive strengths and style of investing and will allow us to generate better riskadjusted returns for our investors” blackstone’s decision is reflective of hedge funds’ desire to shield themselves from quarterly redemptions which can be difficult to bear when investing in markets as volatile as distressed debt in late  marty whitman’s third avenue management had to suspend redemptions in its main credit fund as outflows and losses imperiled its ability to meet further withdrawals that sparked a broader

people with knowledge of the matter saidblackstone declined to comment on investor decisions and the fund’s holdings the special situations hedge fund was started in  and has generated an annualized return after fees of about  percent chirhart said that compares with a  percent net annualized return in gso’s  mezzanine credit fund and  percent in that strategy’s  pool both of which are drawdown vehicles without a redemption option gso’s  and  rescue lending funds which also don’t feature withdrawals were returning  percent and  percent respectively as of dec blackstone acquired gso  which is
