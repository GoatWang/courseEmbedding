sponsoring organizations search for the economic history of the international film industry gerben bakker university of essex introduction like other major innovations such as the automobile electricity chemicals and the airplane cinema emerged in most western countries at the same time as the first form of industrialized massentertainment it was allpervasive from the s onwards each year billions of cinematickets were sold and consumers who did not regularly visit the cinema became a minority in italy today hardly significant in international entertainment the film industry was the fourthlargest export industry before the first world war in the depressionstruck us film was the tenth most profitable industry and in s france it was the fastestgrowing industry followed by paper and electricity while in britain the number of cinematickets sold rose to almost one billion a year bakker b despite this economic significance despite its rapid emergence and growth despite its pronounced effect on the everyday life of consumers and despite its importance as an early case of the industrialization of services the economic history of the film industry has hardly been examined this article will limit itself exclusively to the economic development of the industry it will discuss just a few countries mainly the us britain and france and then exclusively to investigate the economic issues it addresses not to give complete histories of the industries in those countries this entry cannot do justice to developments in each and every country given the nature of an encyclopedia article this entry also limits itself to the evolution of the western film industry because it has been and still is the largest film industry in the world in revenue terms although this may well change in the future before cinema in the late eighteenth century most consumers enjoyed their entertainment in an informal haphazard and often noncommercial way when making a trip they could suddenly meet a roadside entertainer and their villages were often visited by traveling showmen clowns and troubadours seasonal fairs attracted a large variety of musicians magicians dancers fortunetellers and swordswallowers only a few large cities harbored legitimate theaters strictly regulated by the local and national rulers this world was torn apart in two stages first most western countries started to deregulate their entertainment industries enabling many more entrepreneurs to enter the business and make far larger investments for example in circuits of fixed stone theaters the us was the first with liberalization in the late eighteenth century most european countries followed during the nineteenth century britain for example deregulated in the mids and france in the late s the result of this was that commercial formalized and standardized live entertainment emerged that destroyed a fair part of traditional entertainment the combined effect of liberalization innovation and changes in business organization made the industry grow rapidly throughout the nineteenth century and integrated local and regional entertainment markets into national ones by the end of the nineteenth century integrated national entertainment industries and markets maximized productivity attainable through process innovations creative inputs for example circulated swiftly along the venues – often in dedicated trains – coordinated by centralized booking offices maximizing capital and labor utilization at the end of the nineteenth century in the era of the second industrial revolution falling working hours rising disposable income increasing urbanization rapidly expanding transport networks and strong population growth resulted in a sharp rise in the demand for entertainment the effect of this boom was further rapid growth of live entertainment through process innovations at the turn of the century the production possibilities of the existing industry configuration were fully realized and further innovation within the existing liveentertainment industry could only increase productivity incrementally at this moment in a second stage cinema emerged and in its turn destroyed this world by industrializing it into the modern world of automated standardized tradable massentertainment integrating the national entertainment markets into an international one technological origins in the early s thomas edison introduced the kinematograph which enabled the shooting of films and their playback in slotcoin machines for individual viewing in the mids the lumière brothers added projection to the invention and started to play films in theaterlike settings cinema reconfigured different technologies that all were available from the late s onwards photography s taking negative pictures and printing positives s roll films s celluloid  highsensitivity photographic emulsion late s projection  and movement dissection persistence of vision  after the preconditions for motion pictures had been established cinema technology itself was invented already in  patents were filed for viewing and projecting motion pictures but not for the taking of pictures the scientist jean marey completed the first working model of a film camera in  in paris edison visited georges demeney in  and saw his films in  he filed an american patent for a film camera which had a different moving mechanism than the marey camera in  the englishman friese green presented a working camera to a group of enthusiasts in  the frenchman demeney filed a patent for a camera finally the lumière brothers filed a patent for their type of camera and for projection in february  in december of that year they gave the first projection for a paying audience they were followed in february  by the englishman robert w paul paul also invented the ‘maltese cross’ a device which is still used in film cameras today it is instrumental in the smooth rolling of the film and in the correcting of the lens for the space between the exposures michaelis  musser   low and manvell  three characteristics stand out in this innovation process first it was an international process of invention taking place in several countries at the same time and the inventors building upon and improving upon each other’s inventions this connects to joel mokyr’s notion that in the nineteenth century communication became increasingly important to innovations and many innovations depended on international communication between inventors mokyr   second it was what mokyr calls a typical nineteenth century invention in that it was a smart combination of many existing technologies many different innovations in the technologies which it combined had been necessary to make possible the innovation of cinema third cinema was a major innovation in the sense that it was quickly and universally adopted throughout the western world quicker than the steam engine the railroad or the steamship the emergence of cinema for about the first ten years of its existence cinema in the united states and elsewhere was mainly a trick and a gadget before  the coinoperated kinematograph of edison was present at fairs and in entertainment venues spectators had to throw a coin in the machine and peek through glasses to see the film the first projections from  onwards attracted large audiences lumière had a group of operators who traveled around the world with the cinematograph and showed the pictures in theaters after a few years films became a part of the program in vaudeville and sometimes in theater as well at the same time traveling cinema emerged cinemas which traveled around with a tent or mobile theater and set up shop for a short time in towns and villages these differed from the lumière operators and others in that they catered for the general popular audiences while the former were more upscale parts of theater programs or a special program for the bourgeoisie musser     this whole era which in the us lasted up to about  was a time in which cinema seemed just one of many new fashions and it was not at all certain that it would persist or that it would be forgotten or marginalized quickly such as happened to the boom in skating rinks and bowling alleys at the time this changed when nickelodeons fixed cinemas with a few hundred seats emerged and quickly spread all over the country between  and  from this time onwards cinema changed into an industry in its own right which was distinct from other entertainments since it had its own buildings and its own advertising the emergence of fixed cinemas coincided which a huge growth phase in the business in general film production increased greatly and film distribution developed into a special activity often managed by large film producers however until about  besides the cinemas films also continued to be combined with live entertainment in vaudeville and other theaters musser  allen  figure  shows the total length of negatives released on the us british and french film markets in the us the total released negative length increased from  feet in  to two million feet in  to twenty million feet in  clearly the initial us growth between  and  was very strong the market increased by over three orders of magnitude but from an infinitesimal initial base between  and  far less growth took place and in this period it may well have looked like the cinematograph would remain a niche product a gimmick shown at fairs and used to be interspersed with live entertainment from  however a new sharp sustained growth phase starts the market increased further again by two orders of magnitude – and from a far higher base this time at the same time the average film length increased considerably from eighty feet in  to seven hundred feet in  to three thousand feet in  one reel of film held about  feet and had a playing time of about fifteen minutes between the mids and  the british and french markets were growing at roughly the same rates as the us one world war i constituted a discontinuity from  onwards european growth rates are far lower those in the us the prices the nickelodeons charged were between five and ten cents for which spectators could stay as long as they liked around  when larger cinemas emerged in hot city center locations more closely resembling theaters than the small and shabby nickelodeons prices increased they varied from between one dollar to one dollar andahalf for ‘first run’ cinemas to five cents for sixthrun neighborhood cinemas see also sedgwick  figure  total released length on the us british and french film markets in meters  note the length refers to the total length of original negatives that were released commercially see bakker  appendix i for the method of estimation and for a discussion of the sources source bakker b american film institute catalogue  motion picture world  the quality race once nickelodeons and other types of cinemas were established the industry entered a new stage with the emergence of the feature film before  cinemagoers saw a succession of many different films each between one and fifteen minutes of varying genres such as cartoons newsreels comedies travelogues sports films ‘gymnastics’ pictures and dramas after the mids going to the cinema meant watching a feature film a heavily promoted dramatic film with a length that came closer to that of a theater play based on a famous story and featuring famous stars shorts remained only as side dishes the feature film emerged when cinema owners discovered that films with a far higher quality and length enabled them to ask far higher ticket prices and get far more people into their cinemas resulting in far higher profits even if cinemas needed to pay far more for the film rental the discovery that consumers would turn their back on packages of shorts newsreels sports cartoons and the likes as the quality of features increased set in motion a quality race between film producers bakker  they all started investing heavily in portfolios of feature films spending large sums on wellknown stars rights to famous novels and theater plays extravagant sets star directors etc a contributing factor in the us was the demise of the motion picture patents company mppc a cartel that tried to monopolize film production and distribution between about  and  the edisonbacked mppc had restricted quality artificially by setting limits on film length and film rental prices when william fox and the department of justice started legal action in  the power of the mppc quickly waned and the ‘independents’ came to dominate the industry in the us the motion picture industry became the internet of the s when companies put the word motion pictures in their ipo investors would flock to it many of these companies went bankrupt were dissolved or were taken over a few survived and became the hollywood studios most of which we still know today paramount metrogoldwynmayer mgm warner brothers universal radiokeithorpheum rko twentieth centuryfox columbia and united artists a necessary condition for the quality race was some form of vertical integration in the early film industry films were sold this meant that the cinemaowner who bought a film would receive all the marginal revenues the film generated in the film industry these revenues were largely marginal profits as most costs were fixed so an additional film ticket sold was pure gross profit because the producer did not get any of these revenues at the margin there was little incentive to increase quality when outright sales made way for the rental of films to cinemas for a fixed fee producers got a higher incentive to increase a film’s quality because it would generate more rentals bakker  this further increased when percentage contracts were introduced for large city center cinemas and when producersdistributors actually started to buy large cinemas the changing contractual relationship between cinemas and producers was paralleled between producers and distributors the decline and fall of the european film industry because the quality race happened when europe was at war european companies could not participate in the escalation of quality and production costs discussed above this does not mean all of them were in crisis many made high profits during the war from newsreels other short films propaganda films and distribution they also were able to participate in the shift towards the feature film substantially increasing output in the new genre during the war figure  however it was difficult for them to secure the massive amount of venture capital necessary to participate in the quality race while their countries were at war even if they would have managed it may have been difficult to justify these lavish expenditures when people were dying in the trenches yet a few european companies did participate in the escalation phase the danish nordisk company invested heavily in long featuretype films and bought cinema chains and distributors in germany austria and switzerland its strategy ended when the german government forced it to sell its german assets to the newly founded ufa company in return for a  percent minority stake the french pathé company was one of the largest us film producers it set up its own us distribution network and invested in heavily advertised serials films in weekly installments expecting that this would become the industry standard as it turned out pathé bet on the wrong horse and was overtaken by competitors riding high on the feature film yet it eventually switched to features and remained a significant company in the early s its us assets were sold to merrill lynch and eventually became part of rko figure  number of feature films produced in britain france and the us  semilogarithmic scale source bakker  american film institute catalogue british film institute screen digest globe world film index chirat longue métrage because it could not participate in the quality race the european film industry started to decline in relative terms its market share at home and abroad diminished substantially figure  in the s european companies supplied at least half of the films shown in the us in the early s this dropped to about twenty percent in the mids when the feature film emerged the european market share declined to nearly undetectable levels by the s most large european companies gave up film production altogether pathé and gaumont sold their us and international business left film making and focused on distribution in france éclair their major competitor went bankrupt nordisk continued as an insignificant danish film company and eventually collapsed into receivership the eleven largest italian film producers formed a trust which terribly failed and one by one they fell into financial disaster the famous british producer cecil hepworth went bankrupt by late  hardly any films were being made in britain american films were shown everywhere figure  market shares by national film industries us britain france  note euus is the share of european companies on the us market euuk is the share of european companies on the british market and so on for further details see bakker  the rise of hollywood once they had lost out it was difficult for european companies to catch up first of all since the sharply rising film production costs were fixed and sunk market size was becoming of essential importance as it affected the amount of money that could be spent on a film exactly at this crucial moment the european film market disintegrated first because of war later because of protectionism the market size was further diminished by heavy taxes on cinema tickets that sharply increased the price of cinema compared to live entertainment second the emerging hollywood studios benefited from first mover advantages in feature film production they owned international distribution networks they could offer cinemas large portfolios of films at a discount blockbooking sometimes before they were even made blindbidding the quality gap with european features was so large it would be difficult to close in one go and finally the american origin of the feature films in the s had established us films as a kind of brand leaving consumers with high switching costs to try out films from other national origins it would be extremely costly for european companies to reenter international distribution produce large portfolios jumpstart film quality and establish a new brand of films – all at the same time bakker  a third factor was the rise of hollywood as production location the large existing american northeast coast film industry and the newly emerging film industry in florida declined as us film companies started to locate in southern california first of all the ‘sharing’ of inputs facilitated knowledge spillovers and allowed higher returns the studios lowered costs because creative inputs had less downtime needed to travel less could participate in many tryouts to achieve optimal casting and could be rented out easily to competitors when not immediately wanted hollywood also attracted new creative inputs through nonmonetary means even more than money creative inputs wanted to maximize fame and professional recognition for an actress an offer to work with the world’s best directors costume designers lighting specialists and makeup artists was difficult to decline second a thick market for specialized supply and demand existed companies could easily rent out excess studio capacity for example during the nighttime bfilms were made and a producer was quite likely to find the highly specific products or services needed somewhere in hollywood christopherson and storper   while a european industrial ‘film’ district may have been competitive and even have a lower overall costquality ratio than hollywood a first european major would have a substantially higher costquality ratio lacking external economies and would therefore not easily enter see for example krugman and obstfeld  chapter  if entry did happen the hollywood studios could and would buy successful creative inputs away since they could realize higher returns on these inputs which resulted in american films with even a higher perceived quality thus perpetuating the situation sunlight climate and the variety of landscape in california were of course favorable to film production but were not unique locations such as florida italy spain and southern france offered similar conditions the coming of sound in  sound films were introduced the main innovator was warner brothers backed by the bank goldman sachs which actually parachuted a vicepresident to warner although many other sound systems had been tried and marketed from the s onwards the electrical microphone invented at bell labs in the mids sharply increased the quality of sound films and made possible the change of the industry sound increased the interests in the film industry of large industrial companies such as general electric western electric and rca as well as those of the banks who were eager the finance the new innovation such as the bank of america and goldman sachs in economic terms sound represented an exogenous jump in sunk costs and product quality which did not affect the basic industry structure very much the industry structure was already highly concentrated before sound and the european new yorkjersey and florida film industries were already shattered what it did do was industrialize away most of the musicians and entertainers that had complemented the silent films with sound and entertainment especially those working in the smaller cinemas this led to massive unemployment among musicians see for example gomery  kraft  the effect of sound film in europe was to increase the domestic revenues of european films because they became more culturespecific as they were in the local language but at the same time it decreased the foreign revenues european films received bakker b it is difficult to completely assess the impact of sound film as it coincided with increased protection many european countries set quotas for the amount of foreign films that could be shown shortly before the coming of sound in france for example where sound became widely adopted from  onwards the us share of films dropped from eighty to fifty percent between  and  mainly the result of protectionist legislation during the s the share temporarily declined to about forty percent and then hovered to between fifty and sixty percent in short protectionism decreased the us market share and increased the french market shares of french and other european films while sound film increased french market share mostly at the expense of other european films and less so at the expense of us films in britain the share of releases of american films declined from eighty percent in  to seventy percent in  while british films increased from five percent to twenty percent exactly in line with the requirements of the  quota act after  the american share remained roughly stable this suggests that sound film did not have a large influence and that the share of us films was mainly brought down by the introduction of the cinematograph films act in  which set quotas for british films nevertheless revenue data which are unfortunately lacking would be needed to give a definitive answer as little is known about effects on the revenue per film the economics of the interwar film trade because film production costs were mainly fixed and sunk international sales or distribution were important because these were additional sales without much additional cost to the producer the film itself had already been made films had special characteristics that necessitated international sales because they essentially were copyrights rather than physical products theoretically the costs of additional sales were zero film production involved high endogenous sunk costs recouped through renting the copyright to the film the marginal foreign revenue equaled marginal net revenue and marginal profits after the film’s production costs had been fully amortized all companies large or small had to take into account foreign sales when setting film budgets bakker b films were intermediate products sold to foreign distributors and cinemas while the rent paid varied depending on perceived quality and general conditions of supply and demand the ticket price paid by consumers generally did not vary it only varied by cinema highest in firstrun city center cinemas and lowest in sixthrun ramshackle neighborhood cinemas cinemas used films to produce ‘spectatorhours’ a fivehundredseat cinema providing one hour of film produced five hundred spectatorhours of entertainment if it sold three hundred tickets the other two hundred spectatorhours produced would have perished because film was an intermediate product and a capital good at that international competition could not be on price alone just as sales of machines depend on the priceperformance ratio if we consider a film’s ‘capacity to sell spectatorhours’ hereafter called selling capacity as proportional to production costs a lowbudget producer could not simply push down a film’s rental price in line with its quality in order to make a sale even at a price of zero some lowbudget films could not be sold the reasons were twofold first because cinemas had mostly fixed costs and few variable costs a film’s selling capacity needed to be at least as large as fixed cinema costs plus its rental price a sevenhundredseat cinema with a production capacity of  spectatorhours a week weekly fixed costs of five hundred dollars and an average admission price of five cents per spectatorhour needed a film selling at least ten thousand spectatorhours and would not be prepared to pay for that marginal film because it only recouped fixed costs films needed a minimum selling capacity to cover cinema fixed costs producers could only price down lowbudget films to just above the threshold level with a lower expected selling capacity these films could not be sold at any price this reasoning assumes that we know a film’s selling capacity ex ante a main feature distinguishing foreign markets from domestic ones was that uncertainty was markedly lower from a film’s domestic launch the audience appeal was known and each subsequent country added additional information while a film’s audience appeal across countries was not perfectly correlated uncertainty was reduced for various companies correlations between foreign and domestic revenues for entire film portfolios fluctuated between  and  bakker b given the riskiness of film production this reduction in uncertainty undoubtedly was important the second reason for limited price competition was the opportunity cost given cinemas’ production capacities if the hypothetical cinema obtained a highcapacity film for a weekly rental of twelve hundred dollars which sold all  spectatorhours the cinema made a profit of   times  –  –    if a film with half the budget and we assume half the selling capacity rented for half the price the cinemaowner would lose   times  –  –    thus the cinema owner would want to pay no more than  for the lower budget film given that the high budget film is available  times  –     so the lowcapacity film with half the selling capacity of the highcapacity film would need to sell for under a fifth of the price of the high capacity film to even enable the possibility of a transaction these sharply increasing returns to selling capacity made the setting of production outlays important as a right pricecapacity ratio was crucial to win foreign markets how films became branded products to make sure film revenues reached above cinema fixed costs film companies transformed films into branded products with the emergence of the feature film they started to pay large sums to actors actresses and directors and for rights to famous plays and novels this is still a major characteristic of the film industry today that fascinates many people yet the huge sums paid for stars and stories are not as irrational and haphazard as they sometimes may seem actually they might be just as ‘rational’ and have just as quantifiable a return as direct spending on marketing and promotion bakker a to secure an audience film producers borrowed branding techniques from other consumer goods’ industries but the short productlifecycle forced them to extend the brand beyond one product – using trademarks or stars – to buy existing ‘brands’ such as famous plays or novels and to deepen the productlifecycle by licensing their brands thus the main value of stars and stories lay not in their ability to predict successes but in their services as giant ‘publicity machines’ which optimized advertising effectiveness by rapidly amassing high levels of brandawareness after a film’s release information such as wordofmouth and reviews would affect its success the young age at which stars reached their peak and the disproportionate income distribution even among the superstars confirm that stars were paid for their ability to generate publicity likewise because ‘stories’ were paid several times as much as original screenplays they were at least partially bought for their popular appeal bakker a stars and stories marked a film’s qualities to some extent confirming that they at least contained themselves consumer preferences confirm that stars and stories were the main reason to see a film further fame of stars is distributed disproportionately possibly even twice as unequal as income film companies aided by longterm contracts probably captured part of the rent of their popularity gradually these companies specialized in developing and leasing their ‘instant brands’ to other consumer goods’ industries in the form of merchandising already from the late s onwards the hollywood studios used the new scientific market research techniques of george gallup to continuously track the brandawareness among the public of their major stars bakker  figure  is based on one such graph used by hollywood it shows that lana turner was a rising star gable was consistently a top star while stewart’s popularity was high but volatile james stewart was eleven percentagepoints more popular among the richest consumers than among the poorest while lana turner differed only a few percentagepoints additional segmentation by city size seemed to matter since substantial differences were found clark gable was ten percentagepoints more popular in small cities than in large ones of the richest consumers  percent wanted to see a movie starring gable but altogether they constituted just  percent of gable’s market while the  percent poorest gablefans constituted  percent the increases in gable’s popularity roughly coincided with his releases suggesting that while producers used gable partially for the brandawareness of his name each use film subsequently increased or maintained that awareness in what seems to have been a selfreinforcing process figure  popularity of clark gable james stewart and lana turner among us respondents april  – october  in percentage source audience research inc bakker  the film industry’s contribution to economic growth and welfare by the late s cinema had become an important mass entertainment industry nearly everyone in the western world went to the cinema and many at least once a week cinema had made possible a massive growth in productivity in the entertainment industry and thereby disproved the notions of some economists that productivity growth in certain service industries is inherently impossible between  and  output of the entertainment industry measured in spectatorhours grew substantially in the us britain and france varying from three to eleven percent per year over a period of nearly forty years table  the output per worker increased from  spectator hours in the us in  to  in  in britain it increased from  to  spectatorhours and in france from  to  spectatorhours this phenomenal growth could be explained partially by adding more capital such as in the form of film technology and film production outlays and partially by simply producing more efficiently with the existing amount of capital and labor the increase in efficiency ‘total factor productivity’ varied from about one percent per year in britain to over five percent in the us with france somewhere in between in all countries this increase in efficiency was at least one and a half times the increase in efficiency at the level of the entire nation for the us it was as much as five times and for france it was more than three times the national increase in efficiency bakker a another noteworthy feature is that the labor productivity in entertainment varied less across countries in the late s than it did in  part of the reason is that cinema technology made entertainment partially tradable and therefore forced productivity in similar directions in all countries the tradable part of the entertainment industry would now exert competitive pressure on the nontradable part bakker a it is therefore not surprising that cinema caused the lowest efficiency increase in britain which had already a welldeveloped and competitive entertainment industry with the highest labor and capital productivity both in  and in  and higher efficiency increases in the us and to a lesser extent in france which had less welldeveloped entertainment industries in  another way to measure the contribution of film technology to the economy in the late s is by using a social savings methodology if we assume that cinema did not exist and all demand for entertainment measured in spectatorhours would have to be met by live entertainment we can calculate the extra costs to society and thus the amount saved by film technology in the us these social savings amounted to as much as  percent  billion of gdp in france to just  percent  billion and in britain to only  percent  billion of gdp a third and different way to look at the contribution of film technology to the economy is to look at the consumer surplus generated by cinema contrary to the tfp and social savings techniques used above which assume that cinema is a substitute for live entertainment this approach assumes that cinema is a wholly new good and that therefore the entire consumer surplus generated by it is ‘new’ and would not have existed without cinema for an individual consumer the surplus is the difference between the price she was willing to pay and the ticket she actually paid this difference varies from consumer to consumer but with econometric techniques one can estimate the sum of individual surpluses for an entire country the resulting national consumer surpluses for entertainment varied from about a fifth of total entertainment expenditure in the us to about half in britain and as much as three quarters in france all the measures show that by the late s cinema was making an essential contribution in increasing total welfare as well as the entertainment industry’s productivity vertical disintegration after the second world war the hollywood film industry disintegrated production distribution and exhibition became separate activities that were not always owned by the same organization three main causes brought about the vertical disintegration first the us supreme court forced the studios to divest their cinema chains in  second changes in the socialdemographic structure in the us brought about a shift towards entertainment within the home many young couples started to live in the new suburbs and wanted to stay home for entertainment initially they mainly used radio for this purpose and later they switched to television gomery  third television broadcasting in itself without the socialdemographic changes that increased demand for it constituted a new distribution channel for audiovisual entertainment and thus decreased the scarcity of distribution capacity this meant that television took over the focus on the lowest common denominator from radio and cinema while the latter two differentiated their output and started to focus more on specific market segments figure  real cinema box office revenue real ticket price and number of screens in the us  note the values are in dollars of  using the ehnet consumer price deflator source adapted from vogel  and robertson  the consequence was a sharp fall in real box office revenue in the decade after the war figure  after the mids real revenue stabilized and remained the same with some fluctuations until the mids the decline in screens was more limited after  the number of screens increased again steadily to reach nearly twice the  level in the s since the s there have been more movie screens in the us than ever before the proliferation of screens coinciding with declining capacity per screen facilitated market segmentation revenue per screen nearly halved in the decade after the war then made a rebound during the s to start a long and steady decline from  onwards the real price of a cinema ticket was quite stable until the s after which it more than doubled since the early s the price has been declining again and nowadays the real admission price is about what it was in  it was in this adverse postwar climate that the vertical disintegration unfolded it took place at three levels first obviously the hollywood studios divested their cinemachains second they outsourced part of their film production and most of their production factors to independent companies this meant that the hollywood studios would only produce part of the films they distributed themselves that they changed the longterm sevenyear contracts with star actors for perfilm contracts and that they sold off part of their studio facilities to rent them back for individual films third the hollywood studios’ main business became film distribution and financing they specialized in planning and assembling a portfolio of films contracting and financing most of them and marketing and distributing them worldwide the developments had three important effects first production by a few large companies was replaced by production by many small flexibly specialized companies southern california became an industrial district for the film industry and harbored an intricate network of these businesses from set design companies and costume makers to special effects firms and equipment rental outfits storper and christopherson  only at the level of distribution and financing did concentration remain high second films became more differentiated and tailored to specific market segments they were now aimed at a younger and more affluent audience third the european film market gained in importance because the socialdemographic changes suburbanization and the advent of television happened somewhat later in europe the drop in cinema attendance also happened later there the result was that the hollywood offshored a large chunk – at times over half – of their production to europe in the s this was stimulated by lower european production costs difficulties in repatriating foreign film revenues and by the vertical disintegration in california which severed the studios’ ties with their production units and facilitated outside contracting european production companies could better adapt to changes in postwar demand because they were already flexibly specialized the british film production industry for example had been fragmented almost from its emergence in the s in the late s distribution became concentrated mainly through the efforts of j arthur rank while the production sector a network of flexibly specialized companies in and around london boomed after the war the drop in admissions followed the us with about a ten year delay figure  the drop in the number of screens experienced the same lag but was more severe about twothird of british cinema screens disappeared versus only onethird in the us in france after the first world war film production had disintegrated rapidly and chaotically into a network of numerous small companies while a few large firms dominated distribution and production finance the result was a burgeoning industry actually one of the fastest growing french industries in the s figure  admissions and number of screens in britain  source screen digestscreen financebritish film institute and robertson  several european companies attempted to reenter international film distribution such as rank in the s and s the international film finance corporation in the s gaumont in the s polygram in the s and again in the s cannon in the s all of them failed in terms of longrun survival even if they made profits during some years the only postwar entry strategy that was successful in terms of survival was the direct acquisition of a hollywood studio bakker  the comeback of hollywood from the mids onwards the hollywood studios revived the slide of box office revenue was brought to a standstill revenues were stabilized by the joint effect of seven different factors first the blockbuster movie increased cinema attendance this movie was heavily marketed and supported by intensive television advertisement jaws was one of the first of these kind of movies and an enormous success second the us film industry received several kinds of tax breaks from the early s onwards which were kept in force until the mids when hollywood was in good shape again third coinciding with the blockbuster movie and taxbreaks film budgets increased substantially resulting in a higher perceived quality and higher quality difference with television drawing more consumers into the cinema fourth a rise in multiplex cinemas cinemas with several screens increased consumer choice and increased the appeal of cinema by offering more variety within a specific cinema thus decreasing the difference with television in this respect fifth one could argue that the process of flexible specialization of the california film industry was completed in the early s thus making the film industry ready to adapt more flexibly to changes in the market mgm’s sale of its studio complex in  marked the final ending of an era sixth new income streams from video sales and rentals and cable television increased the revenues a highquality film could generate seventh european broadcasting deregulation increased the demand for films by television stations substantially from the s onwards further growth was driven by newer markets in eastern europe and asia film industries from outside the west also grew substantially such as those of japan hong kong india and china at the same time the european union started a large scale subsidy program for its audiovisual film industry with mixed economic effects by  ten years after the start of the program a film made in the european union cost  euros on average was seventy to eighty percent statefinanced and grossed  euros worldwide reaching an audience of  persons in contrast the average american film cost fifteen million euros was nearly hundred percent privately financed grossed  million euros and reached  million persons dale  this seventyfold difference in performance is remarkable even when measured in gross return on investment or gross margin the us still had a fivefold and twofold lead over europe respectively in few other industries does such a pronounced difference exist during the s the film industry moved into television broadcasting in europe broadcasters often cofunded smallscale boutique film production in the us the hollywood studios started to merge with broadcasters in the s they had experienced difficulties with obtaining broadcasting licenses because their reputation had been compromised by the antitrust actions they had to wait for forty years before they could finally complete what they intended disney for example bought the abc network paramount’s owner viacom bought cbs and general electric owner of nbc bought universal at the same time the feature film industry was also becoming more connected to other entertainment industries such as videogames theme parks and musicals with video game revenues now exceeding films’ box office revenues it seems likely that feature films will simply be the flagship part of large entertainment supply system that will exploit the intellectual property in feature films in many different formats and markets conclusion the takeoff of the film industry in the early twentieth century had been driven mainly by changes in demand cinema industrialized entertainment by standardizing it automating it and making it tradable after its early years the industry experienced a quality race that led to increasing industrial concentration only later did geographical concentration take place in southern california cinema made a substantial contribution to productivity and total welfare especially before television after television the industry experienced vertical disintegration the flexible specialization of production and a selfreinforcing process of increasing distribution channels and capacity as well as market growth cinema then was not only the first in a row of media industries that industrialized entertainment but also the first in a series of international industries that industrialized services the evolution of the film industry thus may give insight into technological change and its attendant welfare gains in many service industries to come selected bibliography
