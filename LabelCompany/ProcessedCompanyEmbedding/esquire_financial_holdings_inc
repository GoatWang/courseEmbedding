estimate that the net proceeds from the sale of the shares of common stock by us will be approximately  million or approximately  million if the underwriter exercises in full its option to purchase additional shares of common stock from us after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us in order to maintain our capital and liquidity ratios at acceptable levels while we continue to grow our balance sheet with commercial real estate loans and commercial loans we have decided to undertake a public offering at this time additionally our lending limit is expected to increase by  million following the completion of this offering which will allow us to originate larger loans and be more competitive in the market place we intend to use the net proceeds of the offering to support the growth in esquire bank’s loan portfolio including the possibility of making larger loans due to our increased legal lending limit to finance potential strategic acquisitions to the extent such opportunities arise and for other general corporate purposes which could include other growth initiatives we have no current plans arrangements or understandings relating to any specific acquisition or similar transaction and management has not yet determined the types of businesses that they might target our management will retain broad discretion to allocate the net proceeds of this offering and the precise amounts and timing of our use of the net proceeds of this offering will depend upon market conditions as well as other factors until we deploy the proceeds of this offering for the uses described above we expect to hold such proceeds in shortterm investments we will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock by the selling stockholders the bank and nonbank financial services industries in our markets and surrounding areas is highly competitive we compete with a wide range of regional and national banks located in our market areas as well as nonbank commercial finance companies on a nationwide basis we experience competition in both lending and attracting funds as well as merchant processing services from commercial banks savings associations credit unions consumer finance companies pension trusts mutual funds insurance companies mortgage bankers and brokers brokerage and investment banking firms nonbank lenders government agencies and certain other nonfinancial institutions many of these competitors have more assets capital and lending limits and resources than we do and may be able to conduct more intensive and broaderbased promotional efforts to reach both commercial and individual customers competition for deposit products can depend heavily on pricing because of the ease with which customers can transfer deposits from one institution to another we define the market area for legal community products as law firms practicing within the united states united states territories and united states commonwealths and we serve the litigation industry on a nationwide basis for traditional community banking products and services our primary market areas are nassau and new york manhattan counties in new york and secondarily throughout the state of new york competition for attorneyrelated loans is derived primarily from eight to ten nationallyoriented financial companies that specialize in this market some of these companies are focused exclusively on loans to law firms while others offer loans to plaintiffs as well while some overlap exists between the litigation market loan products offered by esquire bank and these companies primarily lines of credit casecost and postsettlement commercial loans there are a number of critical differences that management believes give esquire bank a competitive advantage • esquire bank can offer more competitive rates on loans compared to specialty finance companies because its cost of funds is much lower than the funding costs for these nonbank competitors a number of these companies purchase the settlements from law firms at steep discounts which has drawn negative attention from some state regulators esquire bank does not purchase settlements it uses them to collateralize loans • the nonbank companies are not able to offer deposit products or business services such as remote deposit capture or letters of credit or debit cards and • nonbanks cannot offer products uniformly across the country because they are not national banks we have established our niche in the litigation community which according to the towers watson  update on us tort cost trends was an approximately  billion market in the united states in  through the strategic development of a business model that understands our market’s unique needs and provides access to our target customers we have designed unique value added products and services for our current and potential clients and created a distribution network with direct access to the market through the experience and networks of our board of directors attorney stockholders customers and management a number of our directors investors and customers are active members of leading litigation law firms in the nation national and state bar associations as well as other industry leading companies in addition we have established informal affiliations or relationships with key industry organizations such as the american association for justice mass tort made perfect new york state trial lawyers association consumer attorneys of california florida justice association and others which we believe gives us access to thousands of trial attorneys across the united states our traditional community banking market area has a diversified economy typical of most urban population centers with the majority of employment provided by services wholesaleretail trade finance insurancereal estate “fire” and construction services account for the largest employment sector across the two primary market area counties while wholesaleretail trade accounts for the second largest employment sector in nassau and new york counties new york city is one of the premier financial centers in the world and thus fire is the third largest employment sector in new york county company description we are a bank holding company headquartered in jericho new york and registered under the bank holding company act of  as amended the “bhc act” through our wholly owned bank subsidiary esquire bank national association we are a full service commercial bank dedicated to serving the financial needs of the legal and small business communities on a national basis as well as commercial and retail customers in the new york metropolitan market we offer tailored products and solutions to the legal community and their clients as well as dynamic and flexible merchant services solutions to small business owners both on a national basis we also offer traditional banking products for businesses and consumers in our local market area a subset of the new york metropolitan market we believe these activities primarily anchored by our legal community focus generate a stable source of low cost core deposits and a diverse asset base to support our overall operations our commercial and consumer loans tailored to the litigation market “attorneyrelated loans” enhance our overall yield on our loan portfolio enabling us to earn attractive riskadjusted net interest margins additionally our merchant processing activities have generated a relatively stable source of fee income we believe our unique and dynamic business model distinguishes us from other banks and nonbank financial services companies in the markets in which we operate as demonstrated by comparing our performance metrics for the three months ended march   and  as well as our year ended  and  for the three months ended march   and  • our net income increased  to  or  per diluted share • we had a net interest margin of  stabilized by a low cost of funds of  on our deposits • our loans increased  or  million to  million with no nonperforming loans and solid asset quality metrics • our noninterest income increased  to  million which represented  of our total revenue for the three months ended march   primarily driven by our merchant services platform • as of march   our total assets loans deposits and stockholders’ equity totaled  million  million  million and  million respectively for the years ended december   and  • our net income increased  to  million or  per diluted share • we had a net interest margin of  an increase from  stabilized by a low cost of funds of  on our deposits • our loans increased  or  million to  million with no nonperforming loans and solid asset quality metrics • our noninterest income increased  to  million which represented  of our total revenue for the year ended december   primarily driven by our growing merchant services platform • as of december   our total assets loans deposits and stockholders’ equity totaled  million  million  million and  million respectively both  and  were transformational years for the company due in part to the successful execution of our unique and dynamic business model we believe our ongoing commitment to the litigation and small business communities have been and should continue to be the foundation for our success in august  we closed our private placement offering of common stock and preferred stock that began in  raising net proceeds totaling  million and successfully converted esquire financial holdings inc and esquire bank from a savings and loan holding company and savings bank to a bank holding company and national bank respectively we believe that the additional capital coupled with the conversion to a national bank has enhanced and should continue to enhance our commercial loan growth in the legal industry and business communities we serve we remain true to our commitment to serve the litigation community and our commercial customers through our tailored and innovative products and solutions we believe esquire bank’s approach to the legal community is simple yet effective — we listen to the customer’s needs and tailor products and services around those needs our management team includes attorneys and bankers who have serviced the legal community throughout their careers which is a differentiating factor and key to our robust attorney network this model continues to set us apart from other institutions that offer a “one product fits all” model our relationships within the litigation community are a key contributor to our loan growth strong loan yields and low cost core deposits the litigation community represented more than  of our deposit base at march   in addition to our lending and deposit gathering activities we have also remained steadfast in growing our merchant services platform we provide dynamic and flexible merchant services solutions to small business owners our merchant services platform has grown to approximately  small businesses at march   which generated most of our noninterest income and represented  of our revenue for the three months ended march   and  of our revenue for the year ended december   we believe our merchant services platform represents a significant opportunity for future growth in fee income core deposits and enhanced lending opportunities our low cost core deposits deposits excluding time deposits representing our primary funding source for loan growth totaled  million at march   resulting in a total cost of deposits of  these stable low cost funds are driven by our attorney operating and escrow deposits representing more than  of our total deposit base at march   we intend to continue to prudently manage growth in deposits utilizing customer sweep programs for our mass tort and class action business banking programs we do not have a traditional “brick and mortar” branch network to support our deposit growth instead we rely on our robust attorney network to gather deposits and our customers utilize online cash management technology to manage their operating and escrow accounts as well as their business banking needs across the country we believe the lack of branch infrastructure coupled with our strong net interest margin and growth will continue to drive our efficiency ratio below the  reported for the three months ended march   with a growing and generally unseasoned loan portfolio our credit risk may continue to increase and our future performance could be adversely affected however we have invested in and developed underwriting and credit management processes tailored to each of the products we offer in order to minimize these risks we are committed to continuing to invest in and develop our underwriting and credit management processes to ensure our asset quality remains high and we minimize our credit risk at march   the average age of our loan portfolio was  years and we currently do not have any nonperforming loans esquire bank national association is subject to comprehensive regulation and examination by the office of the comptroller of the currency “occ” and esquire financial holdings inc is supervised by the board of governors of the federal reserve system “frb”  our
