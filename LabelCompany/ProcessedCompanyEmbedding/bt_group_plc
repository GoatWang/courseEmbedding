back to the establishment of the first telecommunications companies in britain among them was the first commercial telegraph service the electric telegraph company established in  as these companies amalgamated and were taken over or collapsed the remaining companies were transferred to state control under the post office in  these companies were merged and rebranded as british telecom  to edit the bt tower originally the post office tower constructed between  and  in january  alexander graham bell demonstrated his recently developed telephone to queen victoria at osborne house on the isle of wight a few days later the first telephone in britain was installed under licence from the general post office by engineers from david moseley and sons to connect the dantzic street premises of manchester hardware merchant mr john hudson with his other premises in nearby shudehill as the number of installed telephones across the country grew it became sensible to consider constructing telephone exchanges to allow all the telephones in each city to be connected together the first exchange was opened in london in august  closely followed by the lancashire telephonic exchange in manchester from  the telephone service in britain was provided by private sector companies such as the national telephone company and later by the general post office in  the national telephone company was taken over by the general post office in  it became the primary supplier of telecommunications services after the post office took over the private sector telephone service in gb except for a few local authority services those services all folded within a few years the sole exception being kingston upon hull where the telephone department became present day kcom group public corporationedit converting the post office into a nationalised industry as opposed to a governmental department was first discussed in  by lord wolmer in  the bridgeman committee produced a report that was rejected in  more proposals were ignored the post office remained a department of central government with the postmaster general sitting in cabinet as a secretary of state in march  tony benn the acting postmaster general wrote to harold wilson the prime minister proposing that studies be undertaken aimed at converting the post office into a nationalised industry a committee was set up to look into the advantages and disadvantages of the proposal and its findings were found to be favourable enough for the government to reestablish a steering group on the organisation of the post office after some initial deliberations that the business should be divided into five divisions post telecommunications savings giro and national data processing services it was decided that there should be two post and telecommunications these events finally resulted in the introduction of the post office act  on  october  under the post office act of  the post office ceased to be a government department and it became established as a public corporation the act gave the post office the exclusive privilege of operating telecommunications systems with listed powers to authorise others to run such systems effectively the general post office retained its telecommunications monopoly  to edit the british telecom t symbol logo used from  to  in  the carter committee report recommended a further division of the two main services and for their relocation under two individual corporations the findings contained in the report led to the renaming of post office telecommunications as british telecommunications trading as british telecom in  although it remained part of the post office the british telecommunications act  transferred the responsibility for telecommunications services from the post office creating two separate corporations post office ltd and british telecommunications at this time the first steps were taken to introduce competition into british telecommunications industry in particular the act empowered the secretary of state for trade and industry as well as british telecommunications to license other operators to run public telecommunications systems additionally a framework was established which enabled the secretary of state to set standards with the british standards institution bsi for apparatus supplied to the public by third parties and had the effect of requiring british telecommunications to connect approved apparatus to its systems the secretary of state made use of these new powers and began the process of opening up the apparatus supply market where a phased programme of liberalisation was started in  in  a licence was granted to cable  wireless to run a public telecommunications network through its subsidiary mercury communications ltd  to edit on  july  the government formally announced its intention to privatise british telecommunications with the sale of up to  of the companys shares to private investors this intention was confirmed by the passing of the telecommunications act  which received royal assent on  april that year the transfer to british telecommunications plc of the business of british telecommunications the statutory corporation took place on  august  and on  november  more than  per cent of british telecommunications shares were sold to the public at the time this was the largest share issue in the world the new legislation was intended to enable british telecommunications to become more responsive to competition in gb and to expand its operations globally commercial freedom granted to british telecommunications allowed it to enter into new joint ventures and if it so decided to engage in the manufacture of its own apparatus the companys transfer into the private sector continued in december  when the government sold around half its remaining holding of  of shares reducing its stake to  substantially all the governments remaining shares were sold in a third flotation in july  raising £ billion for the treasury and introducing  new shareholders to the company the  act also abolished british telecommunicationss exclusive privilege of running telecommunications systems and established a framework to safeguard the workings of competition this meant that british telecommunications finally lost its monopoly in running telecommunications systems which it had technically retained under the  act despite the secretary of states licensing powers it now required a licence in the same way as any other telecommunications operator the principal licence granted to british telecommunications laid down strict and extensive conditions affecting the range of its activities including those of manufacture and supply of apparatus in  cellnet was launched as a subsidiary of telecom securicor cellular radio limited a  venture between british telecommunications and securicor respectively securicor originally invested

tim bernerslee  alleged complicity with drone strikes in yemen and somaliaedit in september  bt entered into a  million deal with the us military to provide a key communications cable connecting raf croughton a us military base on uk soil with camp lemonnier a large us base in djibouti camp lemonnier is used as a base for american drone attacks in yemen and somalia and has been described by the economist as the most important base for drone operations outside the war zone of afghanistan human rights groups including reprieve and amnesty international have criticised the use of armed drones outside declared war zones evidence produced by the bureau of investigative journalism and stanford universitys international human rights  conflict resolution clinic suggest that drone strikes have caused substantial civilian casualties and may be illegal under international law in  bt was the subject of a complaint by reprieve to the department of business innovation and skills under the oecd guidelines for multinational enterprises following their refusal to explain whether or not their infrastructure was used to facilitate drone strikes the subsequent refusal of this complaint was appealed in may  on the basis that the uk national contact points decision did not follow the oecd guidelines the issue of bias was also raised due to the appointment of lord ian livingston as government minister for the department which was processing the complaint livingston had occupied a senior position at bt when the cable between raf croughton and camp lemonnier was originally built

them was the first commercial telegraph service the electric telegraph company established in  as these companies amalgamated and were taken over or collapsed the remaining companies were transferred to state control under the post office in  these companies were merged and rebranded as british telecom  to edit the bt tower originally the post office tower constructed between  and  in january  alexander graham bell demonstrated his recently developed telephone to queen victoria at osborne house on the isle of wight a few days later the first telephone in britain was installed under licence from the general post office by engineers from david moseley and sons to connect the dantzic street premises of manchester hardware merchant mr john hudson with his other premises in nearby shudehill as the number of installed telephones across the country grew it became sensible to consider constructing telephone exchanges to allow all the telephones in each city to be connected together the first exchange was opened in london in august  closely followed by the lancashire telephonic exchange in manchester from  the telephone service in britain was provided by private sector companies such as the national telephone company and later by the general post office in  the national telephone company was taken over by the general post office in  it became the primary supplier of telecommunications services after the post office took over the private sector telephone service in gb except for a few local authority services those services all folded within a few years the sole exception being kingston upon hull where the telephone department became present day kcom group public corporationedit converting the post office into a nationalised industry as opposed to a governmental department was first discussed in  by lord wolmer in  the bridgeman committee produced a report that was rejected in  more proposals were ignored the post office remained a department of central government with the postmaster general sitting in cabinet as a secretary of state in march  tony benn the acting postmaster general wrote to harold wilson the prime minister proposing that studies be undertaken aimed at converting the post office into a nationalised industry a committee was set up to look into the advantages and disadvantages of the proposal and its findings were found to be favourable enough for the government to reestablish a steering group on the organisation of the post office after some initial deliberations that the business should be divided into five divisions post telecommunications savings giro and national data processing services it was decided that there should be two post and telecommunications these events finally resulted in the introduction of the post office act  on  october  under the post office act of  the post office ceased to be a government department and it became established as a public corporation the act gave the post office the exclusive privilege of operating telecommunications systems with listed powers to authorise others to run such systems effectively the general post office retained its telecommunications monopoly  to edit the british telecom t symbol logo used from  to  in  the carter committee report recommended a further division of the two main services and for their relocation under two individual corporations the findings contained in the report led to the renaming of post office telecommunications as british telecommunications trading as british telecom in  although it remained part of the post office the british telecommunications act  transferred the responsibility for telecommunications services from the post office creating two separate corporations post office ltd and british telecommunications at this time the first steps were taken to introduce competition into british telecommunications industry in particular the act empowered the secretary of state for trade and industry as well as british telecommunications to license other operators to run public telecommunications systems additionally a framework was established which enabled the secretary of state to set standards with the british standards institution bsi for apparatus supplied to the public by third parties and had the effect of requiring british telecommunications to connect approved apparatus to its systems the secretary of state made use of these new powers and began the process of opening up the apparatus supply market where a phased programme of liberalisation was started in  in  a licence was granted to cable  wireless to run a public telecommunications network through its subsidiary mercury communications ltd  to edit on  july  the government formally announced its intention to privatise british telecommunications with the sale of up to  of the companys shares to private investors this intention was confirmed by the passing of the telecommunications act  which received royal assent on  april that year the transfer to british telecommunications plc of the business of british telecommunications the statutory corporation took place on  august  and on  november  more than  per cent of british telecommunications shares were sold to the public at the time this was the largest share issue in the world the new legislation was intended to enable british telecommunications to become more responsive to competition in gb and to expand its operations globally commercial freedom granted to british telecommunications allowed it to enter into new joint ventures and if it so decided to engage in the manufacture of its own apparatus the companys transfer into the private sector continued in december  when the government sold around half its remaining holding of  of shares reducing its stake to  substantially all the governments remaining shares were sold in a third flotation in july  raising £ billion for the treasury and introducing  new shareholders to the company the  act also abolished british telecommunicationss exclusive privilege of running telecommunications systems and established a framework to safeguard the workings of competition this meant that british telecommunications finally lost its monopoly in running telecommunications systems which it had technically retained under the  act despite the secretary of states licensing powers it now required a licence in the same way as any other telecommunications operator the principal licence granted to british telecommunications laid down strict and extensive conditions affecting the range of its activities including those of manufacture and supply of apparatus in  cellnet was launched as a subsidiary of telecom securicor cellular radio limited a  venture between british telecommunications and securicor respectively securicor originally invested £ million in cellnet in  in  bt purchased securicors shares in cellnet for £ billion the company was later rebranded as bt cellnet and became a part of bt wireless a group of subsidiary companies owned by bt the next major development for british telecommunications and a move towards a more open market in telecommunications occurred in  on  march the governments white paper competition and choice telecommunications policy for the s was issued in effect it ended the duopoly which had been shared by british telecommunications and mercury communications in the uk since november  and the buildup to privatisation the new policy enabled customers to acquire telecommunications services from competing providers using a variety of technologies independent retail companies were permitted to bulkbuy telecommunications capacity and sell it in packages to business and domestic users the white paper was endorsed by british telecommunications the new policy enabling the company to compete freely and more effectively by offering flexible pricing packages to meet the needs of different types of customer

supplied with an indepth report indicating that the intelligence services had very grave doubts regarding huawei and that the uk governmental military business community and private citizens privacy may be under serious threat subsequently bts infinity program and other projects are nowwhen under urgent review on  june  british lawmakers concluded that bt should never have allowed the chinese company access to the uks critical communications network without ministerial oversight saying they were deeply shocked that bt did not inform government that they were allowing huawei and zte both foreign entities with ties to the chinese military unfettered access to critical national systems furthermore ministers discovered that the agency with the responsibility to ensure chinese equipment

with virgin media and talktalk with the spyware company phorm responsible under their media guise for the apropos rootkit to intercept and analyse their users clickstream data and sell the anonymised aggregate information as part of phorms oix advertising service the practice known as behavioural targeting and condemned by critics as data pimping came under intense fire from various internet communities and other interestedparties who believe that the interception of data without the consent of users and web site owners is illegal under uk law ripa at a more fundamental level many have argued that the isps and phorm have no right to sell a commodity a users data and the copyright content of web sites to which they have no claim of ownership in response to questions about phorm and the interception of data by the webwise system sir tim bernerslee credited as the creator of the world wide web protocol indicated his disapproval of the concept and is quoted as saying of his data and web history its mine – you cant have it if you want to use it for something then you have to negotiate with me i have to agree i have to understand what im getting in return i myself feel that it is very important that my isp supplies internet to my house like the water company supplies water to my house it supplies connectivity with no strings attached my isp doesnt control which websites i go to it doesnt monitor which websites i go to — sir tim bernerslee  alleged complicity with drone strikes in yemen and somaliaedit in september  bt entered into a  million deal with the us military to provide a key communications cable connecting raf croughton a us military base on uk soil with camp lemonnier a large us base in djibouti camp lemonnier is used as a base for american drone attacks in yemen and somalia and has been described by the economist as the most important base for drone operations outside the war zone of afghanistan human rights groups including reprieve and amnesty international have criticised the use of armed drones outside declared war zones evidence produced by the bureau of investigative journalism and stanford universitys international human rights  conflict resolution clinic suggest that drone strikes have caused substantial civilian casualties and may be illegal under international law in  bt was the subject of a complaint by reprieve to the department of business innovation and skills under the oecd guidelines for multinational enterprises following their refusal to explain whether or not their infrastructure was used to facilitate drone strikes the subsequent refusal of this complaint was appealed in may  on the basis that the uk national contact points decision did not follow the oecd guidelines the issue of bias was also raised due to the appointment of lord ian livingston as government minister for the department which was processing the complaint livingston had occupied a senior position at bt when the cable between raf croughton and camp lemonnier was originally built see alsoedit london portal companies portal sheriff referencesedit  a b c d bt annual report  bt group plc retrieved  may    linkedin   group

back to the establishment of the first telecommunications companies in britain among them was the first commercial telegraph service the electric telegraph company established in  as these companies amalgamated and were taken over or collapsed the remaining companies were transferred to state control under the post office in  these companies were merged and rebranded as british telecom  to edit the bt tower originally the post office tower constructed between  and  in january  alexander graham bell demonstrated his recently developed telephone to queen victoria at osborne house on the isle of wight a few days later the first telephone in britain was installed under licence from the general post office by engineers from david moseley and sons to connect the dantzic street premises of manchester hardware merchant mr john hudson with his other premises in nearby shudehill as the number of installed telephones across the country grew it became sensible to consider constructing telephone exchanges to allow all the telephones in each city to be connected together the first exchange was opened in london in august  closely followed by the lancashire telephonic exchange in manchester from  the telephone service in britain was provided by private sector companies such as the national telephone company and later by the general post office in  the national telephone company was taken over by the general post office in  it became the primary supplier of telecommunications services after the post office took over the private sector telephone service in gb except for a few local authority services those services all folded within a few years the sole exception being kingston upon hull where the telephone department became present day kcom group public corporationedit converting the post office into a nationalised industry as opposed to a governmental department was first discussed in  by lord wolmer in  the bridgeman committee produced a report that was rejected in  more proposals were ignored the post office remained a department of central government with the postmaster general sitting in cabinet as a secretary of state in march  tony benn the acting postmaster general wrote to harold wilson the prime minister proposing that studies be undertaken aimed at converting the post office into a nationalised industry a committee was set up to look into the advantages and disadvantages of the proposal and its findings were found to be favourable enough for the government to reestablish a steering group on the organisation of the post office after some initial deliberations that the business should be divided into five divisions post telecommunications savings giro and national data processing services it was decided that there should be two post and telecommunications these events finally resulted in the introduction of the post office act  on  october  under the post office act of  the post office ceased to be a government department and it became established as a public corporation the act gave the post office the exclusive privilege of operating telecommunications systems with listed powers to authorise others to run such systems effectively the general post office retained its telecommunications monopoly  to edit the british telecom t symbol logo used from  to  in  the carter committee report recommended a further division of the two main services and for their relocation under two individual corporations the findings contained in the report led to the renaming of post office telecommunications as british telecommunications trading as british telecom in  although it remained part of the post office the british telecommunications act  transferred the responsibility for telecommunications services from the post office creating two separate corporations post office ltd and british telecommunications at this time the first steps were taken to introduce competition into british telecommunications industry in particular the act empowered the secretary of state for trade and industry as well as british telecommunications to license other operators to run public telecommunications systems additionally a framework was established which enabled the secretary of state to set standards with the british standards institution bsi for apparatus supplied to the public by third parties and had the effect of requiring british telecommunications to connect approved apparatus to its systems the secretary of state made use of these new powers and began the process of opening up the apparatus supply market where a phased programme of liberalisation was started in  in  a licence was granted to cable  wireless to run a public telecommunications network through its subsidiary mercury communications ltd  to edit on  july  the government formally announced its intention to privatise british telecommunications with the sale of up to  of the companys shares to private investors this intention was confirmed by the passing of the telecommunications act  which received royal assent on  april that year the transfer to british telecommunications plc of the business of british telecommunications the statutory corporation took place on  august  and on  november  more than  per cent of british telecommunications shares were sold to the public at the time this was the largest share issue in the world the new legislation was intended to enable british telecommunications to become more responsive to competition in gb and to expand its operations globally commercial freedom granted to british telecommunications allowed it to enter into new joint ventures and if it so decided to engage in the manufacture of its own apparatus the companys transfer into the private sector continued in december  when the government sold around half its remaining holding of  of shares reducing its stake to  substantially all the governments remaining shares were sold in a third flotation in july  raising £ billion for the treasury and introducing  new shareholders to the company the  act also abolished british telecommunicationss exclusive privilege of running telecommunications systems and established a framework to safeguard the workings of competition this meant that british telecommunications finally lost its monopoly in running telecommunications systems which it had technically retained under the  act despite the secretary of states licensing powers it now required a licence in the same way as any other telecommunications operator the principal licence granted to british telecommunications laid down strict and extensive conditions affecting the range of its activities including those of manufacture and supply of apparatus in  cellnet was launched as a subsidiary of telecom securicor cellular radio limited a  venture between british telecommunications and securicor respectively securicor originally invested

choice telecommunications policy for the s was issued in effect it ended the duopoly which had been shared by british telecommunications and mercury communications in the uk since november  and the buildup to privatisation the new policy enabled customers to acquire telecommunications services from competing providers using a variety of technologies independent retail companies were permitted to bulkbuy telecommunications capacity and sell it in packages to business and domestic users the white paper was endorsed by british telecommunications the new policy enabling the company to compete freely and more effectively by offering flexible pricing packages to meet the needs of different types of customer  to edit the bt brand and piper logo were introduced in  the logo remained until  on

the company from operating in their countries although bt had notified the uk government in  of huaweis interest in their £b network upgrade contract they did not raise the security implications as bt failed to explain that the chinese company would have unfettered access to critical infrastructure on  december  david cameron was supplied with an indepth report indicating that the intelligence services had very grave doubts regarding huawei and that the uk governmental military business community and private citizens privacy may be under serious threat subsequently bts infinity program and other projects are nowwhen under urgent review on  june  british lawmakers concluded that bt should never have allowed the chinese company access to the uks critical communications network without ministerial oversight saying they were deeply shocked that bt did not inform government that they were allowing huawei and zte both foreign entities with ties to the chinese military unfettered access to critical national systems furthermore ministers discovered that the agency with the responsibility to ensure chinese equipment and code was threatfree was entirely staffed by huawei employees subsequently parliamentarians confirmed that in case of an attack on the uk there was nothing at this point that could be done to stop chinese infiltration attacking critical national infrastructure zte another chinese company that supplies extensive network equipment and subscriber hardware to bt infinity was also under scrutiny by parliaments intelligence and security committee according to a report in the guardian on wednesday  october   after the us canada australia and the european union declared the company a security risk to its citizens world wide web hyperlink patentedit in  bt discovered it owned a patent us patent  which it believed gave it patent rights on the use of hyperlink technology on the world wide web the corresponding uk patent had already expired but the us patent was valid until  on  february  bt began a court case relating to its claims in a us federal court against the internet service provider prodigy communications corporation in the case british telecommunications plc v prodigy the united states district court for the southern district of new york ruled on  august  that the bt patent was not applicable to web technology and granted prodigys request for summary judgment of noninfringement behavioural targetingedit in early  it was announced that bt had entered into a contract along with virgin media and talktalk with the spyware company phorm responsible under their media guise for the apropos rootkit to intercept and analyse their users clickstream data and sell the anonymised aggregate information as part of phorms oix advertising service the practice known as behavioural targeting and condemned by critics as data pimping came under intense fire from various internet communities and other interestedparties who believe that the interception of data without the consent of users and web site owners is illegal under uk law ripa at a more fundamental level many have argued that the isps and phorm have no right to sell a commodity a users data and the copyright content of web sites to which they have no claim of ownership in response to questions about phorm and the interception of data by the webwise system sir tim bernerslee credited as the creator of the world wide web protocol indicated his disapproval of the concept and is quoted as saying of his data and web history its mine – you cant have it if you want to use it for something then you have to negotiate with me i have to agree i have to understand what im getting in return i myself feel that it is very important that my isp supplies internet to my house like the water company supplies water to my house it supplies connectivity with no strings attached my isp doesnt control which websites i go to it doesnt monitor which websites i go to — sir tim bernerslee  alleged complicity with drone strikes in yemen and somaliaedit in september  bt entered into a  million deal with the us military to provide a key communications cable connecting raf croughton a us military base on uk soil with camp lemonnier a large us base in djibouti camp lemonnier is used as a base for american drone attacks in yemen and somalia and has been described by the economist as the most important base for drone operations outside the war zone of afghanistan human rights groups including reprieve and amnesty international have criticised the use of armed drones outside declared war zones evidence produced by the bureau of investigative journalism and stanford universitys international human rights  conflict resolution clinic suggest that drone strikes have caused substantial civilian casualties and may be illegal under international law in  bt was the subject of a complaint by reprieve to the department of business innovation and skills under the oecd guidelines for multinational enterprises following their refusal to explain whether or not their infrastructure was used to facilitate drone strikes the subsequent refusal of this complaint was appealed in may  on the basis that the uk national contact points decision did not follow the oecd guidelines the issue of bias was also raised due to the appointment of lord ian livingston as government minister for the department which was processing the complaint livingston had occupied a senior position at bt when the cable between raf croughton and camp lemonnier was originally built

them was the first commercial telegraph service the electric telegraph company established in  as these companies amalgamated and were taken over or collapsed the remaining companies were transferred to state control under the post office in  these companies were merged and rebranded as british telecom  to edit the bt tower originally the post office tower constructed between  and  in january  alexander graham bell demonstrated his recently developed telephone to queen victoria at osborne house on the isle of wight a few days later the first telephone in britain was installed under licence from the general post office by engineers from david moseley and sons to connect the dantzic street premises of manchester hardware merchant mr john hudson with his other premises in nearby shudehill as the number of installed telephones across the country grew it became sensible to consider constructing telephone exchanges to allow all the telephones in each city to be connected together the first exchange was opened in london in august  closely followed by the lancashire telephonic exchange in manchester from  the telephone service in britain was provided by private sector companies such as the national telephone company and later by the general post office in  the national telephone company was taken over by the general post office in  it became the primary supplier of telecommunications services after the post office took over the private sector telephone service in gb except for a few local authority services those services all folded within a few years the sole exception being kingston upon hull where the telephone department became present day kcom group public corporationedit converting the post office into a nationalised industry as opposed to a governmental department was first discussed in  by lord wolmer in  the bridgeman committee produced a report that was rejected in  more proposals were ignored the post office remained a department of central government with the postmaster general sitting in cabinet as a secretary of state in march  tony benn the acting postmaster general wrote to harold wilson the prime minister proposing that studies be undertaken aimed at converting the post office into a nationalised industry a committee was set up to look into the advantages and disadvantages of the proposal and its findings were found to be favourable enough for the government to reestablish a steering group on the organisation of the post office after some initial deliberations that the business should be divided into five divisions post telecommunications savings giro and national data processing services it was decided that there should be two post and telecommunications these events finally resulted in the introduction of the post office act  on  october  under the post office act of  the post office ceased to be a government department and it became established as a public corporation the act gave the post office the exclusive privilege of operating telecommunications systems with listed powers to authorise others to run such systems effectively the general post office retained its telecommunications monopoly  to edit the british telecom t symbol logo used from  to  in  the carter committee report recommended a further division of the two main services and for their relocation under two individual corporations the findings contained in the report led to the renaming of post office telecommunications as british telecommunications trading as british telecom in  although it remained part of the post office the british telecommunications act  transferred the responsibility for telecommunications services from the post office creating two separate corporations post office ltd and british telecommunications at this time the first steps were taken to introduce competition into british telecommunications industry in particular the act empowered the secretary of state for trade and industry as well as british telecommunications to license other operators to run public telecommunications systems additionally a framework was established which enabled the secretary of state to set standards with the british standards institution bsi for apparatus supplied to the public by third parties and had the effect of requiring british telecommunications to connect approved apparatus to its systems the secretary of state made use of these new powers and began the process of opening up the apparatus supply market where a phased programme of liberalisation was started in  in  a licence was granted to cable  wireless to run a public telecommunications network through its subsidiary mercury communications ltd  to edit on  july  the government formally announced its intention to privatise british telecommunications with the sale of up to  of the companys shares to private investors this intention was confirmed by the passing of the telecommunications act  which received royal assent on  april that year the transfer to british telecommunications plc of the business of british telecommunications the statutory corporation took place on  august  and on  november  more than  per cent of british telecommunications shares were sold to the public at the time this was the largest share issue in the world the new legislation was intended to enable british telecommunications to become more responsive to competition in gb and to expand its operations globally commercial freedom granted to british telecommunications allowed it to enter into new joint ventures and if it so decided to engage in the manufacture of its own apparatus the companys transfer into the private sector continued in december  when the government sold around half its remaining holding of  of shares reducing its stake to  substantially all the governments remaining shares were sold in a third flotation in july  raising £ billion for the treasury and introducing  new shareholders to the company the  act also abolished british telecommunicationss exclusive privilege of running telecommunications systems and established a framework to safeguard the workings of competition this meant that british telecommunications finally lost its monopoly in running telecommunications systems which it had technically retained under the  act despite the secretary of states licensing powers it now required a licence in the same way as any other telecommunications operator the principal licence granted to british telecommunications laid down strict and extensive conditions affecting the range of its activities including those of manufacture and supply of apparatus in  cellnet was launched as a subsidiary of telecom securicor cellular radio limited a  venture between british telecommunications and securicor respectively securicor originally invested £ million in cellnet in  in  bt purchased securicors shares in cellnet for £ billion the company was later rebranded as bt cellnet and became a part of bt wireless a group of subsidiary companies owned by bt the next major development for british telecommunications and a move towards a more open market in telecommunications occurred in  on  march the governments white paper competition and choice telecommunications policy for the s was issued in effect it ended the duopoly which had been shared by british telecommunications and mercury communications in the uk since november  and the buildup to privatisation the new policy enabled customers to acquire telecommunications services from competing providers using a variety of technologies independent retail companies were permitted to bulkbuy telecommunications capacity and sell it in packages to business and domestic users the white paper was endorsed by british telecommunications the new policy enabling the company to compete freely and more effectively by offering flexible pricing packages to meet the needs of different types of customer

the interception of data by the webwise system sir tim bernerslee credited as the creator of the world wide web protocol indicated his disapproval of the concept and is quoted as saying of his data

conflict resolution clinic suggest that drone strikes have caused substantial civilian casualties and may be illegal under international law in  bt was the subject of a complaint by reprieve to the department of business innovation and skills under the oecd guidelines for multinational enterprises following their refusal to explain whether or not their infrastructure was used to facilitate drone strikes the subsequent refusal of this complaint was appealed in may  on the basis that the uk national contact points decision did not follow the oecd guidelines the issue of bias was also raised due to the appointment of lord ian livingston as government minister for the department which was processing the complaint livingston had occupied a senior position at bt when the cable between raf

back to the establishment of the first telecommunications companies in britain among them was the first commercial telegraph service the electric telegraph company established in  as these companies amalgamated and were taken over or collapsed the remaining companies were transferred to state control under the post office in  these companies were merged and rebranded as british telecom  to edit the bt tower originally the post office tower constructed between  and  in january  alexander graham bell demonstrated his recently developed telephone to queen victoria at osborne house on the isle of wight a few days later the first telephone in britain was installed under licence from the general post office by engineers from david moseley and sons to connect the dantzic street premises of manchester hardware merchant mr john hudson with his other premises in nearby shudehill as the number of installed telephones across the country grew it became sensible to consider constructing telephone exchanges to allow all the telephones in each city to be connected together the first exchange was opened in london in august  closely followed by the lancashire telephonic exchange in manchester from  the telephone service in britain was provided by private sector companies such as the national telephone company and later by the general post office in  the national telephone company was taken over by the general post office in  it became the primary supplier of telecommunications services after the post office took over the private sector telephone service in gb except for a few local authority services those services all folded within a few years the sole exception being kingston upon hull where the telephone department became present day kcom group public corporationedit converting the post office into a nationalised industry as opposed to a governmental department was first discussed in  by lord wolmer in  the bridgeman committee produced a report that was rejected in  more proposals were ignored the post office remained a department of central government with the postmaster general sitting in cabinet as a secretary of state in march  tony benn the acting postmaster general wrote to harold wilson the prime minister proposing that studies be undertaken aimed at converting the post office into a nationalised industry a committee was set up to look into the advantages and disadvantages of the proposal and its findings were found to be favourable enough for the government to reestablish a steering group on the organisation of the post office after some initial deliberations that the business should be divided into five divisions post telecommunications savings giro and national data processing services it was decided that there should be two post and telecommunications these events finally resulted in the introduction of the post office act  on  october  under the post office act of  the post office ceased to be a government department and it became established as a public corporation the act gave the post office the exclusive privilege of operating telecommunications systems with listed powers to authorise others to run such systems effectively the general post office retained its telecommunications monopoly  to edit the british telecom t symbol logo used from  to  in  the carter committee report recommended a further division of the two main services and for their relocation under two individual corporations the findings contained in the report led to the renaming of post office telecommunications as british telecommunications trading as british telecom in  although it remained part of the post office the british telecommunications act  transferred the responsibility for telecommunications services from the post office creating two separate corporations post office ltd and british telecommunications at this time the first steps were taken to introduce competition into british telecommunications industry in particular the act empowered the secretary of state for trade and industry as well as british telecommunications to license other operators to run public telecommunications systems additionally a framework was established which enabled the secretary of state to set standards with the british standards institution bsi for apparatus supplied to the public by third parties and had the effect of requiring british telecommunications to connect approved apparatus to its systems the secretary of state made use of these new powers and began the process of opening up the apparatus supply market where a phased programme of liberalisation was started in  in  a licence was granted to cable  wireless to run a public telecommunications network through its subsidiary mercury communications ltd  to edit on  july  the government formally announced its intention to privatise british telecommunications with the sale of up to  of the companys shares to private investors this intention was confirmed by the passing of the telecommunications act  which received royal assent on  april that year the transfer to british telecommunications plc of the business of british telecommunications the statutory corporation took place on  august  and on  november  more than  per cent of british telecommunications shares were sold to the public at the time this was the largest share issue in the world the new legislation was intended to enable british telecommunications to become more responsive to competition in gb and to expand its operations globally commercial freedom granted to british telecommunications allowed it to enter into new joint ventures and if it so decided to engage in the manufacture of its own apparatus the companys transfer into the private sector continued in december  when the government sold around half its remaining holding of  of shares reducing its stake to  substantially all the governments remaining shares were sold in a third flotation in july  raising £ billion for the treasury and introducing  new shareholders to the company the  act also abolished british telecommunicationss exclusive privilege of running telecommunications systems and established a framework to safeguard the workings of competition this meant that british telecommunications finally lost its monopoly in running telecommunications systems which it had technically retained under the  act despite the secretary of states licensing powers it now required a licence in the same way as any other telecommunications operator the principal licence granted to british telecommunications laid down strict and extensive conditions affecting the range of its activities including those of manufacture and supply of apparatus in  cellnet was launched as a subsidiary of telecom securicor cellular radio limited a  venture between british telecommunications and securicor respectively securicor originally invested £ million in cellnet in  in  bt purchased securicors shares in cellnet for £ billion the company was later rebranded as bt cellnet and became a part of bt wireless a group of subsidiary companies owned by bt the next major development for british telecommunications and a move towards a more open market in telecommunications occurred in  on  march the governments white paper competition and choice telecommunications policy for the s was issued in effect it ended the duopoly which had been shared by british telecommunications and mercury communications in the uk since november  and the buildup to privatisation the new policy enabled customers to acquire telecommunications services from competing providers using a variety of technologies independent retail companies were permitted to bulkbuy telecommunications capacity and sell it in packages to business and domestic users the white paper was endorsed by british telecommunications the new policy enabling the company to compete freely and more effectively by offering flexible pricing packages to meet the needs of different types of customer  to edit the bt brand and piper logo were introduced in  the logo remained until  on

services had very grave doubts regarding huawei and that the uk governmental military business community and private citizens privacy may be under serious threat subsequently bts infinity program and other projects are nowwhen under urgent review on  june  british lawmakers concluded that bt should never have allowed the chinese company access to the uks critical communications network without ministerial oversight saying they were deeply shocked that bt did not inform government that they were allowing huawei and zte both foreign entities with ties to the chinese military unfettered access to critical national systems furthermore ministers discovered that the agency with the responsibility to ensure chinese equipment and code was threatfree was entirely staffed by huawei employees

phorm responsible under their media guise for the apropos rootkit to intercept and analyse their users clickstream data and sell the anonymised aggregate information as part of phorms oix advertising service the practice known as behavioural targeting and condemned by critics as data pimping came under intense fire from various internet communities and other interestedparties who believe that the interception of data without the consent of users and web site owners is illegal under uk law ripa at a more fundamental level many have argued that the isps and phorm have no right to sell a commodity a users data and the copyright content of web sites to which they have no claim of ownership in response to questions about phorm and the interception of data by the webwise system sir tim bernerslee credited as the creator of the world wide web protocol indicated his disapproval of the concept and is quoted as saying of his data and web history its mine – you cant have it if you want to use it for something then you have to negotiate with me i have to agree i have to understand what im getting in return i myself feel that it is very important that my isp supplies internet to my house like the water company supplies water to my house it supplies connectivity with no strings attached my isp doesnt control which websites i go to it doesnt monitor which websites i go to — sir tim bernerslee  alleged complicity with drone strikes in yemen and somaliaedit in september  bt entered into a  million deal with the us military to provide a key communications cable connecting raf croughton a us military base on uk soil with camp lemonnier a large us base in djibouti camp lemonnier is used as a base for american drone attacks in yemen and somalia and has been described by the economist as the most important base for drone operations outside the war zone of afghanistan human rights groups including reprieve and amnesty international have criticised the use of armed drones outside declared war zones evidence produced by the bureau of investigative journalism and stanford universitys international human rights  conflict resolution clinic suggest that drone strikes have caused substantial civilian casualties and may be illegal under international law in  bt was the subject of a complaint by reprieve to the department of business innovation and skills under the oecd guidelines for multinational enterprises following their refusal to explain whether or not their infrastructure was used to facilitate drone strikes the subsequent refusal of this complaint was appealed in may  on the basis that the uk national contact points decision did not follow the oecd guidelines the issue of bias was also raised due to the appointment of lord ian livingston as government minister for the department which was processing the complaint livingston had occupied a senior position at bt when the cable between raf croughton and camp lemonnier was originally built

them was the first commercial telegraph service the electric telegraph company established in  as these companies amalgamated and were taken over or collapsed the remaining companies were transferred to state control under the post office in  these companies were merged and rebranded as british telecom  to edit the bt tower originally the post office tower constructed between  and  in january  alexander graham bell demonstrated his recently developed telephone to queen victoria at osborne house on the isle of wight a few days later the first telephone in britain was installed under licence from the general post office by engineers from david moseley and sons to connect the dantzic street premises of manchester hardware merchant mr john hudson with his other premises in nearby shudehill as the number of installed telephones across the country grew it became sensible to consider constructing telephone exchanges to allow all the telephones in each city to be connected together the first exchange was opened in london in august  closely followed by the lancashire telephonic exchange in manchester from  the telephone service in britain was provided by private sector companies such as the national telephone company and later by the general post office in  the national telephone company was taken over by the general post office in  it became the primary supplier of telecommunications services after the post office took over the private sector telephone service in gb except for a few local authority services those services all folded within a few years the sole exception being kingston upon hull where the telephone department became present day kcom group public corporationedit converting the post office into a nationalised industry as opposed to a governmental department was first discussed in  by lord wolmer in  the bridgeman committee produced a report that was rejected in  more proposals were ignored the post office remained a department of central government with the postmaster general sitting in cabinet as a secretary of state in march  tony benn the acting postmaster general wrote to harold wilson the prime minister proposing that studies be undertaken aimed at converting the post office into a nationalised industry a committee was set up to look into the advantages and disadvantages of the proposal and its findings were found to be favourable enough for the government to reestablish a steering group on the organisation of the post office after some initial deliberations that the business should be divided into five divisions post telecommunications savings giro and national data processing services it was decided that there should be two post and telecommunications these events finally resulted in the introduction of the post office act  on  october  under the post office act of  the post office ceased to be a government department and it became established as a public corporation the act gave the post office the exclusive privilege of operating telecommunications systems with listed powers to authorise others to run such systems effectively the general post office retained its telecommunications monopoly  to edit the british telecom t symbol logo used from  to  in  the carter committee report recommended a further division of the two main services and for their relocation under two individual corporations the findings contained in the report led to the renaming of post office telecommunications as british telecommunications trading as british telecom in  although it remained part of the post office the british telecommunications act  transferred the responsibility for telecommunications services from the post office creating two separate corporations post office ltd and british telecommunications at this time the first steps were taken to introduce competition into british telecommunications industry in particular the act empowered the secretary of state for trade and industry as well as british telecommunications to license other operators to run public telecommunications systems additionally a framework was established which enabled the secretary of state to set standards with the british standards institution bsi for apparatus supplied to the public by third parties and had the effect of requiring british telecommunications to connect approved apparatus to its systems the secretary of state made use of these new powers and began the process of opening up the apparatus supply market where a phased programme of liberalisation was started in  in  a licence was granted to cable  wireless to run a public telecommunications network through its subsidiary mercury communications ltd  to edit on  july  the government formally announced its intention to privatise british telecommunications with the sale of up to  of the companys shares to private investors this intention was confirmed by the passing of the telecommunications act  which received royal assent on  april that year the transfer to british telecommunications plc of the business of british telecommunications the statutory corporation took place on  august  and on  november  more than  per cent of british telecommunications shares were sold to the public at the time this was the largest share issue in the world the new legislation was intended to enable british telecommunications to become more responsive to competition in gb and to expand its operations globally commercial freedom granted to british telecommunications allowed it to enter into new joint ventures and if it so decided to engage in the manufacture of its own apparatus the companys transfer into the private sector continued in december  when the government sold around half its remaining holding of  of shares reducing its stake to  substantially all the governments remaining shares were sold in a third flotation in july  raising £ billion for the treasury and introducing  new shareholders to the company the  act also abolished british telecommunicationss exclusive privilege of running telecommunications systems and established a framework to safeguard the workings of competition this meant that british telecommunications finally lost its monopoly in running telecommunications systems which it had technically retained under the  act despite the secretary of states licensing powers it now required a licence in the same way as any other telecommunications operator the principal licence granted to british telecommunications laid down strict and extensive conditions affecting the range of its activities including those of manufacture and supply of apparatus in  cellnet was launched as a subsidiary of telecom securicor cellular radio limited a  venture between british telecommunications and securicor respectively securicor originally invested £ million in cellnet in  in  bt purchased securicors shares in cellnet for £ billion the company was later rebranded as bt cellnet and became a part of bt wireless a group of subsidiary companies owned by bt the next major development for british telecommunications and a move towards a more open market in telecommunications occurred in  on  march the governments white paper competition and choice telecommunications policy for the s was issued in effect it ended the duopoly which had been shared by british telecommunications and mercury communications in the uk since november  and the buildup to privatisation the new policy enabled customers to acquire telecommunications services from competing providers using a variety of technologies independent retail companies were permitted to bulkbuy telecommunications capacity and sell it in packages to business and domestic users the white paper was endorsed by british telecommunications the new policy enabling the company to compete freely and more effectively by offering flexible pricing packages to meet the needs of different types of customer

increasing urgency after the usa canada and australia prevented the company from operating in their countries although bt had notified the uk government in  of huaweis interest in their £b network upgrade contract they did not raise the security implications as bt failed to explain that the chinese company would have unfettered access to critical infrastructure on  december  david cameron was supplied with an indepth report indicating that the intelligence services had very grave doubts regarding huawei and that the uk governmental military business community and private citizens privacy may be under serious threat subsequently bts infinity program and other projects are nowwhen under urgent review on  june  british lawmakers concluded that bt should never have allowed the chinese company access to the uks critical communications network without ministerial oversight saying they were deeply shocked that bt did not inform government that they were allowing huawei and zte both foreign entities with ties to the chinese military unfettered access to critical national systems furthermore ministers discovered that the agency with the responsibility to ensure chinese equipment and code was threatfree was entirely staffed by huawei employees subsequently parliamentarians confirmed that in case of an attack on the uk there was nothing at this point that could be done to stop chinese infiltration attacking critical national infrastructure zte another chinese company that supplies extensive network equipment and subscriber hardware to bt infinity was also under scrutiny by parliaments intelligence and security committee according to a report in the guardian on wednesday  october   after the us canada australia and the european union declared the company a security risk to its citizens world wide web hyperlink patentedit in  bt discovered it owned a patent us patent  which it believed gave it patent rights on the use of hyperlink technology on the world wide web the corresponding uk patent had already expired but the us patent was valid until  on  february  bt began a court case relating to its claims in a us federal court against the internet service provider prodigy communications corporation in the case british telecommunications plc v prodigy the united states district court for the southern district of new york ruled on  august  that the bt patent was not applicable to web technology and granted prodigys request for summary judgment of noninfringement behavioural targetingedit in early  it was announced that bt had entered into a contract along with virgin media and talktalk with the spyware company phorm responsible under their media guise for the apropos rootkit to intercept and analyse their users clickstream data and sell the anonymised aggregate information as part of phorms oix advertising service the practice known as behavioural targeting and condemned by critics as data pimping came under intense fire from various internet communities and other interestedparties who believe that the interception of data without the consent of users and web site owners is illegal under uk law ripa at a more fundamental level many have argued that the isps and phorm have no right to sell a commodity a users data and the copyright content of web sites to which they have no claim of ownership in response to questions about phorm and the interception of data by the webwise system sir tim bernerslee credited as the creator of the world wide web protocol indicated his disapproval of the concept and is quoted as saying of his data and web history its mine – you cant have it if you want to use it for something then you have to negotiate with me i have to agree i have to understand what im getting in return i myself feel that it is very important that my isp supplies internet to my house like the water company supplies water to my house it supplies connectivity with no strings attached my isp doesnt control which websites i go to it doesnt monitor which websites i go to — sir tim bernerslee  alleged complicity with drone strikes in yemen and somaliaedit in september  bt entered into a  million deal with the us military to provide a key communications cable connecting raf croughton a us military base on uk soil with camp lemonnier a large us base in djibouti camp lemonnier is used as a base for american drone attacks in yemen and somalia and has been described by the economist as the most important base for drone operations outside the war zone of afghanistan human rights groups including reprieve and amnesty international have criticised the use of armed drones outside declared war zones evidence produced by the bureau of investigative journalism and stanford universitys international human rights  conflict resolution clinic suggest that drone strikes have caused substantial civilian casualties and may be illegal under international law in  bt was the subject of a complaint by reprieve to the department of business innovation and skills under the oecd guidelines for multinational enterprises following their refusal to explain whether or not their infrastructure was used to facilitate drone strikes the subsequent refusal of this complaint was appealed in may  on the basis that the uk national contact points decision did not follow the oecd guidelines the issue of bias was also raised due to the appointment of lord ian livingston as government minister for the department which was processing the complaint livingston had occupied a senior position at bt when the cable between raf croughton and camp lemonnier was originally built see alsoedit london portal companies portal sheriff referencesedit  a b c d bt annual report  bt group plc retrieved  may    linkedin   group

telecommunications companies in britain among them was the first commercial telegraph service the electric telegraph company established in  as these companies amalgamated and were taken over or collapsed the remaining companies were transferred to state control under the post office in  these companies were merged and rebranded as british telecom  to edit the bt tower originally the post office tower constructed between  and  in january  alexander graham bell demonstrated his recently developed telephone to queen victoria at osborne house on the isle of wight a few days later the first telephone in britain was installed under licence from the general post office by engineers from david moseley and sons to connect the dantzic street premises of manchester hardware merchant mr john hudson with his other premises in nearby shudehill as the number of installed telephones across the country grew it became sensible to consider constructing telephone exchanges to allow all the telephones in each city to be connected together the first exchange was opened in london in august  closely followed by the lancashire telephonic exchange in manchester from  the telephone service in britain was provided by private sector companies such as the national telephone company and later by the general post office in  the national telephone company was taken over by the general post office in  it became the primary supplier of telecommunications services after the post office took over the private sector telephone service in gb except for a few local authority services those services all folded within a few years the sole exception being kingston upon hull where the telephone department became present day kcom group public corporationedit converting the post office into a nationalised industry as opposed to a governmental department was first discussed in  by lord wolmer in  the bridgeman committee produced a report that was rejected in  more proposals were ignored the post office remained a department of central government with the postmaster general sitting in cabinet as a secretary of state in march  tony benn the acting postmaster general wrote to harold wilson the prime minister proposing that studies be undertaken aimed at converting the post office into a nationalised industry a committee was set up to look into the advantages and disadvantages of the proposal and its findings were found to be favourable enough for the government to reestablish a steering group on the organisation of the post office after some initial deliberations that the business should be divided into five divisions post telecommunications savings giro and national data processing services it was decided that there should be two post and telecommunications these events finally resulted in the introduction of the post office act  on  october  under the post office act of  the post office ceased to be a government department and it became established as a public corporation the act gave the post office the exclusive privilege of operating telecommunications systems with listed powers to authorise others to run such systems effectively the general post office retained its telecommunications monopoly  to edit the british telecom t symbol logo used from  to  in  the carter committee report recommended a further division of the two main services and for their relocation under two individual corporations the findings contained in the report led to the renaming of post office telecommunications as british telecommunications trading as british telecom in  although it remained part of the post office the british telecommunications act  transferred the responsibility for telecommunications services from the post office creating two separate corporations post office ltd and british telecommunications at this time the first steps were taken to introduce competition into british telecommunications industry in particular the act empowered the secretary of state for trade and industry as well as british telecommunications to license other operators to run public telecommunications systems additionally a framework was established which enabled the secretary of state to set standards with the british standards institution bsi for apparatus supplied to the public by third parties and had the effect of requiring british telecommunications to connect approved apparatus to its systems the secretary of state made use of these new powers and began the process of opening up the apparatus supply market where a phased programme of liberalisation was started in  in  a licence was granted to cable  wireless to run a public telecommunications network through its subsidiary mercury communications ltd  to edit on  july  the government formally announced its intention to privatise british telecommunications with the sale of up to  of the companys shares to private investors this intention was confirmed by the passing of the telecommunications act  which received royal assent on  april that year the transfer to british telecommunications plc of the business of british telecommunications the statutory corporation took place on  august  and on  november  more than  per cent of british telecommunications shares were sold to the public at the time this was the largest share issue in the world the new legislation was intended to enable british telecommunications to become more responsive to competition in gb and to expand its operations globally commercial freedom granted to british telecommunications allowed it to enter into new joint ventures and if it so decided to engage in the manufacture of its own apparatus the companys transfer into the private sector continued in december  when the government sold around half its remaining holding of  of shares reducing its stake to  substantially all the governments remaining shares were sold in a third flotation in july  raising £ billion for the treasury and introducing  new shareholders to the company the  act also abolished british telecommunicationss exclusive privilege of running telecommunications systems and established a framework to safeguard the workings of competition this meant that british telecommunications finally lost its monopoly in running telecommunications systems which it had technically retained under the  act despite the secretary of states licensing powers it now required a licence in the same way as any other telecommunications operator the principal licence granted to british telecommunications laid down strict and extensive conditions affecting the range of its activities including those of manufacture and supply of apparatus in  cellnet was launched as a subsidiary of telecom securicor cellular radio limited a  venture between british telecommunications and securicor respectively securicor originally invested £ million in cellnet in  in  bt purchased securicors shares in cellnet for £ billion the company was later rebranded as bt cellnet and became a part of bt wireless a group of subsidiary companies owned by bt the next major development for british telecommunications and a move towards a more open market in telecommunications occurred in  on  march the governments white paper competition and choice telecommunications policy for the s was issued in effect it ended the duopoly which had been shared by british telecommunications and mercury communications in the uk since november  and the buildup to privatisation the new policy enabled customers to acquire telecommunications services from competing providers using a variety of technologies independent retail companies were permitted to bulkbuy telecommunications capacity and sell it in packages to business and domestic users the white paper was endorsed by british telecommunications the new policy enabling the company to compete freely and more effectively by offering flexible pricing packages to meet the needs of different types of customer  to edit the bt brand and piper logo were introduced in  the logo remained until  on  april  the company started using a new trading name bt and branding in june  bt and mci communication corporation the second largest carrier of long distance telecommunications services in the united states launched concert communications services a  billion joint venture company this alliance gave bt and mci a global network for providing endtoend connectivity for advanced business services concert was the first company to provide a singlesource broad portfolio of global communications services for multinational customers on  november  bt and mci announced they had entered into a merger agreement to create a global telecommunications company called concert plc to be incorporated in gb with headquarters in both london and washington dc as part of the alliance bt acquired a  holding in mci nevertheless following us carrier worldcoms rival bid for mci on  october  bt ultimately decided in november to sell its stake in mci to worldcom for  billion the deal with worldcom resulted in a profit of more than  billion on bts original investment in mci with an additional  million severance fee for the breakup of the proposed merger in december  following modifications to bts licence in april  bt offered local loop unbundling llu to other telecommunications operators enabling them to use bts copper local loops the connection between the customers premises and the exchange to connect directly with their customers  to edit bt offices in madrid spain following the dot com crash the group

supplied with an indepth report indicating that the intelligence services had very grave doubts regarding huawei and that the uk governmental military business community and private citizens privacy may be under serious threat subsequently bts infinity program and other projects are nowwhen under urgent review on  june  british lawmakers concluded that bt should never have allowed the chinese company access to the uks critical communications network without ministerial oversight saying they were deeply shocked that bt did not inform government that they were allowing huawei and zte both foreign entities with ties to the chinese military unfettered access to critical national systems furthermore ministers discovered that the agency with the responsibility to ensure chinese equipment

with virgin media and talktalk with the spyware company phorm responsible under their media guise for the apropos rootkit to intercept and analyse their users clickstream data and sell the anonymised aggregate information as part of phorms oix advertising service the practice known as behavioural targeting and condemned by critics as data pimping came under intense fire from various internet communities and other interestedparties who believe that the interception of data without the consent of users and web site owners is illegal under uk law ripa at a more fundamental level many have argued that the isps and phorm have no right to sell a commodity a users data and the copyright content of web sites to which they have no claim of ownership in response to questions about phorm and the interception of data by the webwise system sir tim bernerslee credited as the creator of the world wide web protocol indicated his disapproval of the concept and is quoted as saying of his data and web history its mine – you cant have it if you want to use it for something then you have to negotiate with me i have to agree i have to understand what im getting in return i myself feel that it is very important that my isp supplies internet to my house like the water company supplies water to my house it supplies connectivity with no strings attached my isp doesnt control which websites i go to it doesnt monitor which websites i go to — sir tim bernerslee  alleged complicity with drone strikes in yemen and somaliaedit in september  bt entered into a  million deal with the us military to provide a key communications cable connecting raf croughton a us military base on uk soil with camp lemonnier a large us base in djibouti camp lemonnier is used as a base for american drone attacks in yemen and somalia and has been described by the economist as the most important base for drone operations outside the war zone of afghanistan human rights groups including reprieve and amnesty international have criticised the use of armed drones outside declared war zones evidence produced by the bureau of investigative journalism and stanford universitys international human rights  conflict resolution clinic suggest that drone strikes have caused substantial civilian casualties and may be illegal under international law in  bt was the subject of a complaint by reprieve to the department of business innovation and skills under the oecd guidelines for multinational enterprises following their refusal to explain whether or not their infrastructure was used to facilitate drone strikes the subsequent refusal of this complaint was appealed in may  on the basis that the uk national contact points decision did not follow the oecd guidelines the issue of bias was also raised due to the appointment of lord ian livingston as government minister for the department which was processing the complaint livingston had occupied a senior position at bt when the cable between raf croughton and camp lemonnier was originally built see alsoedit london portal companies portal sheriff referencesedit  a b c d bt annual report  bt group plc retrieved  may    linkedin   group

back to the establishment of the first telecommunications companies in britain among them was the first commercial telegraph service the electric telegraph company established in  as these companies amalgamated and were taken over or collapsed the remaining companies were transferred to state control under the post office in  these companies were merged and rebranded as british telecom  to edit the bt tower originally the post office tower constructed between  and  in january  alexander graham bell demonstrated his recently developed telephone to queen victoria at osborne house on the isle of wight a few days later the first telephone in britain was installed under licence from the general post office by engineers from david moseley and sons to connect the dantzic street premises of manchester hardware merchant mr john hudson with his other premises in nearby shudehill as the number of installed telephones across the country grew it became sensible to consider constructing telephone exchanges to allow all the telephones in each city to be connected together the first exchange was opened in london in august  closely followed by the lancashire telephonic exchange in manchester from  the telephone service in britain was provided by private sector companies such as the national telephone company and later by the general post office in  the national telephone company was taken over by the general post office in  it became the primary supplier of telecommunications services after the post office took over the private sector telephone service in gb except for a few local authority services those services all folded within a few years the sole exception being kingston upon hull where the telephone department became present day kcom group public corporationedit converting the post office into a nationalised industry as opposed to a governmental department was first discussed in  by lord wolmer in  the bridgeman committee produced a report that was rejected in  more proposals were ignored the post office remained a department of central government with the postmaster general sitting in cabinet as a secretary of state in march  tony benn the acting postmaster general wrote to harold wilson the prime minister proposing that studies be undertaken aimed at converting the post office into a nationalised industry a committee was set up to look into the advantages and disadvantages of the proposal and its findings were found to be favourable enough for the government to reestablish a steering group on the organisation of the post office after some initial deliberations that the business should be divided into five divisions post telecommunications savings giro and national data processing services it was decided that there should be two post and telecommunications these events finally resulted in the introduction of the post office act  on  october  under the post office act of  the post office ceased to be a government department and it became established as a public corporation the act gave the post office the exclusive privilege of operating telecommunications systems with listed powers to authorise others to run such systems effectively the general post office retained its telecommunications monopoly  to edit the british telecom t symbol logo used from  to  in  the carter committee report recommended a further division of the two main services and for their relocation under two individual corporations the findings contained in the report led to the renaming of post office telecommunications as british telecommunications trading as british telecom in  although it remained part of the post office the british telecommunications act  transferred the responsibility for telecommunications services from the post office creating two separate corporations post office ltd and british telecommunications at this time the first steps were taken to introduce competition into british telecommunications industry in particular the act empowered the secretary of state for trade and industry as well as british telecommunications to license other operators to run public telecommunications systems additionally a framework was established which enabled the secretary of state to set standards with the british standards institution bsi for apparatus supplied to the public by third parties and had the effect of requiring british telecommunications to connect approved apparatus to its systems the secretary of state made use of these new powers and began the process of opening up the apparatus supply market where a phased programme of liberalisation was started in  in  a licence was granted to cable  wireless to run a public telecommunications network through its subsidiary mercury communications ltd  to edit on  july  the government formally announced its intention to privatise british telecommunications with the sale of up to  of the companys shares to private investors this intention was confirmed by the passing of the telecommunications act  which received royal assent on  april that year the transfer to british telecommunications plc of the business of british telecommunications the statutory corporation took place on  august  and on  november  more than  per cent of british telecommunications shares were sold to the public at the time this was the largest share issue in the world the new legislation was intended to enable british telecommunications to become more responsive to competition in gb and to expand its operations globally commercial freedom granted to british telecommunications allowed it to enter into new joint ventures and if it so decided to engage in the manufacture of its own apparatus the companys transfer into the private sector continued in december  when the government sold around half its remaining holding of  of shares reducing its stake to  substantially all the governments remaining shares were sold in a third flotation in july  raising £ billion for the treasury and introducing  new shareholders to the company the  act also abolished british telecommunicationss exclusive privilege of running telecommunications systems and established a framework to safeguard the workings of competition this meant that british telecommunications finally lost its monopoly in running telecommunications systems which it had technically retained under the  act despite the secretary of states licensing powers it now required a licence in the same way as any other telecommunications operator the principal licence granted to british telecommunications laid down strict and extensive conditions affecting the range of its activities including those of manufacture and supply of apparatus in  cellnet was launched as a subsidiary of telecom securicor cellular radio limited a  venture between british telecommunications and securicor respectively securicor originally invested

owned by bt the next major development for british telecommunications and a move towards a more open market in telecommunications occurred in  on  march the governments white paper competition and choice telecommunications policy for the s was issued in effect it ended the duopoly which had been shared by british telecommunications and mercury communications in the uk since november  and the buildup to privatisation the new policy enabled customers to acquire telecommunications services from competing providers using a variety of technologies independent retail companies were permitted to bulkbuy telecommunications capacity and sell it in packages to business and domestic users the white paper was endorsed by british telecommunications the new policy enabling the company to compete freely and more effectively by offering flexible pricing packages to meet the needs of different types of customer  to edit the bt brand and piper logo were introduced in  the logo remained until  on

the company from operating in their countries although bt had notified the uk government in  of huaweis interest in their £b network upgrade contract they did not raise the security implications as bt failed to explain that the chinese company would have unfettered access to critical infrastructure on  december  david cameron was supplied with an indepth report indicating that the intelligence services had very grave doubts regarding huawei and that the uk governmental military business community and private citizens privacy may be under serious threat subsequently bts infinity program and other projects are nowwhen under urgent review on  june  british lawmakers concluded that bt should never have allowed the chinese company access to the uks critical communications network without ministerial oversight saying they were deeply shocked that bt did not inform government that they were allowing huawei and zte both foreign entities with ties to the chinese military unfettered access to critical national systems furthermore ministers discovered that the agency with the responsibility to ensure chinese equipment and code was threatfree was entirely staffed by huawei employees subsequently parliamentarians confirmed that in case of an attack on the uk there was nothing at this point that could be done to stop chinese infiltration attacking critical national infrastructure zte another chinese company that supplies extensive network equipment and subscriber hardware to bt infinity was also under scrutiny by parliaments intelligence and security committee according to a report in the guardian on wednesday  october   after the us canada australia and the european union declared the company a security risk to its citizens world wide web hyperlink patentedit in  bt discovered it owned a patent us patent  which it believed gave it patent rights on the use of hyperlink technology on the world wide web the corresponding uk patent had already expired but the us

request for summary judgment of noninfringement behavioural targetingedit in early  it was announced that bt had entered into a contract along with virgin media and talktalk with the spyware company phorm responsible under their media guise for the apropos rootkit to intercept and analyse their users clickstream data and sell the anonymised aggregate information as part of phorms oix advertising service the practice known as behavioural targeting and condemned by critics as data pimping came under intense fire from various internet communities and other interestedparties who believe that the interception of data without the consent of users and web site owners is illegal under uk law ripa at a more fundamental level many have argued that the isps and phorm have no right to sell a commodity a users data and the copyright content of web sites to which they have no claim of ownership in response to questions about phorm and the interception of data by the webwise system sir tim bernerslee credited as the creator of the world wide web protocol indicated his disapproval of the concept and is quoted as saying of his data and web history its mine – you cant have it if you want to use it for something then you have to negotiate with me i have to agree i have to understand what im getting in return i myself feel that it is very important that my isp supplies internet to my house like the water company supplies water to my house it supplies connectivity with no strings attached my isp doesnt control which websites i go to it doesnt monitor which websites i go to — sir tim bernerslee  alleged complicity with drone strikes in yemen and somaliaedit in september  bt entered into a  million deal with the us military to provide a key communications cable connecting raf croughton a us military base on uk soil with camp lemonnier a large us base in djibouti camp lemonnier is used as a base for american drone attacks in yemen and somalia and has been described by the economist as the most important base for drone operations outside the war zone of afghanistan human rights groups including reprieve and amnesty international have criticised the use of armed drones outside declared war zones evidence produced by the bureau of investigative journalism and stanford universitys international human rights  conflict resolution clinic suggest that drone strikes have caused substantial civilian casualties and may be illegal under international law in  bt was the subject of a complaint by reprieve to the department of business innovation and skills under the oecd guidelines for multinational enterprises following their refusal to explain whether or not their infrastructure was used to facilitate drone strikes the subsequent refusal of this complaint was appealed in may  on the basis that the uk national contact points decision did not follow the oecd guidelines the issue of bias was also raised due to the appointment of lord ian livingston as government minister for the department which was processing the complaint livingston had occupied a senior position at bt when the cable between raf croughton and camp lemonnier was originally built

telecommunications companies in britain among them was the first commercial telegraph service the electric telegraph company established in  as these companies amalgamated and were taken over or collapsed the remaining companies were transferred to state control under the post office in  these companies were merged and rebranded as british telecom  to edit the bt tower originally the post office tower constructed between  and  in january  alexander graham bell demonstrated his recently developed telephone to queen victoria at osborne house on the isle of wight a few days later the first telephone in britain was installed under licence from the general post office by engineers from david moseley and sons to connect the dantzic street premises of manchester hardware merchant mr john hudson with his other premises in nearby shudehill as the number of installed telephones across the country grew it became sensible to consider constructing telephone exchanges to allow all the telephones in each city to be connected together the first exchange was opened in london in august  closely followed by the lancashire telephonic exchange in manchester from  the telephone service in britain was provided by private sector companies such as the national telephone company and later by the general post office in  the national telephone company was taken over by the general post office in  it became the primary supplier of telecommunications services after the post office took over the private sector telephone service in gb except for a few local authority services those services all folded within a few years the sole exception being kingston upon hull where the telephone department became present day kcom group public corporationedit converting the post office into a nationalised industry as opposed to a governmental department was first discussed in  by lord wolmer in  the bridgeman committee produced a report that was rejected in  more proposals were ignored the post office remained a department of central government with the postmaster general sitting in cabinet as a secretary of state in march  tony benn the acting postmaster general wrote to harold wilson the prime minister proposing that studies be undertaken aimed at converting the post office into a nationalised industry a committee was set up to look into the advantages and disadvantages of the proposal and its findings were found to be favourable enough for the government to reestablish a steering group on the organisation of the post office after some initial deliberations that the business should be divided into five divisions post telecommunications savings giro and national data processing services it was decided that there should be two post and telecommunications these events finally resulted in the introduction of the post office act  on  october  under the post office act of  the post office ceased to be a government department and it became established as a public corporation the act gave the post office the exclusive privilege of operating telecommunications systems with listed powers to authorise others to run such systems effectively the general post office retained its telecommunications monopoly  to edit the british telecom t symbol logo used from  to  in  the carter committee report recommended a further division of the two main services and for their relocation under two individual corporations the findings contained in the report led to the renaming of post office telecommunications as british telecommunications trading as british telecom in  although it remained part of the post office the british telecommunications act  transferred the responsibility for telecommunications services from the post office creating two separate corporations post office ltd and british telecommunications at this time the first steps were taken to introduce competition into british telecommunications industry in particular the act empowered the secretary of state for trade and industry as well as british telecommunications to license other operators to run public telecommunications systems additionally a framework was established which enabled the secretary of state to set standards with the british standards institution bsi for apparatus supplied to the public by third parties and had the effect of requiring british telecommunications to connect approved apparatus to its systems the secretary of state made use of these new powers and began the process of opening up the apparatus supply market where a phased programme of liberalisation was started in  in  a licence was granted to cable  wireless to run a public telecommunications network through its subsidiary mercury communications ltd  to edit on  july  the government formally announced its intention to privatise british telecommunications with the sale of up to  of the companys shares to private investors this intention was confirmed by the passing of the telecommunications act  which received royal assent on  april that year the transfer to british telecommunications plc of the business of british telecommunications the statutory corporation took place on  august  and on  november  more than  per cent of british telecommunications shares were sold to the public at the time this was the largest share issue in the world the new legislation was intended to enable british telecommunications to become more responsive to competition in gb and to expand its operations globally commercial freedom granted to british telecommunications allowed it to enter into new joint ventures and if it so decided to engage in the manufacture of its own apparatus the companys transfer into the private sector continued in december  when the government sold around half its remaining holding of  of shares reducing its stake to  substantially all the governments remaining shares were sold in a third flotation in july  raising £ billion for the treasury and introducing  new shareholders to the company the  act also abolished british telecommunicationss exclusive privilege of running telecommunications systems and established a framework to safeguard the workings of competition this meant that british telecommunications finally lost its monopoly in running telecommunications systems which it had technically retained under the  act despite the secretary of states licensing powers it now required a licence in the same way as any other telecommunications operator the principal licence granted to british telecommunications laid down strict and extensive conditions affecting the range of its activities including those of manufacture and supply of apparatus in  cellnet was launched as a subsidiary of telecom securicor cellular radio limited a  venture between british telecommunications and securicor respectively securicor originally invested £ million in cellnet in  in  bt purchased securicors shares in cellnet for £ billion the company was later rebranded as bt cellnet and became a part of bt wireless a group of subsidiary companies owned by bt the next major development for british telecommunications and a move towards a more open market in telecommunications occurred in  on  march the governments white paper competition and choice telecommunications policy for the s was issued in effect it ended the duopoly which had been shared by british telecommunications and mercury communications in the uk since november  and the buildup to privatisation the new policy enabled customers to acquire telecommunications services from competing providers using a variety of technologies independent retail companies were permitted to bulkbuy telecommunications capacity and sell it in packages to business and domestic users the white paper was endorsed by british telecommunications the new policy enabling the company to compete freely and more effectively by offering flexible pricing packages to meet the needs of different types

increasing urgency after the usa canada and australia prevented the company from operating in their countries although bt had notified the uk government in  of huaweis interest in their £b network upgrade contract they did not raise the security implications as bt failed to explain that the chinese company would have unfettered access to critical infrastructure on  december  david cameron was supplied with an indepth report indicating that the intelligence services had very grave doubts regarding huawei and that the uk governmental military business community and private citizens privacy may be under serious threat subsequently bts infinity program and other projects are nowwhen under urgent review on  june  british lawmakers concluded that bt should never have allowed the chinese company access to the uks critical communications network without ministerial oversight saying they were deeply shocked that bt did not inform government that they were allowing huawei and zte both foreign entities with ties to the chinese military unfettered access to critical national systems furthermore ministers discovered that the agency with the responsibility to ensure chinese equipment and code was threatfree was entirely staffed by huawei employees subsequently parliamentarians confirmed that in case of an attack on the uk there was nothing at this point that could be done to stop chinese infiltration attacking critical national infrastructure zte another chinese company that supplies extensive network equipment and subscriber hardware to bt infinity was also under scrutiny by

with virgin media and talktalk with the spyware company phorm responsible under their media guise for the apropos rootkit to intercept and analyse their users clickstream data and sell the anonymised aggregate information as part of phorms oix advertising service the practice known as behavioural targeting and condemned by critics as data pimping came under intense fire from various internet communities and other interestedparties who believe that the interception of data without the consent of users and web site owners is illegal under uk law ripa at a more fundamental level many have argued that the isps and phorm have no right to sell a commodity a users data and the copyright content of web sites to which they have no claim of ownership in response to questions about phorm and the interception of data by the webwise system sir tim bernerslee credited as the creator of the world wide web protocol indicated his disapproval of the concept and is quoted as saying of his data and web history its mine – you cant have it if you want to use it for something then you have to negotiate with me i have to agree i have to understand what im getting in return i myself feel that it is very important that my isp supplies internet to my house like the water company supplies water to my house it supplies connectivity with no strings attached my isp doesnt control which websites i go to it doesnt monitor which websites i go to — sir tim bernerslee  alleged complicity with drone strikes in yemen and somaliaedit in september  bt entered into a  million deal with the us military to provide a key communications cable connecting raf croughton a us military base on uk soil with camp lemonnier a large us base in djibouti camp lemonnier is used as a base for american drone attacks in yemen and somalia and has been described by the economist as the most important base for drone operations outside the war zone of afghanistan human rights groups including reprieve and amnesty international have criticised the use of armed drones outside declared war zones evidence produced by the bureau of investigative journalism and stanford universitys international human rights  conflict resolution clinic suggest that drone strikes have caused substantial civilian casualties and may be illegal under international law in  bt was the subject of a complaint by reprieve to the department of business innovation and skills under the oecd guidelines for multinational enterprises following their refusal to explain whether or not their infrastructure was used to facilitate drone strikes the subsequent refusal of this complaint was appealed in may  on the basis that the uk national contact points decision did not follow the oecd guidelines the issue of bias was also raised due to the appointment of lord ian livingston as government minister for the department which was processing the complaint livingston had occupied a senior position at bt when the cable between raf croughton and camp lemonnier was originally built see alsoedit london portal companies portal sheriff referencesedit  a b c d bt annual report  bt group plc retrieved  may    linkedin   group
