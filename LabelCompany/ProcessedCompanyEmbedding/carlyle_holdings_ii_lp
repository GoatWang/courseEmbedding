secondary activities across  fund of funds vehicles on july   we acquired a  interest in alpinvest on august   we acquired the remaining  equity interest in alpinvest on november   we acquired

we acquired diversified global asset management corporation dgam a global manager of fund of hedge funds vehicles which manages  fund of funds vehicles as of december   our investment solutions segment had approximately  billion in aum and approximately  billion billion in feeearning aum we earn management fees pursuant to contractual arrangements with the investment funds that we manage and fees for transaction advisory and oversight services provided to portfolio companies of these funds we also typically receive a performance fee from an investment fund which may be either an incentive fee or a special residual allocation of income which we refer to as a carried interest in the event that specified investment returns are achieved by the fund under us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap we are required to consolidate some of the investment funds that we advise however for segment reporting purposes we present revenues and expenses on a basis that deconsolidates these investment funds accordingly our segment revenues primarily consist of fund management and related advisory fees performance fees consisting of incentive fees and carried interest allocations investment income including realized and unrealized gains on our investments in our funds and other trading securities as well as interest and other income our segment expenses primarily consist of compensation and benefits expenses including salaries bonuses performance payment arrangements and equitybased compensation excluding awards granted in our initial public offering or in connection with acquisitions and strategic investments and general and administrative expenses refer to note  to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for more information on the differences between our financial results reported pursuant to us gaap and our financial results for segment reporting purposes trends affecting our business we believe that on an annual basis our diversified multiproduct global platform which invests across numerous industries asset classes and geographies generally enhances the stability of our management fee revenues and distributable earnings and decreases our exposure to a negative event associated with any specific fund investment or vintage however our results of operations particularly our quarterly results are affected by a variety of factors including global economic market and financial conditions particularly in the united states europe and asia in general a climate of reasonable interest rates and high levels of liquidity in the debt and equity capital markets provide a positive environment for us to generate attractive investment returns in our carry funds but periods of volatility and dislocation in the capital markets can present us with opportunities to invest at reduced valuations that position us for future revenue growth for our hedge funds opportunities to generate revenue depend on their respective investment strategies certain of which may benefit from higher market volatility these strategies include but are not limited to low levels of correlation in equity and debt markets differences in market prices versus fundamental value and opportunities to profit from trading inefficiencies during  the general economic climate started the year weaker but by the second half of the year the us macroeconomic outlook improved with gross domestic product growth averaging nearly  at an annualized rate this acceleration in growth helped to offset the  contraction in the first quarter of  and bring gdp growth for the year to roughly  economic strength in the second half of the year contributed to an  increase in the sp  index for the year stock markets outside of the us were generally weaker in  with the eurostoxx index up by  the msci exus index down by  and the msci emerging index down by  the us dollar strengthened against almost all other currencies in  with gains of  versus the japanese yen and the euro and  versus the chinese yuan renminbi on a tradeweighted basis the us dollar rose by  for  the increase in the value of the us dollar likely will depress the foreign earnings of us businesses which could cause asset prices to decline or valuation ratios to increase further while this may pressure the us dollar values of our assets and portfolio outside the united states we also expect it to create opportunities for our funds to invest in assets at more reasonable prices than have been available over the past several years in october  the federal reserve ended its large scale asset purchase program and has signaled its intention to raise interest rates during  depending on the results of incoming economic data during the year despite the expected increase in policy rates marketbased interest rates generally declined in  with the year yield falling from  at the end of  to just  in early  yields on year german and japanese government debt fell to  and  respectively by january  the decline in interest rates has been partially due to increased monetary accommodation in japan and the expectation that the european central bank will launch an asset purchase program in the first quarter of  some of the considerations informing our strategic decisions include our ability to grow our feeearning aum during the year ended december   we raised more than  billion of new capital commitments across our fund platform although the time required to raise a fund remains lengthened relative to historical years prior to the recession and the environment is competitive our fundraising levels exceeded expectations in  during which several of our larger funds were in the market if our fundraising levels decline this decline also will impact our feeearning aum our feeearning aum declined from  billion in  to  billion in  primarily due to large distributions from our funds stemming from significant exit activity during  we expect that much of our fundraising will come from midsize funds and we will continue to sell remaining investments in many of the older larger buyout funds which may make it difficult to grow feeearning aum in our openended funds to the extent we face significant investor redemptions that are not replaced with subscriptions our feeearning aum would be adversely impacted effective january   we had  billion net redemptions in our gms hedge fund operations furthermore from time to time we may raise funds or managed accounts where we take fees on invested capital rather than on committed capital so we will not earn any fees from such commitments until we make an investment as of december   we also had  billion of newly raised capital for which we have not yet commenced charging management fees to the extent we fail to grow our feeearning aum our management fee revenues also will be adversely impacted our ability to offer and market differentiated products that engage new fund investors our ability to attract new capital and investors in our funds is driven in part by the extent to which they continue to see the alternative asset management industry generally and our investment products specifically as an attractive vehicle for capital appreciation we continually seek to create avenues to meet our investors evolving needs and broaden the appeal of our investment products by offering an expansive range of investment funds developing new products and creating managed accounts and other investment vehicles tailored to our investors goals one area of recent attention has been the expansion of access to our products for a new base of individual fund investors including through the launch of a mutual fund we utilize both external strategies including the use of feeder funds and other registered investment products and our internal team of lp relations professionals to reach out to and expand our investor base we have dedicated and expect to continue to dedicate significant resources to maintain our existing relationships further develop external avenues to reach investors and support our lp relations personnel which could increase our fundraising costs our successful deployment of capital our ability to maintain and grow our revenue base is dependent upon our ability to deploy successfully the capital that our investors have committed to our investment funds greater competition high valuations cost of credit and other general market conditions may impact our ability to identify and execute attractive investments because we maintain a disciplined investment approach and analyze each carry fund transaction based on our ability to achieve our targeted returns while taking on a reasonable level of risk we will not deploy our capital until we have sourced a suitable investment opportunity at an attractive price we have a longterm investment horizon and the capital deployed in any one quarter may vary significantly from the capital deployed in any other quarter or the quarterly average of capital deployed in any given year during  we invested approximately  billion in new and existing investments in our carry funds over the past five years we have invested an average of more than  billion a year in new and existing investments in our carry funds as of december   we had capital available for investment through our carry funds of  billion our ability to generate strong absolute and risk adjusted returns the strength of our investment performance affects investors willingness to commit capital to our funds the capital we are able to attract is one of the main drivers of the growth of our aum and the management fees we earn during the year ended december   we realized proceeds of approximately  billion for our carry fund investors our decision to realize carry considers such factors as the level of embedded valuation gains the portion of the fund invested the portion of the fund returned to limited partner investors and the length of time the fund has been in carry as well as other qualitative measures the valuation of our carry fund portfolio increased  overall during  with a  increase in our corporate private equity segment a  increase in our global market strategies segment and a  decline in our real assets segment the decline in real assets was primarily driven by depreciation in funds in our energy platform in late  but was partially mitigated by the lower economics of our interests in the performance fees from our legacy energy funds as opposed to the enhanced economics we hold in funds in our broadened energy and natural resources platform we believe that this broadened platform will provide significant opportunities for future returns on our investment as we seek to deploy significant capital into the sector at current attractive values given increased competition for investments and the effect particularly in europe and asia of the rising dollar against foreign currencies the internal rates of return we are able to generate may be lower than our historical rates but we continue to follow our core investment tenets and disciplined approach to make investments where we believe we can create

following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this annual report on form k overview we conduct our operations through four reportable segments corporate private equity real assets global market strategies and investment solutions corporate private equity  our corporate private equity segment advises our  buyout and  growth capital funds which seek a wide variety of investments of different sizes and growth potentials as of december   our corporate private equity segment had approximately  billion in aum and approximately  billion in feeearning aum real assets  our real assets segment advises our ten us and internationally focused real estate funds our infrastructure fund our two power funds our international energy fund as well as our four legacy energy funds funds that we jointly advise with riverstone the segment also includes five ngp management fee funds and three carry funds advised by ngp as of december   our real assets segment had approximately  billion in aum and approximately  billion in feeearning aum global market strategies  our global market strategies segment advises a group of  funds that pursue investment opportunities across structured credit distressed debt corporate and energy mezzanine debt middlemarket and senior debt as of december   our global market strategies segment had approximately  billion in aum and approximately  billion in feeearning aum investment solutions  our investment solutions segment advises global private equity and real estate fund of funds programs and related coinvestment and secondary activities across  fund vehicles as of december   our investment solutions segment had approximately  billion in aum and approximately  billion in feeearning aum we earn management fees pursuant to contractual arrangements with the investment funds that we manage and fees for transaction advisory and oversight services provided to portfolio companies of these funds we also typically receive a performance fee from an investment fund which may be either an incentive fee or a special residual allocation of income which we refer to as a carried interest in the event that specified investment returns are achieved by the fund under us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap we are required to consolidate some of the investment funds that we advise however for segment reporting purposes we present revenues and expenses on a basis that deconsolidates these investment funds accordingly our segment revenues primarily consist of fund management and related advisory fees performance fees consisting of incentive fees and carried interest allocations investment income including realized and unrealized gains on our investments in our funds and other trading securities as well as interest and other income our segment expenses primarily consist of compensation and benefits expenses including salaries bonuses performance payment arrangements and equitybased compensation excluding awards granted in our initial public offering or in connection with acquisitions and strategic investments and general and administrative expenses while our segment expenses include depreciation and interest expense our segment expenses exclude acquisitionrelated charges and amortization of intangibles and impairment refer to note  to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for more information on the differences between our financial results reported pursuant to us gaap and our financial results for segment reporting purposes trends affecting our business during  intensifying over the second half of the year and into  significant events in the global political landscape including the results of the us presidential election the vote on the brexit referendum in the united kingdom and the populist movement more broadly have introduced macroeconomic and political risks that are difficult to quantify and could have farreaching implications for the united states and global economy these events meaningfully increased the uncertainty surrounding the probable future direction of interest rates inflation foreign exchange rates trade volumes and fiscal and monetary policy as a result the evolution of the global economy and regional economies is increasingly difficult to predict and there is a smaller margin of error for economic misjudgments by market participants uncertainty also persists regarding global regulation trade agreements and taxation particularly in the united states where the new administration has suggested or proposed changes to existing regulations some of which could have a material impact on personal and corporate tax rates and tax deductions similarly in the united kingdom the effects on trade and taxation as a result of the brexit vote remain unclear but are likely to constrain significant investment until there is clarity around these issues in europe increased focus on tax receipts and policy for local companies and multinational corporations could have a substantial impact on investment structuring and domicile decisions while few details have been finalized regarding potential tax reform we continue to evaluate our fund investment and partnership organizational structures in light of these potential changes in the regulatory and tax landscape in addition to increasing uncertainty the general rebound in commodities prices during  had farreaching effects as the rebound caused inflationary pressures to reemerge across the global economy while this rebound in commodities prices including those in oil and industrial metals generally has benefited our energy and other commoditiesrelated investments both the actual increase in inflation and the perception and expectation of continuing increased inflation led to an increase in us treasury yields in the second half of  the us federal reserve raised its target for shortterm interest rates by  basis points in december  which followed a similar rate hike in december  rising rates also put upward pressure on property yields cap rates which depressed the market value of some categories of real estate in the latter part of  while our us real estate business invests a majority of its capital in assets with more sensitivity to demographic changes than to fluctuations in interest rates it is possible that valuations for certain types of real estate investments such as commercial real estate and multifamily housing could be negatively impacted if interest rates or inflation increase from current levels during  we were able to take advantage of strong asset prices by exiting many investments at attractive prices which resulted in favorable returns for our fund investors looking forward into  however we believe that there is some risk that larger fiscal deficits in the us or accelerating inflation tied to rising commodity prices may force the federal reserve to raise rates at a faster pace than currently expected by the futures markets as a result higher interest rates could depress valuations of private equity assets real estate and net asset values of fixed income products and potentially could increase the cost of financing for acquisition transactions in addition when the federal reserve increases interest rates at the same time as major central banks in the rest of the world are on hold or are easing monetary policy the us dollar is likely to appreciate relative to a basket of nonus currencies since  the us dollar has appreciated by  on a tradeweighted basis the rising us dollar has benefited some of our existing fund investments but has created operational headwinds and increased risks in certain portfolio companies for example a strong dollar has enhanced margins at certain globallyfocused portfolio companies that generate significant revenue in dollars but whose cost structures are primarily denominated in a nondollar currency in contrast a strong dollar has had a negative effect on certain usbased portfolio companies that are large exporters because it reduces the domestic value of their foreign sales and earnings a rising dollar also increases the default risk of dollardenominated bonds issued by companies outside of the us across our buyout funds in europe and asia several of our portfolio companies have issued dollardenominated bonds though none have defaulted on their debt obligations since the us election in early november  global stocks have risen more than  on average alongside an approximate  basis point increase in  and year treasury yields taking advantage of the strong financial market conditions in the period before and after the us election we were able to sell several portfolio companies on beneficial terms in  and realized  billion for our carry fund investors during the year we also liquidated a large portion of the public portfolio in our cpe real assets and gms carry funds at attractive prices over the course of the year which decreased the portion of remaining fair value held in public securities to  as of december   from  as of december   as we had a record year in overall exits and returned  billion in realized proceeds to our carry fund investors in  we anticipate that our level of exit activity may decline in  as compared to  which could affect the amount of distributable earnings available for distributions to our unitholders in  buoyed by strong equity markets and an active ma environment our largest carry funds appreciated significantly in  our latest vintage us buyout and asia buyout funds appreciated by  and  respectively and our opportunistic us real estate funds collectively appreciated by  the increase in oil prices had a positive effect on the latest fund sponsored by ngp which also had exceptional performance during the year while cpe funds currently generate a large percentage of our performance fees we believe that over time our other business units will meaningfully contribute to our performance fees and earnings and we will decrease our reliance on these funds the same trends that bolster asset prices of our existing portfolio companies and foster attractive exit opportunities can also create headwinds for investment activity due to high valuation multiples and rising interest rates that may increase the cost of financing if not offset by higher growth opportunities despite these conditions during  we were able to identify and close on many investments with strong underlying business fundamentals that met our strategic objectives and investment criteria and which we believe also have the potential to generate attractive returns for our fund investors we made many of these investments in demographic driven industries such as consumer and healthcare though our total mix of investments continues to span a diverse set of asset classes industries and geographies in  we put  billion in capital to work through our carry funds an increase over the  billion we invested in  although interest rates for corporate borrowing in the united states continued to rise modestly during the year we were often able to obtain financing on better terms than were originally anticipated due primarily to the strong underlying fundamentals of the investments we made we expect that  will be a transition year for our funds since many of our largest fundsincarry have been harvesting their assets over the past few quarters and during  we expect that they will be in the final stages of selling down their portfolios as a result our net accrued carry balance has declined from  billion as of december   to  billion as of december   during  we will seek to continue to invest capital through our current generation of large funds including cp vi cep iv cap iv and crp as well as ngp x to the generate strong returns that will facilitate the replenishment of our accrued carry balance at the same time as we are completing the investment cycle for several of our large buyout funds we will continue to work diligently to create value in the remaining investments in the portfolio and to move these funds as well as others into carry positions while we continue to invest in new transactions and monetize our existing portfolio and create value for our investors during  another significant element of the transition will be our increased focus on fundraising for the next generation of our large buyout funds and several of our real assets funds as well as for new fund strategies in  we commenced a fouryear fundraising cycle the pace of which we expect will accelerate through  during which we are targeting to raise approximately  billion in new capital commitments our ability to raise these funds and replenish our dry powder and the timing of such raises will depend on our pace of capital deployment and the performance of our investments at different parts of this fundraising cycle some of our largest funds may overlap in terms of raising capital for their next generation of funds which could impact our financial performance in various ways for example as we are raising these new funds the current generation of our funds will continue to realize existing investments and as a result we could see a further reduction in our feeearning aum until fees on these new funds are activated we also expect to see an increase in fundraising costs associated with these new capital commitments which will impact our earnings as we generally expense fundraising costs upon raising new capital recent transactions its founders this transaction closed on january   see note  of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for more information key financial measures performance fees performance fees consist principally of the performancebased capital allocation from fund limited partners to us commonly referred to as carried interest from certain of our investment funds which we refer to as the carry funds carried interest revenue which historically has comprised over  of all performance fees in our consolidated financial statements is recognized by carlyle upon appreciation of the valuation of our funds investments above certain return hurdles as set forth in each respective partnership agreement and is based on the amount that would be due to us pursuant to the fund partnership agreement at each period end as if the funds were liquidated at such date accordingly the amount of carried interest recognized as performance fees reflects our share of the fair value gains and losses of the associated funds underlying investments measured at their thencurrent fair values relative to the fair values as of the end of the prior period as a result the performance fees earned in an applicable reporting period are not indicative of any future period as fair values are based on conditions

primarily from the following funds below certain return hurdles previously recognized performance fees are reversed in all cases each investment fund is considered separately in evaluating carried interest and potential giveback obligations for any given period performance fee revenue on our statement of operations may include reversals of previously recognized performance fees due to a decrease in the value of a particular fund that results in a decrease of cumulative performance fees earned to date since fund return hurdles are cumulative previously recognized performance fees also may be reversed in a period of appreciation that is lower than the particular funds hurdle rate for the years ended december    and  the reversals of performance fees were  million  million and  million respectively additionally unrealized performance fees reverse when performance fees are realized and unrealized performance fees can be negative if the amount of realized performance fees exceed total performance fees generated in the period as of december   accrued performance fees and accrued giveback obligations were approximately  billion and  million respectively after amounts eliminated related to the consolidated funds each balance assumes a hypothetical liquidation of the funds investments at december   at their then current fair values these assets and liabilities will
