untitled document homehistoricalexecutives dr chun announces his retirement in  dr michael j chun president and headmaster kamehameha schools kapälama aloha mai käkou when i accepted the job as president of kamehameha schools in 9 i knew i had an exciting opportunity before me but i had no idea how deeply it would change my life what began with a simple dream to help our students and our people realize their own goals and aspirations became a remarkable journey through one of the most interesting periods in the history of kamehameha schools—one marked by exciting opportunities sobering events significant growth and timely changes at every step in this journey were students teachers administrators staff parents alumni and friends of kamehameha who inspired excited supported guided and mentored aunty bina and me with their enthusiasm energy talents wisdom courage integrity and loyalty we have proudly watched thousands of inspiring – and aspiring—hawaiian students receive their diplomas knowing they are capable of succeeding anywhere in the world this coming school year will be my 4th year as president and headmaster of the kapälama campus it will also be my last this morning i informed our ceo dee jay mailer and our campus leadership team of my decision to retire at the end of the – school year the next  months will allow kamehameha schools to conduct a thorough search for the leader who will build on the good work of the ksk staff and faculty over the last two decades i believe ksk is wellpositioned for this transition our recently completed haiswasc selfstudy and accreditation visit affirms the strength and quality of an exemplary academic program that is rooted in the culture of the first peoples of our island home from kindergarten through graduation our campus master plan is well underway including needed new facilities for our middle school and the kaÿiwakïloumoku cultural complex – the dream of visionary former trustee myron “pinky” thompson our campus leadership is skilled and prepared to lead through this transition ksk remains a beacon for all hawaiians and is wellprepared to remain so far into the future while there is sadness and nostalgia in leaving a place filled with such precious memories cherished friendships and deep aloha there is also gratitude for being able to be part of such a wonderful ÿohana and excitement for all that lies ahead for our remarkable school i mua kamehameha dee jay mailer ceo kamehameha schools aloha mai käkou with expected humility dr michael chun has tendered his resignation in a letter filled with appreciation for the good fortune of being part of the remarkable kamehameha schools ÿohana this good fortune is mutual as dr chun has shaped our schools in remarkable ways on behalf of kamehameha schools i thank him for his dedication to fulfilling pauahi’s vision and for  years of leadership marked by professionalism and integrity and founded on christian values and deep aloha for our haumäna and their ‘ohana our faculty and our staff he will retire in june  as the longest serving president in the history of kamehameha schools dr chun will continue to lead our kapälama campus through the next fifteen months as we complete the search for the best leader to continue dr chun’s legacy under dr chun’s leadership kapalama has made a dramatic shift away from being a school for hawaiians to becoming a hawaiian school one small indicator our kapälama campus haumäna are speaking ‘ölelo hawaiÿi in classrooms hallways and our song contests fluently and with great pride and reverence for our ancestors they join many graduates before them who are fulfilling their kuleana representing our culture around the world college preparatory curriculum at kapälama is an expectation rather than merely an option every graduate has met the requirements for collegeuniversity admission and over 9 percent choose to go on to higher education upon graduation the percentage of haumäna with need at ksk has risen substantially fulfilling pauahi’s desire to serve those in indigent and orphaned circumstances kapälama was recently commended by the wasc accreditation team for its strong integrated k– academic cocurricular and cultural learning environment we await official notification of accreditation the renovation of kapälama’s middle school and dormatories athletic facilities and the building of ka‘iwakïloumoku our cultural center has begun dr chun and his wife bina have been our “first family” symbolizing the spirit of kamehameha schools excellence responsibility service compassion and aloha from launa at their home to attendance at every event where our haumäna demonstrate their excellence the chuns have provided warm encouragement it is no wonder that so many of our graduates have emerged as exemplary servant leaders in the tradition of ke ali‘i pauahi i look forward to watching all of the aloha that will pour out to mike and bina chun over the next year knowing that even as new doors open before them this door called kamehameha schools will never close i mua e mike a me bina i mua kamehameha microsoft personalized ad preferences to
