this solution is thematic and derived from our macroeconomic outlook the portfolios are constructed in response to our overall market viewpoint so that the allocation may take advantage of tactical

maintain target allocations each portfolio will hold a combination of etfs andor mutual funds strategy fact sheets  updated    custom portfolio consulting   as an advisor you run across prospects with a variety of financial needs  financial assets can range from cash values in insurance policies to a brokerage account full of stocks  this last area is where we can help  many money managers require an advisor to “sell all” assets to fit into the manager’s model portfolio  this may not be an advisable strategy if the client has large unrealized gains in the portfolio thus triggering a taxable

company thereby providing basis on whether or not to sell an existing position  we can help manage taxes by offsetting gains and losses  if there is a concentrated position we can advise on risk control measures such as hedging or equity monetization  our goal would be to work with you and the client to monitor and manage the portfolio in the future in order to compliment the clients’ other
