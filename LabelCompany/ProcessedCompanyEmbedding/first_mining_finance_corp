alphasign in  join nowgo»first mining finance is building a mineral banksep  about first mining ffmgf simple digressions contrarian longshort equity deep valuemarketplaceunorthodox mining investingsummaryfirst mining is a small niche company building the socalled mineral bank the company is growing very fast adding new exploration companies to its portfolio in my opinion the companys shares are undervalued at the moment first mining finance corp otcqbffmgf is a canadabased small company involved in building the socalled mineral bank it is not a gold or silver miner or the explorer according to the company our business model is to acquire mineral assets which are currently trading at very low valuations and holding or banking these assets until the capital markets for commodities and mining projects improve at that point we would add value for our shareholders by entering into agreements with other parties which would move the projects forward through exploration development and production while first mining finance holds a residual interest in the project in question the residual interest may be in the form of royalties metal streams minority interests or equity positions in the counterparty that is moving the project forward ultimately our goal is to have a number of projects which are generating cash flow for our shareholders which we would remit to our shareholders in the form of a dividend in my opinion first mining offers a strategy which might interest some precious metals investors in this article i would like to give a short description of first mining and in the latter part i am trying to assess the value of this company introduction first mining emerged from a transaction involving albion petroleum and sundance minerals albion petroleum was a company involved in the oilgas and mineral industries with oil and gas being dominant sectors on july   albion petroleum entered into an arrangement which totally changed its business as a result of this arrangement albion petroleum changed its name into first mining finance sundance minerals a private company involved in precious metals exploration gained control over first mining first mining acquired mineral assets previously indirectly belonging to first majestic silver corp nyseag the new company changed its strategy as described above new acquisitions after its transformation first mining immediately started to implement its strategy of acquiring new propertiescompanies in july  the company acquired coastal gold corp otcpkcoggf a company holding the hope brook gold project described below this transaction was a noncash one  first mining acquired all of the outstanding common shares of coastal gold on the basis of  common shares in the capital of first mining for each coastal gold common share by way of a plan of arrangement then on september   the company announced its plan to acquire gold canyon resources otcpkgdcrf and pc gold otcpcglf the companies control two prospective gold properties called springpole gold and pickle crow respectively although the transaction has to be yet approved by at least two thirds of the votes cast by shareholders of gold canyon and pc gold i assume that it will be successful therefore in the section on the first mining properties i am giving a short description of flagship properties belonging to gold canyon and pc gold management first mining is managed by a few very experienced managers the key persons are chris osterman  a geologist with thirty years experience in exploration and metal production according to the companys website mr osterman took part in the discovery and development of the san jose silver deposit in oaxaca mexico owned by fortuna silver mines and the zuun mod molybdenum deposit in mongolia owned by erdene resource development keith neumeyer  chairman of the board he was the founding president of first quantum minerals a big mining company producing copper nickel gold zinc and platinum group elements apart from being the chairman of first mining he is also the president and ceo of first majestic silver apart from these two managers the company is managed by a number of other experienced experts with precious metals background properties currently the company holds a portfolio of  properties excluding springpole and pickle crow which formally do not belong to first mining yet a number of other mineral properties are under review for a potential acquisition all properties are located in three safe and miningfriendly jurisdictions canada one property usa one property and mexico seventeen properties the majority of these properties are underexplored where practically no or very limited drilling was conducted therefore it is not easy to assess the potential of these resources fortunately a few properties listed below are well explored and may be subject to further development in a substantially short time note although the acquisition of gold canyon and pc gold are not completed yet i assume that first mining will succeed and the flagship properties belonging to these companies would be owned by first mining therefore below i am giving a description of the springpole and pickle crow deposits hope brook hope brook is a gold deposit located on the southwest coast of the island of newfoundland canada the property was extensively explored by the former owner of the property coastal gold corp acquired by first mining in july  during five phases of exploration as many as  holes were drilled  meters of drilling the last phase was completed in october  as a result a technical report was prepared where the hope brook mineral base was estimated to stand at  ounces of gold classified as indicated resources and  ounces of gold classified as inferred resources resources were calculated using the long term gold price of us per ounce hope brook is going to become an underground mine with the average recovery rate of  but this is not the end of story most of the exploration work was focused on two zones of highgrade mineralization called mine zone and  zone but according to the last technical report the deposit is still open for additional exploration last but not least  between  and  hope brook was an active mine therefore there are  ounces of gold inventory which could also increase the current resources and extend mine life miranda the miranda gold property is located in the sonora state in mexico there is a number of other mines operating in the area close to miranda for example la herradura belonging to fresnillo plc el chanate alamos san francisco timmins gold most of these mines lie in the socalled the mojave  sonora megasheer which is considered by some geologists for example chris osterman the ceo of first mining to be a mineral structure similar to the nevadas carlintype deposits those interested in that theory may refer to this article it is why the companys management believes that miranda could be a future goldbearing deposit where an open pit mining could be conducted anyway i think that miranda together with hope brook is currently the first minings flagship property at the moment there are no estimates of mirandas mineral resources springpole gold project the springpole gold project is located  kilometers northeast of ontario canada according to the last preliminary economic assessment published in may  springpole holds  million ounces of gold classified as indicated resources and  million ounces of gold classified as inferred resources springpole is planned to become a lowgrade gold and silver bulk tonnage open pit mining operation with conventional milling methods although the pea was based on mineral resources estimates to get the bank financing mineral reserves have to be established so far this deposit is the best explored property in the companys portfolio according to the pea during  years as many as  million ounces of gold will be extracted at springpole with initial capital expenditures of us million the project should bring the pretax net present value of us million and the pretax internal rate of return of  using the gold price of  per ounce pickle crow pickle crow is located in northwestern ontario canada between  and  pickle crow was an operating mine where  million ounces of gold were extracted then the mine was closed in  pc gold started an exploration program at the property as a result in june  a mineral resource estimate for the pickle crow deposit was prepared according to that report pickle crow holds  thousand ounces of gold classified as inferred resources using the gold price of  per ounce valuation most of the companys properties are in their early exploration stage where no economically viable deposit has been established what is more in practice only a small number of exploration properties are going to become producing assets it means that the market value of exploration properties is low at least much lower than that attributed to the producing properties how to value the shares of companies holding such assets well there are a few methods of valuation such as option agreement terms appraised value geosciences factor but in the case of first mining i will apply the method used by the companys management in this method an enterprise value  resources multiple is being used as the main measure let me use this method to estimate the value of the first mining shares then i will try to find whether the companys shares are under or overvalued my assumptions springpole and pickle crow are included into my estimates though their acquisitions are not formally finished after the acquisition of gold canyon and pc gold the company should have  shares outstanding for simplicity no warrants or options are included in my calculations at the end of june  first mining had us thousand in cash and was holding debt of us thousand these days the shares of first mining are trading at c per share assuming that the company will have  million shares outstanding its market value is c thousand around us thousand therefore the companys enterprise value will be us thousand because the acquisition of gold canyon and pc gold is a noncash nodebt transaction no additional cash or debt is added or deducted in my calculations of twenty one properties only three have mineral resources established springpole pickle crow and hope brook these properties hold gold resources of  ounces  ounces classified as indicated resources and  ounces classified as inferred resources combined with such assumptions the companys enterprise value  resources multiple is standing at us c please note that my calculations do not include a majority of the first mining properties  deposits therefore the value of c per ounce should be treated as a maximum i am confident that the real value is much lower than that calculated above for example the addition of just one property miranda should lower the value attributable to the companys mineral resources another point one ounce of indicated resources is probably more valued than one ounce of inferred resources in my calculations to make them simple i have made indicated and inferred resources equal to each other which is generally a wrong assumption summarizing  an investor buying the shares of first mining would be owning a portfolio of mineral properties valued at less than us per one ounce of gold resources is it much or little the chart below shows the market valuations of a few junior mining companies using an enterprise value  resources multiple source newcastle gold presentation page  as the chart shows the average enterprise value  resources multiple is standing at us per ounce  it is much higher value than that attributable to first mining therefore i am quite confident that the current first mining valuation is rather low than high what is more adding  properties which are not included in my calculations could deepen the companys shares undervaluation that is why i think that first mining should be worth keeping an eye on it or even investing summary first mining is a niche company in the precious metals sector the company is in the process of building the socalled mineral bank perceiving the todays sector valuations as very low first mining is going to build a large pool of mineral properties generating cash flow for the companys shareholders currently first mining owns  properties but the company is trying to make two additional acquisitions which could increase the number of properties by at least two well explored projects first mining is managed by a team of very experienced mining experts which strengthens the company in my opinion the market value of the first mining shares is relatively low at the moment although it is not easy to assess specific value to the majority of properties owned by the company therefore i think that first mining is at least worth of keeping an eye on if not investing in disclosure iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next  hours i wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions i am not receiving compensation for it other than from seeking alpha i have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article editors note
