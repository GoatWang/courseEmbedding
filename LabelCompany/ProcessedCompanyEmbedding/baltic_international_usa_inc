statements and notes thereto contained in our annual report filed with the sec on form k in the opinion of management all adjustments consisting of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and the results of operations for the interim periods presented have been reflected herein the results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year notes to the consolidated financial statements which would substantially duplicate the disclosure contained in the consolidated financial statements for fiscal  as reported in the form k have been omitted note   financial condition we have incurred operating losses since inception at march   we had an accumulated deficit of  and current assets and current liabilities of  and  respectively resulting in a working capital deficit of  net cash used in operating activities was  in the three months ended march   and  in three months ended march   we currently have limited cash resources available and have obligations due or past due management believes that we will be able to achieve a satisfactory level of liquidity to meets its business plan and capital needs for the next twelve months additionally management believes we have the ability to obtain additional financing from key officers directors and certain investors management also believes that we can continue to defer certain amounts payable by us that are either currently payable or past due however there can be no assurance we will be successful to meet its liquidity needs there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern  note   loss per common share stock warrants and options are considered to be dilutive for earnings per

such information involves risks and uncertainties including those created by general market conditions competition and the possibility of events may occur which limit our ability to maintain or improve its operating results or execute its primary growth strategy although we believe that the assumptions underlying the forwardlooking statements are reasonable any of the assumptions could be inaccurate and there can therefore be no assurance that the forwardlooking statements included herein will prove to be accurate the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that our objectives and plans will be achieved current plan of operations our current business objective for the next  months is to investigate and if such investigation warrants acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation our principal business objective for the next  months and beyond will be to achieve longterm growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate shortterm earnings we will not restrict our potential candidate target companies to any specific business industry or geographical location and thus may acquire any type of business we do not currently engage in any business activities that provide us with positive cash flows as such the costs of investigating and analyzing business combinations for the next approximately  months and beyond will be paid with our current cash on hand and through funds from financing to be obtained during the next  months we anticipate incurring costs related to filing of exchange act reports and costs relating to consummating an acquisition we believe we will be able to meet these costs with our current cash on hand and additional amounts as necessary to be loaned to or invested in us by our stockholders or other investors we may consider a business which has recently commenced operations is a developing company in need of additional funds for expansion into new products or markets is seeking to develop a new product or service or is an established business which may be experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital in the alternative a business combination may involve the acquisition of or merger with a company which does not need substantial additional capital but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares while avoiding among other things the time delays significant expense and loss of voting control which may occur in a public offering any target business that is selected may be a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stages of development or growth including entities without established records of sales or earnings in that event we will be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies in addition we may effect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk and although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks  we anticipate that the selection of a business combination will be complex and extremely risky because of general economic conditions rapid technological advances being made in some industries and shortages of available capital our management believes that there are numerous firms seeking even the limited additional capital which we will have andor the perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation such perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation include among other things facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be obtained providing liquidity for the principals of and investors in a business creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees and offering greater flexibility in structuring acquisitions joint ventures and the like through the issuance of stock potentially available business combinations may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex quality resource technologies in october  we acquired  ownership of quality resource technologies inc quality resource technologies is to develop manufacture and sell innovative lightweight fiber reinforced shipping container and storage units we had announced a spinoff of our interest in quality resource technologies inc to our shareholders however we cancelled the spinoff and continue to own an interest in quality resource technologies inc liquidity and capital resources we had  in cash at march   compared to  at december   at march   we had working capital deficit of  as compared to  at december   the increase in the working capital deficit is due primarily to the accrual of additional liabilities net cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended march   was  as compared to  for the same period of  we have incurred operating losses since inception at march   we had an accumulated deficit of  and current assets and current liabilities of  and  respectively resulting in a working capital deficit of  we currently have limited cash resources available and have obligations due or past due item  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk there has been no material change in our market risks since the end of the fiscal year   item  controls and procedures our chief executive officer and chief financial officer after evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in the securities exchange act of  rules ae and de as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on form q has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure there were no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that materially affected or were reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting limitations on the effectiveness of internal control our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will necessarily prevent all fraud and material errors an internal control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations on all internal control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people andor by managements override of the controls the design of any system of internal control is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in circumstances andor the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective internal control system financial reporting misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected on a timely basis  baltic
