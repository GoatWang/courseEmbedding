a funding in the region announced at startup day  knoxville tenn – one of the largest series a funding investments in the southeast was announced today at startup day  an annual event celebrating knoxville’s startup and entrepreneurial community general graphene corporation led by serial entrepreneur vig sherrill is the recipient of an investment from angel capital group a national syndicate of angel groups and funds “we are pleased to announce the series a investment in general graphene” said eric dobson angel capital group chief executive officer angel capital group is one of the largest angel networks in the country and is headquartered in knoxville tennessee “general graphene demonstrates the angel capital group investment philosophy which is to find the real innovator in the nation’s heartland who has demonstrated science and technology that can ultimately have worldwide impact” general graphene introduced by sherrill during a startup day  power pitch will manufacture graphene one of the most expensive substances on earth making it affordable for material innovators throughout the world at only one atom thick graphene is harder than diamond  times stronger than steel  times the current carrying capacity and  times more thermally conductive than copper impermeable to all substances known inert in the human body antimicrobial corrosion resistant flexible and almost transparent “we’ve developed the technology that will enable the mass production of high quality graphene at a low cost” sherrill said “angel capital group’s funding will allow us to make the machine that will then in turn make the graphene we will build our first prototype in oak ridge tennessee and get into preproduction” general graphene has licensed a graphene synthesis process developed by oak ridge national laboratory that overcomes limitations of previously used techniques “our approach represents a major step toward the goal of costeffective industrial rolltoroll graphene manufacturing” said ornl coinventor ivan vlassiouk “we appreciate general graphene’s entrepreneurial vision and expertise in transitioning our scientific research to the commercial marketplace” according to dobson general graphene is a perfect fit for angel capital group’s funding model—a model that brings angel investors and entrepreneurs together in an environment that celebrates innovation rewards strategic risktaking and focuses on performance “our model is that we find the real true innovation that you can touch feel and see the scalability potential” he said “general graphene is real it can be scaled up and grown to maturity we are excited to be a part of this worldchanging investment” the use of graphene is only limited by the imagination of the user the substance itself has virtually unlimited applications “imagine having tires that only weigh two to three pounds airplane wings that weigh a hundred pounds and clothing that becomes bulletproof based on the fact that its made out of graphene” sherrill said “that’s the potential of graphene nobody is using it now because you can’t buy enough to use you can’t get the material to experiment with because it’s too expensive” now with the angel capital group’s series a funding general graphene has the foundation needed to massproduce high quality low cost graphene “angel capital group gets all the credit for making this possible” sherrill said “they put together a model that worked for us” angel capital group and one syndication partner have extended general graphene a term sheet for the entire round and it will be completed by november   about startup day several organizations that share in the mission of promoting new ideas and businesses host startup day an annual event that

miracle substance has power to revolutionize entire industries rich duprey tmfcop apr   at am i first heard of graphene earlier this year on a discussion board where someone essentially asked people say its going to be huge but what is it and how can we profit from it the answer to the first question is a bit easier than the second because two scientists at the university of manchester in great britain first discovered it and won a nobel prize for it so that means no publicly traded company is going to have a lock on it but thats not stopping them from patenting how its being used everyone from ibm nyseibm and samsung to nokia nysenok and intel nasdaqintc are rushing to tap its incredible properties its elementaryok so what exactly is graphene its a carbonbased substance and as such gives diamonds a run for the money as being the hardest substance known to man its actually harder yet its lighter than down fluff it can conduct electricity better than copper and even at a thickness of just one atom it can serve as the lattice for powering chips while being both flexible and transparent graphene is being hailed as a miracle substance already scientists are imagining the possibilities of what can be done with the material charge your cell phone in  seconds or better yet fully recharge your electric cars batteries in an hour  faster than a speeding bulletas explained in the following video a battery stores a lot of energy but it charges and discharges slowly a cameras flash bulb on the other hand doesnt have much storage but it charges and discharges very quickly graphene combines those two features into a sort of supercapacitor that has lots of energy storage and charges and discharges very fast yet because its carbonbased it doesnt harm the environment ibm was the first to use the material to create graphenebased integrated circuits back in  having created the year before a graphene processor that could execute  billion cycles per second ghz intel and samsung are now looking into graphenebased processors while nokia is part of a consortium of  companies that received a grant of  billion from the european union to figure out how to use graphene to improve the world its experimenting in electronics and mobile communications a needle in a haystackyet try to invest in any one of these companies to get exposure to graphene and youre taking a pretty circuitous route and only nibbling at the corners perhaps a better route might be looking at producers of graphite as thats the material from which graphene is made unfortunately most of the mineral is produced in china it produces some  metric tonnes annually making it the pound gorilla in the space with the next closest producer being india at  metric tonnes its not even mined in the united states while there are a few foreign companies or micro caps that are involved in graphite production graftech international nysegti may be the best avenue for investors to take as its the leading producer of graphite electrodes and was one of the top  graphene patent holders at one time ahead of such giants as general electric and bayer yet its been pretty dormant in the space since  as newer entrants have become more active patently absurdgraphene may become a product so generic that no one company profits from it even if it goes on to create enormous advances in technology and science that benefit us all because the development is so new its an exciting field that bears watching but we would be wise to remember that there have been other scientific miracles that didnt pan out carbon nanotubes once held similar promise but i have yet to see any space elevators being built just yet fool contributor rich duprey owns shares of general electric and intel the motley fool
