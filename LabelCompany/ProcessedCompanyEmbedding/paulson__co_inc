acquisition targets aiming to increase the bid price on these companies as a large shareholder in  paulson which owned a  stake in washington national corp opposed penncorp financial group incs  million deal to takeover washington national calling the terms of the deal inadequate this holding out paid off when another suitor conseco inc purchased washington national for  million the financial crisisedit in  paulson co analyst paolo pellegrini convinced john paulson of the danger of weak credit underwriting standards excessive leverage among financial institutions and a fundamental mispricing of credit risk particularly in the housing market paulson began shorting this credit risk by purchasing the hitherto obscure derivative known as credit default swaps to insure debt securities paulson co did not own those securities it was insuring but merely believed they would default they thought would decline in value due to weak credit underwriting the bubble continued to grow through  and  but by  began to deflate in one later widely publicized deal goldman sachs put together a synthetic collateralized debt obligation cdo called abacus ac where investors such as the european banks ikb deutsche industrie and abn amro and the new york insurance company aca financial guaranty provided the long by taking the risk from subprime mortgage bonds effectively providing paulson with insurance in the case of subprime mortgage default the deal was made in late april  and several months later the bonds began to default and paulson eventually made about  billion total from those investors losses in total paulson reportedly earned  billion on  billion of investment in —a return of over  in  paulsons bearish outlook on the credit markets continued paulson believed that credit problems would expand beyond subprime mortgages into consumer auto commercial and corporate credit stressing financial institutions and causing some to fail this led them to take short positions in several large financial institutions in the us and the uk that had high degrees of leverage high concentrations of assets in deteriorating sectors and rising credit costs sectors include mortgage finance companies specialty finance companies and regional national and global banks in september  paulson bet against four of the five biggest british banks including a £m bet against barclays £m against royal bank of scotland and £m against lloyds tsb paulson is reported to have earned a total of £m after reducing its short position in rbs in january  to help protect their bets pci and others successfully prevented attempts to limit foreclosures and rework mortgage loans criticism and lawsuitsedit paulson has been criticized in the abacus investment for paying goldman  million to put together what was a collection of toxic subprime securities with his help creating the concept of the ethically challenged synthetic securities to be sold by goldman to long investors so that paulson could bet against it a process critics complained was sleazy or the work of those lacking a moral compass though not illegal paulson has replied that they were not involved in the marketing of any abacus products to any third parties and that paulson did not sponsor or initiate goldmans abacus program in april  the us securities and exchange commission sec sued goldman sachs over the abacus synthetic cdo alleging goldman had represented the assembler of the mortgage package underlying the cdos as an objective third party aca management when in fact a short standing to reap great financial benefit in the event the cdos default paulson had a major role in assembling the mortgage package paulson released a statement saying that it was not the subject of this complaint made no misrepresentations and is not the subject of any charges goldman neither admitted nor denied the sec allegations but three months later paid  million to settle the charges the largest penalty a wall street company has ever paid to the sec acknowledging that it gave investors incomplete information in  aca financial guaranty acafgul filed a lawsuit against paulson for  million claiming goldman sachs and paulson deceived aca into believing paulson was investing in the cdo paulson made money betting against acas position in the cdo in  paulson asked a judge to dismiss the lawsuit alleging aca had relied on mischaracterizations emails unrelated to abacus and snippets of correspondence taken out of context recovery and bankruptcy investmentedit paulson also has a long track record of investing in distressed debt bankruptcies and restructurings the  financial crisis resulted in a record high level of defaults and bankruptcies across numerous industries and paulson was a large investor in many of them including the lehman brothers bankruptcy and liquidation at the end of  following the collapse of lehman brothers and the subsequent turmoil in the markets paulson became selectively bullish it launched a fund dedicated to restructuring andor recapitalizing companies such as investment banks hedge funds insurance and hotel that were feeling the pressure of the more than  billion of write downs of underperforming assets linked to the housing market by providing capital to companies at trough valuations paulson believed it would enable the firms to survive the crisis while paulson would profit from recovery by buying at the market bottom amongst some of the holdings disclosed in paulsons june   f filings were  million shares of goldman sachs as well as  million shares in regions financial paulson also purchased shares of bank of america in the spring of  when the bank was forced to recapitalize its balance sheet following the results of the bank stress tests conducted by the us government and was reported to have a  stake in the bank in  according to bloomberg paulson purchased the shares expecting the stock to double by  paulsons invested in citigroup and reportedly earned  billion in  through the end of  which john paulson called a demonstration of the upside potential of many of the restructuring investments we have added to our portfolio and our ability to generate aboveaverage returns in large positions in february  pci was linked to the restructuring and recapitalization of the publisher houghton mifflin harcourt the agreement included restructuring about  billion of its  billion debt load by converting it to new equity issued to the senior debt holders one of whom was paulson through this debt to equity conversion paulson would reportedly become the companys largest equity investor another one of paulsons specialties is proxy event investment in may  carl icahn launched a proxy fight at yahoo to replace its board and a f filing for the quarter ending march   showed ownership by paulson of  million shares of yahoo gold thesisedit in november  paulson announced a gold fund focused on gold mining stocks and goldrelated investments believing that the massive amount of balance sheet expansion from countercyclical monetary stimulus undertaken by the federal reserve and other central banks would eventually lead to inflation in the us dollar and other fiat currencies in the words of john paulson we view gold as a currency not a commodity its importance as a currency will continue to increase as the major central banks around the world continue to print money  to presentedit in  pci was ranked as the worlds fourthlargest hedge fund with  billion in assets under management however during the course of that year his advantage fund lost  and advantage plus  the funds also had doubledigit losses the next year an unsuccessful investment in the sinoforest corporation and a drop in the price of gold were in part responsible in august  paulson entered into a merger agreement for the acquisition of steinway musical instruments in a transaction valued at approximately  million the
