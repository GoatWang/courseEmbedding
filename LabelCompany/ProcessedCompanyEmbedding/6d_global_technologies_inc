continued investment in future growth may impact overall results on september   cleantech consummated a share exchange the exchange with six dimensions inc pursuant to the agreement and plan of share exchange dated as of june   between cleantech six dimensions and the shareholders of six dimensions the exchange is being treated as a reverse recapitalization effected by a share exchange for financial accounting and reporting purposes since substantially all of cleantechs operations were disposed of prior to the consummation of the transaction d global is treated as the accounting acquirer as its stockholders control d global after the exchange agreement even though cleantech was the legal acquirer as a result the assets and liabilities and the historical operations that are reflected in these financial statements are those of d global as if d global had always been the reporting company and on the date of the exchange agreement changed its name and reorganized its capital stock since cleantech had no operations upon the exchange agreement taking place the transaction was treated as a reverse recapitalization for accounting purposes and no goodwill or other intangible assets were recorded by us as a result of the exchange agreement table of contents on september   in connection with the exchange we completed a private placement equity offering to accredited investors from which we received  in gross proceeds and issued  shares of common stock on november   d global completed an additional private placement equity offering to accredited investors from which we raised  in gross proceeds and issued  shares of common stock on august   the company entered into a stock purchase agreement spa with a single institutional investor pursuant to which the company agreed to issue and sell  shares of the companys newly designated series a redeemable convertible preferred stock of the company par value  per share the redeemable preferred stock convertible into shares of the companys common stock at a fixed conversion price of  per share at a purchase price of  per share with an  original issue discount for total gross proceeds of  million or the sale of approximately  million the agreement carries a dividend rate that amounts to  per annum subject to certain upward or downward adjustments based upon the market value of the companys common stock with a maximum dividend rate of  and a minimum dividend rate of  in addition the dividend increased by  percentage points as a result of the suspension and delisting of our common stock upon conversion the company shall pay the holders of the redeemable preferred stock being converted a conversion premium equal to the amount of dividends that such shares would have otherwise received if they had been held through the dividend maturity date the redeemable preferred stock will mature seven years following the issuance date at which time such shares will automatically convert into shares of common stock critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap and our discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require our management to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes note  significant and critical accounting policies and practices of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item  of this annual report on form k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material management believes our critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition allowances leases and income taxes complex financial instruments business combinations and related goodwill and intangible assets revenue recognition we provide our services primarily under timeandmaterials contracts revenues earned under timeandmaterial arrangements are recognized as services are provided we recognize revenue from the provision of professional services when it is realized or realizable and earned we consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii the services have been rendered to the customer iii the sales price is fixed or determinable and iv collectability is reasonably assured appropriate allowances for returns and discounts are recorded concurrent with revenue recognition in accordance with us gaap guidance income statement characterization of reimbursement received for outofpocket expenses we classify reimbursed expenses as revenue and the related expense within cost of revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for fixed price service arrangements we apply the proportional performance model or a ratable model to recognize revenue when customer acceptance provisions exist we are generally able to reliably demonstrate that the service meets or will meet upon completion the customer acceptance criteria if circumstances exist which prevent us from verifying compliance with the acceptance provisions until the service has been completed revenue is not recognized until compliance can be verified revenues recognized in excess of the amounts invoiced to clients are classified as unbilled revenues in our consolidated balance sheets we may record deferred revenue in circumstances where the customers contract calls for prebilling of services amounts in deferred revenue are realized when the services are performed and the criteria noted above are met table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts managements estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on historical sales historical loss levels and an analysis of the collectability of individual accounts and general economic conditions that may affect a clients ability to pay we evaluated the key factors and assumptions used to develop the allowance in determining that it is reasonable in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole although we believe the estimates we have made are reasonable because they are based on estimates and judgment they are inherently uncertain we have not experienced any significant adjustments however unknown factors or changes in the economy may affect our clients ability to process payments timely in the future leases lease agreements are evaluated to determine if they are capital leases meeting any of the following criteria at inception a transfer of ownership b bargain purchase option c lease term is equal to  percent or more of the estimated economic life of the leased property or d present value at the beginning of the lease term of the minimum lease payments excluding that portion of the payments representing executory costs such as insurance maintenance and taxes to be paid by the lessor including any profit thereon equals or exceeds  percent of the excess of the fair value of the leased property to the lessor at lease inception over any related investment tax credit retained by the lessor and expected to be realized by the lessor if at its inception a lease meets any of the four lease criteria above the lease is classified by the lessee as a capital lease and if none of the four criteria are met the lease is classified by the lessee as an operating lease income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method this approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities of the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities the us gaap guidance for income taxes prescribes a twostep approach for the financial statement recognition and measurement of income tax positions taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return the first step evaluates an income tax position in order to determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position the second step measures the benefit to be recognized in the financial statements for those income tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold us gaap also provides guidance on derecognition classification recognition and classification of interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosers and transition under us gaap we may recognize a previously unrecognized tax benefits if the tax position is effectively rather than ultimately settled through examination negotiation or litigation we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts and circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues and new audit activity any changes in these factors could result in changes to a tax benefit or tax provision redeemable convertible preferred stock we account for our series a redeemable convertible preferred stock redeemable preferred stock under the provisions of accounting series release  sec comments and interpretations asr  asc   equity asc   distinguishing liabilities from equity and asc   derivatives and hedging accordingly these shares along with the embedded conversion feature the redemption feature and the conversion feature are all part of temporary equity mezzanine equity in our consolidated balance sheets based upon the terms and conditions of the stock purchase agreement spa in accordance with asc  the initial carrying amount of redeemable preferred stock is equal to the amount of proceeds received upon issuance as reduced for the derivative liability associated with the dividend antidilution protection and a conversion premium which has been bifurcated business combinations we account for business combinations under the provisions of accounting standards codification asc topic  business combinations asc  which requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations assets acquired and liabilities assumed including noncontrolling interests are recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values asc  also specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired in a business combination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of the tangible net assets and intangible assets acquired in a business combination acquisitionrelated expenses are recognized separately from the business combinations and are expensed as incurred if the business combination provides for contingent consideration we record the contingent consideration at fair value at the acquisition date and any changes in fair value after the acquisition date are accounted for as measurementperiod adjustments changes in fair value of contingent consideration resulting from events after the acquisition date such as earnouts are recognized as follows table of contents the multiperiod excess earnings method used to value customer relationships requires the use of assumptions the most significant of which include the remaining useful life expected revenue survivor curve earnings before interest and tax margins marginal tax rate contributory asset charges discount rate and tax amortization benefit the most significant assumptions under the relief of royalty method used to value trade names include estimated remaining useful life expected revenue royalty rate tax rate discount rate and tax amortization benefit the discounted cash flow method used to value noncompete agreements includes assumptions such as expected revenue term of the noncompete agreements probability and ability to compete operating margin tax rate and discount rate management has developed these assumptions on the basis of historical knowledge of the business and projected financial information of the company these assumptions may vary based on future events perceptions of different market participants and other factors outside the control of management and such variations may be significant to estimated values the discounted cash flow valuation method requires the use of assumptions the most significant of which include future revenue growth future earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization estimated synergies to be achieved by a market participant as a result of the business combination marginal tax rate terminal value growth rate weighted average cost of capital and discount rate goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets goodwill which represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired is carried at cost goodwill is not amortized rather it is subject to a periodic assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test goodwill is assessed for impairment on an annual basis as of october st of each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired when conducting its annual goodwill impairment assessment management initially performs a qualitative evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired if it is determined by a qualitative evaluation that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired we then apply a twostep impairment test in the first step we determine the fair value of the companys reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis if the net book values of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we would then perform the second step of the impairment test which requires allocation of the reporting units fair value to all of its assets and liabilities using the acquisition method prescribed under authoritative guidance for business combinations any residual fair value is being
