source underwater robot san francisco ca robots  pledged of  goal  backers it could change the future of ocean exploration  new york times “i wish they were in every hardware store in the world”  dr sylvia earle national geographic explorerinresidence the maker movement at its best  tim oreilly founder and ceo of oreilly media incopenrov is an open source robotic submarine designed to make underwater exploration possible for everyone  its also an online community of professional and amateur rov remotely operated vehicle enthusiasts on openrovcom    the goal to inspire and enable anyone to become a diy ocean explorer we believe in the power of open source communities to create amazing tools and experiences this is an invitation to become a codeveloper of the openrov projectimportant note the openrov kit is a perfect introduction into the world of underwater exploration but at this point it is very much a product for makersdevelopers its a blast to play with but you should be ready to tinker with it the kit involves soldering gluing and wiring of electronicsbackgroundthe rov is the brainchild of eric stackpole eerrp who wanted an easy way to explore a cave that was rumored to contain sunken treasure near his home pretty soon a small team of interested onlookers began contributing to the design the community grew to include beginner amateur and professional engineers and scientists from over  countries as the community grew so did the proposed uses of the rov   from pollution monitoring in streams to species identification in antarctica the uses are only limited by your imaginationdesign the openrov is cm long cm wide and cm tall  it weights approximately kg and has been designed to go to depths of up to m a single cm outerdiameter by cm long waterproof tube houses all electronics and other equipment that must be kept dry  equipment in the tube is mounted onto a rotating platform that can be tilted up and down with a servo three kv brushless motors power the rov  two horizontal thrusters allow the rov to move forward and aft as well as rotate and a vertical thruster allows the neutrally buoyant vehicle to change depth openrov has been tested in ocean water to depths of m   onboard c batteries supply about  hours of run timefaqshow deep can it go  structurally openrov has been designed to go to m depth however weve only tested it to depths of about m so far  does it work in salt water yes but the salt water accelerates the corrosion of the brushless motors our current strategy has been to spray them with silicon mold release before use and to give them a freshwater rinse after every salt water dive this seems to work pretty well but more testing is needed if the motors do need to be replaced they are low cost and off the shelf the community is working hard to develop ways to make the motors run longer and strongerdo you have interns from the university of north alaska no not yethow fast does the rov travel what kind of current can it fly inwith the current propellers we are using which still have plenty of room to be optimized the rov moves at about ms were looking for propellers that will be more efficient and we are even investigating the possibility of making our own so if you happen to be an aerospace engineer we could use your help how is the rov poweredwe use  onboard c batteries which are mounted in the two white tubes at the bottom of the rov  these allow the rov to fly around for about an hour higher capacity batteries could be used to make the rov last longer but we wanted to use something available everywhere there are also ways to send power for the rov down the tether but thats still in the community development phasehow is the rov controlledflying the rov is a lot like playing a video game the interface is hosted as a webserver from the rov that allows you to control its movements with your computers keyboard and see its video feed on your screen  were also developing an interface that will use a usb game controller  eventually we plan to make the rov controllable via the internet and our hope is that developers who get the kit through this kickstarter project will have ideas for how to helpwhat comes after kickstarterwe want this to be a sustainable adventure  our plan is to get user feedback from people who build and operate openrovs to make the design even better and more fitted toward the communitys needs  we plan to continue selling openrov kits and assembled openrovs on our website as well as payloads and accessories for specific uses  we also hope that by building a strong community of people who understand the hardware and its applications well be able to develop ways of doing better science and exploration in more remote and

operated minisubmarine that weighs  kg and has dimensions  cm x  cm x  cm this submarine is powered by  liion batteries and can be assembled from common materials with the most expensive piece being the beaglebone black linux computer  the submarine is controlled from a laptop computer connected to the submarine via a tether and is equipped with onboard leds and a camera openrov is an opensource hardware project by providing the list of the submarine parts and instructions on how to assemble them the developers aim to democratize underwater exploration communityedit in addition to being a robotic submarine openrov is also a diy community of amateur and professional openrov submarine builders in over  countries that pursue underwater exploration openrov forums provides a platform for users to discuss ideas solve problems and share information similarly users can document builds projects and deployments on the open explorer platform  hall city caveedit the development of the openrov submarine was in part fueled by the legend that stolen gold is hidden in the deep waters of the hall city cave located near hayfork in trinity county northern california according to the legend a few renegade native americans stole  pounds of gold nuggets from miners in the s but were chased to escape from the pursuit the renegades had to bury the nuggets in deep waters of the nearby hall city cave to lighten their load but could not retrieve the gold because they were soon caught and hanged even though many have tried to find the gold nobody has been able to get to the bottom of the narrow and deep well of the cave some of the openrov testing has taken place at that cave developersedit the idea to build openrov was pioneered by eric stackpole an engineer at nasa at the time to discover whether the legend about the hidden treasure of the hall city cave was true david lang a selftaught sailor from minnesota heard about stackpole building a small cheap and robust submarine in his garage to search for the gold and became inspired to join matteo borri designed and built the electronics software and motor system for a prototype presented at the world maker faire in  lang
