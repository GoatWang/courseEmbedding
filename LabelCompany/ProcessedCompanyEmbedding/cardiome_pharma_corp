ischemic conditions new myocardial infarction and death in highrisk patients with nonstelevation acute coronary syndrome nsteacs who undergo early percutaneous coronary intervention pcihealth canada approved the aggrastat hdb regimen based on evidence from a number of independent studies that indicated that a higher degree of platelet inhibition was beneficial for patients in need of an urgent

patients with nsteacs who undergo early pcithe approval of the snds for a high dose bolus regimen of aggrastat for this higher risk patient population is an important accomplishment as it better
