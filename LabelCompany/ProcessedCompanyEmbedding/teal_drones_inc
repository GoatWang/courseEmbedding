teal drone can hit  mph so its a good thing it has replaceable legs july    am pdt this blazing fast quad aims to be the one drone for everyone by jacob krol  close drag autoplay on autoplay off              teal is more than just another quadcopter its a platformas it stands in  consumers can pick out a readytofly drone for aerial photos and video or for racing or just to fly casually teal is meant to appeal to all of these buyers regardless of skill level and eventually to commercial pilots toobehind teal  the company and the drone  is year old george matus who has been flying quads since he was  and built his first one at  the drone is the result of an evolving list of dream features hes been making since thenthe quad can go fast at up to  mph  kph in up to  mph  kph winds its weatherproof can be controlled with an ios or android device or a regular radio controller and is small enough to slip into backpack in front is an electronically stabilized megapixel camera that can record video at k resolutionteal is also modular and that doesnt only mean removing the battery each arm can be popped on and off as can the drones top section with other drones if you were to break one of the prop arms you would have to send the whole thing in for repair with teal youll be able to easily replace it on your own plus this opens the possibility for specialized arms for specific tasks teal is also currently planning to release modules for the top section including thermal imaging obstacle avoidance something it currently cant do on its own and a secondary camera for firstpersonview racingheres where it gets even more interesting though inside teal is a minicomputer powered by an nvidia jetson tx quadcore processor to handle machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies the idea here is that by having the modular design powerful hardware running the drones teal os as well as making an sdk available it can be a platform to be developed for consumer and commercial usesfor the moment the drone is targeted at consumers and will have three apps available at launch one for flight control another for a followme mode for automatic subject tracking and a racing application so you can compete against other teal pilots matus hopes after an app store has been built and grows that licensing of the platform with other hardware manufacturers will soon followthe biggest downsides we see are the same things we see with a lot of drones battery life and price teal has a mah lithium polymer battery that will provide around  minutes of flight time this is shorter than larger camera drones but is in line with most racing drones teal should be releasing extended batteries at some point after launch too the other issue is that teal is a new comer and at  the unit is not cheap and it is far off with the earliest units shipping right before christmas  while the rest of the orders placed by august  should ship by early  which is quite some time and thats if all goes according to plan the company is accepting preorders on teal drones site and you wont be charged until the drone ships best drones of  see all flir duo starting at  the flir

of these systems also from a political standpoint it helps address some of the concerns in congress about the ability of us companies to really address this market said philip finnegan director of corporate analysis at the teal group a leading aerospace and defense market analysis company its a way of providing an interim step before you go out and do the final rule and the final rule is going to take a long time one of the most troublesome issues the faa must address in its final rule is to outline the differences between using a drone for commercial purposes versus solely for recreation and then to police drone operators accordingly under current law for instance it is technically legal to equip a drone with a camera and snap pictures of a scenic countryside selling those pictures however is not allowed ironically that system may have created a situation in which the most responsible operators cant use drones legally while the most irresponsible can its going to be very difficult for the faa to control this part of the problem is there are severe restrictions on the commercial operation of these and a lot of those people would be the most responsible mr finnegan said

recognition algorithms with nasa and the air force racing this app lets pilots race against other teal users record flight logs and telemetry play challenges and win awards and move up the leaderboard to become one of the best product qhow fast can teal fly ateal can fly over  mph we’ve even reached speeds over  mph in certain conditions qisn’t it dangerous to have a drone that can fly that fast aclearly flying any drone out of control is dangerous and yes a highspeed drone can sometimes be more difficult to control for an inexperienced user for that reason teal is built on both the hardware side and software side to make it as safe and easy as possible to fly while still allowing mindblowing maneuverability and speed  software features include selectable beginner to advanced configurations speed and pitch governing geofencing and our beginner bubble qcan i fly teal in windy conditions ayes unlike other drones teal is incredibly stable in wind it has been flown in winds

we favored having an extremely small stable and powerful drone out of the box with two batteries included a fast charge time of  minutes and “hot swappable” capability that makes switching batteries easy you will be able to get plenty of air time we also have an endurance package available that doubles the flight time of teal to  minutes since it’s heavier and favors efficiency it will decrease the top speed and stability of teal slightly qhow can i check the battery level for my teal athe leds on the back of teal provide battery status our command  control application also has a battery indicator as the battery level starts to get low you’ll be notified and will be able to select whether you’d like teal to return to you or just land in place qhow far away can my teal fly from me

protected by hydrophobic mesh it is not waterproof we don’t support water damage so we don’t recommend that you submerge it or fly in wet conditions not only will this void your warranty but we also
