provide investors with an understanding of our past performance current financial condition and outlook for the future and should be read in conjunction with item  financial statements and supplementary data of this report overview of  results by executing on our strategy outlined in items  and  business and properties of this report we strive to optimize value for our shareholders by growing cash flow earnings production and reserves all on a per debtadjusted share basis despite the challenges our company and the entire upstream energy sector have faced from the sustained low commodity price environment we have continued to execute our strategy and position our company for longterm success although we have seen moderate improvements in oil and natural gas prices over the course of  prices for oil and natural gas were still significantly lower than  and  and remain under pressure due to excess supply concerns in response to this environment we remained committed to an approach centered on maintaining a balanced portfolio of highclass assets with a focus on value and returns accelerating our activity in the stack and delaware basin and preserving continuity in our other us resource plays driving efficiencies across our portfolio of assets by achieving operating efficiencies and cost savings and increasing capital productivity and protecting and strengthening our investmentgrade balance sheet by investing directionally within cash flow and through use of divestiture proceeds to that end in  we expanded our position in the stack by acquiring approximately  net acres and assets for  billion and increased production in this key resource play by  compared to  continued the shift to highermargin products with oil and bitumen production representing  of our retained asset production mix for  successfully divested certain noncore upstream assets in the us and our  interest in the access pipeline in canada for  billion reduced exploratory and developmental

billion in an offering of our common stock and exited  with approximately  billion in cash and senior credit facility capacity in  and beyond we have the financial capacity to further accelerate investment across our bestinclass us resource plays we are increasing drilling activity and will continue to rapidly shift our production mix to highmargin products we will continue our premier technical work to drive capital allocation and efficiency and industryleading well productivity results we will continue to maximize the value of our base production by sustaining the operational efficiencies we have achieved finally we will continue to manage activity levels within our cash flows we expect this disciplined approach will position us to deliver substantial cash flow expansion

with a strong leadership team we have experience operating in periods of challenged commodity prices with our focused strategy and portfolio of quality assets we are prepared to successfully navigate the current environment while ensuring our longterm financial strength market prices for crude oil and natural gas are inherently volatile therefore we cannot predict with certainty the future prices for the commodities we produce and sell during  oil prices ranged from bbl to bbl as a result of the ongoing worldwide oversupply issue opec agreed to its first oil production cut in eight years in

due to our  reduction in exploration and development capital related to our retained assets during  while expanded drilling in the stack and the performance of our jackfish assets drove production increases these production increases were more than offset by reduced completion activity in the eagle ford and natural production declines in the barnett shale and rockies oil delaware basin production was relatively flat as natural declines offset the increases from new wells additionally our production decreased as a result of our us noncore divestiture program volumes  vs  commodity sales increased due to volumes in  because of strong production growth from our us oil properties the growth was primarily driven by the continued development of our eagle table of contents index to
