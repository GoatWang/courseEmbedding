of its market guide for productcentric cloud erp solutions the guide provides a concise look at everything from the erp market direction to some of the space’s representative vendors gartner defines productcentric organizations as those who manufacture sell andor distribute products some also sell services such as installation or maintenance delivered by direct employees and contractors but this

companies according to gartner the landscape for cloud erp for productcentric organizations is in transition as cloud becomes more prevalent and offers multiple deployment models cio’s and application
