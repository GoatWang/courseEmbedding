international markets the company’s products are distributed primarily through  independent insurance agents and brokers throughout the united states travelers is number  on the fortune  list of the largest publicly traded us corporations can you provide a brief overview of the travelers companies and the areas you’re specifically focused on we’re headquartered in saint paul minnesota but we have significant operations in hartford as well as offices in the united kingdom and canada we’re the secondlargest writer of commercial us property casualty insurance and we’re the secondlargest writer of personal insurance through independent agents our financial strength wide range of products and effective claims handling are just a few of our competitive advantages we’ve grown over the past  years and have more than  employees worldwide with more than  employees in connecticut  or so in the greater hartford area and we’ve been adding jobs at a significant pace over the past couple of years as chief administrative officer i’m responsible for human resources and administrative services which includes facilities management real estate purchasing security food service and aviation as well as our foundation which makes significant contributions nationwide and in the greater hartford area are the career opportunities within the industry and at travelers specifically well understood and how have you been so successful at retaining the talent yes our retention rates are excellent we work very hard at providing mentoring and coaching for our employees and we make sure that this is a place where people want to continue their careers to do that we have to give our employees opportunities for personal and professional growth we’re proud that travelers has been named one of fortune’s “most admired companies” and businessweek’s “best places to launch a career” as well as one of the “ best internships” how important has it been for your workforce to mirror your client base and how focused have you been on fostering a diverse culture and inclusiveness it’s very important that our workforce be reflective of our clients who comprise a diverse community travelers has a very strong commitment to diversity we talk about it plan for it and make sure that we’re actively involved in it through initiatives that include hiring a diverse workforce fostering an inclusive environment and providing learning and development opportunities we have a program called the travelers education access initiative we gave birth to the program about two years ago to get connected with young people from underrepresented communities to provide the means for them to get to college and stay there through scholarships parttime jobs and internships once they get out of college we give them the opportunity to come work for us we’re putting millions of dollars into this program it’s very important for our company and it’s something we’re very focused on to help diversify our employee base how critical is corporate social responsibility to the organization we all want to give back to our communities and help other people – that’s human nature young people today are very interested in knowing what a company does for the community and they are also very involved with green initiatives which is part of my role here travelers is committed to being environmentally responsible our entire campus in hartford and our entire campus in saint paul are energy starcompliant facilities that’s huge for companies because it’s a difficult achievement in the area of community support we give more than  million to the greater hartford area alone in the areas of education with things like the travelers education access initiative community development which is housing and economic development and arts and culture you’ve also gravitated toward sports sponsorships notably the travelers championship with the pga tour what made you feel that was the right fit sponsoring the travelers championship was an easy decision because it’s good for our business and it is good for the community because it benefits local charities our research found that golf is the numberone sport of our distribution network of agents and our customers the tournament started in hartford in  but in  it lost its place on the tour schedule when a slot on the schedule unexpectedly opened up we signed on as title sponsor and brought the tournament back to life as the travelers championship the community really responded everywhere we go we hear thanks and praise for saving the tournament the two charities of the tournament are the greater hartford jaycees which does a lot of things in underserved communities around the greater hartford region and the hole in the wall gang camp founded by paul newman in ashford which is a fabulous place for seriously ill children those relationships are important click here to download a pdf of this article page not found  leadership directories

    o f     t h e     m o n t h andy bessette former olympian brings team game to idrc presidency b y     j a c k     l y n e leading the worlds preeminent corporate real estate cre association might seem an olympian task in fact thats how  us olympic team member andy bessette right views his upcoming stint as president of the international development research council idrc team though is the key word in the parallels between idrc and the olympics where hammer thrower bessette threw a pound kg ball on a fourfoot m wire more than  feet  m  farther than most folks can fling a baseball a lot of people see hammer throwing as an individual sport but its a team sport as much as anything else says bessette vice president of corporate real estate services for travelers property casualty corp i had a wellintegrated team behind me my coaches people who helped me with sports psychology my wife and yes thats equally true with being idrc president im really proud to do it but im just a cog in the wheel what makes idrc great is our team our membership  the most powerful thing we have our challenge as a team is to take idrc and the profession to the next level extending idrcs integration only connect wrote em forster and that echoes how idrcs incoming president operates hes seemingly always searching for connections in words like team and integration integration in fact is a recurrent theme in how bessette envisions his  idrc presidency which will begin after idrcs april may  new york world congress thats certainly apropos since idrc has become a leader in corporate infrastructure resource managementtm cir bessette for example wants to accelerate idrcs integration of research education and cre certification and the discovery and leadership forums see pg  are such great tools with leadership at all levels visualizing the future in real time he says bessette also sees huge potential payoffs in integrating with other groups including nacore with whom idrc is discussing an integration of organizations in the corporate world we explore integration all the time in mergers and acquisitions he says weve done that year after year at the travelers and now at citigroup and so many good things come out of it and cir integration occurs every day within our companies adding value to the business process similarly exploring integrating with associations like nacore becoming more broad and encompassing is so healthy and important it forces you to think about exactly what you want your organization to be and it will do nothing but strengthen idrc personally i love the idea of integrating the two organizations which are so strong separately with such great memberships mills remains mentor talking to andy bessette inevitably evokes two other integrative words wayne mills  who retired last year after a long lauded career that included idrcs  presidency bessette spent his first four years at the travelers in human relations and facilities ironically given todays integration push those two functions were integrated then then in  bessette joined travelers cre headed by mills he became my mentor and he still is bessette says with obvious feeling i still see him all the time ive never known anyone as passionate about the profession and yet so humble about all hes accomplished he was a major force in one of the big industry transitions ive seen from being more focused on transactions  which are still very important  to becoming much more integral in corporate strategy mills in fact makes a bessette dream team the three most important people who have had the most influence in my life have been my dad my coach when i was trying to make the olympics and wayne andy bessette extends that lineage finding the important connections in his work and life right now for example hes hurrying home for his daughters birthday the next day he leaves for idrcs beijing world congress the olympian it seems is still going flat out  site selection online  sitenet  feedback
