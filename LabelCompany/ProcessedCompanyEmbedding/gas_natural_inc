provided by gas natural inc jun    et share this article cleveland june   prnewswire  gas natural inc nyse mkt egas the company a holding company operating local natural gas utilities serving approximately  customers in four states announced that it has filed its definitive proxy materials with the us securities and exchange commission sec in connection with the companys  annual meeting of shareholders to be held on july    gas natural shareholders of record at the close of business on may   are entitled to vote at the  annual meeting of shareholders the gas natural board of directors strongly recommends that shareholders vote on the green proxy card for all six of gas naturals qualified and experienced director nominees  michael b bender james p carney richard k greaves robert b johnston gregory j osborne and michael r winter in conjunction with the filing and mailing of its definitive proxy statement gas natural is mailing a letter to shareholders detailing the significant progress and accomplishments under the leadership of the gas natural board and management team over the past two years  the letter also addresses richard m osbornes committee which has not provided an alternative strategic plan to drive additional value for gas natural shareholders and is only suggesting different director nominees gas naturals definitive proxy materials letter to shareholders and other materials regarding the boards recommendation for the  annual meeting of shareholders can be found at httpproxyegasnet the full text of the letter follows june   dear fellow shareholder your board of directors and management team are transforming gas natural  we have been – and will continue to be – the agents of change for your company  within the last two years we have overhauled management and the board of directors and brought greater sophistication and experience to gas natural  we are taking decisive actions to become a premier natural gas utility in the regions in which we operate and are restoring relationships with our stakeholders that were lost under the watch of the previous management team and board  we disposed of resourcedemanding low return operations  we made significant progress ridding the company of transactions contracts and entanglements with companies related to the former chairman and ceo richard m osborne that raised the concern of the public utilities commission of ohio puco   and we gained shareholder support with our largest shareholder being represented on our board  at our  annual meeting of shareholders to be held on july   you face an important decision regarding the future of gas natural and your investment  you are being asked to elect the directors who you believe are the most qualified to complete the transformation of gas natural  your current board is the change that gas natural has needed in a time of significant regulatory and shareholder scrutiny  we have led this transformation to an inflection point and have the knowledge and expertise to drive our strategy forward to deliver superior value  we strongly recommend that you elect our highly qualified leaders by voting for all of your boards experienced nominees – michael b bender james p carney richard k greaves robert b johnston gregory j osborne and michael r winter  to elect gas naturals board of director nominees we encourage you to vote today by signing and dating the enclosed green proxy card and returning it in the postagepaid envelope provided remember if you hold your shares at a bank or broker you can vote your shares by telephone or via the internet  as you may recall richard m osborne gas naturals former chairman and ceo was removed in  amidst regulatory inquiries derivative lawsuits and an unprecedented investigation in ohio  in retaliation he brought several lawsuits against the company and started a business that competes with our ohio utilities  now he has formed the committee to reenergize gas natural and has nominated six of his own director candidates for election to your board  please do not return or vote any white proxy card sent to you by richard m osborne and his socalled committee  when richard m osborne was dismissed from gas natural our regulatory relations were at an alltime low  under richard m osbornes leadership two consecutive regulatory audits in ohio covering periods from  through mid resulted in significant losses for the ohio utilities and directives by the puco to end related party transactions  ultimately richard m osborne refused to follow the direction of the regulators and in november  the puco ordered an investigative audit into the management practices under richard m osborne  we are successfully transforming gas natural to drive greater earnings power and growth since richard m osbornes dismissal in may  we began the long process of repairing relationships with our regulators restoring morale throughout our organization improving corporate governance rightsizing the organization redirecting capital investment to improve the opportunity for higher returns and strengthening our relationship with our lenders  as evidence of the progress we are making with our regulators the puco recently approved a stipulated settlement between our ohio utilities and the puco staff regarding the investigative audit  the audit was completed in january  by rehmann corporate investigative services  the order specifically states the findings of rehmann were noteworthy in part because all of the issues identified with respect to the operations and management of the companies took place during the time richard osborne was ceo and chairman of the board of directors of the companies emphasis added  since richard m osbornes removal with strong leadership and positive direction for the company we have strengthened our financial structure  we recently requested regulatory approvals for a complete refinancing of our debt that simplifies our balance sheet provides greater financial flexibility and will further facilitate growth improved internal controls and procedures  we retained an independent audit firm to assist in the establishment of processes procedures and documentation for effective processing of transactional data informed decisionmaking required checks and balances and sound corporate governance  this included changes in personnel eliminated relatedparty transactions  we unwound prior relationships with richard m osbornes companies other than those to which we are contractually obligated or are necessary to serve customers and we established additional practices for engaging with independent third parties disposed of resourceconsuming assets and directed resources toward core earning assets  we sold noncore assets and operations in wyoming kentucky pennsylvania and ohio and generated nearly  million in cash from the divestiture  grew our customer base  during the two year period ended march   we realized customer growth of  and  in our emerging markets of maine and north carolina respectively in addition to moderate growth in our more mature markets of ohio and montana  these accomplishments are a product of our tireless efforts to fix the damage caused to your company under richard m osborne we are poised to realize the benefits of our strategic plan we made tough business decisions to establish a solid foundation for stronger earnings power and improved returns  we have achieved this goal while building a healthy work environment for our employees and providing our customers with safe reliable competitivelypriced natural gas service  the foundation of our company is stronger as a result of the following reduced headcount by over  to improve efficiency and morale reprioritized investments and borrowed capital to advance our growth plan and aligned the dividend with current earnings and capital needs to execute our growth plan lowered the payout ratio to be commensurate with peers by reducing the dividend to an annual rate of  per share from  per share  we have a growth plan that includes increasing our customer base and expanding throughput with capital investments aimed at higher returns as well as finding strategic smaller incremental acquisitions or larger transformative acquisitions to supplement that organic growth  our goal is to achieve returns on equity significantly above the roughly  we have averaged over the last five years and ultimately to surpass the level of our past dividend  your board is highly qualified and independent with the experience necessary to drive lasting shareholder value over the last two years since the ouster of richard m osborne we have measurably strengthened your board and improved corporate governance  the board is now comprised of six highly experienced and qualified directors four of whom were newly elected to the board since richard m osborne departed replacing the directors that were on the board when he was chairman five of the six directors are independent contributing to strong corporate governance  two of the directors represent our largest shareholder with almost  of our outstanding shares and we believe their interests are aligned with yours  the board adopted a new code of conduct a new policy on insider trading and also adopted a nepotism and personal relationships policy on september   our directors are actively engaged in overseeing management as we execute our plans and strategies for creating longterm value for all our shareholders we want you to know the facts richard m osbornes platform is based on misrepresentations and distorted analysis  in fact during richard m osbornes tenure the puco initiated an investigation into the management practices at our ohio utilities primarily due to significant concerns over related party transactions between our ohio utilities and richard m osbornes companies as well as what the puco described as flawed unreasonable and imprudent purchasing practices and designs  richard m osborne has criticized us for customer refunds in   in fact the refunds were required by the puco for the  gas cost recovery audit period when richard m osborne was chairman and ceo  during richard m osbornes tenure significant amounts of cash were deployed that have not delivered returns for our company  for example from  through  his last five years leading gas natural capital expenditures were nearly double the earnings of the company in fact under richard m osborne our outstanding common stock increased more than two fold from  million shares at the end of  to  million shares four years later  in fact these share issuances more than doubled the total annual dividend payment from  million in  to  million in   continuing to pay that level of dividend was disproportionate to our earnings and unsustainable leading us to the difficult decision of reducing it  richard m osbornes slate of directors possesses questionable business experience or lacks relevant utility experience and commitment to shareholder interests several of richard m osbornes companies are undergoing bankruptcy proceedings including john d oil and gas company great plains exploration llc and oz gas ltd  in fact richard m osborne currently has multiple actions pending before the bankruptcy court against him or his companies  in fact the november  puco order initiating the investigative audit noted that during richard m osbornes tenure as chairman and ceo of gas natural the evidence shows that there is a severe organizational dysfunction within the companies and between the regulated companies and their nonregulated affiliates  senior management lacked basic utility experience the recommendation for an audit comes following a series of extremely frustrating audits of the companies rife with selfdealing that demonstrates a remarkable lack of control  in fact on june   an order was issued by the puco calling for the investigation and audit of all pipeline companies owned or controlled by richard m osborne and under the jurisdiction of the puco  while richard m osbornes ohio pipeline companies are under further regulatory scrutiny by the puco he is asking you to vote for him to lead gas natural  richard m osbornes interests do not appear to be aligned with the majority of our shareholders as evidenced by his significant divestiture of gas natural shares  during the period from january   through april   richard m osborne sold nearly  million shares of gas natural stock  he now owns fewer than  shares   one of richard m osbornes board nominees darryl l knight was hired by richard m osborne and served as the general manager of our north carolina utility from october  until september   that utility was cited with a disallowance in excess of  million by the north carolina utility commission regarding gas cost procurement practices under the management of darryl l knight  none of richard m osbornes remaining four nominees has any experience in the highly regulated utility industry  protect your investment please vote the green proxy card today discard richard m osbornes white proxy card  we believe richard m osborne and his nominees lack the experience to properly lead manage and govern public utilities and they own less than  of our outstanding shares  furthermore richard m osbornes history demonstrates his disregard for our regulators lack of understanding of utility operations and furtherance of his own selfserving interests  your vote matters and we believe your current board is the most qualified to provide you the best future returns on your investment  on behalf of the board of directors thank you for your continued support  sincerely michael r winter chairman of the board your vote is important no matter how many or few shares you own please follow the easy instructions on the enclosed green proxy card if you have any questions or need assistance in voting your
