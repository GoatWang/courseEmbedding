editor’s note recipes past issues select page jelynne leblancburley ready for the future jul    cover profile  jelynne leblancburley helps cps energy meet st century goals while most of us were relaxing during the last memorial day weekend jelynne leblancburley spent a great deal of time cooped up inside the cps energy emergency management center following weather reports and guiding the company’s response to potentially dangerous developments caused by the storms emergencies are part of her job leblancburley is the executive vice president and chief delivery officer for cps energy san antonio’s municipally owned utility that supplies electricity and natural gas to a total of  million customers in the greater san antonio area “i understand what happens to property and to people in these situations over the years i have seen a lot of devastation and i have a keen sense of the potential for danger it can quickly become catastrophic so you have to be on it” she says “i wanted to make sure that we had the correct information and that that information was disseminated appropriately and that we had resources deployed to help people affected by outages” since she took the helm of the energy delivery and customer service sectors she has been implementing customerfocused policies that utilize both technological and human resources to improve service help people in need conserve energy and look to the future needs of both cps energy and the public “our utility is at a crossroads right now” explains leblancburley “our industry is changing and it all started with this she holds up her smartphone customers today want control convenience and choice and we have to be ready” these choices may range from the way they pay their bill — in person by mail online — to programs that would allow customers to choose how they access solar energy those who cannot install rooftop panels for instance will be able to get solargenerated energy through a “community solar system” by buying or renting panels on a public system another recent service created in response to consumer demand is the installation of public chargers for electric cars  have been installed so far and there’s more leblancburley points out that thomas edison would be very comfortable seeing our present electrical infrastructure because it has not changed substantially for  years but a major overhaul has begun cps energy and other utilities nationwide are in the process of developing “smart grids” to optimize both the delivery and conservation of energy to begin with your meters will be replaced by digital “smart” devices that will directly communicate with a central data center eliminating the need for meter readers to access customers’ property while this grid optimization project is supervised by another executive leblancburley is preparing for the postinstallation challenges managing a workforce of  employees the largest cps energy group is very much part of that “with all the new devices added to the infrastructure we need to keep our workers skilled and educated and anticipate the workload ahead of us not just for the linemen but for engineers and data scientists too” she notes “we will be collecting a lot of data it’s all about data analytics now” in addition her business plan includes things that we as consumers never think about — cable and pole replacements for the overhead transmission grid call center technological improvements pipe replacement for gas transmission substation modernization etc she pulls out a little card to give me the exact numbers showing the vastness of the task  miles of overhead electrical lines  miles of underground lines  miles of transmission lines and a gas line system consisting of  distribution and  transmission miles managing and motivating such a large workforce can be a challenge for any executive leblancburley believes that employee engagement is the answer “we need to explain to employees our vision and strategies why we are going in the direction we are going it is also our job to make sure they have the tools to do their job in a safe manner and that we send them home at night the way their families sent them to us in the morning” hard work and integrity a native of baton rouge la where she became the first black child to enroll in her elementary school young jelynne grew up with a single mother who was a role model for her “she was an africanamerican woman lawyer the first in the east baton rouge parish in the s” notes the proud daughter “she never indicated that being a woman was an extra burden she just did what she needed to do” it was also mom who encouraged her to pursue urban studies at trinity university instead of law and to stay in san antonio following the completion of her master’s degree though her mother passed away her picture keeps vigil on the daughter’s desk joined by photos of leblancburley’s daughters and her beloved grandmother an internship with the city of san antonio led to a job offer which segued into an illustrious year career at city hall ending with the position of deputy city manager during her long tenure she’s been involved in many projects and city departments from housing and neighborhood services to public works international affairs and information services her stepdaughter crystal and her daughter juliet often accompanied her to public meetings and each has memories of debates surrounding certain projects like the convention center or the alamodome construction they also have memories of confusing newspaper articles mentioning their mother and of people always claiming their mom’s attention now a yearold professional cook juliet recalls how she used to stop eager citizens from interfering with the family’s grocery shopping “i would tell them ‘you can call her on monday now we are just buying eggs’” the startled person would back away “it was a very fulfilling career” says leblancburley of her years with the city “i still run into neighborhood activists who remember the time we worked together on a drainage problem or housing issue one regret i have is that i won’t be able to give back to my hometown of baton rouge anything like what i have given to san antonio san antonio has embraced me but san antonians have a way of letting you know that you are not from here still i like it here it’s a much more diverse city than baton rouge” asked to compare working at cps energy versus working for the city she doesn’t hesitate “both entities are citizenfocused but the contrast is in the nature of the business the city offices can close sometimes there’s not one aspect of this business that can ever close that’s a huge difference” to keep up with the demands of the job this executive wakes up very early hits the gym at  am and by  is already back at her computer sending messages to her direct reports and preparing for the day basically the job requires her “to stay on all the time” she monitors her phone constantly to stay informed about any employee incidents that may occur in the course of a day the work they do is often dangerous and the concern is not misplaced this attitude of caring is also evident in the community engagement programs that leblancburley initiated to educate and help cps energy customers as well as in her personal involvement with a number of nonprofits in town “service is the price you pay for the space you occupy” she says matteroffactly her civic affiliations include board and leadership positions with san antonio for growth on the eastside known as sage christus santa rosa health system girl scouts of southwest texas san antonio hispanic chamber alamo colleges advisory council united way and others being a black woman in the top echelons of corporate leadership jelynne is frequently asked to speak to young audiences about succeeding in life and work everything is possible she tells them but it’s hard work you have to be disciplined dependable prepared and you cannot compromise your integrity it also requires patience tolerance for different personalities and ideas and the ability to stay pleasant no matter how you feel inside her own career embodies these principles while she has huge responsibilities that affect the lives of more than  million san antonians the soulnourishing rewards are big too “what i like best about my work are the people the people i work with and the people i serve it’s gratifying to me to look at the town and think how all those poles and wires mean so much to my community” she says

increase to the city council interim cps boss rewarded    back to gallery jelynne leblancburley who ran daytoday operations at cps energy since december but fell short of permanently landing the top spot was awarded a  bonus for a job well done and has been asked by the new ceo to stay “i have enormous respect for her” said doyle beneby who was hired last month from exelon power to run cps energy the nations largest municipally owned electric and gas utility leblancburleys new title is executive vice president of corporate support services and chief administrative officer with an annual salary of  the job is similar to the one she held before she was asked to become acting chief of the utility which was in disarray in the wake of revelations that cost estimate increases for the proposed expansion at the south texas project were kept from the board of trustees cps energy ended up suing its partner nrg energy business channel the former assistant city manager led the utility to a successful resolution of the case leaving cps energy incurring no further costs and if the plant is built a small stake in it and an  million payment from nrg she then made a successful argument for a rate increase to the city council and saw the utilitys bond rating rise the utility is now rated aa aa and aa by fitch ratings moodys investor services and standard  poors respectively in a statement to employees released thursday beneby noted her leadership “jelynne shepherded cps energy through an unusually difficult period her actions in settling the lawsuit  saved millions of dollars in avoided legal and settlement costs and by maintaining our high bond rating we pay lower rates on debt ive heard repeatedly from the board our employees and community leaders that she should be recognized for what she accomplished and i agreed” beneby said wednesday that he likely would increase leblancburleys responsibilities “at some point there are probably opportunities to make some consolidation and give her more accountability” he told the san antonio expressnews editorial board leblancburley was in meetings all day thursday and was unavailable for comment a spokeswoman said she was one of four candidates on the short list for the top job and a source close to the process called her “a strong second” ultimately benebys career experience in the energy industry gave him the edge but board chairman charles e foster made plain the boards wish that he keep leblancburley in some capacity as originally published this story contained an error text news to  for alerts official
