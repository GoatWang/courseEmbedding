resources to cushion the impact on exporters wrote james wang a city university of hong kong professor who pens a monthly commentary for the fund privatelyowned chinese exporters would be worse hit than statecontrolled peers because they have less political clout in beijing he said“by design decisionmakers in a democracy face difficulties coordinating a relief effort and must eventually face a political backlash from impacted domestic producers” wang wrote “on this basis the chinese may have more runway to play the long game in a trade war” during his campaign trump pledged to brand china a currency manipulator and impose a  percent tariff on chinese imports his protocolbreaking phone call with taiwan president tsai ingwen and his attacks on china on twitter have sparked further friction between the world’s two biggest economies before he takes office next monthtrump’s electoral victory capped a year of rising populism that wang likened to the aftermath of world war i which ushered in an age of discontent and protectionismdiffuse power“the balance of power worldwide is much more diffuse compared to the early th century and players like china and india have emerged to create new
