equity private equity giants use size to lean on suppliers by kevin roose july    pm july    pm slide show a single company purchased more than  hewlettpackard computers last year buying in bulk to shave millions of dollars off its costs but it was not general electric procter  gamble or another large multinational conglomerate with the muscle to dictate prices to suppliers rather the big buyer was the blackstone group a private equity firm private equity firms like blackstone are emerging as a powerful new force in the marketplace the big investors which collectively oversee thousands of companies are using their size and scope to pressure suppliers set their own prices and exert their influence in a range of industries including health care construction and consumer goods last year blackstone was part of a group of companies that collectively bought  million reams of copy paper  million fedex shipments and  days’ worth of rental cars from national and avis “we have incredible leverage” said james a quella blackstone’s north american head of portfolio operations “the more volume we have the lower our prices go” for years private equity firms like blackstone have been viewed as financial alchemists who buy undervalued companies rejigger their balance sheets and sell them for quick gain in good times the strategy worked buyout specialists could turn a tidy profit in a matter of months without getting deeply involved in the businesses they owned hence the “barbarians at the gate” stereotype which has arisen again in recent months as the presidential election has brought the private equity debate into sharp focus critics of the industry have faulted mitt romney the presumed republican candidate for his years of running bain capital a large buyout firm the industry players have been cast as job destroyers more concerned with making money for investors than improving the companies they own one particularly critical ad for the obama campaign featured a company gst steel that went out of business years after it was taken over by bain capital but with the financial crisis the decline of stocks markets and the sputtering recovery private equity has been adapting its ways while profit remains central and layoffs can still be part of the private equity equation buyout firms are now stuck holding on to companies longer than expected as a result the firms cannot operate at arm’s length anymore and instead have had to roll up their sleeves and become fullfledged operators the private equity titans have huge economic influence and sway largely because of the size of their portfolios blackstone owns all or part of  companies that employ  people and generate  billion in annual revenue taken collectively blackstone’s businesses would rank as the th largest company by revenue ahead of jpmorgan chase ibm and procter  gamble kohlberg kravis roberts another megafirm would be no  on that list with its  portfolio companies and  billion in aggregate revenue the carlyle group has investments in  portfolio companies including dunkin’ brands and hertz that collectively employ around  people — more than general motors and general electric combined “historically private equity firms were about financial engineering” said jason busch managing director at spend matters a research firm that focuses on the procurement processes of big corporations “that’s the fairy tale story from  or  years ago within the last decade there’s been more operational work to do” blackstone and others are taking the cues from the likes of general electric decades ago ge started buying in bulk for its various businesses units including aerospace energy consumer and finance despite the disparate industries spread across dozens of countries ge decided to make buying decisions at the corporate level as a way to save money and bolster profits today most large multinational companies adhere to a similar strategy for their supply chain buying computers office supplies and all types of products at a discount now private equity firms are too both blackstone and kkr belong to a group purchasing program called coretrust which has roughly  member companies including tpg capital bain capital and other private equity firms the program which began in  helps companies save  to  percent on common items and even lets them stay enrolled after they are sold or taken public by their private equity owners “it’s just common sense” said todd cooper head of procurement for kkr which uses coretrust for some bulk purchases “every company whether i’m a manufacturer or a retailer uses fedex everybody needs laptops” those savings can add up blackstone says it has saved  million since  through coretrust direct supplier relationships and an equity health care group which applies the same group purchasing principles to employee health insurance plans kkr pegs its total savings at north of  million “it’s a phenomenal benefit” said chris karkenny the chief financial officer of apria a health care company that was acquired by blackstone in  and has since used coretrust to buy telecommunications equipment office supplies and other goods “we do just over  billion in revenue but we’re getting rates that companies with  billion in revenue would get” in  mr quella of blackstone recruited gregory beutler a former ge executive to help blackstone drive down prices in its biggest spending categories the two set a goal of saving  million a year through bulkbuying they immediately began reaching out to the company’s suppliers telling them that they were to treat blackstone’s myriad businesses like one giant conglomerate and set their prices accordingly “we went to ups and fedex” mr quella said “we said ‘guys we just did an analysis our smallest company is paying  for overnight our largest company is paying  for overnight you guys charge whatever you get away with we want one price and we want that price to be the price you give your biggest customer’ ” the hardball tactic worked “we negotiate them to the wall” mr beutler said of blackstone’s suppliers another costcutting tactic is the reverse eauction in the ebaystyle process suppliers are given a set period of time typically an hour to bid against one another for a large contract earlier this year when emdeon a medical data provider owned by blackstone wanted to renegotiate a contract for a type of large pound paper rolls it uses to print medical claim statements and customer bills mr beutler organized a onehour eauction involving four paper makers mr quella and mr beutler watched eagerly from their desks as the bids began at  a roll then fell as companies began lowering their prices when the auction ended a late bid of  a roll had won out the savings were small by group purchasing standards only about  percent of a contract that averages around  million annually but at the scale of private equity every dollar counts “ten percent of a big number is a big number” mr quella explained while eauctions and other aggressive negotiating tactics save money for private equity firms they often put suppliers in a bind should they lose out on a large contract or win it and make the narrowest of profit margins “it almost is a necessary evil” said anthony c chukumba an analyst for bbt capital markets “you want the business but if you bid so low and then win a contract then you have something that is only marginally profitable” some large private equity firms choose not to participate in programs like coretrust typically because they believe the group purchasing process strains relationships with suppliers and requires them to micromanage companies in exchange for relatively small savings private equityowned companies too have raised objections to group purchasing programs which often require them to change suppliers from the ones they have used for decades “it’s difficult to break companies out of their mindsets” said justin hillenbrand a partner at monomoy capital partners a midmarket private equity firm that uses a group purchasing program for its portfolio companies “maybe they’ve been using ups forever and because of that ups gives them favors maybe it delivers things at odd hours guess what if my purchasing program can get fedex for  percent cheaper they’re going to switch” at one meeting mr quella of blackstone said the chief executive of a portfolio company expressed his frustration that the firm’s group purchasing plan would force him to switch the brand of toilet paper his company used in its bathrooms still group purchasing advocates defend their work as a necessary part of private equity’s fattrimming process blackstone and kkr rival firms in almost every sense are now teaming up to introduce coretrust to europe as group purchasing programs grow they will have to tread lightly finding a balance in getting the prices they want and not angering the companies they own or their suppliers “it’s one thing to fool with the balance sheet of a company — it’s another to change its operations” said mr busch of spend matters “it’s absolutely about rolling up your sleeves but it’s about having soft hands as well” whats next loading previous post many regulators put their attention on how jpmorgan marketed its funds next post regulators’ shakeup seen as missed bid to police jpmorgan advertisement
