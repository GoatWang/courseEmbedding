kodak did not believe that american consumers would ever desert its brand kodak passed on the opportunity to become the official film of the  los angeles olympics fuji won these sponsorship rights which gave it a permanent foothold in the marketplace fuji opened a film plant in the us and its aggressive marketing and price cutting began taking market share from kodak fuji went from a  share in the early s to  in  fuji also made headway into the professional market with specialty transparency films such as velvia and provia which competed successfully with kodaks signature professional product kodachrome but used the more economical and common e processing machines which were standard in most processing labs rather than the dedicated machines required by kodachrome fujis films soon also found a competitive edge in higherspeed negative films with a tighter grain structure in may  kodak filed a petition with the us commerce department under section  of the commerce act arguing that its poor performance in the japanese market was a direct result of unfair practices adopted by fuji the complaint was lodged by the united states with the world trade organization on january

george m c fisher reached outclarification needed to microsoft and other new consumer merchandisers apples pioneering quicktake consumer digital cameras introduced in  had the apple label but were produced by kodak the dc and dc launched in  overall though there was little implementation of the new digital strategy kodaks core business faced no pressure from competing technologies and as kodak executives could not fathom a world without traditional film there was little incentive to deviate from that course consumers gradually switched to the digital offering from companies such as sony in  film sales dropped which was attributed by kodak to the financial shocks caused by the september  attacks executives hoped that kodak might be able to slow the shift to digital through aggressive marketing under daniel carp fishers successor as ceo kodak made its move in the digital camera market with its easyshare family of digital cameras kodak spent tremendous resources studying customer behavior finding out that women in particular loved taking digital photos but were frustrated in moving them to their computers this key unmet consumer need became a major opportunity once kodak got

strategy rejected the razor and blades business model used by the dominant market leader hewlettpackard in that kodaks printers were expensive but the ink was cheaper as of  these new lines of inkjet printers were said to be on verge of turning a profit although some analysts were skeptical as printouts had been replaced gradually by electronic copies on computers tablets and smartphones home

brian o’connor kodak chief privacy officer said the company was surprised by the news release distributed by the better business bureau it is inaccurate in the facts presented as well as those the bbb chose to omit ironically we ultimately decided to resign our membership because we were extremely unhappy with the customer service we received from the local office of the bbb after years of unproductive discussions with the local office regarding their web site postings about kodak which in our view were consistently inaccurate we came to the conclusion that their process added no value to our own our commitment to our customers is unwavering that will not change what has changed is that for us the bbbs customer complaint process has become redundant given the multiple and immediate

fujifilmedit japanese competitor fujifilm entered the us market via fuji photo film usa with lowerpriced film and supplies but kodak did not believe that american consumers would ever desert its brand kodak passed on the opportunity to become the official film of the  los angeles olympics fuji won these sponsorship rights which gave it a permanent foothold in the marketplace fuji opened a film plant in the us and its aggressive marketing and price cutting began taking market share from kodak fuji went from a  share in the early s to  in  fuji also made headway into the professional market with specialty transparency films such as velvia and provia which competed successfully with kodaks signature professional product kodachrome but used the more economical and common e processing machines which were standard in most processing labs rather than the dedicated machines required by kodachrome fujis films soon also found a competitive edge in higherspeed negative films with a tighter grain structure in may  kodak filed a petition with the us commerce department under section  of the commerce act arguing that its poor performance in the japanese market was a direct result

new consumer merchandisers apples pioneering quicktake consumer digital cameras introduced in  had the apple label but were produced by kodak the dc and dc launched in  overall though there was little implementation of the new digital strategy kodaks core business faced no pressure from competing technologies and as kodak executives could not fathom a world without traditional film there was little incentive to deviate from that course consumers gradually switched to the digital offering from companies such as sony in  film sales dropped which was attributed by kodak to the financial shocks caused by the september  attacks executives hoped that kodak might be able to slow the shift to digital through aggressive marketing under daniel carp fishers successor as ceo kodak made its move in the digital camera market with its easyshare family of digital cameras kodak spent tremendous resources studying customer behavior finding out that women in particular loved taking digital photos but were frustrated in moving them to their computers this key unmet consumer need became a major opportunity once kodak got its product development machine started it released a wide range of products

jobs as it outsourced its manufacturing pérez invested heavily in digital technologies and new services that capitalized on its technology innovation to boost profit margins he also spent hundreds of millions of dollars to build up a highmargin printer ink business to replace shriveling film sales kodaks ink strategy rejected the razor and blades business model used by the dominant market leader hewlettpackard in that kodaks printers were expensive but the ink was cheaper as of  these new lines of inkjet printers were said to be on verge of turning a profit although some analysts were skeptical as printouts had been replaced gradually by electronic copies on computers tablets and smartphones home photograph printers highspeed commercial inkjet presses workflow software and packaging were viewed as the companys new core businesses with sales from those four businesses projected to double to nearly  billion in revenue in  and account for  of all sales however while kodak named home printers as a core business as late as august  at the end of september declining sales forced kodak to announce an exit from the consumer inkjet market kodak has also turned to litigation

to consumer complaints submitted by them in prior years kodak responded by offering consumers an adjustment or an explanation of the company’s position the bbb file contains consumer complaints of problems with repairs of kodak digital cameras as well as difficulty communicating with kodak customer service among other complaints consumers say that their cameras broke and they were charged for repairs when the failure was not the result of any damage or abuse some say their cameras failed again after being repaired kodak said its customer service and customer privacy teams concluded that  of all complaints forwarded by the bbb already were handled directly with the customer brian o’connor kodak chief privacy officer said the company was surprised by the news release distributed by the better business bureau it is inaccurate in the facts presented as well as those the bbb chose to omit ironically we ultimately decided to resign our membership because we were extremely unhappy with the customer service we received from the local office of the bbb after years of unproductive discussions with the local office regarding their web site postings about kodak which in our view were consistently inaccurate we came to the conclusion that their process added no value to our own our commitment to our customers is unwavering that will not change what has changed is that for us the bbbs customer complaint process has become redundant given the multiple and immediate ways that customers have to address their concerns directly with kodak patent litigationedit in  apple filed a

kodak was founded by george eastman and henry a strong on september   during most of the th century kodak held a dominant position in photographic film the companys ubiquity was such that its kodak moment tagline entered the common lexicon to describe a personal event that was demanded to be recorded for posterity kodak began to struggle financially in the late s as a result of the decline in sales of photographic film and its slowness in transitioning to digital photography as a part of a turnaround strategy kodak began to focus on digital photography and digital printing and attempted to

making large margins from consumables – film chemicals and paper as late as  kodak commanded  of film sales and  of camera sales in the us rivalry with fujifilmedit japanese competitor fujifilm entered the us market via fuji photo film usa with lowerpriced film and supplies but kodak did not believe that american consumers would ever desert its brand kodak passed on the opportunity to become the official film of the  los angeles olympics fuji won these sponsorship rights which gave it a permanent foothold in the marketplace fuji opened a film plant in the us and its aggressive marketing and price cutting began taking market share from kodak fuji went from a  share in the early s to  in  fuji also made headway into the professional market with specialty transparency films such as velvia and provia which competed successfully with kodaks signature professional product kodachrome but used the more economical and common e processing machines which were standard in most processing labs rather than the dedicated machines required by kodachrome fujis films soon also found a competitive edge in higherspeed negative films with a tighter grain structure in may  kodak filed a petition with the us commerce department under section  of the commerce act arguing that its poor performance in the japanese market was a direct result of unfair practices adopted by fuji the complaint was lodged by the united states with the world trade organization on january   the wto announced a sweeping rejection of kodaks complaints about the film market in japan kodaks financial results for the year ending december  showed that companys revenues dropped from  billion in  to  billion in  a fall of more than  its net earnings went from  billion to just  million for the same period kodaks market share declined from  to  in the united states a oneyear drop of five percentage points that had observers suggesting that kodak was slow to react to changes and underestimated its rivals although from the s both fuji and kodak recognized the upcoming threat of digital photography and although both sought diversification as a mitigation strategy fuji was more successful at diversification shift to digitaledit the kodak k logo was introduced in  the version seen here – with the kodak name in a more modern typeface – was used from  until the logos discontinuation in  a revised version was reintroduced in  kodak logo from  to  although kodak developed a digital camera in  the first of its kind the product was dropped for fear it would threaten kodaks photographic film business in the s kodak planned a decadelong journey to move to digital technology ceo george m c fisher reached outclarification needed to microsoft and other new consumer merchandisers apples pioneering quicktake consumer digital cameras introduced in  had the apple label but were produced by kodak the dc and dc launched in  overall though there was little implementation of the new digital strategy kodaks core business faced no pressure from competing technologies and as kodak executives could not fathom a world without traditional film there was little incentive to deviate from that course consumers gradually switched to the digital offering from companies such as sony in  film sales dropped which was attributed by kodak to the financial shocks caused by the september  attacks executives hoped that kodak might be able to slow the shift to digital through aggressive marketing under daniel carp fishers successor as ceo kodak made its move in the digital camera market with its easyshare family of digital cameras kodak spent tremendous resources studying customer behavior finding out that women in particular loved taking digital photos but were frustrated in moving them to their computers this key unmet consumer need became a major opportunity once kodak got its product development machine started it released a wide range of products which made it easy to share photos via pcs one of their key innovations was a printer dock where consumers could insert their cameras into this compact device press a button and watch their photos roll out by  kodak ranked no  in the us in digital camera sales that surged  to  billion despite the high growth kodak failed to anticipate how fast digital cameras became commodities with low profit margins as more companies entered the market in the mids in  kodak held the no  spot in us digital camera sales behind sony but it lost  on every camera sold while there was also a dispute between employees from its digital and film divisions the film business where kodak enjoyed high profit margins fell  in  the combination of these two factors resulted in disappointing profits overall its digital cameras soon became undercut by asian competitors that could produce their offerings more cheaply kodak had a  marketleading share in  that dwindled to  by  in  kodak was no  in us digital camera sales with a  share and by  it held  in seventh place behind canon sony nikon and others according to research firm idc also an eversmaller percentage of digital pictures were being taken on dedicated digital cameras being gradually displaced in the late s by cameras on cellphones smartphones and tablets new strategyedit the decline of camera film to digital greatly affected kodaks business kodaks main headquarters in rochester new york kodak then began a strategy shift previously kodak had done everything inhouse but ceo antonio pérez shut down film factories and eliminated  jobs as it outsourced its manufacturing pérez invested heavily in digital technologies and new services that capitalized on its technology innovation to boost profit margins he also spent hundreds of millions of dollars to build up a highmargin printer ink business to replace shriveling film sales kodaks ink strategy rejected the razor and blades business model used by the dominant market leader hewlettpackard in that kodaks printers were expensive but the ink was cheaper as of  these new lines of inkjet printers were said to be on verge of turning a profit although some analysts were skeptical as printouts had been replaced gradually by electronic copies on computers tablets and smartphones home photograph printers highspeed commercial inkjet presses workflow software and packaging were viewed as the companys new core businesses with sales from those four businesses projected to double to nearly  billion in revenue in  and account for  of all sales however while kodak named home printers as a core business as late as august  at the end of september declining sales forced kodak to announce an exit from the consumer inkjet market kodak has also turned to litigation in order to generate revenue in  it received  million from patent licensing that included a settlement with lg in  despite the turnaround progress kodak rapidly used up its cash reserves stoking fears of bankruptcy it had  million in cash in june  down from  billion in january  in  kodak reportedly explored selling off or licensing its vast portfolio of patents in order to stave off bankruptcy by january  analysts suggested that the company could enter bankruptcy followed by an auction of its patents as it was reported to be in talks with citigroup to provide debtorinpossession financing this was confirmed on january   when the company filed for chapter  bankruptcy protection and obtained a  million month credit facility from citigroup to enable it to continue operations under the terms of its bankruptcy protection kodak had a deadline of

order to work fulltime at the eastman dry plate company  the eastmanstrong partnership was dissolved and the eastman dry plate and film company formed with  shareowners the eastman dry plate company was responsible for the first cameras suitable for non expert use  george eastman bought david houstons patents for roll film and developed them further these were the basis for the invention of motion picture film as used by early filmmakers and thomas edison september   eastman registered the trademark kodak  the first model of the kodak camera appeared it took round pictures  cm  in in diameter was of the fixed focus type and carried a roll of film enough for  exposures its invention practically marked the advent of amateur photography as before that time both apparatus and processes were too burdensome to classify photography as recreation the roll film used in the first model of the kodak camera had a paper base but was soon superseded by a film with a cellulose base a practical transparent flexible film the first films had to be loaded into the camera and unloaded in the dark room but the film cartridge system with its protecting strip of opaque paper made it possible to load and unload the camera in ordinary light the kodak developing machine  and its simplified successor the kodak film tank provided the means for daylight development of film making the dark room unnecessary for any of the operations of amateur photography the earlier types of the kodak cameras were of the box form and of fixed focus and as various sizes were added devices for focusing the lenses were incorporated  the eastman company was formed  george eastman began to produce a second line of cameras the ordinary range  it was renamed the eastman kodak company in  eastman

photo film usa with lowerpriced film and supplies but kodak did not believe that american consumers would ever desert its brand kodak passed on the opportunity to become the official film of the  los angeles olympics fuji won these sponsorship rights which gave it a permanent foothold in the marketplace fuji opened a film plant in the us and its aggressive marketing and price cutting began taking market share from kodak fuji went from a  share in the early s to  in  fuji also made headway into the professional market with specialty transparency films such as velvia and provia which competed successfully with kodaks signature professional product kodachrome but used the more economical and common e processing machines which were standard in most processing labs rather than the dedicated machines required by kodachrome fujis films soon also found a competitive edge in higherspeed negative films with a tighter grain structure in may  kodak filed a petition with the us commerce department under section  of the commerce act arguing that its poor performance in the japanese market was a direct result of unfair practices adopted by fuji the complaint was lodged by the united states with the world trade organization on january   the wto announced a sweeping rejection of kodaks complaints about the film market in japan kodaks financial results for the year ending december

journey to move to digital technology ceo george m c fisher reached outclarification needed to microsoft and other new consumer merchandisers apples pioneering quicktake consumer digital cameras introduced in  had the apple label but were produced by kodak the dc and dc launched in  overall though there was little implementation of the new digital strategy kodaks core business faced no pressure from competing technologies and as kodak executives could not fathom a world without traditional film there was little incentive to deviate from that course consumers gradually switched to the digital offering from companies such as sony in  film sales dropped which was attributed by kodak to the financial shocks caused by the september  attacks executives hoped that kodak might be able to slow the shift to digital through aggressive marketing under daniel carp fishers successor as ceo kodak made its move in the digital camera market with its easyshare family of digital cameras kodak spent tremendous resources studying customer behavior finding out that women in particular loved taking digital photos but were frustrated in moving them to their computers this key unmet consumer need became a major opportunity once kodak got its product development machine started it released a wide range of products which made it easy to share photos via pcs one of their key innovations was a printer dock where consumers could insert their cameras into this compact device press a button and watch their photos roll out by  kodak ranked no  in the us in digital camera sales that surged  to  billion despite the high growth kodak failed to anticipate how fast digital cameras became commodities with low profit margins as more companies entered the market in the mids in  kodak held the no  spot in us digital camera sales behind sony but it lost  on every camera sold while there was also a dispute between employees from its digital and film divisions the film business where kodak enjoyed high profit margins fell  in  the combination of these two factors resulted in disappointing profits overall its digital cameras soon became undercut by asian competitors that could produce their

shift previously kodak had done everything inhouse but ceo antonio pérez shut down film factories and eliminated  jobs as it outsourced its manufacturing pérez invested heavily in digital technologies and new services that capitalized on its technology innovation to boost profit margins he also spent hundreds of millions of dollars to build up a highmargin printer ink business to replace shriveling film sales kodaks ink strategy rejected the razor and blades business model used by the dominant market leader hewlettpackard in that kodaks printers were expensive but the ink was cheaper as of  these new lines of inkjet printers were said to be on verge of turning a profit although some analysts were skeptical as printouts had been replaced gradually by electronic copies on computers tablets and smartphones home photograph printers highspeed commercial inkjet presses workflow software and packaging were viewed as the companys new core businesses with sales from those four businesses projected to double to nearly  billion in revenue in  and account for  of all sales however while kodak named home printers as a core business as late as august  at the end of september declining sales forced kodak to announce an exit from the consumer inkjet market kodak has also turned to litigation in order to generate revenue in  it received  million from patent licensing that included a settlement with lg in  despite the turnaround progress kodak rapidly used up its cash reserves stoking fears of bankruptcy it had  million in cash in june  down from  billion in january  in  kodak

fujifilmedit japanese competitor fujifilm entered the us market via fuji photo film usa with lowerpriced film and supplies but kodak did not believe that american consumers would ever desert its brand kodak passed on the opportunity to become the official film of the  los angeles olympics fuji won these sponsorship rights which gave it a permanent foothold in the marketplace fuji opened a film plant in the us and its aggressive marketing and price cutting began taking market share from kodak fuji went from a  share in the early s to  in  fuji also made headway into the professional market with specialty transparency films such as velvia and provia which competed successfully with kodaks signature professional product kodachrome but used the more economical and common e processing machines which were standard in most processing labs rather than the dedicated machines required by kodachrome fujis films soon also found a competitive edge in higherspeed negative films with a tighter grain structure in may  kodak filed a petition with the us commerce department under section  of the commerce act arguing that its poor performance in the japanese market was a direct result of unfair practices adopted by fuji the complaint was lodged by the united states with the world trade organization on january   the wto announced a sweeping rejection of kodaks complaints about the

react to changes and underestimated its rivals although from the s both fuji and kodak recognized the upcoming threat of digital photography and although both sought diversification as a mitigation strategy fuji was more successful at diversification shift to digitaledit the kodak k logo was introduced in  the version seen here – with the kodak name in a more modern typeface – was used from  until the logos discontinuation in  a revised version was reintroduced in  kodak logo from  to  although kodak developed a digital camera in  the first of its kind the product was dropped for fear it would threaten kodaks photographic film business in the s kodak planned a decadelong journey to move to digital technology ceo george m c fisher reached outclarification needed to microsoft and other new consumer merchandisers apples pioneering quicktake consumer digital cameras introduced in  had the apple label but were produced by kodak the dc and dc launched in  overall though there was little implementation of the new digital strategy kodaks core business faced no pressure from competing technologies and as kodak executives could not fathom a world without traditional film there was little incentive to deviate from that course consumers gradually switched to the digital offering from companies such as sony in  film sales dropped which was attributed by kodak to the financial shocks caused by the september  attacks executives hoped that kodak might be able to slow the shift to digital through aggressive marketing under daniel carp fishers successor as ceo kodak made its move in the digital camera market with its easyshare family of digital cameras kodak spent tremendous resources studying customer behavior finding out that women in particular loved taking digital photos but were frustrated in moving them to their computers this key unmet consumer need became a major opportunity once kodak got its product development machine started it released a wide range of products which made it easy to share photos via pcs one of their key innovations was a printer dock where consumers could insert their cameras into this compact device press a button and watch their photos roll out by  kodak ranked no  in the us in digital camera sales that surged  to  billion despite the high growth kodak failed to anticipate how fast digital cameras became commodities with low profit margins as more companies entered the market in the mids in  kodak held the no  spot in us digital camera sales behind sony but it lost  on every camera sold while there was also a dispute between employees from its digital and film divisions the film business where kodak enjoyed high profit margins fell  in  the combination of these two factors resulted in disappointing profits overall its

jobs as it outsourced its manufacturing pérez invested heavily in digital technologies and new services that capitalized on its technology innovation to boost profit margins he also spent hundreds of millions of dollars to build up a highmargin printer ink business to replace shriveling film sales kodaks ink strategy rejected the razor and blades business model used by the dominant market leader hewlettpackard in that kodaks printers were expensive but the ink was cheaper as of  these new lines of inkjet printers were said to be on verge of turning a profit although some analysts were skeptical as printouts had been replaced gradually by electronic copies on computers tablets and smartphones home photograph printers highspeed commercial inkjet presses workflow software and packaging were viewed as the companys new core businesses with sales from those four businesses projected to double to nearly  billion in revenue in  and account for  of all sales however while kodak named home printers as a core business as late as august  at the end of september declining sales forced kodak to announce an exit from the consumer inkjet market kodak has also turned to litigation in order to generate revenue in  it received  million from patent licensing that included a settlement with lg in  despite the turnaround progress kodak rapidly used up its cash reserves stoking fears of bankruptcy it had  million in cash in june  down from  billion in january  in  kodak reportedly explored selling off or licensing its vast portfolio of patents in order to stave off bankruptcy by

of all complaints forwarded by the bbb already were handled directly with the customer brian o’connor kodak chief privacy officer said the company was surprised by the news release distributed by the better business bureau it is inaccurate in the facts presented as well as those the bbb chose to omit ironically we ultimately decided to resign our membership because we were extremely unhappy with the customer service we received from the local office of the bbb after years of unproductive discussions with the local office regarding their web site postings about kodak which in our view were consistently inaccurate we came to the conclusion that their process added no value to our own our commitment to our customers is unwavering that will not change what has changed is that for us the bbbs customer complaint process has become redundant given the multiple and immediate ways that customers have to address their concerns directly with kodak patent litigationedit in  apple filed a

lowerpriced film and supplies but kodak did not believe that american consumers would ever desert its brand kodak passed on the opportunity to become the official film of the  los angeles olympics fuji won these sponsorship rights which gave it a permanent foothold in the marketplace fuji opened a film plant in the us and its aggressive marketing and price cutting began taking market share from kodak fuji went from a  share in the early s to  in  fuji also made headway into the professional market with specialty transparency films such as velvia and provia which competed successfully with kodaks signature professional product kodachrome but used the more economical and common e processing machines which were standard in most processing labs rather than the dedicated machines required by kodachrome fujis films soon also found a competitive edge in higherspeed negative films with a tighter grain structure in may  kodak filed a petition with the us commerce department under section  of the commerce act arguing that its poor performance in the japanese market was a direct result of unfair practices adopted by fuji the complaint was lodged by the united states with the world trade

revenues dropped from  billion in  to  billion in  a fall of more than  its net earnings went from  billion to just  million for the same period kodaks market share declined from  to  in the united

the upcoming threat of digital photography and although both sought diversification as a mitigation strategy fuji was more successful at diversification shift to digitaledit the kodak k logo was introduced in  the version seen here – with the kodak name in a more modern typeface – was used from  until the logos discontinuation in  a revised version was reintroduced in  kodak logo from  to  although kodak developed a digital camera in  the first of its kind the product was dropped for fear it would threaten kodaks photographic film business in the s kodak planned a decadelong journey to move to digital technology ceo george m c fisher reached outclarification needed to microsoft and other new consumer merchandisers apples pioneering quicktake consumer digital cameras introduced in  had the apple label but were produced by kodak the dc and dc launched in  overall though there was little implementation of the new digital strategy kodaks core business faced no pressure from competing technologies and as kodak executives could not fathom a world without traditional film there was little incentive to deviate from that course consumers gradually switched to the digital offering from companies such as sony in  film sales dropped which was attributed by kodak to the financial shocks caused by the september  attacks executives hoped that kodak might be able to slow the shift to digital through aggressive marketing under daniel carp fishers successor as ceo kodak made its move in the digital camera market with its easyshare family of digital cameras kodak spent tremendous resources studying customer behavior finding out that women in particular loved taking digital photos but were frustrated in moving them to their computers this key unmet consumer need became a major opportunity once kodak got its product development machine started it released a wide range of products which made it easy to share photos via pcs one of their key innovations was a printer dock where consumers could insert their cameras into this compact device press a button and watch their photos roll out by  kodak ranked no  in the us in digital camera sales that surged  to  billion despite the high growth kodak failed to anticipate how fast digital cameras became commodities with low profit margins as more companies entered the market in the mids in  kodak held the no  spot in us digital camera sales behind sony but it lost  on every camera sold while there was also a dispute between employees from its digital and film divisions the film business where kodak enjoyed high profit margins fell  in  the combination of these two factors resulted in disappointing profits overall its digital cameras soon became undercut by asian competitors that could produce their

shift previously kodak had done everything inhouse but ceo antonio pérez shut down film factories and eliminated  jobs as it outsourced its manufacturing pérez invested heavily in digital technologies and new services that capitalized on its technology innovation to boost profit margins he also spent hundreds of millions of dollars to build up a highmargin printer ink business to replace shriveling film sales kodaks ink strategy rejected the razor and blades business model used by the dominant market leader hewlettpackard in that kodaks printers were expensive but the ink was cheaper as of  these new lines of inkjet printers were said to be on verge of turning a profit although some analysts were skeptical as printouts had been replaced gradually by electronic copies on computers tablets and smartphones home photograph printers highspeed commercial inkjet presses workflow software and packaging were viewed as the companys new core businesses with sales from those four businesses projected to double to nearly  billion in revenue in  and account for  of all sales however while kodak named home printers as a core business as late as august  at the end of september declining sales forced kodak to announce an exit from the consumer inkjet market kodak has also turned to litigation in order to generate revenue in  it received  million from patent licensing that included a

consumers an adjustment or an explanation of the company’s position the bbb file contains consumer complaints of problems with repairs of kodak digital cameras as well as difficulty communicating with kodak customer service among other complaints consumers say that their cameras broke and they were charged for repairs when the failure was not the result of any damage or abuse some say their cameras failed again after being repaired kodak said its customer service and customer privacy teams concluded that  of all complaints forwarded by the bbb already were handled directly with the customer brian o’connor kodak chief privacy officer said the company was surprised by the news release distributed by the better business bureau it is inaccurate in the facts presented as well as those the bbb chose to omit ironically we ultimately decided to resign our membership because we were extremely unhappy with the customer service we received from the local office of the bbb after years of unproductive discussions with the local office regarding their web site postings about kodak which in our view were consistently inaccurate we came to the conclusion that their process added no value to our own our commitment to our customers is unwavering that will not change what has changed is that for us the bbbs customer complaint process has become redundant given the multiple and immediate
