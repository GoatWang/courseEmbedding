timeas i was recovering from my own surgery rushing out of the house to sit at an urgent care center was just not an option i contacted pediaq and within minutes i got a response soon after a friendly and knowledgeable nurse arrived she came complete with what seemed to be a full doctors office worth of supplies and equipment in her bag ready to take on anything i even received a personalized text the next day following up i highly recommend pediaq they saved the day  jennifer dallas we had absolutely the best experience possible on our first visit i put in a request received a phone call from my nurse within  minutes letting me know when she would arrive she an experienced pediatric nurse practitioner arrived as expected examined my child diagnosed her quickly and put in the script to the pharmacy no leaving the house when my girl felt so bad no waiting waiting waiting some more at a yucky dirty clinic i cant say enough about how positive our experience was my husband and daughter were really impressed too  brandi dallas this service is a life changer with in  minutes of initially downloading this app our nurse had come and gone if i had gone to urgent care i may have still been waiting in a waiting room exposing my other healthy child to illnesses there our nurse treated our son with meds she had on hand no pharmacy hassle and was so helpful informative but most of all kind she immediately took to our son offering him comfort and was sweet and loving my son was cooperative and at ease since he was in his own home surrounded by his toys during his exam cannot recommend this enough im hooked thank you to whomever created this app and to all pediaqs employees its a life saver  anne dallas pediaq was prompt and very professional the nurse was excellent with my daughter and even gave her a little teddy bear which has not left my daughters side even went to to game with us its hard to see us  in the future choosing to get all kids out including the one whos sick and waiting in drs office instead of bringing the knowledgeable nurse directly to my child at home pediaq is the way to go  cheri dallas i had the opportunity to use pediaq today and had a wonderful experience my daughter had been up all night sick and we couldnt get in to see our pediatrician today so i gave it a shot within minutes of making a request via the app a nurse practitioner called to get details about what was going on she arrived shortly after and did a full examination of my sick little girl while she was laying on our sofa still comfy in her pjs the pediaq np even brought her a q bear sweet little teddy bear to help break the ice that my daughter loves and hasnt put down since heres the best part not only did she call in our prescription she went to pick it up for us with my husband traveling  sick kiddo trying to make dinner for my other kiddo and it pouring rain i was beyond thankful thank you pediaq we will definitely use your service again hopefully not too soon
