certain services like paying  when you visit your gp or a  copay for an emergency room visit once you reach your outofpocket maximum which will differ if youre an individual or within a family plan

appointmentmost doctors require a phone call for an appointment although some may provide online scheduling as well be sure to have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment and to bring it with you to the actual appointment they need the id numbers to verify your coverage and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you dont have to show it again unless your insurance changeswhen you call let them know if youre a new patient as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit tell them the reason for your visit such as your symptoms if youre feeling sick its also important to inform them if you have medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit like current medications or medical recordsfrom here the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you during your call its important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit this information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect your appointment may progress faster as a result and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for yourisksdoctors see a number of patients in a day sometimes in minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand this can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations and they can end up missing certain problem indicators while some problems like a cold or flu can be diagnosed in this time more complex ailments require attention which takes up time reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demandsurgery has some more dire risks attached to it so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure if a patient has a reaction to anesthesia it can cause very serious complications but this is an uncommon occurrence blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery often caused by inactivity during recovery infections numbness scarring swelling and death are all possible but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery youre undergoing talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potentialaftercaresurgery affects people in different ways but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia youll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have the nurse will tell you how the procedure went what effect it will have on your condition what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal if you start feeling pain the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse when possible its also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs this can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot some surgeries are outpatient procedures where people are released the same day for major surgeries patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bringrecovery and followupyour recovery time and followup expectations will vary depending on your procedure for example you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heartvalve surgery your surgeon will give you a list of things that youll need to do during this time including what medications to take and when youll be able to get back to work and other activitiesevery surgery will have a followup call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health if you have a major operation like heart surgery its important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected these appointments will give you peace of mind about your

holdens involvement in exports has fluctuated since the s the declining sales of large cars in australia led the company to look to international markets to increase profitability since  holden has

throughout the s holden also supplied tramcars to the melbourne  metropolitan tramways board of which several examples have been preserved in both australia and new zealand sedit the holden  utility launched in  three years after the  sedan holdens second fullscale car factory located in fishermans bend port melbourne was completed in  with construction beginning in  on a new plant in pagewood new south wales however world war ii delayed car production with efforts shifted to the construction of vehicle bodies field guns aircraft and engines before the war ended the australian government took steps to encourage an australian automotive industry both gm and ford provided studies to the australian government outlining the production of the first australiandesigned car fords proposal was the governments first choice but required substantial financial assistance gms study was ultimately chosen because of its low level of government intervention after the war holden returned to producing vehicle bodies this time for buick chevrolet pontiac and vauxhall the oldsmobile ace was also produced from  to  from here holden continued to pursue the goal of producing an australian car this involved compromise with gm as holdens managing director laurence hartnett favoured development of a local design while gm preferred to see an american design as the basis for australias own car in the end the design was based on a previously rejected postwar chevrolet proposal the holden was launched in  creating long waiting lists extending through  and beyond the name holden was chosen in honour of sir edward holden the companys first chairman and grandson of ja holden other names considered were gem austral melba woomerah boomerang emu and canbra a phonetic spelling of canberra although officially designated  the car was marketed simply as the holden the unofficial usage of the name fx originated within holden referring to the updated suspension on the  of  sedit holdens fc series was the first to be tested at the lang lang proving ground during the s holden dominated the australian car market gm invested heavily in production capacity which allowed the company to meet increased postwar demand for motor cars less expensive fourcylinder cars did not offer holdens ability to deal with rugged rural areas  sedans were produced in parallel with the  coupé utility from  the latter was known colloquially as the ute and became ubiquitous in australian rural areas as the workhorse of choice production of both the utility and sedan continued with minor changes until  when they were replaced by the facelifted fj model introducing a third panel van body style the fj was the first major change to the holden since its  introduction over time it gained iconic status and remains one of australias most recognisable automotive symbols a new horizontally slatted grille dominated the frontend of the fj which received various other trim and minor mechanical revisions in  holden began exporting the fj to new zealand although little changed from the  marketing campaigns and price cuts kept fj sales steady until a completely redesigned model was launched at the  australian international motor show in sydney holden paid homage to the fj with the efijy concept car holdens next model the fe launched in  offered in a new station wagon body style dubbed station sedan in the companys sales literature in the same year holden commenced exports to malaya thailand and north borneo strong sales continued in australia and holden achieved a market share of more than  percent in  with the revised fc model this was the first holden to be tested on the new holden proving ground based in lang lang victoria  saw holdens export markets grow to  countries with new additions including indonesia hong kong singapore fiji sudan the east africa region and south africa indonesian market cars were assembled locally by pt udatin the opening of the dandenong victoria production facility in  brought further jobs by  holden employed  workers countrywide in  complete knock down assembly began in south africa and indonesia sedit in  holden introduced its third major new model the fb the cars style was inspired by s chevrolets with tailfins and a wraparound windshield with dog leg apillars by the time it was introduced many considered the appearance dated much of the motoring industry at the time noted that the adopted style did not translate well to the more compact holden the fb became the first holden that was adapted for lefthanddrive markets enhancing its export potential and as such was exported to new caledonia new hebrides the philippines and hawaii the ek of  was holdens response to the ford falcon with the availability of automatic transmission in  ford unveiled the new falcon in australia only months after its introduction in the united states to holdens advantage the falcon was not durable particularly in the front suspension making it illsuited for australian conditions in response to the falcon holden introduced the facelifted ek series in  the new model featured twotone paintwork and optional hydramatic automatic transmission a restyled ej series came in  debuting the new luxury oriented premier model the eh update came a year later bringing the new red motor providing better performance than the previous grey motor the hd series of  saw the introduction of the powerglide automatic transmission at the same time an x performance option with a more powerful version of the cubicinch  l sixcylinder engine was made available in  the hr was introduced including changes in the form of new front and rear styling and highercapacity engines more significantly the hr fitted standard front seat belts holden thus became the first australian automaker to provide the safety device as standard equipment across all models this coincided with the completion of the production plant in acacia ridge queensland by  holden was exporting cars to africa the middle east southeast asia the pacific islands and the caribbean holden began assembling the compact ha series vauxhall viva in  this was superseded by the holden torana in  a development of the viva ending vauxhall production in australia holden offered the lc a torana with new styling in  with the availability of holdens sixcylinder engine in the development days the sixcylinder torana was reserved for motor racing but research had shown that there was a business case for such a model the lc torana was the first application of holdens new threespeed trimatic automatic transmission this was the result of holdens a million transformation of the woodville south australia factory for its production the iconic holden monaro coupé introduced in  and based on the mainstream kingswood has since gained a cult following holdens association with the manufacture of chevrolets and pontiacs ended in  coinciding with the year of holdens next major new model the hk  this included holdens first v engine a chevrolet engine imported from canada models based on the hk series included an extendedlength prestige model the brougham and a twodoor coupé the monaro the mainstream holden special was rebranded the kingswood and the basic fleet model the standard became the belmont on  march  alexander rhea managing director of general motorsholdens at the time was joined by press photographers and the federal minister of shipping and transport ian sinclair as the two men drove the two millionth holden an hk brougham off the production line this came just over half a decade since the one millionth car an ej premier sedan rolled off the dandenong line on  october  following the chevrolet v fitted to the hk the first australiandesigned and massproduced v the holden v engine debuted in the hurricane concept of  before fitment to facelifted ht model this was available in two capacities  cubic inches  l and  cubic inches  l late in ht production use of the new trimatic automatic transmission first seen in the lc torana was phased in as powerglide stock was exhausted but holdens official line was that the hg of  was the first fullsize holden to receive it holdens hx pictured was an evolution of the recordselling hq with more than  units shifted throughout the cars lifetime despite the arrival of serious competitors—namely the ford falcon chrysler valiant and japanese cars—in the s holdens locally produced large six and eightcylinder cars remained australias topselling vehicles sales were boosted by exporting the kingswood sedan station wagon and utility body styles to indonesia trinidad and tobago pakistan the philippines and south africa in complete knock down form sedit holden launched the new hq series in  at this time the company was producing all of its passenger cars in australia and every model was of australian design however by the end of the decade holden was producing cars based on overseas designs the hq was thoroughly reengineered featuring a perimeter frame and semimonocoque unibody construction other firsts included an allcoil suspension and an extended wheelbase for station wagons while the utilities and panel vans retained the traditional coilleaf suspension configuration the series included the new prestige statesman brand which also had a longer wheelbase replacing the brougham the statesman remains noteworthy because it was not marketed as a holden but rather a statesman the uc holdens final iteration of the torana was replaced by an interim fourcylinder version of the commodore until camira was launched in  the hq framework led to a new generation of twodoor monaros and despite the introduction of the similar sized competitors the hq range became the topselling holden of all time with  units sold in three years  units were exported and  ckd kits were constructed the hq series was facelifted in  with the introduction of the hj heralding new front panel styling and a revised rear fascia this new bodywork was to remain albeit with minor upgrades through the hx and hz series detuned engines adhering to government emission standards were brought in with the hx series whilst the hz brought considerably improved road handling and comfort with the introduction of radial tuned suspension rts as a result of gms toying with the wankel rotary engine as used by mazda of japan an export agreement was initiated in  this involved holden exporting with powertrains hj and later hx series premiers as the mazda roadpacer ap mazda then fitted these cars with the b rotary engine and threespeed automatic transmission production ended in  after just  units sold during the s holden ran an advertising jingle football meat pies kangaroos and holden cars based on the baseball hot dogs apple pies and chevrolet jingle used by chevrolet in the united states also development of the torana continued in with the larger midsized lh series released in  offered only as a fourdoor sedan the lh torana was one of the few cars worldwide engineered to accommodate four sixand eightcylinder engines this trend continued until holden introduced the sunbird in  essentially the fourcylinder torana with a new name designated lx both the sunbird and torana introduced a threedoor hatchback variant a final uc update appeared in  during its production run the torana achieved legendary racing success in australia achieving victories at the mount panorama circuit in bathurst new south wales the commodore premiering in  followed the success of its kingswood forebear becoming holdens bestselling vehicle to date in  holden introduced the compact gemini the australian version of the tcar based on the opel kadett c the gemini was an overseas design developed jointly with isuzu gms japanese affiliate and was powered by a litre fourcylinder engine fast becoming a popular car the gemini rapidly attained sales leadership in its class and the nameplate lived on until  holdens most popular car to date the commodore was introduced in  as the vb the new family car was loosely based on the opel rekord e body shell but with the front from the opel senator grafted to accommodate the larger holden sixcylinder and v engines initially the commodore maintained holdens sales leadership in australia however some of the compromises resulting from the adoption of a design intended for another market hampered the cars acceptance in particular it was narrower than its predecessor and its falcon rival making it less comfortable for three rearseat passengers with the abandonment of lefthand drive markets holden exported almost  commodores to markets such as new zealand thailand hong kong malaysia indonesia malta and singapore holden discontinued the torana in  and the sunbird in  after the  introduction of the commodore the torana became the inbetween car surrounded by the smaller and more economical gemini and the larger more sophisticated commodore the closest successor to the torana was the camira released in  as australias version of gms mediumsized jcar sedit after a good start sales of the camira holdens version of the global jcar platform slumped significantly this placed a huge financial burden on the australian subsidiary which was already operating at a loss at this time the s were challenging for holden and the australian automotive industry the australian government tried to revive the industry with the button car plan which encouraged car makers to focus on producing fewer models at higher more economical volumes and to export cars the decade opened with the shutdown of the pagewood new south wales production plant and introduction of the light commercial rodeo sourced from isuzu in japan the rodeo was available in both two and fourwheel drive chassis cab models with a choice of petrol and diesel powerplants the range was updated in  with the tf series based on the isuzu tf other cars sourced from isuzu during the s were the fourwheel drive jackaroo  the shuttle  van and the piazza  threedoor sports hatchback the second generation holden gemini from  was also based on an isuzu design although its manufacture was undertaken in australia while gm australias commercial vehicle range had originally been mostly based on bedford products these had gradually been replaced by isuzu products this process began in the s and by  holdens commercial vehicle arm no longer offered any bedford products the new holden wb commercial vehicles and the statesman wb limousines were introduced in  however the designs based on the hq and updated hj hx and hz models from the s were less competitive than similar models in fords lineup thus holden abandoned those vehicle classes altogether in  sales of the commodore also fell with the effects of the  energy crisis lessening and for the first time the commodore lost ground to the ford falcon sales in other segments also suffered when competition from ford intensified and other australian manufacturers mitsubishi nissan and toyota gained market share when released in  the camira initially generated good sales which later declined because buyers considered the litre engine underpowered and the cars build and ride quality belowaverage the camira lasted just seven years and contributed to holdens accumulated losses of over a million by the mids the second generation commodore vn calais pictured overcame the previous generations width problems in  holden introduced the vk commodore with significant styling changes from the previous vh the commodore was next updated in  as the vl which had new front and rear styling controversially the vl was powered by the litre nissan rb sixcylinder engine and had a nissanbuilt electronically controlled fourspeed automatic transmission holden even went to court in  to stop local motoring magazine wheels from reporting on the matter the engine change was necessitated by the legal requirement that all new cars sold in australia after  had to consume unleaded petrol because it was unfeasible to convert the existing sixcylinder engine to run on unleaded fuel the nissan engine was chosen as the best engine available however changing exchange rates doubled the cost of the engine and transmission over the life of the vl the decision to opt for a japanesemade transmission led to the closure of the woodville south australia assembly plant confident by the apparent sign of turnaround gm paid off holdens mounted losses of a million on  december  at gm headquarters request holden was then reorganised and recapitalised separating the engine and car manufacturing divisions in the process this involved the splitting of holden into holdens motor company hmc and holdens engine company hec for the most part car bodies were now manufactured at elizabeth south australia with engines as before confined to the fishermans bend plant in port melbourne victoria the engine manufacturing business was successful building fourcylinder family ii engines for use in cars built overseas the final phase of the commodores recovery strategy involved the  vn a significantly wider model powered by the americandesigned australianassembled litre buick v engine holden began to sell the subcompact suzuki swiftbased barina in  the barina was launched concurrently with the suzukisourced holden drover followed by the scurry later on in  in the previous year nissan pulsar hatchbacks were rebadged as the holden astra as a result of a deal with nissan this arrangement ceased in  when holden entered a new alliance with toyota forming a new company united australian automobile industries uaai uaai resulted in holden selling rebadged versions of toyotas corolla and camry as the holden nova and apollo respectively with toyota rebranding the commodore as the lexcen sedit the vs statesmancaprice of  represented a mild facelift of the vr which in turn was an update of the  vq—holdens longwheelbase version of the vn commodore series the company changed throughout the s increasing its australian market share from  percent in  to  percent in  besides manufacturing australias best selling car which was exported in significant numbers holden continued to export many locally produced engines to power cars made elsewhere in this decade holden adopted a strategy of importing cars it needed to offer a full range of competitive vehicles during  general motorsholdens ltd name was shortened to holden ltd on  april  gms new zealand subsidiary holden new zealand announced that production at the assembly plant based in trentham would be phased out and vehicles would be imported dutyfree—this came after the  closure of the petone assembly line due to low output volumes during the s holden other australian automakers and trade unions pressured the australian government to halt the lowering of car import tariffs by  the federal government had already cut tariffs to  percent from  percent ten years earlier by  a plan was formulated to reduce the tariffs to  percent holden was critical saying that australias population was not large enough and that the changes could tarnish the local industry commodore vt introduced in  marked the commodores global expansion holden reintroduced its defunct statesman title in —this time under the holden marque as the statesman and caprice for  holden updated the statesman and caprice with a range of improvements including the introduction of fourwheel antilock brakes abs although a rearwheel system had been standard on the statesman caprice from march  abs was added to the shortwheelbase commodore range in  another returning variant was the fullsize utility and on this occasion it was based on the commodore the vn commodore received a major facelift in  with the vr—compared to the vn approximately  percent of the car model was new exterior changes resulted in a smoother overall body and a twinkidney grille—a commodore styling trait that remained until the  vy model and as of  remains a permanent staple on hsv variants holden introduced the allnew vt commodore in  the outcome of a a million development programme that spanned more than five years the new model featured a rounded exterior body shell improved dynamics and many firsts for an australianbuilt car also a stronger body structure increased crash safety the locally produced buicksourced v engine powered the commodore range as did the litre holden v engine and was replaced in  by the litre ls unit the  holden astra continued holdens trend of sourcing its midsize and smaller model lines from opel in europe the uaai badgeengineered cars first introduced in  sold in far fewer numbers than anticipated but the holden commodore toyota camry and corolla were all successful when sold under their original nameplates the first generation nova and the donor corolla were produced at holdens dandenong victoria facility until  uaai was dissolved in  and holden returned to selling only gm products the holden astra and vectra both designed by opel in germany replaced the toyotasourced holden nova and apollo this came after the  introduction of the opel corsa replacing the already available suzuki swift as the source for the holden barina sales of the fullsize holden suburban suv sourced from chevrolet commenced in —lasting until  also in  local assembly of the vectra began at elizabeth south australia these cars were exported to japan and southeast asia with opel badges however the vectra did not achieve sufficient sales in australia to justify local assembly and reverted to being fully imported in  sedit holdens market surge from the s reversed in the s decade in australia holdens market share dropped from  percent in  to  percent in  from march  holden no longer held the number one sales position in australia losing ground to toyota this overall downturn affected holdens profits the company recorded a combined gain of a million between  and  and a combined loss of a million between  and  factors contributing to the loss included the development of an allnew model the strong australian dollar and the cost of reducing the workforce at the elizabeth plant including the loss of  jobs after the closure of the thirdshift assembly line in  after two years in operation holden fared better in  posting an a million loss this was followed by an a million loss in the  an a million loss in  and a profit of a million in  on  may  holden ltd became gm holden ltd coinciding with the resettling to the new holden headquarters on  salmon street port melbourne victoria the monaro coupé was resurrected in  as a lowvolume niche model unanticipated overseas demand proved otherwise with the monaro selling in the uk as a vauxhall monaro and throughout the united states as the pontiac gto holden caused controversy in  with their holden employee pricing television advertisement which ran between october and december  the campaign publicised for the first time ever all australians can enjoy the financial benefit of holden employee pricing however this did not include a discounted dealer delivery fee and savings on factory fitted options and accessories that employees received at the same time employees were given a further discount between  and  percent on selected models holden revived the monaro coupe in  based on the vt commodore architecture the coupe attracted worldwide attention after being shown as a concept car at australian auto shows the vt commodore received its first major update in  with the vy series a mildly facelifted vz model launched in  introducing the high feature engine this was built at the fishermans bend facility completed in  with a maximum output of  engines per day this has reportedly added a billion to the australian economy exports account for about a million alone after the vz the high feature engine powered the allnew holden commodore ve in contrast to previous models the ve no longer utilised an opelsourced platform adapted both mechanically and in size but was based on the gm zeta platform that was earmarked to become a global rwd architecture until plans were cancelled due to the  global financial crisis holden updated the commodore with the ve series in  holdens first cleansheet design since  throughout the s opel had also been the source of many holden models to increase profitability holden looked to the south korean daewoo brand for replacements after acquiring a  percent stake—worth us million—in the company in  as a representative of gm this was increased to  percent in  but when gm further increased its stake to  percent around the time of its  chapter  reorganisation holdens interest was relinquished and transferred to another undisclosed part of gm the commencement of the holdenbranded daewoo models began with the  holden barina which based on the daewoo kalos replaced the opel corsa as the source of the barina in the same year the viva based on the daewoo lacetti replaced the entrylevel holden astra classic although the newgeneration astra introduced in  continued on the captiva crossover suv came next in  after discontinuing the frontera and jackaroo models in  holden was only left with one allwheel drive model the adventra a commodorebased station wagon the fourth model to be replaced with a south korean alternative was the vectra by the midsize epica in  as a result of the split between gm and isuzu holden lost the rights to use the rodeo nameplate consequently the holden rodeo was facelifted and relaunched as the colorado in  following holdens successful application for a a million government grant to build a localised version of the chevrolet cruze in australia from  holden in  announced that it would initially import the small car unchanged from south korea as the holden cruze following the government grant announcement kevin rudd australias prime minister at the time stated that production would support  new jobs at the elizabeth facility however this failed to take into account holdens previous announcement whereby  jobs would be shed when production of the family ii engine ceased in late  in mid holden sought a further a million in addition to the a million that was already committed by the governments of canberra south australia and victoria to remain viable as a car manufacturer in australia a source close to holden informed the australian news publication that the car company is losing money on every vehicle that it produces and consequently initiated negotiations to reduce employee wages by up to a per week to cut costs following the announcement of  job cuts and an assembly line reduction of   to  cars per day sedit in march  holden was given a  million lifeline by the gillard weatherill and baillieu ministries in return holden planned to inject over  billion into car manufacturing in australia they estimated the new investment package would return around  billion to the australian economy and see gm holden continue making cars in australia until at least  industry minister kim carr confirmed on  july  that talks had been scheduled between the australian government and holden on  august   employees at the elizabeth plant in northern adelaide voted to accept a threeyear wage freeze in order to decrease the chances of the production lines closure in  holdens ultimate survival though depended on continued negotiations with the federal government—to secure funding for the period from  to —and the final decision of the global headquarters in detroit us on  december  general motors announced that holden would cease engine and vehicle manufacturing operations in australia by the end of  as a result  jobs would be lost over four years beyond  holdens australian presence will consist of a national sales company a parts distribution centre and a global design studio in may  gm reversed their decision to abandon the lang lang proving ground and decided to keep it as part of their engineering capability in australia in  holden again began selling a range of opelderived cars comprising the astra vxr and insignia vxr both based on the opc models sold by vauxhall and cascada later that year holden also announced plans to sell the european astra and the korean cruze alongside each other from  in december  belgian entrepreneur guido dumarey commenced negotiations to buy the commodore manufacturing

new zealand limited in an earlier and quite separate operation from holdens in australia although holdens involvement in exports has fluctuated since the s the declining sales of large cars in

james grandson joined the firm in  with an interest in automobiles from there the firm evolved through various partnerships and in  holden  frost moved into the business of minor repairs to car upholstery the company began to produce complete motorcycle sidecar bodies in  and edward experimented with fitting bodies to different types of carriages after  wartime trade restrictions led the company to start fullscale production of vehicle body shells ja holden founded a new company in  holdens motor body builders ltd hmbb specialising in car bodies and utilising a facility on king william street in adelaide holden body badge on a  chevrolet tourer by  hmbb were producing  units per year during this time hmbb was the first company to assemble bodies for ford motor company of

vehicle bodies field guns aircraft and engines before the war ended the australian government took steps to encourage an australian automotive industry both gm and ford provided studies to the australian government outlining the production of the first australiandesigned car fords proposal was the governments first choice but required substantial financial assistance gms study was ultimately chosen because of its low level of government intervention after the war holden returned to producing vehicle bodies this time for buick chevrolet pontiac and vauxhall the oldsmobile ace was also produced from  to  from here holden continued to pursue the goal of producing an australian car this involved compromise with gm as holdens managing director laurence hartnett favoured development of a local design while gm preferred to see an american design as the basis for australias own car in the end the design was based on a previously rejected postwar chevrolet proposal the holden was launched in  creating long waiting lists extending through  and beyond the name holden was chosen in honour of sir edward holden the companys first chairman and grandson of ja holden other names considered were gem austral melba woomerah boomerang emu and canbra a phonetic spelling of canberra although officially designated  the car was marketed simply as the holden the unofficial usage of the name fx originated within holden referring to the updated suspension on the  of  sedit holdens fc series was the first to be tested at the lang lang proving ground during the s holden dominated

the workhorse of choice production of both the utility and sedan continued with minor changes until  when they were replaced by the facelifted fj model introducing a third panel van body style the fj was the first major change to the holden since its  introduction over time it gained iconic status and remains one of australias most recognisable automotive symbols a new horizontally slatted grille dominated the frontend of the fj which received various other trim and minor mechanical revisions in  holden began exporting the fj to new zealand although little changed from the  marketing campaigns and price cuts kept fj sales steady until a completely redesigned model was launched at the  australian international motor show in sydney holden paid homage to the fj with the efijy concept car holdens next model the fe launched in  offered in a new station wagon body style dubbed station sedan in the companys sales literature in the same year holden commenced exports to malaya thailand and north borneo strong sales continued in australia and holden achieved a market share of more than  percent in  with the revised fc model this was the first holden to be tested on the new holden proving

knock down assembly began in south africa and indonesia sedit in  holden introduced its third major new model the fb the cars style was inspired by s chevrolets with tailfins and a wraparound windshield with dog leg apillars by the time it was introduced many considered the appearance dated much of the motoring industry at the time noted that the adopted style did not translate well to the more compact holden the fb became the first holden that was adapted for lefthanddrive markets enhancing its export potential and as such was exported to new caledonia new hebrides the philippines and hawaii the ek of  was holdens response to the ford falcon with the availability of automatic transmission in  ford unveiled the new falcon in australia only months after its introduction in the united states to holdens advantage the falcon was not durable particularly in the front suspension making it illsuited for australian conditions in response to the falcon holden introduced the facelifted ek series in  the new model featured twotone paintwork and optional hydramatic automatic transmission a restyled ej series came in  debuting the new luxury oriented premier model the eh update came a year later bringing the new red motor providing better performance than the previous grey motor the hd series of  saw the introduction of the powerglide automatic transmission at the same time an x performance option with a more powerful version of the cubicinch  l sixcylinder engine was made available in  the hr was introduced including changes in the form of new front and rear styling and highercapacity engines more significantly the hr fitted standard front seat belts holden thus became the first australian automaker to provide the safety device as standard equipment across all models this coincided with the completion of the production plant in acacia ridge queensland by  holden was exporting cars to africa the middle east southeast asia the pacific islands and the caribbean holden began assembling the compact ha series vauxhall viva in  this was superseded by the holden torana in  a development of the viva ending vauxhall production in australia holden offered the lc a torana with new styling in  with the availability of holdens sixcylinder engine in the development days the sixcylinder torana was reserved for motor racing but research had shown that there was a business case for such a model the lc torana was the first application of holdens new threespeed trimatic automatic transmission this was the result of holdens a million transformation of the woodville south australia factory for its production the iconic holden monaro coupé introduced in  and based on the mainstream kingswood has since gained a cult following holdens association with the manufacture of chevrolets and pontiacs ended in  coinciding with the year of holdens next major new model the hk  this included holdens first v engine a chevrolet engine imported from canada models based on the hk series included an extendedlength prestige model the brougham and a twodoor coupé the monaro the mainstream holden special was rebranded the kingswood and the basic fleet model the standard became the belmont on  march  alexander rhea managing director of general motorsholdens at the time was joined by press photographers and the federal minister of shipping and transport ian sinclair as the two men drove the two millionth holden an hk brougham off the production line this came just over half a decade since the one millionth car an ej premier sedan rolled off the dandenong line on  october  following the chevrolet v fitted to the hk the first australiandesigned and massproduced v the holden v engine debuted in the hurricane concept of  before fitment to facelifted ht model this was available in two capacities  cubic inches  l and  cubic inches  l late in ht production use of the new trimatic automatic transmission first seen in the lc torana was phased in as powerglide stock was exhausted but holdens official line was that the hg of  was the first fullsize holden to receive it holdens hx pictured was an evolution of the recordselling hq with more than  units shifted throughout the cars lifetime despite the arrival of serious competitors—namely the ford falcon chrysler valiant and japanese cars—in the s holdens locally produced large six and eightcylinder cars remained australias topselling vehicles sales were boosted by exporting the kingswood sedan station wagon and utility body styles to indonesia trinidad and tobago pakistan the philippines and south africa in complete knock down form sedit holden launched the new hq series in  at this time the company was producing all of its passenger cars in australia and every model was of australian design however by the end of the decade holden was producing cars based on overseas designs the hq was thoroughly reengineered featuring a perimeter frame and semimonocoque unibody construction other firsts included an allcoil suspension and an extended wheelbase for station wagons while the utilities and panel vans retained the traditional coilleaf suspension configuration the series included the new prestige statesman brand which also had a longer wheelbase replacing the brougham the statesman remains noteworthy because it was not marketed as a holden but rather a statesman the uc holdens final iteration of the torana was replaced by an interim fourcylinder version of the commodore until camira was launched in  the hq framework led to a new generation of twodoor monaros and despite the introduction of the similar sized competitors the hq range became the topselling holden of all time with  units sold in three years  units were exported and  ckd kits were constructed the hq series was facelifted in  with the introduction of the hj heralding new front panel styling and a revised rear fascia this new bodywork was to remain albeit with minor upgrades through the hx and hz series detuned engines adhering to government emission standards were brought in with the hx series whilst the hz brought considerably improved road handling and comfort with the introduction of radial tuned suspension rts as a result of gms toying with the wankel rotary engine as used by mazda of japan an export agreement was initiated in  this involved holden exporting with powertrains hj and later hx series premiers as the mazda roadpacer ap mazda then fitted these cars with the b rotary engine and threespeed automatic transmission production ended in  after just  units sold during the s holden ran an advertising jingle football meat pies kangaroos and holden cars based on the baseball hot dogs apple pies and chevrolet jingle used by chevrolet in the united states also development of the torana continued in with the larger midsized lh series released in  offered only as a fourdoor sedan the lh torana was one of the few cars worldwide engineered to accommodate four sixand eightcylinder engines this trend continued until holden introduced the sunbird in  essentially the fourcylinder torana with a new name designated lx both the sunbird and torana introduced a threedoor hatchback variant a final uc update appeared in  during its production run the torana achieved legendary racing success in australia achieving victories at the mount panorama circuit in bathurst new south wales the commodore premiering in  followed the success of its kingswood forebear becoming holdens bestselling vehicle to date in  holden introduced the compact gemini the australian version of the tcar based on the opel kadett c the gemini was an overseas design developed jointly with isuzu gms japanese affiliate and was powered by a litre fourcylinder engine fast becoming a popular car the gemini rapidly attained sales leadership in its class and the nameplate lived on until  holdens most popular car to date the commodore was introduced in  as the vb the new family car was loosely based on the opel rekord e body shell but with the front from the opel senator grafted to accommodate the larger holden sixcylinder and v engines initially the commodore maintained holdens sales leadership in australia however some of the compromises resulting from the adoption of a design intended for another market hampered the cars acceptance in particular it was narrower than its predecessor and its falcon rival making it less comfortable for three rearseat passengers with the abandonment of lefthand drive markets holden exported almost  commodores to markets such as new zealand thailand hong kong malaysia indonesia malta and singapore holden discontinued the torana in  and the sunbird in  after the  introduction of the commodore the torana became the inbetween car surrounded by the smaller and more economical gemini and the larger more sophisticated commodore the closest successor to the torana was the camira released in  as australias version of gms mediumsized jcar sedit after a good start sales of the camira holdens version of the global jcar platform slumped significantly this placed a huge financial burden on the australian subsidiary which was already operating at a loss at this time the s were challenging for holden and the australian automotive industry the australian government tried to revive the industry with the button car plan which encouraged car makers to focus on producing fewer models at higher more economical volumes and to export cars the decade opened with the shutdown of the pagewood new south wales production plant and introduction of the light commercial rodeo sourced from isuzu in japan the rodeo was available in both two and fourwheel drive chassis cab models with a choice of petrol and diesel powerplants the range was updated in  with the tf series based on the isuzu tf other cars sourced from isuzu during the s were the fourwheel drive jackaroo  the shuttle  van and the piazza  threedoor sports hatchback the second generation holden gemini from  was also based on an isuzu design although its manufacture was undertaken in australia while gm australias commercial vehicle range had originally been mostly based on bedford products these had gradually been replaced by isuzu products this process began in the s and by  holdens commercial vehicle arm no longer offered any bedford products the new holden wb commercial vehicles and the statesman wb limousines were introduced in  however the designs based on the hq and updated hj hx and hz models from the s were less competitive than similar models in fords lineup thus holden abandoned those vehicle classes altogether in  sales of the commodore also fell with the effects of the  energy crisis lessening and for the first time the commodore lost ground to the ford falcon sales in other segments also suffered when competition from ford intensified and other australian manufacturers mitsubishi nissan and toyota gained market share when released in  the camira initially generated good sales which later declined because buyers considered the litre engine underpowered and the cars build and ride quality belowaverage the camira lasted just seven years and contributed to holdens accumulated losses of over a million by the mids the second generation commodore vn calais pictured overcame the previous generations width problems in  holden introduced the vk commodore with significant styling changes from the previous vh the commodore was next updated in  as the vl which had new front and rear styling controversially the vl was powered by the litre nissan rb sixcylinder engine and had a nissanbuilt electronically controlled fourspeed automatic transmission holden even went to court in  to stop local motoring magazine wheels from reporting on the matter the engine change was necessitated by the legal requirement that all new cars sold in australia after  had to consume unleaded petrol because it was unfeasible to convert the existing sixcylinder engine to run on unleaded fuel the nissan engine was chosen as the best engine available however changing exchange rates doubled the cost of the engine and transmission over the life of the vl the decision to opt for a japanesemade transmission led to the closure of the woodville south australia assembly plant confident by the apparent sign of turnaround gm paid off holdens mounted losses of a million on  december  at gm headquarters request holden was then reorganised and recapitalised separating the engine and car manufacturing divisions in the process this involved the splitting of holden into holdens motor company hmc and holdens engine company hec for the most part car bodies were now manufactured at elizabeth south australia with engines as before confined to the fishermans bend plant in port melbourne victoria the engine manufacturing business was successful building fourcylinder family ii engines for use in cars built overseas the final phase of the commodores recovery strategy involved the  vn a significantly wider model powered by the americandesigned australianassembled litre buick v engine holden began to sell the subcompact suzuki swiftbased barina in  the barina was launched concurrently with the suzukisourced holden drover followed by the scurry later on in  in the previous year nissan pulsar hatchbacks were rebadged as the holden astra as a result of a deal with nissan this arrangement ceased in  when holden entered a new alliance with toyota forming a new company united australian automobile industries uaai uaai resulted in holden selling rebadged versions of toyotas corolla and camry as the holden nova and apollo respectively with toyota rebranding the commodore as the lexcen sedit the vs statesmancaprice of  represented a mild facelift of the vr which in turn was an update of the  vq—holdens longwheelbase version of the vn commodore series the company changed throughout the s increasing its australian market share from  percent in  to  percent in  besides manufacturing australias best selling car which was exported in significant numbers holden continued to export many locally produced engines to power cars made elsewhere in this decade holden adopted a strategy of importing cars it needed to offer a full range of competitive vehicles during  general motorsholdens ltd name was shortened to holden ltd on  april  gms new zealand subsidiary holden new zealand announced that production at the assembly plant based in trentham would be phased out and vehicles would be imported dutyfree—this came after the  closure of the petone assembly line due to low output volumes during the s holden other australian automakers and trade unions pressured the australian government to halt the lowering of car import tariffs by  the federal government had already cut tariffs to  percent from  percent ten years earlier by  a plan was formulated to reduce the tariffs to  percent holden was critical saying that australias population was not large enough and that the changes could tarnish the local industry commodore vt introduced in  marked the commodores global expansion holden reintroduced its defunct statesman title in —this time under the holden marque as the statesman and caprice for  holden updated the statesman and caprice with a range of improvements including the introduction of fourwheel antilock brakes abs although a rearwheel system had been standard on the statesman caprice from march  abs was added to the shortwheelbase commodore range in  another returning variant was the fullsize utility and on this occasion it was based on the commodore the vn commodore received a major facelift in  with the vr—compared to the vn approximately  percent of the car model was new exterior changes resulted in a smoother overall body and a twinkidney grille—a commodore styling trait that remained until the  vy model and as of  remains a permanent staple on hsv variants holden introduced the allnew vt commodore in  the outcome of a a million development programme that spanned more than five years the new model featured a rounded exterior body shell improved dynamics and many firsts for an australianbuilt car also a stronger body structure increased crash safety the locally produced buicksourced v engine powered the commodore range as did the litre holden v engine and was replaced in  by the litre ls unit the  holden astra continued holdens trend of sourcing its midsize and smaller model lines from opel in europe the uaai badgeengineered cars first introduced in  sold in far fewer numbers than anticipated but the holden commodore toyota camry and corolla were all successful when sold under their original nameplates the first generation nova and the donor corolla were produced at holdens dandenong victoria facility until  uaai was dissolved in  and holden returned to selling only gm products the holden astra and vectra both designed by opel in germany replaced the toyotasourced holden nova and apollo this came after the  introduction of the opel corsa replacing the already available suzuki swift as the source for the holden barina sales of the fullsize holden suburban suv sourced from chevrolet commenced in —lasting until  also in  local assembly of the vectra began at elizabeth south australia these cars were exported to japan and southeast asia with opel badges however the vectra did not achieve sufficient sales in australia to justify local assembly and reverted to being fully imported in  sedit holdens market surge from the s reversed in the s decade in australia holdens market share dropped from  percent in  to  percent in  from march  holden no longer held the number one sales position in australia losing ground to toyota this overall downturn affected holdens profits the company recorded a combined gain of a million between  and  and a combined loss of a million between  and  factors contributing to the loss included the development of an allnew model the strong australian dollar and the cost of reducing the workforce at the elizabeth plant including the loss of  jobs after the closure of the thirdshift assembly line in  after two years in operation holden fared better in  posting an a million loss this was followed by an a million loss in the  an a million loss in  and a profit of a million in  on  may  holden ltd became gm holden ltd coinciding with the resettling to the new holden headquarters on  salmon street port melbourne victoria the monaro coupé was resurrected in  as a lowvolume niche model unanticipated overseas demand proved otherwise with the monaro selling in the uk as a vauxhall monaro and throughout the united states as the pontiac gto holden caused controversy in  with their holden employee pricing television advertisement which ran between october and december  the campaign publicised for the first time ever all australians can enjoy the financial benefit of holden employee pricing however this did not include a discounted dealer delivery fee and savings on factory fitted options and accessories that employees received at the same time employees were given a further discount between  and  percent on selected models holden revived the monaro coupe in  based on the vt commodore architecture the coupe attracted worldwide attention after being shown as a concept car at australian auto shows the vt commodore received its first major update in  with the vy series a mildly facelifted vz model launched in  introducing the high feature engine this was built at the fishermans bend facility completed in  with a maximum output of  engines per day this has reportedly added a billion to the australian economy exports account for about a million alone after the vz the high feature engine powered the allnew holden commodore ve in contrast to previous models the ve no longer utilised an opelsourced platform adapted both mechanically and in size but was based on the gm zeta platform that was earmarked to become a global rwd architecture until plans were cancelled due to the  global financial crisis holden updated the commodore with the ve series in  holdens first cleansheet design since  throughout the s opel had also been the source of many holden models to increase profitability holden looked to the south korean daewoo brand for replacements after acquiring a  percent stake—worth us million—in the company in  as a representative of gm this was increased to  percent in  but when gm further increased its stake to  percent around the time of its  chapter  reorganisation holdens interest was relinquished and transferred to another undisclosed part of gm the commencement of the holdenbranded daewoo models began with the  holden barina which based on the daewoo kalos replaced the opel corsa as the source of the barina in the same year the viva based on the daewoo lacetti replaced the entrylevel holden astra classic although the newgeneration astra introduced in  continued on the captiva crossover suv came next in  after discontinuing the frontera and jackaroo models in  holden was only left with one allwheel drive model the adventra a commodorebased station wagon the fourth model to be replaced with a south korean alternative was the vectra by the midsize epica in  as a result of the split between gm and isuzu holden lost the rights to use the rodeo nameplate consequently the holden rodeo was facelifted and relaunched as the colorado in  following holdens successful application for a a million government grant to build a localised version of the chevrolet cruze in australia from  holden in  announced that it would initially import the small car unchanged from south korea as the holden cruze following the government grant announcement kevin rudd australias prime minister at the time stated that production would support  new jobs at the elizabeth facility however this failed to take into account holdens previous announcement whereby  jobs would be shed when production of the family ii engine ceased in late  in mid holden sought a further a million in addition to the a million that was already committed by the governments of canberra south australia and victoria to remain viable as a car manufacturer in australia a source close to holden informed the australian news publication that the car company is losing money on every vehicle that it produces and consequently initiated negotiations to reduce employee wages by up to a per week to cut costs following the announcement of  job cuts and an assembly line reduction of   to  cars per day sedit in march  holden was given a  million lifeline by the gillard weatherill and baillieu ministries in return holden planned to inject over  billion into car manufacturing in australia they estimated the new investment package would return around  billion to the australian economy and see gm holden continue making cars in australia until at least  industry minister kim carr confirmed on  july  that talks had been scheduled between the australian government and holden on  august   employees at the elizabeth plant in northern adelaide voted to accept a threeyear wage freeze in order to decrease the chances of the production lines closure in  holdens ultimate survival though depended on continued negotiations with the federal government—to secure funding for the period from  to —and the final decision of the global headquarters in detroit us on  december  general motors announced that holden would cease engine and vehicle manufacturing operations in australia by the end of  as a result  jobs would be lost over four years beyond  holdens australian presence will consist of a national sales company a parts distribution centre and a global design studio in may  gm reversed their decision to abandon the lang lang proving ground and decided to keep it as part of their engineering capability in australia in  holden again began selling a range of opelderived cars comprising the astra vxr and insignia vxr both based on the opc models sold by vauxhall and cascada later that year holden also announced plans to sell the european astra and the korean cruze alongside each other from  in december  belgian entrepreneur guido dumarey commenced negotiations to buy the commodore manufacturing

consolidation of car production at elizabeth was completed in  but some assembly operations continued at dandenong until  gm assembly plants were operated in new zealand from  until  by general motors new zealand limited in an earlier and quite separate operation from holdens in australia although holdens involvement in exports has fluctuated since the s the declining sales of large cars in australia led the company to look to international markets to increase profitability since  holden has incurred losses due to the strong australian dollar and government grants have been reduced this lead to the announcement on  december  that holden will cease vehicle and engine production by the end of  however the company will continue to have a large and ongoing presence in australia importing

james grandson joined the firm in  with an interest in automobiles from there the firm evolved through various partnerships and in  holden  frost moved into the business of minor repairs to car upholstery the company began to produce complete motorcycle sidecar bodies in  and edward experimented with fitting bodies to different types of carriages after  wartime trade restrictions led the company to start fullscale production of vehicle body shells ja holden founded a new company in  holdens motor body builders ltd hmbb specialising in car bodies and utilising a facility on king william street in adelaide holden body badge on a  chevrolet tourer by  hmbb were producing  units per year during this time hmbb was the first company to assemble bodies for ford motor company of australia until its geelong plant was completed from  hmbb became the exclusive supplier of car bodies for gm in australia with manufacturing taking place at the new woodville plant these bodies were made to suit a number of chassis imported from manufacturers such as chevrolet and dodge in  general motors australia was established with assembly plants at newstead queensland marrickville new south wales city road melbourne birkenhead south australia and cottesloe western australia utilising bodies produced by holden motor body builders and imported complete knock down ckd chassis in  alone the still independent woodville plant built bodies for austin chrysler desoto morris hillman humber hupmobile and willysoverland as well gm cars the last of this line of business was the assembly of hillman minx sedans in  the great depression led to a substantial downturn in production by holden from  units annually in  to just  units one year later in  general motors purchased holden motor body builders and merged it with general motors australia pty ltd to form general motorsholdens ltd gmh throughout the s holden also supplied tramcars to the melbourne  metropolitan tramways board of which several examples have been preserved in both australia and new zealand sedit the holden  utility launched in  three years after the  sedan holdens second fullscale car factory located in fishermans bend port melbourne was completed in  with construction beginning in  on a new plant in pagewood new south wales however world war ii delayed car production with efforts shifted to the construction of vehicle bodies field guns aircraft and engines before the war ended the australian government took steps to encourage an australian automotive industry both gm and ford provided studies to the australian government outlining the production of the first australiandesigned car fords proposal was the governments first choice but required substantial financial assistance gms study was ultimately chosen because of its low level of government intervention after the war holden returned to producing vehicle bodies this time for buick chevrolet pontiac and vauxhall the oldsmobile ace was also produced from  to  from here holden continued to pursue the goal of producing an australian car this involved compromise with gm as holdens managing director laurence hartnett favoured development of a local design while gm preferred to see an american design as the basis for australias own car in the end the design was based on a previously rejected postwar chevrolet proposal the holden was launched in  creating long waiting lists extending through  and beyond the name holden was chosen in honour of sir edward holden the companys first chairman and grandson of ja holden other names considered were gem austral melba woomerah boomerang emu and canbra a phonetic spelling of canberra although officially designated  the car was marketed simply as the holden the unofficial usage of the name fx originated within holden referring to the updated suspension on the  of  sedit holdens fc series was the first to be tested at the lang lang proving ground during the s holden dominated the australian car market gm invested heavily in production capacity which allowed the company to meet increased postwar demand for motor cars less expensive fourcylinder cars did not offer holdens ability to deal with rugged rural areas  sedans were produced in parallel with the  coupé utility from  the latter was known colloquially as the ute and became ubiquitous in australian rural areas as the workhorse of choice production of both the utility and sedan continued with minor changes until  when they were replaced by the facelifted fj model introducing a third panel van body style the fj was the first major change to the holden since its  introduction over time it gained iconic status and remains one of australias most recognisable automotive symbols a new horizontally slatted grille dominated the frontend of the fj which received various other trim and minor mechanical revisions in  holden began exporting the fj to new zealand although little changed from the  marketing campaigns and price cuts kept fj sales steady until a completely redesigned model was launched at the  australian international motor show in sydney holden paid homage to the fj with the efijy concept car holdens next model the fe launched in  offered in a new station wagon body style dubbed station sedan in the companys sales literature in the same year holden commenced exports to malaya thailand and north borneo strong sales continued in australia and holden achieved a market share of more than  percent in  with the revised fc model this was the first holden to be tested on the new holden proving ground based in lang lang victoria  saw holdens export markets grow to  countries with new additions including indonesia hong kong singapore fiji sudan the east africa region and south africa indonesian market cars were assembled locally by pt udatin the opening of the dandenong victoria production facility in  brought further jobs by  holden employed  workers countrywide in  complete knock down assembly began in south africa and indonesia sedit in  holden introduced its third major new model the fb the cars style was inspired by s chevrolets with tailfins and a wraparound windshield with dog leg apillars by the time it was introduced many considered the appearance dated much of the motoring industry at the time noted that the adopted style did not translate well to the more compact holden the fb became the first holden that was adapted for lefthanddrive markets enhancing its export potential and as such was exported to new caledonia new hebrides the philippines and hawaii the ek of  was holdens response to the ford falcon with the availability of automatic transmission in  ford unveiled the new falcon in australia only months after its introduction in the united states to holdens advantage the falcon was not durable particularly in the front suspension making it illsuited for australian conditions in response to the falcon holden introduced the facelifted ek series in  the new model featured twotone paintwork and optional hydramatic automatic transmission a restyled ej series came in  debuting the new luxury oriented premier model the eh update came a year later bringing the new red motor providing better performance than the previous grey motor the hd series of  saw the introduction of the powerglide automatic transmission at the same time an x performance option with a more powerful version of the cubicinch  l sixcylinder engine was made available in  the hr was introduced including changes in the form of new front and rear styling and highercapacity engines more significantly the hr fitted standard front seat belts holden thus became the first australian automaker to provide the safety device as standard equipment across all models this coincided with the completion of the production plant in acacia ridge queensland by  holden was exporting cars to africa the middle east southeast asia the pacific islands and the caribbean holden began assembling the compact ha series vauxhall viva in  this was superseded by the holden torana in  a development of the viva ending vauxhall production in australia holden offered the lc a torana with new styling in  with the availability of holdens sixcylinder engine in the development days the sixcylinder torana was reserved for motor racing but research had shown that there was a business case for such a model the lc torana was the first application of holdens new threespeed trimatic automatic transmission this was the result of holdens a million transformation of the woodville south australia factory for its production the iconic holden monaro coupé introduced in  and based on the mainstream kingswood has since gained a cult following holdens association with the manufacture of chevrolets and pontiacs ended in  coinciding with the year of holdens next major new model the hk  this included holdens first v engine a chevrolet engine imported from canada models based on the hk series included an extendedlength prestige model the brougham and a twodoor coupé the monaro the mainstream holden special was rebranded the kingswood and the basic fleet model the standard became the belmont on  march  alexander rhea managing director of general motorsholdens at the time was joined by press photographers and the federal minister of shipping and transport ian sinclair as the two men drove the two millionth holden an hk brougham off the production line this came just over half a decade since the one millionth car an ej premier sedan rolled off the dandenong line on  october  following the chevrolet v fitted to the hk the first australiandesigned and massproduced v the holden v engine debuted in the hurricane concept of  before fitment to facelifted ht model this was available in two capacities  cubic inches  l and  cubic inches  l late in ht production use of the new trimatic automatic transmission first seen in the lc torana was phased in as powerglide stock was exhausted but holdens official line was that the hg of  was the first fullsize holden to receive it holdens hx pictured was an evolution of the recordselling hq with more than  units shifted throughout the cars lifetime despite the arrival of serious competitors—namely the ford falcon chrysler valiant and japanese cars—in the s holdens locally produced large six and eightcylinder cars remained australias topselling vehicles sales were boosted by exporting the kingswood sedan station wagon and utility body styles to indonesia trinidad and tobago pakistan the philippines and south africa in complete knock down form sedit holden launched the new hq series in  at this time the company was producing all of its passenger cars in australia and every model was of australian design however by the end of the decade holden was producing cars based on overseas designs the hq was thoroughly reengineered featuring a perimeter frame and semimonocoque unibody construction other firsts included an allcoil suspension and an extended wheelbase for station wagons while the utilities and panel vans retained the traditional coilleaf suspension configuration the series included the new prestige statesman brand which also had a longer wheelbase replacing the brougham the statesman remains noteworthy because it was not marketed as a holden but rather a statesman the uc holdens final iteration of the torana was replaced by an interim fourcylinder version of the commodore until camira was launched in  the hq framework led to a new generation of twodoor monaros and despite the introduction of the similar sized competitors the hq range became the topselling holden of all time with  units sold in three years  units were exported and  ckd kits were constructed the hq series was facelifted in  with the introduction of the hj heralding new front panel styling and a revised rear fascia this new bodywork was to remain albeit with minor upgrades through the hx and hz series detuned engines adhering to government emission standards were brought in with the hx series whilst the hz brought considerably improved road handling and comfort with the introduction of radial tuned suspension rts as a result of gms toying with the wankel rotary engine as used by mazda of japan an export agreement was initiated in  this involved holden exporting with powertrains hj and later hx series premiers as the mazda roadpacer ap mazda then fitted these cars with the b rotary engine and threespeed automatic transmission production ended in  after just  units sold during the s holden ran an advertising jingle football meat pies kangaroos and holden cars based on the baseball hot dogs apple pies and chevrolet jingle used by chevrolet in the united states also development of the torana continued in with the larger midsized lh series released in  offered only as a fourdoor sedan the lh torana was one of the few cars worldwide engineered to accommodate four sixand eightcylinder engines this trend continued until holden introduced the sunbird in  essentially the fourcylinder torana with a new name designated lx both the sunbird and torana introduced a threedoor hatchback variant a final uc update appeared in  during its production run the torana achieved legendary racing success in australia achieving victories at the mount panorama circuit in bathurst new south wales the commodore premiering in  followed the success of its kingswood forebear becoming holdens bestselling vehicle to date in  holden introduced the compact gemini the australian version of the tcar based on the opel kadett c the gemini was an overseas design developed jointly with isuzu gms japanese affiliate and was powered by a litre fourcylinder engine fast becoming a popular car the gemini rapidly attained sales leadership in its class and the nameplate lived on until  holdens most popular car to date the commodore was introduced in  as the vb the new family car was loosely based on the opel rekord e body shell but with the front from the opel senator grafted to accommodate the larger holden sixcylinder and v engines initially the commodore maintained holdens sales leadership in australia however some of the compromises resulting from the adoption of a design intended for another market hampered the cars acceptance in particular it was narrower than its predecessor and its falcon rival making it less comfortable for three rearseat passengers with the abandonment of lefthand drive markets holden exported almost  commodores to markets such as new zealand thailand hong kong malaysia indonesia malta and singapore holden discontinued the torana in  and the sunbird in  after the  introduction of the commodore the torana became the inbetween car surrounded by the smaller and more economical gemini and the larger more sophisticated commodore the closest successor to the torana was the camira released in  as australias version of gms mediumsized jcar sedit after a good start sales of the camira holdens version of the global jcar platform slumped significantly this placed a huge financial burden on the australian subsidiary which was already operating at a loss at this time the s were challenging for holden and the australian automotive industry the australian government tried to revive the industry with the button car plan which encouraged car makers to focus on producing fewer models at higher more economical volumes and to export cars the decade opened with the shutdown of the pagewood new south wales production plant and introduction of the light commercial rodeo sourced from isuzu in japan the rodeo was available in both two and fourwheel drive chassis cab models with a choice of petrol and diesel powerplants the range was updated in  with the tf series based on the isuzu tf other cars sourced from isuzu during the s were the fourwheel drive jackaroo  the shuttle  van and the piazza  threedoor sports hatchback the second generation holden gemini from  was also based on an isuzu design although its manufacture was undertaken in australia while gm australias commercial vehicle range had originally been mostly based on bedford products these had gradually been replaced by isuzu products this process began in the s and by  holdens commercial vehicle arm no longer offered any bedford products the new holden wb commercial vehicles and the statesman wb limousines were introduced in  however the designs based on the hq and updated hj hx and hz models from the s were less competitive than similar models in fords lineup thus holden abandoned those vehicle classes altogether in  sales of the commodore also fell with the effects of the  energy crisis lessening and for the first time the commodore lost ground to the ford falcon sales in other segments also suffered when competition from ford intensified and other australian manufacturers mitsubishi nissan and toyota gained market share when released in  the camira initially generated good sales which later declined because buyers considered the litre engine underpowered and the cars build and ride quality belowaverage the camira lasted just seven years and contributed to holdens accumulated losses of over a million by the mids the second generation commodore vn calais pictured overcame the previous generations width problems in  holden introduced the vk commodore with significant styling changes from the previous vh the commodore was next updated in  as the vl which had new front and rear styling controversially the vl was powered by the litre nissan rb sixcylinder engine and had a nissanbuilt electronically controlled fourspeed automatic transmission holden even went to court in  to stop local motoring magazine wheels from reporting on the matter the engine change was necessitated by the legal requirement that all new cars sold in australia after  had to consume unleaded petrol because it was unfeasible to convert the existing sixcylinder engine to run on unleaded fuel the nissan engine was chosen as the best engine available however changing exchange rates doubled the cost of the engine and transmission over the life of the vl the decision to opt for a japanesemade transmission led to the closure of the woodville south australia assembly plant confident by the apparent sign of turnaround gm paid off holdens mounted losses of a million on  december  at gm headquarters request holden was then reorganised and recapitalised separating the engine and car manufacturing divisions in the process this involved the splitting of holden into holdens motor company hmc and holdens engine company hec for the most part car bodies were now manufactured at elizabeth south australia with engines as before confined to the fishermans bend plant in port melbourne victoria the engine manufacturing business was successful building fourcylinder family ii engines for use in cars built overseas the final phase of the commodores recovery strategy involved the  vn a significantly wider model powered by the americandesigned australianassembled litre buick v engine holden began to sell the subcompact suzuki swiftbased barina in  the barina was launched concurrently with the suzukisourced holden drover followed by the scurry later on in  in the previous year nissan pulsar hatchbacks were rebadged as the holden astra as a result of a deal with nissan this arrangement ceased in  when holden entered a new alliance with toyota forming a new company united australian automobile industries uaai uaai resulted in holden selling rebadged versions of toyotas corolla and camry as the holden nova and apollo respectively with toyota rebranding the commodore as the lexcen sedit the vs statesmancaprice of  represented a mild facelift of the vr which in turn was an update of the  vq—holdens longwheelbase version of the vn commodore series the company changed throughout the s increasing its australian market share from  percent in  to  percent in  besides manufacturing australias best selling car which was exported in significant numbers holden continued to export many locally produced engines to power cars made elsewhere in this decade holden adopted a strategy of importing cars it needed to offer a full range of competitive vehicles during  general motorsholdens ltd name was shortened to holden ltd on  april  gms new zealand subsidiary holden new zealand announced that production at the assembly plant based in trentham would be phased out and vehicles would be imported dutyfree—this came after the  closure of the petone assembly line due to low output volumes during the s holden other australian automakers and trade unions pressured the australian government to halt the lowering of car import tariffs by  the federal government had already cut tariffs to  percent from  percent ten years earlier by  a plan was formulated to reduce the tariffs to  percent holden was critical saying that australias population was not large enough and that the changes could tarnish the local industry commodore vt introduced in  marked the commodores global expansion holden reintroduced its defunct statesman title in —this time under the holden marque as the statesman and caprice for  holden updated the statesman and caprice with a range of improvements including the introduction of fourwheel antilock brakes abs although a rearwheel system had been standard on the statesman caprice from march  abs was added to the shortwheelbase commodore range in  another returning variant was the fullsize utility and on this occasion it was based on the commodore the vn commodore received a major facelift in  with the vr—compared to the vn approximately  percent of the car model was new exterior changes resulted in a smoother overall body and a twinkidney grille—a commodore styling trait that remained until the  vy model and as of  remains a permanent staple on hsv variants holden introduced the allnew vt commodore in  the outcome of a a million development programme that spanned more than five years the new model featured a rounded exterior body shell improved dynamics and many firsts for an australianbuilt car also a stronger body structure increased crash safety the locally produced buicksourced v engine powered the commodore range as did the litre holden v engine and was replaced in  by the litre ls unit the  holden astra continued holdens trend of sourcing its midsize and smaller model lines from opel in europe the uaai badgeengineered cars first introduced in  sold in far fewer numbers than anticipated but the holden commodore toyota camry and corolla were all successful when sold under their original nameplates the first generation nova and the donor corolla were produced at holdens dandenong victoria facility until  uaai was dissolved in  and holden returned to selling only gm products the holden astra and vectra both designed by opel in germany replaced the toyotasourced holden nova and apollo this came after the  introduction of the opel corsa replacing the already available suzuki swift as the source for the holden barina sales of the fullsize holden suburban suv sourced from chevrolet commenced in —lasting until  also in  local assembly of the vectra began at elizabeth south australia these cars were exported to japan and southeast asia with opel badges however the vectra did not achieve sufficient sales in australia to justify local assembly and reverted to being fully imported in  sedit holdens market surge from the s reversed in the s decade in australia holdens market share dropped from  percent in  to  percent in  from march  holden no longer held the number one sales position in australia losing ground to toyota this overall downturn affected holdens profits the company recorded a combined gain of a million between  and  and a combined loss of a million between  and  factors contributing to the loss included the development of an allnew model the strong australian dollar and the cost of reducing the workforce at the elizabeth plant including the loss of  jobs after the closure of the thirdshift assembly line in  after two years in operation holden fared better in  posting an a million loss this was followed by an a million loss in the  an a million loss in  and a profit of a million in  on  may  holden ltd became gm holden ltd coinciding with the resettling to the new holden headquarters on  salmon street port melbourne victoria the monaro coupé was resurrected in  as a lowvolume niche model unanticipated overseas demand proved otherwise with the monaro selling in the uk as a vauxhall monaro and throughout the united states as the pontiac gto holden caused controversy in  with their holden employee pricing television advertisement which ran between october and december  the campaign publicised for the first time ever all australians can enjoy the financial benefit of holden employee pricing however this did not include a discounted dealer delivery fee and savings on factory fitted options and accessories that employees received at the same time employees were given a further discount between  and  percent on selected models holden revived the monaro coupe in  based on the vt commodore architecture the coupe attracted worldwide attention after being shown as a concept car at australian auto shows the vt commodore received its first major update in  with the vy series a mildly facelifted vz model launched in  introducing the high feature engine this was built at the fishermans bend facility completed in  with a maximum output of  engines per day this has reportedly added a billion to the australian economy exports account for about a million alone after the vz the high feature engine powered the allnew holden commodore ve in contrast to previous models the ve no longer utilised an opelsourced platform adapted both mechanically and in size but was based on the gm zeta platform that was earmarked to become a global rwd architecture until plans were cancelled due to the  global financial crisis holden updated the commodore with the ve series in  holdens first cleansheet design since  throughout the s opel had also been the source of many holden models to increase profitability holden looked to the south korean daewoo brand for replacements after acquiring a  percent stake—worth us million—in the company in  as a representative of gm this was increased to  percent in  but when gm further increased its stake to  percent around the time of its  chapter  reorganisation holdens interest was relinquished and transferred to another undisclosed part of gm the commencement of the holdenbranded daewoo models began with the  holden barina which based on the daewoo kalos replaced the opel corsa as the source of the barina in the same year the viva based on the daewoo lacetti replaced the entrylevel holden astra classic although the newgeneration astra introduced in  continued on the captiva crossover suv came next in  after discontinuing the frontera and jackaroo models in  holden was only left with one allwheel drive model the adventra a commodorebased station wagon the fourth model to be replaced with a south korean alternative was the vectra by the midsize epica in  as a result of the split between gm and isuzu holden lost the rights to use the rodeo nameplate consequently the holden rodeo was facelifted and relaunched as the colorado in  following holdens successful application for a a million government grant to build a localised version of the chevrolet cruze in australia from  holden in  announced that it would initially import the small car unchanged from south korea as the holden cruze following the government grant announcement kevin rudd australias prime minister at the time stated that production would support  new jobs at the elizabeth facility however this failed to take into account holdens previous announcement whereby  jobs would be shed when production of the family ii engine ceased in late  in mid holden sought a further a million in addition to the a million that was already committed by the governments of canberra south australia and victoria to remain viable as a car manufacturer in australia a source close to holden informed the australian news publication that the car company is losing money on every vehicle that it produces and consequently initiated negotiations to reduce employee wages by up to a per week to cut costs following the announcement of  job cuts and an assembly line reduction of   to  cars per day sedit in march  holden was given a  million lifeline by the gillard weatherill and baillieu ministries in return holden planned to inject over  billion into car manufacturing in australia they estimated the new investment package would return around  billion to the australian economy and see gm holden continue making cars in australia until at least  industry minister kim carr confirmed on  july  that talks had been scheduled between the australian government and holden on  august   employees at the elizabeth plant in northern adelaide voted to accept a threeyear wage freeze in order to decrease the chances of the production lines closure in  holdens ultimate survival though depended on continued negotiations with the federal government—to secure funding for the period from  to —and the final decision of the global headquarters in detroit us on  december  general motors announced that holden would cease engine and vehicle manufacturing operations in australia by the end of  as a result  jobs would be lost over four years beyond  holdens australian presence will consist of a national sales company a parts distribution centre and a global design studio in may  gm reversed their decision to abandon the lang lang proving ground and decided to keep it as part of their engineering capability in australia in  holden again began selling a range of opelderived cars comprising the astra vxr and insignia vxr both based on the opc models sold by vauxhall and cascada later that year holden also announced plans to sell the european astra and the korean cruze alongside each other from  in december  belgian entrepreneur guido dumarey commenced negotiations to buy the commodore manufacturing plant in south australia with a view to continue producing a rebadged zetabased premium range of rear and allwheel drive vehicles for local and export sales the proposal was met with doubt in south

consolidation of car production at elizabeth was completed in  but some assembly operations continued at dandenong until  gm assembly plants were operated in new zealand from  until  by general motors new zealand limited in an earlier and quite separate operation from holdens in australia although holdens involvement in exports has fluctuated since the s the declining sales of large cars in australia led the company to look to international markets to increase profitability since  holden has incurred losses due to the strong australian dollar and government grants have been reduced this lead to the announcement on  december  that holden will cease vehicle and engine production by the end of  however the company will continue to have a large and ongoing presence in australia importing

james grandson joined the firm in  with an interest in automobiles from there the firm evolved through various partnerships and in  holden  frost moved into the business of minor repairs to car upholstery the company began to produce complete motorcycle sidecar bodies in  and edward experimented with fitting bodies to different types of carriages after  wartime trade restrictions led the company to start fullscale production of vehicle body shells ja holden founded a new company in  holdens motor body builders ltd hmbb specialising in car bodies and utilising a facility on king william street in adelaide holden body badge on a  chevrolet tourer by  hmbb were producing  units per year during this time hmbb was the first company to assemble bodies for ford motor company of australia until its geelong plant was completed from  hmbb became the exclusive supplier of car bodies for gm in australia with manufacturing taking place at the new woodville plant these bodies were made to suit a number of chassis imported from manufacturers such as chevrolet and dodge in  general motors australia was established with assembly plants at newstead queensland marrickville new south wales city road melbourne birkenhead south australia and cottesloe western australia utilising bodies produced by holden motor body builders and imported complete knock down ckd chassis in  alone the still independent woodville plant built bodies for austin chrysler desoto morris hillman humber hupmobile and willysoverland as well gm cars the last of this line of business was the assembly of hillman minx sedans in  the great depression led to a substantial downturn in production by holden from  units annually in  to just  units one year later in  general motors purchased holden motor body builders and merged it with general motors australia pty ltd to form general motorsholdens ltd gmh throughout the s holden also supplied tramcars to the melbourne  metropolitan tramways board of which several examples have been preserved in both australia and new zealand sedit the holden  utility launched in  three years after the  sedan holdens second fullscale car factory located in fishermans bend port melbourne was completed in  with construction beginning in  on a new plant in pagewood new south wales however world war ii delayed car production with efforts shifted to the construction of vehicle bodies field guns aircraft and engines before the war ended the australian government took steps to encourage an australian automotive industry both gm and ford provided studies to the australian government outlining the production of the first australiandesigned car fords proposal was the governments first choice but required substantial financial assistance gms study was ultimately chosen because of its low level of government intervention after the war holden returned to producing vehicle bodies this time for buick chevrolet pontiac and vauxhall the oldsmobile ace was also produced from  to  from here holden continued to pursue the goal of producing an australian car this involved compromise with gm as holdens managing director laurence hartnett favoured development of a local design while gm preferred to see an american design as the basis for australias own car in the end the design was based on a previously rejected postwar chevrolet proposal the holden was launched in  creating long waiting lists extending through  and beyond the name holden was chosen in honour of sir edward holden the companys first chairman and grandson of ja holden other names considered were gem austral melba woomerah boomerang emu and canbra a phonetic spelling of canberra although officially designated  the car was marketed simply as the holden the unofficial usage of the name fx originated within holden referring to the updated suspension on the  of  sedit holdens fc series was the first to be tested at the lang lang proving ground during the s holden dominated the australian car market gm invested heavily in production capacity which allowed the company to meet increased postwar demand for motor cars less expensive fourcylinder cars did not offer holdens ability to deal with rugged rural areas  sedans were produced in parallel with the  coupé utility from  the latter was known colloquially as the ute and became ubiquitous in australian rural areas as the workhorse of choice production of both the utility and sedan continued with minor changes until  when they were replaced by the facelifted fj model introducing a third panel van body style the fj was the first major change to the holden since its  introduction over time it gained iconic status and remains one of australias most recognisable automotive symbols a new horizontally slatted grille dominated the frontend of the fj which received various other trim and minor mechanical revisions in  holden began exporting the fj to new zealand although little changed from the  marketing campaigns and price cuts kept fj sales steady until a completely redesigned model was launched at the  australian international motor show in sydney holden paid homage to the fj with the efijy concept car holdens next model the fe launched in  offered in a new station wagon body style dubbed station sedan in the companys sales literature in the same year holden commenced exports to malaya thailand and north borneo strong sales continued in australia and holden achieved a market share of more than  percent in  with the revised fc model this was the first holden to be tested on the new holden proving ground based in lang lang victoria  saw holdens export markets grow to  countries with new additions including indonesia hong kong singapore fiji sudan the east africa region and south africa indonesian market cars were assembled locally by pt udatin the opening of the dandenong victoria production facility in  brought further jobs by  holden employed  workers countrywide in  complete knock down assembly began in south africa and indonesia sedit in  holden introduced its third major new model the fb the cars style was inspired by s chevrolets with tailfins and a wraparound windshield with dog leg apillars by the time it was introduced many considered the appearance dated much of the motoring industry at the time noted that the adopted style did not translate well to the more compact holden the fb became the first holden that was adapted for lefthanddrive markets enhancing its export potential and as such was exported to new caledonia new hebrides the philippines and hawaii the ek of  was holdens response to the ford falcon with the availability of automatic transmission in  ford unveiled the new falcon in australia only months after its introduction in the united states to holdens advantage the falcon was not durable particularly in the front suspension making it illsuited for australian conditions in response to the falcon holden introduced the facelifted ek series in  the new model featured twotone paintwork and optional hydramatic automatic transmission a restyled ej series came in  debuting the new luxury oriented premier model the eh update came a year later bringing the new red motor providing better performance than the previous grey motor the hd series of  saw the introduction of the powerglide automatic transmission at the same time an x performance option with a more powerful version of the cubicinch  l sixcylinder engine was made available in  the hr was introduced including changes in the form of new front and rear styling and highercapacity engines more significantly the hr fitted standard front seat belts holden thus became the first australian automaker to provide the safety device as standard equipment across all models this coincided with the completion of the production plant in acacia ridge queensland by  holden was exporting cars to africa the middle east southeast asia the pacific islands and the caribbean holden began assembling the compact ha series vauxhall viva in  this was superseded by the holden torana in  a development of the viva ending vauxhall production in australia holden offered the lc a torana with new styling in  with the availability of holdens sixcylinder engine in the development days the sixcylinder torana was reserved for motor racing but research had shown that there was a business case for such a model the lc torana was the first application of holdens new threespeed trimatic automatic transmission this was the result of holdens a million transformation of the woodville south australia factory for its production the iconic holden monaro coupé introduced in  and based on the mainstream kingswood has since gained a cult following holdens association with the manufacture of chevrolets and pontiacs ended in  coinciding with the year of holdens next major new model the hk  this included holdens first v engine a chevrolet engine imported from canada models based on the hk series included an extendedlength prestige model the brougham and a twodoor coupé the monaro the mainstream holden special was rebranded the kingswood and the basic fleet model the standard became the belmont on  march  alexander rhea managing director of general motorsholdens at the time was joined by press photographers and the federal minister of shipping and transport ian sinclair as the two men drove the two millionth holden an hk brougham off the production line this came just over half a decade since the one millionth car an ej premier sedan rolled off the dandenong line on  october  following the chevrolet v fitted to the hk the first australiandesigned and massproduced v the holden v engine debuted in the hurricane concept of  before fitment to facelifted ht model this was available in two capacities  cubic inches  l and  cubic inches  l late in ht production use of the new trimatic automatic transmission first seen in the lc torana was phased in as powerglide stock was exhausted but holdens official line was that the hg of  was the first fullsize holden to receive it holdens hx pictured was an evolution of the recordselling hq with more than  units shifted throughout the cars lifetime despite the arrival of serious competitors—namely the ford falcon chrysler valiant and japanese cars—in the s holdens locally produced large six and eightcylinder cars remained australias topselling vehicles sales were boosted by exporting the kingswood sedan station wagon and utility body styles to indonesia trinidad and tobago pakistan the philippines and south africa in complete knock down form sedit holden launched the new hq series in  at this time the company was producing all of its passenger cars in australia and every model was of australian design however by the end of the decade holden was producing cars based on overseas designs the hq was thoroughly reengineered featuring a perimeter frame and semimonocoque unibody construction other firsts included an allcoil suspension and an extended wheelbase for station wagons while the utilities and panel vans retained the traditional coilleaf suspension configuration the series included the new prestige statesman brand which also had a longer wheelbase replacing the brougham the statesman remains noteworthy because it was not marketed as a holden but rather a statesman the uc holdens final iteration of the torana was replaced by an interim fourcylinder version of the commodore until camira was launched in  the hq framework led to a new generation of twodoor monaros and despite the introduction of the similar sized competitors the hq range became the topselling holden of all time with  units sold in three years  units were exported and  ckd kits were constructed the hq series was facelifted in  with the introduction of the hj heralding new front panel styling and a revised rear fascia this new bodywork was to remain albeit with minor upgrades through the hx and hz series detuned engines adhering to government emission standards were brought in with the hx series whilst the hz brought considerably improved road handling and comfort with the introduction of radial tuned suspension rts as a result of gms toying with the wankel rotary engine as used by mazda of japan an export agreement was initiated in  this involved holden exporting with powertrains hj and later hx series premiers as the mazda roadpacer ap mazda then fitted these cars with the b rotary engine and threespeed automatic transmission production ended in  after just  units sold during the s holden ran an advertising jingle football meat pies kangaroos and holden cars based on the baseball hot dogs apple pies and chevrolet jingle used by chevrolet in the united states also development of the torana continued in with the larger midsized lh series released in  offered only as a fourdoor sedan the lh torana was one of the few cars worldwide engineered to accommodate four sixand eightcylinder engines this trend continued until holden introduced the sunbird in  essentially the fourcylinder torana with a new name designated lx both the sunbird and torana introduced a threedoor hatchback variant a final uc update appeared in  during its production run the torana achieved legendary racing success in australia achieving victories at the mount panorama circuit in bathurst new south wales the commodore premiering in  followed the success of its kingswood forebear becoming holdens bestselling vehicle to date in  holden introduced the compact gemini the australian version of the tcar based on the opel kadett c the gemini was an overseas design developed jointly with isuzu gms japanese affiliate and was powered by a litre fourcylinder engine fast becoming a popular car the gemini rapidly attained sales leadership in its class and the nameplate lived on until  holdens most popular car to date the commodore was introduced in  as the vb the new family car was loosely based on the opel rekord e body shell but with the front from the opel senator grafted to accommodate the larger holden sixcylinder and v engines initially the commodore maintained holdens sales leadership in australia however some of the compromises resulting from the adoption of a design intended for another market hampered the cars acceptance in particular it was narrower than its predecessor and its falcon rival making it less comfortable for three rearseat passengers with the abandonment of lefthand drive markets holden exported almost  commodores to markets such as new zealand thailand hong kong malaysia indonesia malta and singapore holden discontinued the torana in  and the sunbird in  after the  introduction of the commodore the torana became the inbetween car surrounded by the smaller and more economical gemini and the larger more sophisticated commodore the closest successor to the torana was the camira released in  as australias version of gms mediumsized jcar sedit after a good start sales of the camira holdens version of the global jcar platform slumped significantly this placed a huge financial burden on the australian subsidiary which was already operating at a loss at this time the s were challenging for holden and the australian automotive industry the australian government tried to revive the industry with the button car plan which encouraged car makers to focus on producing fewer models at higher more economical volumes and to export cars the decade opened with the shutdown of the pagewood new south wales production plant and introduction of the light commercial rodeo sourced from isuzu in japan the rodeo was available in both two and fourwheel drive chassis cab models with a choice of petrol and diesel powerplants the range was updated in  with the tf series based on the isuzu tf other cars sourced from isuzu during the s were the fourwheel drive jackaroo  the shuttle  van and the piazza  threedoor sports hatchback the second generation holden gemini from  was also based on an isuzu design although its manufacture was undertaken in australia while gm australias commercial vehicle range had originally been mostly based on bedford products these had gradually been replaced by isuzu products this process began in the s and by  holdens commercial vehicle arm no longer offered any bedford products the new holden wb commercial vehicles and the statesman wb limousines were introduced in  however the designs based on the hq and updated hj hx and hz models from the s were less competitive than similar models in fords lineup thus holden abandoned those vehicle classes altogether in  sales of the commodore also fell with the effects of the  energy crisis lessening and for the first time the commodore lost ground to the ford falcon sales in other segments also suffered when competition from ford intensified and other australian manufacturers mitsubishi nissan and toyota gained market share when released in  the camira initially generated good sales which later declined because buyers considered the litre engine underpowered and the cars build and ride quality belowaverage the camira lasted just seven years and contributed to holdens accumulated losses of over a million by the mids the second generation commodore vn calais pictured overcame the previous generations width problems in  holden introduced the vk commodore with significant styling changes from the previous vh the commodore was next updated in  as the vl which had new front and rear styling controversially the vl was powered by the litre nissan rb sixcylinder engine and had a nissanbuilt electronically controlled fourspeed automatic transmission holden even went to court in  to stop local motoring magazine wheels from reporting on the matter the engine change was necessitated by the legal requirement that all new cars sold in australia after  had to consume unleaded petrol because it was unfeasible to convert the existing sixcylinder engine to run on unleaded fuel the nissan engine was chosen as the best engine available however changing exchange rates doubled the cost of the engine and transmission over the life of the vl the decision to opt for a japanesemade transmission led to the closure of the woodville south australia assembly plant confident by the apparent sign of turnaround gm paid off holdens mounted losses of a million on  december  at gm headquarters request holden was then reorganised and recapitalised separating the engine and car manufacturing divisions in the process this involved the splitting of holden into holdens motor company hmc and holdens engine company hec for the most part car bodies were now manufactured at elizabeth south australia with engines as before confined to the fishermans bend plant in port melbourne victoria the engine manufacturing business was successful building fourcylinder family ii engines for use in cars built overseas the final phase of the commodores recovery strategy involved the  vn a significantly wider model powered by the americandesigned australianassembled litre buick v engine holden began to sell the subcompact suzuki swiftbased barina in  the barina was launched concurrently with the suzukisourced holden drover followed by the scurry later on in  in the previous year nissan pulsar hatchbacks were rebadged as the holden astra as a result of a deal with nissan this arrangement ceased in  when holden entered a new alliance with toyota forming a new company united australian automobile industries uaai uaai resulted in holden selling rebadged versions of toyotas corolla and camry as the holden nova and apollo respectively with toyota rebranding the commodore as the lexcen sedit the vs statesmancaprice of  represented a mild facelift of the vr which in turn was an update of the  vq—holdens longwheelbase version of the vn commodore series the company changed throughout the s increasing its australian market share from  percent in  to  percent in  besides manufacturing australias best selling car which was exported in significant numbers holden continued to export many locally produced engines to power cars made elsewhere in this decade holden adopted a strategy of importing cars it needed to offer a full range of competitive vehicles during  general motorsholdens ltd name was shortened to holden ltd on  april  gms new zealand subsidiary holden new zealand announced that production at the assembly plant based in trentham would be phased out and vehicles would be imported dutyfree—this came after the  closure of the petone assembly line due to low output volumes during the s holden other australian automakers and trade unions pressured the australian government to halt the lowering of car import tariffs by  the federal government had already cut tariffs to  percent from  percent ten years earlier by  a plan was formulated to reduce the tariffs to  percent holden was critical saying that australias population was not large enough and that the changes could tarnish the local industry commodore vt introduced in  marked the commodores global expansion holden reintroduced its defunct statesman title in —this time under the holden marque as the statesman and caprice for  holden updated the statesman and caprice with a range of improvements including the introduction of fourwheel antilock brakes abs although a rearwheel system had been standard on the statesman caprice from march  abs was added to the shortwheelbase commodore range in  another returning variant was the fullsize utility and on this occasion it was based on the commodore the vn commodore received a major facelift in  with the vr—compared to the vn approximately  percent of the car model was new exterior changes resulted in a smoother overall body and a twinkidney grille—a commodore styling trait that remained until the  vy model and as of  remains a permanent staple on hsv variants holden introduced the allnew vt commodore in  the outcome of a a million development programme that spanned more than five years the new model featured a rounded exterior body shell improved dynamics and many firsts for an australianbuilt car also a stronger body structure increased crash safety the locally produced buicksourced v engine powered the commodore range as did the litre holden v engine and was replaced in  by the litre ls unit the  holden astra continued holdens trend of sourcing its midsize and smaller model lines from opel in europe the uaai badgeengineered cars first introduced in  sold in far fewer numbers than anticipated but the holden commodore toyota camry and corolla were all successful when sold under their original nameplates the first generation nova and the donor corolla were produced at holdens dandenong victoria facility until  uaai was dissolved in  and holden returned to selling only gm products the holden astra and vectra both designed by opel in germany replaced the toyotasourced holden nova and apollo this came after the  introduction of the opel corsa replacing the already available suzuki swift as the source for the holden barina sales of the fullsize holden suburban suv sourced from chevrolet commenced in —lasting until  also in  local assembly of the vectra began at elizabeth south australia these cars were exported to japan and southeast asia with opel badges however the vectra did not achieve sufficient sales in australia to justify local assembly and reverted to being fully imported in  sedit holdens market surge from the s reversed in the s decade in australia holdens market share dropped from  percent in  to  percent in  from march  holden no longer held the number one sales position in australia losing ground to toyota this overall downturn affected holdens profits the company recorded a combined gain of a million between  and  and a combined loss of a million between  and  factors contributing to the loss included the development of an allnew model the strong australian dollar and the cost of reducing the workforce at the elizabeth plant including the loss of  jobs after the closure of the thirdshift assembly line in  after two years in operation holden fared better in  posting an a million loss this was followed by an a million loss in the  an a million loss in  and a profit of a million in  on  may  holden ltd became gm holden ltd coinciding with the resettling to the new holden headquarters on  salmon street port melbourne victoria the monaro coupé was resurrected in  as a lowvolume niche model unanticipated overseas demand proved otherwise with the monaro selling in the uk as a vauxhall monaro and throughout the united states as the pontiac gto holden caused controversy in  with their holden employee pricing television advertisement which ran between october and december  the campaign publicised for the first time ever all australians can enjoy the financial benefit of holden employee pricing however this did not include a discounted dealer delivery fee and savings on factory fitted options and accessories that employees received at the same time employees were given a further discount between  and  percent on selected models holden revived the monaro coupe in  based on the vt commodore architecture the coupe attracted worldwide attention after being shown as a concept car at australian auto shows the vt commodore received its first major update in  with the vy series a mildly facelifted vz model launched in  introducing the

mechanically and in size but was based on the gm zeta platform that was earmarked to become a global rwd architecture until plans were cancelled due to the  global financial crisis holden updated the commodore with the ve series in  holdens first cleansheet design since  throughout the s opel had also been the source of many holden models to increase profitability holden looked to the south korean

announcement of  job cuts and an assembly line reduction of   to  cars per day sedit in march  holden was given a  million lifeline by the gillard weatherill and baillieu ministries in return holden
