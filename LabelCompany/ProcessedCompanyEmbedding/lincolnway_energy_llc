operations markets feedstocks coproducts cellulosic business policy rayeman elements sells rcd drying system to lincolnway energy by rayeman elements inc  may   rayeman elements inc in conjunction with its partner nationwide  llc has completed the sale of its second production unit to lincolnway energy of nevada iowa  rayeman elements based in berthoud colorado has developed designed and manufactured a new patented grain drying system the rayeman compression dryer targeting the grain and grain coproducts markets  lincolnway energy llc located in nevada iowa has been working to develop a high quality species specific animal feed branded as purestream protein this product will target the growing swine and poultry markets in iowa purestream protein is both higher in crude protein and richer in the essential amino acids these animals need for growth than traditional ddg the rayeman compression dryer system is ideal for this kind of product it is inherently a low heat process which will not denature the proteins in the product as can happen in some drying systems and the rcd is scalable so production volumes can grow with sales eric hakmiller president of lincolnway energy said “we first saw this system at the vendor exhibit floor of the few in  we were very excited about the potential at the time and were one of the first to see the prototype when it was operational last fall  rayeman elements and nationwide  have been great to work with so far and we are looking forward to seeing purestream protein commercialized on this dryer system by the end of ” mike thomas vice president and director of technology of rayeman elements said “working with lincolnway on this project has been a terrific experience and we are excited to help them achieve their ultimate goals in grain drying” the rayeman compression dryer is a unique drying system for the industry as wet grain goes in the moisture in the grain meets two electrically heated specially designed and patented screws inside a barrel these screws intermesh with one another creating designated compression points that squeeze the water out of the grain while simultaneously creating heat at low temperatures upon contact and vaporizing the water within the grains at various flash points throughout the process additional heat is created naturally through shearing and compressing of the material from the rotating screws causing this machine to conserve energy through selfgenerated low heat and by squeezing water from the grain versus reaching heat of vaporization the rcd process eliminates burning and produces the highest nutritional value grain that is consistently a lighter superior golden colored more flowable grain an attribute highly sought after in the business of grain exporting and feed in addition to the rayeman compression dryer producing a superior quality grain the required moisture levels are dialed in meaning one has the flexibility to produce modified wets along the way if desired the rcd emits far lower vocs which reduces regenerative thermal oxidizer requirements by as much as  percent and makes epa permitting easier the rcd is explosion proof—providing unmatched safety and lower insurance rates this technology offers a significantly smaller footprint than conventional dryers and in comparison a lower capital cost overall to purchase and operate—creating a winwin all around  lincolnway energy an ethanol and grain processor since may of  continually strives to seek out and implement the safest and most efficient methods of production and has found all of that in the rayeman compression dryer  lincolnway energy and rayeman elements together are scheduled to have the dual drying systems fully operational by late fall of this year      related
