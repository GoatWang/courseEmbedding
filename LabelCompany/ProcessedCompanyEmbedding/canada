isedcanadaca aussi offert en français sous le titre « produit du canada » et « fait au canada » preface the competition bureau bureau is an independent law enforcement agency that contributes to the prosperity of canadians by protecting and promoting competitive markets and enabling informed consumer choice headed by the commissioner of competition the bureau is responsible for the administration and enforcement of four federal statutes the competition actfootnote  contains provisions against false or misleading representations the consumer packaging and labelling actfootnote  requires that consumer products bear accurate and meaningful labelling information the bureau only enforces this act as it relates to non‑food products the textile labelling actfootnote  requires that consumer textile articles bear accurate and meaningful labelling information and the precious metals marking actfootnote  the competition act the consumer packaging and labelling act and the textile labelling act collectively the acts do not require that the country of origin of a product be identifiedfootnote  the acts address and prohibit the making of false or misleading representations accordingly the acts do not require for instance that businesses make a made in canada claim with regard to their products however if they choose to make such a claim the bureau will apply the approach described in these enforcement guidelines to assist in determining when it will investigate a claim for non‑compliance or undertake an appropriate enforcement action under the false or misleading representations provisions in the statutes under its responsibility the bureaus guide to made in canada claims was introduced in the early s as a means of identifying canadian content and to assist in evaluating made in canada claims against the false or misleading representations provisions contained in the actsfootnote  as noted above the bureau enforces the consumer packaging and labelling act cpla only as it relates to non‑food products the canadian food inspection agency cfia enforces the cpla as it relates to food products until december   the cfia chose to rely on the bureaus guide to made in canada claims to enforce the cpla in relation to food products after this date the cfia introduced its own guide for the use of made in canada and product of canada claims in the labelling of food products sold in canada in light of among other developments the distinction that has been created in cfias guide between made in canada and product of canada claims in labelling of food products the bureau has reviewed its guide to made in canada claims for non‑food products and has adopted new guidelines called product of canada and made in canada claims the guidelines these guidelines describe the bureaus approach to assessing made in canada and product of canada claims under the false or misleading representations provisions of the acts and supersedes the previous guide to made in canada claims the new guidelines introduce a distinction between product of canada and made in canada claims product of canada claims will be subject to a higher threshold of canadian content  while made in canada claims will remain subject to a  threshold of canadian content but should be accompanied by a qualifying statement indicating that the product contains imported content in both cases the last substantial transformation of the product must have occurred in canada the bureau recognizes the need for transparency and predictability regarding its assessment of product of canada and made in canada claims these guidelines are intended to provide businesses and industry groups with information that will help them develop strategies to ensure compliance with the false or misleading representations provisions of the acts with respect to such claims significantly the guidelines and industry compliance with them will promote clarity and assist consumers in understanding the meaning of product of canada and made in canada claims and in making informed purchasing decisions if businesses follow these guidelines when making representations that their products are product of canada or made in canada it is unlikely that they will raise concerns under the statutes administered by the bureau it should also be pointed out that a mere deviation from these guidelines might not in and of itself represent a contravention of any one or more of those statutes each situation will be evaluated on a case by case basis commissioner of competition interpretation these guidelines describe the general approach of the bureau to assessing made in canada and product of canada claims under the false or misleading representations provisions of the acts these guidelines are not intended to restate the law or to constitute a binding statement of how the commissioner of competition or the director of public prosecutions dpp will exercise discretion in a particular situation they do not replace the advice of legal counsel guidance regarding future business conduct can be obtained by requesting a binding written opinion from the commissioner of competition under section  of the competition act ca the respective enforcement and prosecutorial decisions of the commissioner of competition and the dpp and the ultimate resolution of issues will depend on the particular circumstances of the matter in question final interpretation of the law is the responsibility of the competition tribunal tribunal and the courts table of contents introduction  scope and purpose of

purpose of the guidelines these guidelines discuss the bureaus interpretation of product of canada and made in canada claims under the competition act ca the consumer packaging and labelling act cpla and the textile labelling act tla as they relate to non‑food products as defined in section  of these guidelines the ca the cpla and the tla collectively the acts do not require that the country of origin of a product be identifiedfootnote  rather the acts prohibit the making of false or misleading representations the acts do not require for instance that businesses make a made in canada claim with regard to their products if however they choose to make such a claim the bureau will apply the approach described in these enforcement guidelines to assist in determining when it will investigate a claim for non‑compliance or undertake an appropriate enforcement action under the false or misleading representations provisions in the statutes under its responsibility these guidelines do not address other statutory or regulatory requirements regarding country of origin identification including product of canada and made in canada claims with respect to food and non‑food productsfootnote  included in statutes other than the acts these guidelines are intended to provide businesses and industry groups with information that will help them develop strategies to ensure compliance with the false or misleading representations provisions of the ca the cpla and the tla with respect to product of canada and made in canada claims significantly these guidelines and industry compliance with them will assist consumers in understanding the meaning of product of canada and made in canada claims and in making informed purchasing decisions if businesses follow these guidelines when making representations that their products are product of canada or made in canada it is unlikely that they will raise concerns under the statutes administered by the bureau moreover a mere deviation from these guidelines might not in and of itself represent a contravention of any one or more of those statutes each situation will be evaluated on a case by case basis  overview of the legislation while country of origin labelling is not a requirement under the ca the cpla or the tla each statute contains provisions prohibiting false or misleading representations such provisions can apply to false or misleading country of origin claims the purpose of the false or misleading representations provisions of the acts is to promote fair competition in the marketplace by discouraging deceptive business practices and by encouraging the provision of truthful and accurate information to enable informed consumer choice  the competition act the cafootnote  contains provisions that prohibit false or misleading representations for the purpose of promoting a product or any business interest two of these provisions sections  and  can be applied to country of origin claims made by businesses subsection  of the ca is a criminal provision that prohibits anyone for the purpose of promoting the supply or use of a product or business interest from knowingly or recklessly making a materially false or misleading representation to the public that is false or misleading in a material respect any person who contravenes this subsection is guilty of an offence and liable to a fine andor imprisonment and can be ordered to pay restitution if the conditions set out in the criminal codefootnote  are metfootnote  paragraph a of the ca is a civil provision that provides that anyone who makes a materially false or misleading representation to the public to promote the supply or use of a product or a business interest engages in reviewable conduct when the competition tribunal on application by the commissioner of competition finds that a person has engaged in reviewable conduct it may order the person not to engage in such conduct to publish a corrective notice to pay an administrative monetary penalty andor to pay restitutionfootnote  most cases are taken under the civil provision of the ca criminal prosecution is only undertaken when the false or misleading representations are made knowingly or recklessly and when the director of public prosecutions is of the view that it is in the public interest to proceed criminallyfootnote   the consumer packaging and labelling act the cplafootnote  requires that consumer products bear accurate and meaningful labelling information to help consumers make informed purchasing decisions the cpla sets out specifications for mandatory label information such as product identity product net quantity and the dealers name and principal place of businessfootnote  section  of the cpla also contains a provision prohibiting false or misleading representations on a pre‑packaged product which covers country of origin claims made by businesses the bureau enforces the cpla as it relates to non‑food products the enforcement of the cpla as it relates to food products is the responsibility of the canadian food inspection agency cfia  the textile labelling act the tlafootnote  requires that consumer textile articles bear accurate and meaningful labelling information to help consumers make informed purchasing decisions the tla sets out specifications for mandatory label information such as information on fibre content and dealer identification section  of the tla also contains a provision prohibiting false or misleading representations on a textile article which covers country of origin claims made by businesses top of page  definitions for the purpose of these guidelines the following definitions apply  cost of productionmanufacturing cost of productionmanufacturing that would be taken into account by the bureau when assessing a product of canada or made in canada claim are expenditures on materials incurred by the producermanufacturer in the production or manufacturing of the goods and expenditures on labour incurred by the producermanufacturer that relate to the production or manufacturing of the goods and can reasonably be allocated to the production or manufacturing of the goods general overhead is not usually included in the calculation of the cost of production and manufacturing however overhead expenditures incurred by the producermanufacturer may be eligible if they relate directly to the production or manufacturing of the goods in question and if they can reasonably be allocated to the production or manufacturing of the goods  food food as defined in section  of the food and drugs actfootnote  includes any article manufactured sold or represented for use as food or drink for human beings chewing gum and any ingredient that may be mixed with food for any purpose whatever  non‑food product or good non‑food products or goods means products or goods that are not food as defined in section  of the food and drugs act  substantial transformation goods are substantially transformed where they undergo a fundamental change in form appearance or nature such that the goods existing after the change are new and different goods from those existing before the change top of page  product of canada and made in canada claims  the bureaus enforcement approach — general principles the acts enforced by the bureau do not require that the country of origin of a product be identifiedfootnote  the acts do prohibit the making of false or misleading representations as such the acts do not require for instance that businesses make a made in canada claim with respect to their products however if they choose to make such a claim the bureau will apply the approach described in these enforcement guidelines to assist in determining when it will investigate a claim for non‑compliance or undertake an appropriate enforcement action under the false or misleading representations provisions included in the statutes under its responsibility the approach outlined in these guidelines is applied by the bureau on a case‑by‑case basis the guidelines are used to assist in interpreting whether a representation either implicit or explicit that a product is a product of canada or made in canada may be false or misleading to prospective purchasers of the product  general impression test when determining whether a product of canada or made in canada declaration has been made that is false or misleading the ca requires that the general impression conveyed by a representation as well as its literal meaning be taken into account thus when examining a particular representation the bureau will consider the general impression conveyed through a combination of words visual elements illustrations and overall layout that may alter the plain meaning of a representation as such any country of origin claim or representation including any pictorial representation will be evaluated in its entirety to establish whether the representation creates the general impression that the product was made in canada if the bureau concludes that the general impression given by a representation is that the product was made in canada the bureau will assess these representations under the criteria for product of canada and made in canada claims set out in section  of these guidelines to assist in interpreting whether the representations may be false or misleading  medium of the representations the false or misleading representations provisions of the ca and tla cover all forms of representation regardless of the medium used including print or broadcast media internet and oral representationsfootnote   proof of deception not required subsections  and  of the ca clarify that it is not necessary to prove that anyone was actually deceived or misled in order to prove that a representation has contravened the provisions for criminal or civil false or misleading representations in the ca  goods wholly obtained or produced in canada goods that are wholly obtained or produced in canada for example mineral goods extracted in canada or goods harvested in canada will be considered to have undergone their last substantial transformation in canada  types of claims  product of canada claims the bureau generally will not challenge a representation that states that a good is a product of canada under the false or misleading representations provisions of the acts if these two conditions are met the last substantial transformation of the good occurred in canada and all or virtually all at least  of the total direct costs of producing or manufacturing the good have been incurred in canada  made in canada claims the bureau will generally not challenge a representation that a good is made in canada under the false or misleading representations provisions of the acts if these three conditions are met the last substantial transformation of the good occurred in canada at least  of the total direct costs of producing or manufacturing the good have been incurred in canada and the made in canada representation is accompanied by an appropriate qualifying statement such as made in canada with imported parts or made in canada with domestic and imported parts this could also include more specific information such as made in canada with  canadian content and  imported content  other claims if a product does not meet either of the criteria for a product of canada or made in canada claim the bureau recommends the use of a more specific term that more accurately reflects the limited production or manufacturing activity that took place in canada for example assembled in canada with foreign parts or sewn in canada with imported fabricfootnote  the bureau encourages the use of qualified claims where the additional information provided is accurate relevant and useful and does not give a false or misleading impression more general terms however such as produced or manufactured in canada are likely to be understood by consumers as synonymous with a made in canada claim and should therefore comply with the requirements for made in canada claims to increase clarity for consumers the bureau recommends the use of made in canada claims with a qualifying statement over more general terms such as produced or manufactured in canada with a qualifying statement a marketer may represent that a particular manufacturing or other process was performed in canada such as designed in canada similarly a marketer may represent that a particular part was manufactured in canada such as that the motor in a lawnmower was made in canada from domestic and imported parts such a claim is acceptable provided it is accurate and that consumers would understand it to refer to a specific process or part and not to the general manufacturing of the product  implicit declarations a representation may be made by either express or implied claims depending on the context pictorial representations eg logos pictures or symbols such as the canadian flag or maple leaf may by themselves be just as forceful as an explicit made in canada written representation any text that attempts to qualify a pictorial representation must be sufficiently prominent to ensure that consumers notice it and understand the significance if a reasonable conclusion from the use of a pictorial representation is that the goods are made in canada when that is in fact not the case as per the requirements noted above there is a risk of misleading consumers and the acts may come into play implicit declarations of domestic origin will be interpreted by the bureau as giving the same general impression to the public as an explicit made in canada claim and should therefore meet the conditions for this type of claim as set out in section  of these guidelines in identifying implied claims the bureau focuses on the overall general impression of an advertisement label or other promotional material this requires an examination of both the representation and the overall context including the positioning of phrases and images top of page  penalties and remedies if the bureau believes that a representation is false or misleading in a material respect it will look to its conformity continuum information bulletinfootnote  in choosing the appropriate enforcement approach for achieving conformity with the legislation the bureau has several instruments at its disposal to promote and achieve compliance with the acts the conformity continuum information bulletin explains how the bureau will select and use each tool and sets out the considerations influencing the bureaus discretionary enforcement decisions in prioritizing enforcement activity the commissioner of competition reviews matters in relation to criteria such as economic impact and the bureaus enforcement policies and priorities under the ca a corporation found to have engaged in conduct described in the civil false or misleading

guidelines for product of canada and made in canada claims this page is part of the guidance document repository gdr looking for related documents search for related documents in the guidance document repository the guidelines for product of canada and made in canada claims promote compliance with subsection  of the food and drugs act and subsection  of the consumer packaging and labelling act which prohibit false and misleading claims the use of product of canada and made in canada claims is voluntary however once a company chooses to make one of these claims the product to which it is applied should meet these guidelines the guidelines for product of canada and made in canada claims apply to foods sold at all levels of trade including bulk sale or wholesale foods for further processing they also apply to claims made in advertising and by restaurants these guidelines do not apply to products destined for export markets these products must continue to meet the requirements of the importing country this could result in different labels for domestic and exported products other consumer goods such as animal feed agricultural seed or plants that are not food products these products may be assessed under the competition bureaus guide to made in canada claims content claims regarding regional or provincial content such provinces cities towns etc terms or references that have regulated requirements and are not subject to the guidelines eg grade names references to canada organic or mandatory country of origin labelling all ingredients and their components that contribute to the food regardless of their generation when they were added must be considered when assessing product of canada and made in canada claims product of canada claims a food product may use the claim product of canada when all or virtually all major ingredients processing and labour used to make the food product are canadian this means that all the significant ingredients in a food product are canadian in origin and that noncanadian material is negligible the following circumstances would not disqualify a food from making a product of canada claim very low levels of ingredients that are not generally produced in canada including spices food additives vitamins minerals flavouring preparations or grown in canada such as oranges cane sugar and coffee generally the percentage referred to as very little or minor is considered to be less than a total of  per cent of the product packaging materials that are sourced from outside canada as these guidelines apply to the canadian content and production or manufacturing of the food product and not the packaging itself the use of imported agricultural inputs such as seed fertilizers animal feed and medications for example a cookie that is manufactured in canada from oatmeal enriched flour butter honey and milk from canada and imported vanilla may use the claim product of canada even if the vitamins in the flour and the vanilla are not from canada the claim canadian is considered to be the same as a product of canada claim and any product carrying this claim must meet the criteria for a product of canada claim described above generally products that are exported and reimported into canada would not be able to make a product of canada claim the only exception would be if the product meets the product of canada criteria and is ready for sale when it leaves canada fully packaged and labelled and is subsequently returned to canada without undergoing any processing repackaging or relabelling eg perhaps because of an ordering error this is because all content processing and labour still occurred in canada made in canada claims with a qualifying statement a made in canada claim with a qualifying statement can be used on a food product when the last substantial transformation of the product occurred in canada even if some ingredients are from other countries  substantial transformation a substantial transformation occurs when a food product undergoes processing which changes its nature and becomes a new product bearing a new name commonly understood by the consumer for example the processing of cheese dough sauce and other ingredients to create a pizza would be considered a substantial transformation processes which result in a substantial transformation may be outlined in more specific legislation such as the meat inspection regulations and processed products regulations qualifying statement if the made in canada claim is used it must also include a qualifying statement to indicate that the food product is made in canada from imported ingredients or a combination of imported and domestic ingredients the qualifying statements that can be used include made in canada from domestic and imported ingredients or made in canada from imported ingredients all variations of made in canada claims must include a qualifying statement for example a claim such as proudly made in canada would need a qualifying statement if the product contains imported ingredients as this claim includes the phrase made in canada made in canada from imported ingredients when a food is made with ingredients that are all sourced from outside of canada the label would state made in canada from imported ingredients for example a cookie manufactured in canada from imported flour oatmeal shortening and sugar may be labelled or advertised with the claim made in canada from imported ingredients made in canada from domestic and imported ingredients when a food contains both domestic and imported ingredients the label would state made in canada from domestic and imported ingredients this claim may be used on a product that contains a mixture of imported and domestic ingredients regardless of the level of canadian content in the product for example a cookie manufactured in canada using canadian flour oatmeal and shortening and imported sugar may be labelled or advertised with the claim made in canada from domestic and imported ingredients to provide clarity and consistency for consumers when a company chooses to use the made in canada claim the qualifying statement should be presented in a standard format from domestic and imported ingredients however it would be considered acceptable if the order were reversed if there were a higher proportion of imported ingredients than domestic ingredients the claim made in canada from domestic andor imported ingredients is not permitted as it does not provide meaningful information to the consumer about the canadian content other domestic content claims the use of product of canada and the qualified made in canada claims are encouraged to ensure clarity for the consumer and to enhance their ability to identify canadian made foods however other more specific statements or claims that describe the canadian value added may be used without further qualification provided they are truthful and not misleading for consumers examples of these types of domestic claims include roasted and blended in canada to describe coffee since the coffee beans are always imported distilled in canada to describe bottled water that was distilled in canada canned in canada to describe green beans that were canned in canada refined in canada to describe imported cane sugar which has been refined in canada processed in canada to describe a food which has been entirely processed in canada prepared in canada to describe a food which has been entirely prepared in canada packaged in canada to describe a food which is imported in bulk and packaged in canada guidance on other types of commonly used domestic content claims can be found below claims identifying a canadian food or canadian ingredients the claim canadian is considered to be the same as a product of canada claim as such all or virtually all major ingredients processing and labour used to make the food product must be canadian for example the claim canadian on a container of frozen lasagna would mean that the food meets the product of canada criteria this criteria also applies when the claim is used to describe an ingredient within the food for example if the claim canadian cheddar cheese is used on a package of cheddar cheese sauce all or virtually all major ingredients processing and labour used to make the cheddar cheese in the sauce must be canadian when this type of claim is used to describe a single component ingredient within the food all of the ingredients and if any derivatives of that ingredient in the food must be canadian for example if the claim contains canadian blueberries is used on a prepackaged blueberry pie all of the blueberries as well as any blueberry juice concentrate or derivative must be canadian  canadian claims on foods or ingredients when the claim  canadian is used on a label the food or ingredient to which the claim applies must be entirely canadian rather than all or virtually all canadian for example if the claim  canadian was used on a pot pie all of the ingredients processing and labour used to make that product must be canadian this would be the same case for a food with a claim which refers to the origin of a particular ingredient whether single or multicomponent as being  canadian for example if the claim made with  canadian wheat is used on a bag of dry pasta all of the wheat and its derivatives used in that product must be canadian additional guidance on the use of the claim  canadian milk can be found in the guidelines for the acceptable use of  canadian milk claims on dairy products multiple country of origin claims that reference canada the use of a voluntary multiple country of origin statement that references canada eg product of canada and united states would not be acceptable products that contain foreign ingredients regardless of their source are not eligible to bear a product of canada claim declaring multiple countries of origin on the label could result in false information and as such could be considered false and misleading although products that contain foreign ingredients are not eligible to bear a product of canada claim they may be eligible to make a qualified made in canada claim provided that the last substantial transformation of the product occurred in canada a blended claim such as a blend of canadian naming the product and naming the country naming the product may be considered acceptable eg a blend of canadian and american soybean oil separate requirements may exist for commodities that require a country of origin statement these are summarized in the foodspecific labelling requirements of the industry labelling tool commodity specific information meat and poultry product of canada claims can be applied to meat from canadian animals that are slaughtered in canada animals are considered canadian if they are born or hatched raised and slaughtered in canada or in the case of feeder cattle if they have spent a period of at least  days in canada prior to slaughter in canada the day residency period is based on international animal health standards such animals are fed raised and slaughtered in canada according to canadian requirements the the canadian food inspection agency cfia is currently reviewing how these guidelines can be best applied to meat products from live animals imported into canada this review will determine how to apply the product of canada claim to meat products while respecting the principles of the product of canada guidelines and not disrupting international commerce or be contrary to trade rules meat from imported hatching eggs including those hatched in transit would meet the product of canada guidelines provided that the chick was raised slaughtered and processed in canada fish and seafood wild fish and seafood products can be labelled product of canada when caught by vessels in canadian waters or adjacent waters as per canadian regulatory fishing quotas and the products from the fish and seafood are processed in a canadian establishment using canadian ingredients in the case of farmed fish and seafood the farm must be located in canada and the processing must occur in a canadian establishment with the use of canadian ingredients dairy and eggs eggs from imported hens and milk from imported cows would qualify for the product of canada claim provided that the hen laid its eggs in canada and the cow is milked in canada national symbols the use of the canadian coat of arms and the canadian flag are both protected under the trademarks act subsection  see government of canada trademarks for more information coat of arms the canadian coat of arms cannot be used unless permission is granted by the department of canadian heritage requests for

one or two bars cannot be used unless permission for its use is granted by the department of canadian heritage there is however no objection to the use of an point maple leaf without bars the maple leaf should not be used on an imported food product since it may give the consumer the false impression that the product is of domestic origin requests for permission may be made to state ceremonial and canadian symbolsdepartment of canadian heritagegatineau quebec ka mtel  fax  ceremonialetsymbolesceremonialandsymbolspchgcca maple leaf the use of the maple leaf or other similar symbol may be used on food products without further permission the use of these vignettes on their own does not always imply that the product is wholly or partially canadian eg maple leaves as part of a fall scene on a products label however depending on how the maple leaf is used it could imply a product of canada claim and in such situations the product must follow the criteria for a product of canada claim in order to ensure that the use of the maple leaf or other similar symbol will not mislead the consumer it is recommended that an accompanying domestic content statement be placed in close proximity to the vignette terms not subject to the guidelines the following terms or references have regulated requirements and as such are not subject to the guidelines for product of canada claims grade names incorporating the term canada eg canada fancy the guidelines will not affect the regulated canada grade name requirements or the meat inspection legendthe canada organic logo or references to canada

canadian milk chocolate crispy crunch smarties the canadian kind aero wunderbar caramilk—while the names and textures of these candy bars may differ they all contain the same unique “canadian”

to develop a milkier creamier chocolate “that is unique to canadian chocolate” even canadian versions of popular american chocolate bars such as kit kat and reese’s peanut butter cups taste completely

tarts nick harris flickr  cc bynd  these yummy desserts—pastry tart shells filled with maple or corn syrup sugar butter and raisins—are a distinctly canadian treat some articles have traced their

  istock walk down a street after a hard night of drinking in montréal and you’d be hardpressed not seeing someone gorging themselves on poutine a highcalorie classic staple of québécois cassecroûtes—or “greasy spoon”—cuisine just what is poutine you ask the delicious canadian dish is comprised of a holyhoser trinity of ingredients french fries cheese curds and gravy try some yourself and you’ll be hooked it’s become so popular that it’s readily available at certain restaurants in the us lucky new yorkers can get their hands on some traditional poutine at brooklyn restaurant mile end otherwise the dish has become so ubiquitous in its home province that even mcdonald’s and burger king sell it as a side much like the debate in the us about the origins of the hamburger poutine has similarly unclear beginnings the most widespread claim for inventing poutine comes from the small dairyfarming town of warwick québec where in  a customer asked restaurateur fernand lachance to throw cheese curds and french fries—items the owner sold separately at his restaurant l’idéal later renamed le lutin qui rit or “the laughing elf”—together in one bag because the customer was in a rush legend has it when lachance peered into the bag after the two ingredients were mixed together he remarked “this is a ‘poutine’” using the joual—or québécois slang—for a mess” noticeably absent from lachance’s cobbledtogether recipe is the gravy ingredient which was added to the mix in  when a restaurantowner in nearby drummondville quebec named jeanpaul roy noticed a few of his diners ordering a side of cheese curds to add to the patented gravy sauce and fries dish at his restaurant le roy jucep roy soon added the threeingredient item on his menu and the rest is delicious gravysoaked history eventually poutine spread across the province and throughout canada—with different combinations added to the fries curds and gravy recipe—but the original remains the most recognized and honored it even initially made its way to the united states by way of new jersey where an altered recipe known as “disco fries” substitutes shredded cheddar or mozzarella cheese for the canadian curds but if you ever find yourself in montréal and have a hankering for greasy food be sure to order it correctly anglophones usually pronounce the word as “pooteen” but if you want to pass for a real québécois it’s pronounced “pootin”   this story originally ran in  canada day travel facebook twitter istock arrow language  colorful canadian slang terms by nicolas rivero july   istock
